        "file_text": "On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar, who is not able to be with us on this solemn occasion, I have the pleasure of expressing my sincere felicitations and profound satisfaction at the election of Mr. Amerasingjhe as President of the General Assembly during its thirty-first session. My delegation is well aware of his good qualities and statesmanship. Indeed, we consider those qualities the best guarantee for the creation of most effective and positive conditions for our deliberations. This is due to his skill and great ability.\n264.\tI should like also to express my respect and esteem for Ambassador Amerasinghe's predecessor because of the wisdom and tact he demonstrated in guiding the meetings at the last session.\n265.\tI am pleased to express my thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, because we believe he is exerting every effort to bring harmony into the family of nations and to enhance its effectiveness in serving the causes of justice, security and peace, which remain at the center of our interest.\n266.\tMoreover, we welcome and extend our congratulations to the Republic of Seychelles, which has recently joined our international family in order to take part in the noble march towards the establishment of a free human society based on justice and equality. At the same time, we express the hope that the Republic of Seychelles will achieve stability and progress.\n267.\tToday, at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly, with our responsibility towards the peoples of the worlds which are longing for a better future, we are required to strengthen this international Organization, under whose regulations, laws and Charter we seek protection, because it incorporates all the great hopes of humanity that man will be prevented from again resorting to violence instead of relying on honorable, civilized dialog; that all kinds of hegemony, whatever their origin, will be eliminated; that justice will be achieved and peace restored; and that there will be respect for the sovereignty of all States and for their right to invest and develop their national resources without any foreign intervention.\n268.\tHence the United Nations, as a forum of justice and right, is requested to play a decisive and sophisticated role in respect of world problems and to create broader hopes for the solution of international problems. That goal will not be achieved unless there is a common belief in the necessity of imposing constant pressure and blockades on those who impede the march of international peace and development and who, by their violations of the United Nations Charter, whatever the justifications, increase tensions and anxiety in the world.\n269.\tIn that context, the question of Palestine becomes a materialization of the tragedy created as a result of the constant and deliberate efforts by Israel, with its frivolous attitude, to violate the United Nations Charter and the just resolutions of the United Nations. Though the General Assembly has frequently confirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and especially their right to self-determination without any foreign intervention and their right to independence and national sovereignty, as well as the right of Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they were displaced and uprooted, and in spite of the Assembly's recognition that the Palestinian people are a major party in the process of achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, these questions arise, Where does the issue of Palestine-man, land and right-stand, and why? And why does Israel insist on forcing its racial hegemony upon the Palestinian Arab people, whose just struggle the Assembly recognized and whose representation as an observer at the United Nations the Assembly thereupon accepted?\n270.\tThe Middle East question, because of its persistent consequences, will continue to be a threat to world peace and the international community because Israel up to this very moment has still not recognized the international resolutions pertaining to this very crucial question. Therefore, with the aim of protecting peace and ensuring respect for right and justice, and in pursuance of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, we demand that the United Nations put an end to Israeli frivolity and Zionist racism and terrorism by firmly and decisively implementing the United Nations Charter and all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations in this respect, and by forcing Israel to respect the just will of the international community.\n271.\tWe consider that the establishment of real peace and the adequate response inspired by the spirit of the United Nations Charter are basic preludes to all the positive achievements to which the peoples of the world are looking forward as a result of our meetings and efforts.\n272.\tThe State of Qatar renews its commitment to the provisions and principles laid down in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. We in Qatar look forward to the fifth conference of countries located on the Indian Ocean, with a view to declaring that region to be a zone of peace. We definitely believe that the Middle East should be free of nuclear arms. Similarly, we declare Qatar's full support for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in South Asia, Africa and Latin America. My delegation firmly believes that absolute priority should be given to the problems of disarmament because of the serious danger that the use of these arms can lead to the obliteration of mankind and civilization. We are fully aware that the ever-increasing destructive capability of these weapons has reached unbelievably terrifying proportions.\n273.\tTherefore, my country endorses the call for the convening of a world disarmament conference open to all countries, nuclear and non-nuclear, large and small, on an equal footing. We do so in the hope that such a conference will result in positive and effective measures leading to disarmament. We consider it to be our duty and responsibility to human civilization to take this stand, in order to prevent mankind from falling victim to bewilderment, dispersion and instability.\n274.\tWe warn the Assembly of the increasing threat of a military confrontation in the Middle East. At the same time, we underline the necessity of discussing all aspects of the situation resulting from Israel's adamant refusal to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to cease producing, or obtaining nuclear weapons or contemplating using them.\n275.\tWe would therefore ask, Is it sufficient for the United Nations to condemn this deliberate aggressive refusal by Israel alone? And if we add to all that the arbitrary measures taken by Israel to obstruct the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the oppression practised by Israel against the inhabitants of the occupied Arab territories and all of Israel's endeavors to change the demographic characteristics of the West Bank and Jerusalem, it becomes clear that the implementation of political and economic sanctions against Israel is the least the United Nations should do in this respect.\n276.\tWe view with great sympathy and appreciation the efforts exerted by the United Nations to eliminate racist impurities from the world political arena. Also, we declare the support of the State of Qatar for the rights of the struggling African peoples in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania to attain their independence and preserve their national identities so as to be able to choose their way of life. Racial discrimination is a disgrace to civilization and disregards the most sacred humanistic values. We therefore consider that breaking the international blockade, whether moral or material, imposed on racist regimes is as heinous an act as racism itself.\n277.\tOn the other hand, it is our duty and responsibility to stress the contents of the resolution adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly acknowledging the legitimacy of the struggle of the national liberation movements, which complies with the aims of the Charter. The international community should be accountable for any violation of that resolution or negligence of the requirement of putting it into effect.\n278.\tAs we in the State of Qatar declare our solidarity with and support for the national liberation movements in their just struggle, we also condemn any indication of international terrorism. Meanwhile we believe it is unacceptable to deal with it by adopting the law of the jungle. It is also unacceptable to justify an offense by invoking the right to protect humanity, as Israel did when it violated Uganda's sovereignty recently. Thus arises the question of whether we can treat one offense by committing another.\n279.\tMan's freedom, his dignity and his rights are the basic pillars upon which the United Nations Charter, which is accepted by all of us, was based. Henceforth we must express our respect for the Charter by our commitment and determination to deplore and put an end to all practices which degrade human beings, whether by torture or by other inhuman or humiliating means.\n280.\tIf it is our duty to protect the freedom, dignity and rights of man, wherever he may be, we ought also to protect the spiritual and material values of nations out of our respect for their cultural heritage and in pursuance of the promotion of development.\n281.\tAccordingly, we must condemn cultural colonialism whatever its origin for trying with all its power to annihilate and distort a part of the human legacy. Thus it is unacceptable that the United Nations, with all its vigilance and concern, could not prevent Israel from distorting the Arab cultural heritage in the occupied Arab lands.\n282.\tThe State of Qatar, like all other States of the third world, is deeply interested in the efforts being exerted by the United Nations and the great concern it demonstrates in its efforts to increase productive efficiency and development capacity all over the world. That is so because resistance to the specter of famine which haunts millions of poor people will continue to be vital if we want uninterrupted progress without setbacks. In this respect we believe that the role being played by the major Powers and the industrial countries still noticeably falls short of our expectations. Moreover, inflation and the increases in the prices of manufactured products and food-stuffs and problems which afflict the international community and its economic order. These problems can be solved only by the major Powers and the industrial countries. It is worth mentioning that the oil-producing countries are not responsible in any way for the creation of these problems, since they, as developing countries, have been severely affected, largely because of the deterioration of the world economic situation as a whole.\n283.\tWe believe that the international family should warmly and comprehensively welcome the creation of new economic order, one well balanced and based on an objective economic dialogue between the world's different economic blocs, including both developed and developing countries. In this respect the State of Qatar supports the resolutions adopted by the Group of 77.  It also exerts sincere and continuous efforts in the field of co-operation with sister Arab States and in the field of the execution of joint development projects in Africa and Asia and in other parts of the world, in the conviction that objective economic co-operation is capable of fostering the world's development and prosperity.\n284.\tStrengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and enhancing its effectiveness in solving international problems are not impossible tasks if we are seriously committed to a thorough implementation of its Charter. The great aspirations and ambitions of mankind to see the United Nations capable of achieving security, justice, prosperity and dignity for all present us with a responsibility to be worthy of those aspirations and ambitions that have been the dream of ail the nations of earth since the dawn of history.\n285.\tIn conclusion I wish to express my Government's hope that the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly will be crowned with successful results compatible with the aspirations of the peoples of the world at large. We are confident that the United Nations will exert itself to the utmost in using all available facilities in accordance with the Charter, and with the support of its Member States, to uphold the new international spirit, to achieve equality and to build a new era of international solidarity, with the dedication of all co-operating for the good and unity of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate this body for electing Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka to preside over this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. He is a diplomat of great, international stature who, among his many distinctions, has provided indispensable leadership to the crucial negotiations on the law of the sea.\n144.\tI would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for his tireless efforts on behalf of the world community. He successfully embodies the Charter's prin\u00acciples of fairness, impartiality and dedication to the causes of global peace and human dignity.\n145.\tThe United Nations was born of the conviction that peace is both indivisible and more than mere stability, that for peace to be lasting it must fulfill mankind's aspirations for justice, freedom, economic well-being, the rule of law and the promotion of human rights. But the history of this Organization has been, in considerable measure, the gradual awareness that humanity would not inevitably share a single approach to these goals.\n146.\tThe United Nations has survived-and helped to manage-30 years of vast change in the international system. It has come through the bitterness of the cold war. It has played a vital role in the dismantling of colonial empires. It has helped to moderate conflicts, and is even now manning truce lines in critical parts of the world. It has carried out unprecedented efforts in such areas as public health, development assistance and technical co-operation.\n147.\tBut the most important challenge for this Organization still lies ahead: to vindicate mankind's positive and nobler goals and help nations to achieve a new understanding of community.\n148.\tWith modern communications, human endeavor has become a single experience for peoples in every part of the globe. We share the wonders of science and technology, the trials of industrialization and social change, and a constant awareness of the fate and the dreams of our fellow men.\n149.\tThe world has shrunk, but the nations of the world have not come closer together. Paradoxically, nationalism has been on the rise at the precise time when the most serious issues we all face can only be resolved through a recognition of our interdependence.\n150.\tFragmentation has affected even this body. Nations have taken decisions on a bloc or regional basis, or by rigid ideologies, before even listening to the debate in these halls; on many issues positions have been predetermined by prior conferences containing more than half the membership of the United Nations. The tendency is widespread to come here for battle, rather than negotiation. If these trends continue, the hope for world community will dissipate and the moral influence of this Organization will progressively diminish.\n151.\tThis would be a tragedy. Members of this Organization are today engaged in a multiplicity of endeavors to find just solutions for complex and explosive problems. There is a fragile tranquility, but beneath the surface it is challenged by fundamental forces of change -technological, economic and social. More than ever, this is a time for statecraft and restraint, for persistence but also for daring in the pursuit of peace and justice. The doctrines of perpetual strife produce only bloodshed and bitterness; they unleash the forces of destruction and repression and plant the seeds of future conflict. Appeals to hatred-  whether on the basis of race or class or color or nationality or ideology-will in the end rebound against those who launch them and will not advance the cause of freedom and justice in the world. \n152.\tLet us never forget that the United Nations benefits the smaller and Weaker nations most of all; for without the rule of law, disputes will be settled as they hive been all too frequently and painfully in history: by tests of strength. It is not the weak that will prevail in s world of chaos.\n153.\tThe United States believes that this thirty-First session of the General Assembly must free itself of the ideological and confrontational tactics that marked some of its predecessors and dedicate itself to a program of common action.\n154.\tThe United States comes to the General Assembly prepared to work co-operatively on programs of common action. We will offer concrete proposals. We will listen carefully to the ideas of others. We will resist pressure and we shall seek co-operation.\n155.\tLet me, in this spirit, discuss the three principal challenges we face: the problem of peace, the challenge of economic well-being, and the agenda of global interdependence.\n156.\tThe age of the United Nations has also been an age of frequent conflict. We have been spared a third world war, but we cannot assume that this condition will prevail forever or without exertion. Our generation must build out of the multitude of nations a structure of relations that frees the energies of nations and peoples for the positive endeavors of mankind, without die fear or the threat of war.\n157.\tCentral to American foreign policy are our sister democracies, the industrial nations of North America, Western Europe, the southern Pacific and Japan, and our traditional friends in the Western Hemisphere. We are bound to these nations by ties of history, civilization, culture, shared principles and generations of common endeavors.\n158.\tOur alliances, founded on the bed-rock of mutual security, now reach beyond the common defense to a new range of issues: the social challenges shared by the advanced technological societies; common approaches to easing tensions with our adversaries; and shaping positive relations with the developing world. The common efforts of the industrial democracies are not directed at exclusive ends, but as a bridge to a broader, more secure and co-operative international system and to increasing freedom and prosperity for all nations.\n159.\tThe United States is proud of its historical friendships in the Western Hemisphere. In the modern era these friendships must be, and they are, based on equality and mutual benefit. We have a unique advantage in this Hemisphere: the great dialog between the developed and the developing nations can find its most creative solution in the Hemisphere where modern democracy was born, and where co-operation between developed and developing, large and small, is a long-standing tradition.\n160.\tThroughout history, ideology and power have tempted nations to seek unilateral advantage. But the inescapable lesson of the nuclear age is that the politics of tests of strength has become incompatible with the survival of humanity. Traditional power politics becomes irrational when war can destroy civilized life and when neither side can gain a decisive strategic advantage.\n161.\tAccordingly, the great nuclear Powers have particular responsibilities for restraint and vision. They are in a position to know the full extent of the catastrophe which could overwhelm mankind. They must take care not to fuel disputes if they conduct their rivalries by traditional methods; if they turn local conflicts into aspects of a global competition, sooner or later their conflicts will grow out of control.\n162.\tThe United States believes that the future of mankind requires coexistence with the Soviet Union. Tired slogans cannot obscure the necessity for a more constructive relationship. We will insist that restraint be reciprocal, not just in bilateral relations, but around the globe. There can be no selective detente. We will maintain our defenses and our vigilance. But we know also that tough rhetoric is not strength and that we owe future generations more hopeful prospects than a delicate equilibrium of awesome forces.\n163.\tPeace requires a balance of strategic power. This the United States will maintain. But the United States is convinced that the goal of strategic balance is achievable more safely by agreement than through an arms race. The negotiations on the limitation of armaments are therefore at the heart of United States-Soviet relations.\n164.\tUnprecedented agreements limiting and controlling nuclear weapons have been reached. An historic effort has been made to place a ceiling on the strategic arsenals of both sides in accordance with the Vladivostok communique of 24 November 1974. And once this is achieved we are ready to seek immediately to lower the levels of strategic arms.\n165.\tThe United States welcomes the recent progress that has been made in further curtailing nuclear-weapons testing and in establishing a regime for peaceful nuclear explosions for the first time. The two treaties now signed and awaiting ratification should be the basis for further progress in this field.\n166.\tTogether with several of our European allies, we are continuing efforts to achieve a balanced reduction in the military forces facing each other in central Europe. In some respects this is the most complex negotiation on arms limitation yet undertaken. It is our hope that, through patient effort, reciprocal reductions will soon be achieved that enhance the security of all countries concerned.\n167.\tBut coexistence and negotiations on the control of arms do not take place in a vacuum. We have been disturbed by the continuing accumulation of Soviet armaments and by recent instances of military intervention to tip the scales in local conflicts in distant continents. We have noted crude attempts to distort the purposes of peaceful diplomacy and to impede hopeful progress towards peaceful solutions to complex issues. These efforts only foster tensions; they cannot be reconciled with the policy of improving relations, and they will inevitably be\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nuneasy armistice, both sides must recognize that ideology and power politics today confront the realities of the nuclear age and that a striving for unilateral advantages will not be accepted.\n168.\tIn recent years, the new relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China has held great significance for global security.\n169.\tWe came together out of necessity and a mutual belief that the world should remain free of military blackmail and the will to hegemony. We have set out a new path -in wide-ranging consultations, bilateral exchanges, the opening of offices in our respective capitals and an accelerating movement towards normalization. And we have derived reciprocal benefits- a clearer understanding of the aspirations of our peoples, better prospects for international equilibrium, reduced tensions in Asia and increased opportunities for parallel actions on global issues.\n170.\tThese elements form the basis for a growing and lasting relationship founded on objective common interest. The United States is committed to strengthen the bonds between us and to proceed towards the normalization of our relations in strict conformity with the principles of the Shanghai communique of 27 February 1972. As this process moves forward, each side must display restraint and respect for the interests and convictions of the other. We will keep Chinese interests in mind on all international issues and will do our utmost to take account of them. But if the relationship is to prosper, there must be similar sensitivity to our views and concerns.\n171.\tOn this basis, the progressive development of our relations with the world's most populous nation will be a key element of the foreign policy of the United States.\n172.\tThe world today is witness to continuing regional crises. Any one of them could blossom into larger conflict. Each one commands our most diligent efforts of conciliation and co-operation. The United States has played, and is prepared to continue to play, an active role in the search for peace in many areas -southern Africa, the Middle East, Korea and Cyprus. Let me deal with each of these.\n173.\tRacial injustice and the grudging retreat of colonial power have conspired to make southern Africa an acid test of the world's hope for peace and justice under the Charter. A host of voices have been heard in this chamber warning that, if we failed quickly to find solutions to the crises of Namibia and Rhodesia, that part cf the globe could become a battleground with consequences for every part of the world.\n174.\tI have just been to Africa, at President Ford's request, to see what the United States could do to help the peoples of that continent achieve their aspirations to freedom and justice.\n175.\tAn opportunity to pull back from the brink now exists. I believe that Africa has before it the prize for which it has struggled so long-the opportunity for Africans to shape a future of peace, justice, racial harmony and progress.\n176.\tThe United Nations since its beginning has been concerned with the issue of Namibia. For 30 years that Territory has been a test of this institution's ability to make its decisions effective.\n177.\tIn recent months, the United States has vigorously sought to help the parties concerned speed up the process towards Namibian independence. The United States favors the following elements: the independence of Namibia within a fixed, short time-limit; the calling of a constitutional conference at a neutral location under the aegis of the United Nations; and the participation in that conference of all authentic national forces, including specifically the South West Africa People's Organization Progress has been made in achieving all those goals. We will exert our efforts to remove the remaining obstacles and bring into being a conference which can then fashion, with goodwill and wisdom, a design for the new State of Namibia and its relationship with its neighbors. We pledge our continued solicitude for the independence of Namibia so that it may, in the end, be a proud achievement of this Organization and a symbol of international co-operation.\n178.\tLess than a week ago the Rhodesian authorities announced that they were prepared to meet with the nationalist leaders of Zimbabwe to form an interim Government to bring about majority rule within two years. That is in itself an historic break from the past. The African Presidents, in calling for immediate negotiations, have shown that, they are prepared to seize this opportunity. And the Government of the United Kingdom, in expressing its willingness to assemble a conference, has shown its high sense of responsibility and concern for the rapid and just independence of Rhodesia.\n179.\tInevitably, after a decade of strife, suspicions run deep; many obstacles remain. Magnanimity is never easy, and less so after a generation of bitterness and racial conflict. But let us not lose sight of what has been achieved: a commitment to majority rule within two years; a commitment to form immediately a transitional Government with an African majority in the cabinet and an African prime minister; and a readiness to follow that with a constitutional conference to define the legal framework of an independent Zimbabwe.\n180.\tThe United States, together with other countries, has made major efforts; and we will continue to do what we can to support the hopeful process that is now possible. But it is those in Africa who must shape the future. The people of Rhodesia and the neighboring States now face a supreme challenge. Their ability to work together and their capacity to unify will be tested in the months ahead as never before.\n181.\tThere may be some countries which see a chance for advantage in fueling the flames of war and racial hatred; but they are not motivated by concern for the peoples of Africa, or for peace. And if they succeed they could doom opportunities that might never return.\n182.\tIn South Africa itself, the pace of change accelerates. The system of apartheid-by whatever name-is a denial of our common humanity and a challenge to the conscience of\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nhave shown wisdom in facilitating a peaceful solution in Rhodesia. The world community takes note of it and urges similar wisdom-while there is still time-to bring racial justice to South Africa.\n183.\tAs for the United States, we have become convinced that our values and our interests are best served by an Africa seeking its own destiny, free of outside intervention. Therefore we will back no faction, whether in Rhodesia or elsewhere; we will not seek to impose solutions anywhere. The leadership and the future of an independent Zimbabwe, as for the rest of Africa, are for Africans to decide. The United States will abide by their decision. We call on all other non-African States to do likewise.\n184.\tThe United States wants no special position or sphere of influence in Africa. We respect African unity. The rivalry and interference of non-African Powers would make a mockery of Africa's hard-won struggle for independence from foreign domination. It will inevitably be resisted.\n185.\tEvery nation which has signed the Charter is pledged to allow the nations of Africa, whose peoples have suffered so much, to fulfill at long last their dreams of independence, peace, unity and human dignity in their own way and by their own decisions.\n186.\tThe United Nations, since its birth, has been involved in the chronic conflict in the Middle East. Each successive war has brought greater perils, an increased danger of great-Power confrontation and more severe economic dislocations.\n187.\tAt the request of the parties, the United States has been actively engaged in the search for peace in the Middle East. Since the 1973 war, statesmanship on all sides has produced unprecedented steps towards a resolution of that conflict. There have been three agreements that lessen the danger of war; and mutual commitments have been made to pursue the negotiating process with urgency until a final peace is achieved. As a result, we are closer to the goal of peace than at any time in a generation.\n188.\tThe role of the United Nations has been crucial. The Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East met in 1973 under its aegis, and the implementation of subsequent agreements has been negotiated in its working groups. Security Council resolutions form the only agreed framework for negotiations. I want to compliment the Secretary- General and his colleagues in New York, Geneva and on the ground in the Middle East for their vigorous support of the peace process at critical moments.\n189.\tThe United States remains committed to help the parties reach a settlement. The step-by-step negotiations of the past three years have now brought us to a point where comprehensive solutions seem possible. The decision before us now is how the next phase of negotiations should be launched.\n190.\tThe United States is prepared to participate in an early resumption of the work of the Geneva Conference. We think a a preparatory conference must be useful for a discussion of the structure and agenda of future negotiations; but we are open to other suggestions.\n191.\tThe groundwork that has been laid represents an historic opportunity. The United States will do all it can to assure that by the time this Assembly meets next year it will be possible to report significant progress towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n192.\tSince the General Assembly last met, overwhelming tragedy has befallen the people of Lebanon. The United States strongly supports the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of that troubled country. We oppose partition. We hope that Lebanese affairs will soon be returned to the hands of the people of Lebanon. All Members of the United Nations, and all the conflicting parties in Lebanon, have an obligation to support the efforts of the new President of Lebanon to restore peace and to turn energies to rebuilding the nation. And the agencies of the United Nations system can play an important role in the reconstruction effort.\n193.\tThe confrontation between North and South Korea remains a threat to international peace and stability. The vital interests of world Powers intersect in Korea: conflict there inevitably threatens wider war.\n194.\tWe and many other United Nations Members welcome the fact that a contentious and sterile debate on Korea will be avoided this fall. Let this opportunity be used, then, to address the central problem of how the Korean people can determine their future and achieve their ultimate goal of peaceful reunification without a renewal of armed conflict.\n195.\tOur own views on the problem of Korea are well known. We have called for a resumption of a serious dialog between North and South Korea. We are prepared to have the United Nations Command dissoJved so long as the Armistice Agreement is either preserved or replaced by more durable arrangements. We are willing to improve relations with North Korea, provided that its allies are ready to take similar steps towards the Republic of Korea. We are ready to talk with North Korea about the peninsula's future, but we will not do so without the participation of the Republic of Korea.\n196.\tLast fall the United States proposed a conference including all the parties most directly concerned- North and South Korea, the United States, and the People's Republic of China to discuss ways of adapting the Armistice Agreement to new conditions and replacing it with more permanent arrangements.  On 22 July, I stated our readiness to meet immediately with those parties. I reaffirm that readiness here today.\n197.\tIf such a conference proves impracticable right now, the United States would support a phased approach. Preliminary talks between North and South Korea, including discussions on the venue and scope of the conference, could start immediately. In that phase the United States and the People's Republic of China could participate as observers or in an advisory role, if the parties so desired. If such discussions yielded concrete results, the United States and China could join the talks formally. This, in turn, could set the stage for a wider conference in which other countries could associate themselves with arrangements that guarantee a durable peace on the peninsula.\n198.\tWe hope that North Korea and other concerned parties will respond affirmatively to this proposed procedure or else offer an alternative suggestion.\n199.\tThe world community is deeply concerned over the continuing stalemate on the Cyprus problem.\n200.\tDomestic pressures, nationalistic objectives, and international rivalries have combined to block the parties from taking even the most elementary steps towards a solution. On those few occasions when representatives of the two Cypriot communities have come together, they have fallen into inconclusive procedural disputes. The passage of time has served only to complicate domestic difficulties and to diminish the possibilities of constructive conciliation.\n201.\tAll concerned need to focus on committing themselves to achieving the overriding objectives: assuring the well-being of the suffering Cypriot people and ensuring peace in the eastern Mediterranean.\n202.\tA settlement must come from the Cypriot communities themselves. It is they who must decide how their island's economy, society and government shall be reconstructed. It is they who must decide the ultimate relationship of the two communities.\n203.\tThe United States is ready to assist in restoring momentum to the negotiating process. We believe that agreeing to a set of principles might help the parties to resume negotiations. We would suggest some concepts along the following lines. A settlement should preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The present dividing lines on Cyprus must be adjusted to reduce the area currently controlled by the Turkish side. The territorial arrangement should take into account the economic requirements and humanitarian concerns of the two Cypriot communities, including the plight of those who remain refugees. A constitutional arrangement should provide conditions under which the two Cypriot communities can live in freedom and have a large voice in their own affairs. Security arrangements should be agreed upon that would permit the withdrawal of foreign military forces other than those present under international agreement.\n204.\tI have discussed this approach with the Secretary- General and with several Western European colleagues. In the days ahead, the United States will consult along these lines with all interested parties. In the meantime, we urge the Secretary-General to continue his dedicated efforts.\n205.\tI shall now turn to the problems of economic development. The economic division of our planet between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, between the industrial and developing nations is a dominant issue of our time. Our mutual dependence for our prosperity is a reality, not a slogan. It should summon our best efforts to make common progress, to bring mankind's dreams of a better life to closer reality in our lifetime.\n206.\tThere are many reasons why co-operation has not made greater strides. The industrial democracies have sometimes been more willing to pay lip service to the challenge of development than to match rhetoric with real resources. The countries with non-market economies are quite prepared to undertake verbal assaults, but their performance is in inverse ratio to their rhetoric. Their real contribution to development assistance has been minimal. Last year, for example, the non-market economies provided only about 4 per cent of the public aid flowing to the developing nations. The developing nations are understandably frustrated and impatient with poverty, illiteracy and disease. But often they have made demands for change that are as confrontational as they are unrealistic. They sometimes speak of new economic orders as if growth were a quick fix requiring only that the world's wealth be properly redistributed through tests of strength instead of a process of self-help extending over decades. Ultimately, such tactics lose more than they gain, for they undermine the popular support in the industrial democracies which is imperative to provide the resources and market access -available nowhere else- to sustain development.\n207.\tI believe that the objectives of the developing nations and the objectives of the industrial nations are complementary. Indeed they must be, for neither side can achieve its aims at the expense of the other. They can be realized only through co-operation.\n208.\tWe took a major step forward together a year ago at the seventh special session of this Assembly, and we have since followed through on many fronts. We have taken steps to protect the economic security of developing nations against cyclical financial disaster. The newly expanded compensatory finance facility of the International Monetary Fund has disbursed over $2 billion to developing nations in this year alone. Replenishments of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank will provide additional resources for development. World-wide food aid has been expanded. With a United States contribution of $200 million, we have brought the International Fund for Agricultural Development close to operation.\n209.\tThe United States has continued this process by putting forward a number of new proposals at the fourth session of UNCTAD in May 1976. We committed ourselves to improvements in the quality of aid. We agreed to a serious effort to improve markets of 18 basic commodities. These measures, undertaken since we met here just a year ago, assist, not with rhetoric and promises, but in practical and concrete ways, the peoples of the world that are struggling to throw off the chains of poverty.\n210.\tMuch remains to be done. First, the application of science and technology is at the very heart of the development process. The United States, conscious of its pioneering role in technology, has put forward three basic principles, which we shall support with funds aid talent: to train individuals who can identify, select and manage the future technology of the developing world; to build both national and international institutions to create indigenous technology; and to spur the private sector to make its maximum contribution to the development and transfer of technological progress. \n211.\tTo achieve these goals, we are today extending an invitation to the world conference on science and technology for development, now scheduled for 1979, to meet in this country. In preparation for that meeting, we have asked members of the industrial, academic and professional scientific communities throughout the United States to meet in Washington in November. They will review the important initiatives this country can take to expand the technological base for development and they will strive to develop new approaches.\n212.\tSecondly, the ministerial meeting of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris should be given new impetus. We are making several new proposals. We will seek to help nations facing severe debt burdens. We will advance new ideas for expanded co-operation in energy.\n213.\tThirdly, the industrial democracies have been far too willing to wait for the demands of the developing countries rather than to advance their own proposals. Now, however, the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have, at the suggestion of the United States, agreed to examine long-range development planning and to develop a more coherent and comprehensive approach to global growth and economic justice.\n214.\tFourthly, natural disasters each year take thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars. It strikes most those who can afford it least-the poorest peoples of the world. The United Nations has a unique capacity to address these global concerns and thus improve man's odds against nature. We urge this body to take the lead in strengthening international co-operation to prevent and alleviate natural calamity.\n215.\tOur dream is that all the children of the world can live with hope and widening opportunity. No nation can accomplish this alone; no group of nations can achieve it through confrontation. But together there is a chance for major progress-and in our generation.\n216.\tIt is an irony of our time that an age of ideological and nationalistic rivalry has spawned as well a host of challenges that no nation can possibly solve by itself: the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology; the problems posed by the law of the sea; and the horrible new tool of tenor that cJiims innocent victims on every continent.\n217.\tThe growing danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons raises stark questions about man's ability to ensure his very existence. We have lived through three perilous decades hi which the catastrophe of nuclear war has been avoided, despite ? strategic rivalry between a relatively few nations.\n218.\tBut now a wholly new situation impends. Many nations have the potential to build nuclear weapons. If this potential were to materialize, threats to use nuclear weapons, fed by mutually reinforcing misconceptions, could become a recurrent feature of local conflicts in every' quarter of the globe. And there will be growing dangers of accidents, blackmail and nuclear terrorism.\n219.\tUnless current trends are altered rapidly, the likelihood of nuclear devastation could grow steadily in the years ahead. We must look to the roots of the problem. Since the 1973 energy crisis and drastic rise in oil prices, both developed and developing nations have seen in nuclear energy a means both of lowering the cost of electricity and of reducing reliance upon imported petroleum. In an age of growing nationalism some see the acquisition and expansion of nuclear power as symbols of enhanced national prestige, and, let us be frank, as a means to provide themselves a future option to acquire nuclear weapons.\n220.\tA nation that acquires the potential for a nuclear weapons capability must accept the consequences of its action. It is bound to trigger offsetting actions by its neighbors and stimulate broader proliferation, thereby accelerating a process that ultimately will undermine its own security. And it is disingenuous to label as \\\"peaceful\\\" nuclear devices which obviously are capable of massive military destruction.\n221.\tTime is of the essence. In no area of international concern does the future of this planet depend more directly upon what this generation can do or fails to do. We must move on the following three broad fronts.\n222.\tFirst, international safeguards must be strengthened and strictly enforced. The supply and use of nuclear materials associated with civilian nuclear energy programs must be carefully safeguarded so that they will not be diverted. The physical security of nuclear materials must be increased. The International Atomic Energy Agency must receive the full support of all nations in making its safeguards effective. Any violator of these safeguards must face immediate and drastic penalties.\n223.\tSecondly, adherence to safeguards, while of prime importance, is no guarantee against future proliferation. We must continue our efforts to forge international restraints against the acquisition or transfer of reprocessing facilities and of enrichment facilities which produce highly enriched uranium.\n224.\tThirdly, we must recognize that one of the principal incentives for seeking sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technology is the fear that essential non-sensitive materials will not be made available on a reliable basis. Nations that show their sense of international responsibility by accepting effective restraints have a right to expect a reliable. economical supply of peaceful nuclear reactors and associated non-sensitive fuel. The United States, as a principal supplier of these items, is prepared to be responsive in this regard.\n225.\tIn the near future President Ford will announce a comprehensive American program for international action on non-proliferation that reconciles global aspirations for assured nuclear supply with global requirements for nuclear control. In that way we hope that the 9.tom can be seen once again as a boon, and not as a menace, to mankind.\n226.\tAnother issue of vast global consequence is the law of the sea. The negotiations which have just recessed in New York represent one of the most important, complex\nand ambitious diplomatic undertakings in history.\n\n227.\tWe have traveled an extraordinary distance in these negotiations in recent years, thanks in no small part to the skill and dedication of the distinguished President of this Assembly. Agreement exists on key concepts: a 12-mile territorial sea; free passage over and through straits; a 200-mile economic zone; and important pollution controls. In many fields we have replaced ideological debates with serious efforts to find concrete solutions. And there is growing consensus that the outstanding problems must be solved at the next session.\n228.\tBut there is hardly room for complacency. Important issues remain which, if not settled, could cause us to forfeit all our hard-won progress. The Conference has yet to agree on the balance between coastal-State and international rights in the economic zone; on the freedom of marine scientific research; on arrangements for dispute settlement; and, most crucially, on the regime for exploitation of the deep sea-beds.\n229.\tThe United States has made major proposals to resolve the deep sea-bed issue. We have agreed that the sea-beds are the common heritage of all mankind We have proposed a dual system for the exploitation of sea-bed minerals by which half of the mining sites would be reserved for the International Authority and half could be developed by individual nations and their nationals on the basis of technical capacity. We have offered to find financing and to transfer the technology needed to make international mining a practical reality. And in light of the many uncertainties that lie ahead, we have proposed that there be a review-for example after 25 years-to determine whether the provisions on sea-bed mining are working equitably.\n230.\tIn response, some nations have escalated their demands and the stridency with which they advocate them.\n231.\tI must say candidly that there are limits beyond which no American administration can, or will, go. If attempts are made to compel concessions which exceed those limits, unilateralism will become inevitable. Countries which have no technological capacity for mining the sea-beds in the foreseeable future should not seek to impose a doctrine of total internationalization on nations which alone have this capacity and which have voluntarily offered to share it. The United States has an interest in the progressive development of international law, stable order and global co-operation. We are prepared to make significant sacrifices for this- but these sacrifices cannot go beyond equitable bounds.\n23*2. Let us therefore put aside delaying tactics and pressures and take the path of co-operation. If we have the vision to conclude a treaty considered fair and just by mankind, our labors will have profound meaning not only for the regimen of the oceans but for all efforts to build a peaceful, co-operative and prosperous international community. The United States will spend the interval between sessions of the Conference reviewing its positions and will approach other nations well in advance of the next session at the political level to establish the best possible conditions for success.\n233.\tA generation that dreams of world peace and economic progress is plagued by a new, brutal and indiscriminate form of violence: international terrorism. In the year since I last addressed this body there have been 11 hijackings, 19 kidnappings, 42 armed attacks and 112 bombings perpetrated by international terrorists. Over 70 people have lost their lives and over 200 have been injured.\n234.\tIt is time this Organization said to the world that the vicious murder and abuse of innocents cannot be excused by the invocation of lofty motives. Criminal acts against humanity, whatever the professed objective, cannot be excused by any civilized nation.\n235.\tHie threat of terrorism should be dealt with through the co-operative efforts of all countries. More stringent steps must be taken now to deny skyjackers and terrorists a safe haven. Additional measures are required to protect passengers in both transit and terminal areas, as well as in flight.\n236.\tThe United States will support new initiatives which will ensure the safety of the innocent. The proposal of the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany against the taking of hostages [7th meeting, para.,113] deserves the most serious and sympathetic consideration of this Assembly.\n237.\tThe United States will do everything within its power to work co-operatively in the United Nations and in other international bodies to put an end to terrorism. But we have an obligation to protect the lives of our citizens as they travel at home or abroad, and we intend to meet that obligation. If multilateral efforts are blocked, then the United States will be forced to act through its own legislative processes and in conjunction with others willing to join us.\n238.\tTerrorism is an international problem. It is inconceivable that an organization of the world's nations would fail to take effective action against it.\n239.\tThe final measure of all we do together, of course, is man himself. Our common efforts to define, preserve and enhance respect for the rights of man thus represent an ultimate test of international co-operation.\n240.\tWe Americans, in the year of our bicentennial, are conscious -and proud of our own traditions. Our founders wrote 200 years ago of the equality and inalienable rights of all men. Since then the ideals of liberty and democracy have become the universal and indestructible goals of mankind. But the plain truth -of tragic proportions-is that human rights are in jeopardy over most of the globe. Arbitrary arrest, denial of fundamental procedural rights, slave labor, the stifling of freedom of religion, racial injustice, political repression, the use of torture, and restraints on communications and expression these abuses are far too prevalent.\n241.\tThe performance of the United Nations system in protecting human rights has fallen far short of what was envisaged when the Organization was founded. The principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are clear debates of this body and in other forums have been marred by hypocrisy, double standards and discrimination. Flagrant and consistent deprivation of human rights is no less grave in one country or one social system than in another. Nor is it more acceptable when practiced upon members of the same race than when inflicted by one race upon another.\n242.\tThe international community has a unique role to play. The application of the standards of the Universal Declaration should be entrusted to fair and capable international bodies. But at the same time let us ensure that those bodies do not become platforms from which nations which are the worst transgressors pass judgment on the alleged shortcomings of others.\n243.\tLet us together pursue practical approaches: to build on the foundations already laid at previous sessions of the General Assembly and in the Commission on Human Rights to lessen the abominable practice of officially sanctioned torture; to promote acceptance of procedures for protecting the rights of people subject to detention, such as access to courts, counsel and families,-and their prompt release or fair and public trial; to improve the working procedures of international bodies concerned with human rights, so that they may function fairly and effectively; to strengthen the capability of the United Nations to meet the tragic problems of the ever growing number of refugees whose human rights have been stripped away by conflict in almost every continent. The United States pledges its firm support to these efforts.\n\n244.\tThe challenge to statesmanship in this generation is to advance from the management of crises to the building of a stable and just international order, an order resting not on power but on restraint of power, not on the strength of arms but on the strength of the human spirit.\n245.\tGlobal forces of change now shape our future. Order will come in one of two ways: through its imposition by the strong and the ruthless or by the wise and far-sighted use of international institutions through which we enlarge the sphere of Common interests and enhance the sense of community.\n246.\tIt is easy and tempting to press relentlessly for national advantage. It is infinitely more difficult to act in recognition of the rights of others.\n247.\tThroughout history the greatness of men and nations has been measured by their actions in times of acute peril. Today there is no single crisis to conquer. There is, Instead, a persisting challenge of staggering complexity: the need to create a universal community based on co-operation, peace and justice.\n248.\tIf we falter, future generations will pay for our failure. If we succeed we shall have been worthy of the hopes of mankind.\n249.\tI am confident that we can succeed.\n250.\tAnd it is here, in the Assembly of nations, that we should begin.\n"

        "file_text": "It is in this forum that nations and their representatives express their ideas and their aspirations in a continuing human effort to ensure progress and peace. Despite the diversity and dynamics of conflicts, despite differences in interests and ideologies, the United Nations has proved its ability to find and implement solutions. This is because man has learned that the determination to live together in peace is not only desirable but essential.\n3.\tHowever, Guatemala is not before this Assembly today to preach any cause. Guatemala comes simply to express to every nation represented here its appreciation and gratitude for the aid provided by the peoples and the Governments of your nations when the tragedy of 4 February this year destroyed one third of our territory.\n4.\tGuatemala is not the only country in the world that has suffered earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters. But it is the smallest of the countries that have experienced destruction of such magnitude.\n5.\tIt is true that one no longer sees the tears or hears the moans of the more than 15,000 disabled. The graves of the 24,750 dead are still and dark. The orphans will be growing up without the warmth of a family, but they will have the solidarity of their countrymen. The more than 94,000 injured are recovering.\n6. But, of our total population of 6 million, 1,200,000 lost their homes, and the homes of another 400,000 will have to be restored or reconstructed.\n7.\tWith the destruction of one third of our territory, the infrastructure that we had before the earthquake was completely wiped out. Centers of agricultural production have lost plantings and crops; moreover, the ecology has changed, and this change will affect our agriculture.\n8.\tBy consulting the map and United Nations statistics, you will be able to appreciate the devastating effects of the disaster we have suffered. If, as the result of an earthquake, a country loses its vital resources, human and otherwise, and if that country is also small and poor, such a disaster must mark the beginning of a new era. It means that the country must start anew.\n9.\tThat is why the emergency aid that your countries furnished us at a time of crisis not only saved lives but demonstrated that human solidarity continues to be one of the qualities ensuring the survival of mankind.\n10.\tWe Guatemalans shall not forget that your nations shared our grief and made our needs a common cause. We are aware that in many of your countries sacrifices had to be made in order to help us. We know that thousands of your countrymen did not eat in order to send food to our victims. And we are also aware that children of your nations who do not even know where on this planet our country is located none the less cried for our children and sent them clothing, toys, and candy.\n11.\tNone of this can ever be forgotten. Neither can we forget the medical assistance missions, the specialists in many fields, and the volunteers of all races, religions and political ideologies who came to Guatemala to offer help, expecting no compensation.\n12.\tAt this very moment, the sight of these dedicated men and women passes before my eyes-people engaged in a dramatic, noble and heroic task, in the midst of the rubble and the weeping victims. I see them today as I saw them then. They spoke in languages that we did not understand, but we witnessed their help and sensed their sympathy and resignation in the face of death.\n13.\tIn the midst of the cataclysm, volunteers of your nations helped to mitigate the effects of the disaster. Penetrating unknown territory, they entered the caves where rural folk lay dying and scaled the mountains where survivors begged to be saved.\n14.\tSo how can Guatemala fail to be grateful to your countries? How can we repay you? We cannot.\n15. It is for that reason that I have been commissioned by my people to appear before this Assembly to express our appreciation and gratitude. Please accept them, since this is the only way that we can compensate your countries for their solidarity and generosity. \n16.\tIn the meantime,' we are repaying and shall continue to repay you for your assistance through the work that Guatemala is now doing and will continue to do in years to come to rebuild our country.\n17.\tI can assure you that a great national crusade in under way in Guatemala, aimed at its reconstruction. And, in accordance with the request of my husband, President Laugerud, a request to which the people agreed, we have dried our tears and started to work.\n18.\tIn the national crusade for reconstruction, the Guatemalan woman is not a spectator but a necessary participant. I can attest to the amazing fortitude of the Guatemalan woman during the most difficult stage of the catastrophe and to her devoted dedication in the present effort to create and build.\n19.\tThough carrying a newborn infant on her back and perhaps having seen her husband buried in a common grave, that woman grasped a tool to clear the rubble from the streets of her village and from the access routes. Her sorrow burned within her, but she did not weep. Under the blazing sun or the drenching rain she worked tirelessly, through long, dark hours.\n20.\tIn the tormented faces of those women one could observe the serenity of our race in the face of adversity; one could sense the stoicism of people who remained erect in the face of death and devastation in their homes, death and devastation in their towns, death and devastation among their neighbors.\n21.\tThe Guatemalan woman is not redecorating her home; she is rebuilding it with her own hands. Side by side with the men, she is rebuilding houses, working in the wheat and corn fields. She is helping the needy. She is a mother and a refuge to the orphaned and the old who have lost everything, even an awareness of their age.\n22.\tMay I say that as a woman I am proud of the stature and greatness of the Guatemalan woman.\n23.\tNevertheless, we Guatemalans and our President believe that in this reconstruction we must not again build things as they were. Through the reconstruction we are working to create new living conditions and a better standard of living for all our people. Guatemala believes that reconstruction means improvement. In reconstructing we are also establishing the instruments for promoting social development and for giving impetus to human progress.\n24.\tWe do not want any country to live through the terrifying experience Guatemala has lived through. We do not want any country to face a catastrophe such as we have faced.\n25.\tI sincerely pray that the Almighty will spare the nations here represented from the cataclysmic destruction we have suffered.\n26.\tIn closing I ask you to accept the homage Guatemala wishes to pay to the victims of earthquakes and other disasters in all parts of the world.\n27.\tOn behalf of Guatemala, may I ask that we say a prayer in tribute to those who have died in your countries.\n28.\tFinally, on behalf of Guatemala I wish to tell you that we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like, at the outset, to express to you my heartfelt congratulations on your unanimous election as President of this session. I am convinced that your wide knowledge and wisdom and the invaluable role played by your country, Sri Lanka, in strengthening international co-operation and understanding, will help this session to achieve more victories for this Organization in the fields of peace, understanding and co-operation among the different nations of the world.\nUS. I should also like to express the gratitude of my delegation to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for his remarkable contribution to last year's Assembly. Our gratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts and wise guidance in molding this Organization so as to comply with the aspirations of its Members, as enshrined in its Charter.\n116. It also gives my delegation great pleasure to welcome the presence among us today of the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles, now a full Member of this Organization. And while extending our congratulations, I have no doubt that the Republic of Seychelles will positively contribute to our efforts in the' international arena to realize our lofty goals. In this respect my delegation looks forward with great eagerness to seeing the delegations of both Angola and Viet Nam taking their rightful place among the independent nations, in accordance with the proper application of the principle of universality of this Organization.\n117.\tBefore reviewing the issues on the agenda, allow me, Mr. President, to express the deep sorrow of the people and Government of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan on the passing away of the great leader of China, Chairman Mao Tsetung, one of the giants of our century, whose unmatched, ingenious achievements made possible the reconstruction of modern China.\n118.\tThere is no doubt that one of the key issues of utmost interest to our continent and to the whole world is South Africa and the events which are currently taking place there. Our Organization is, especially at this session, expected to reach a formula that will fully guarantee the application of the principles of human rights in that part of our continent, ensure the dignity of the African and stop the bloodshed that now stains the streets of valiant Soweto-a formula that will also condemn the murderers of Africans and the advocates of racial discrimination, that serious malady introduced by those abhorrent regimes into the spirit of modem civilization. If we fail to eradicate that malady, it will be a disgrace for our generation and generations to come.\n119.\tRacial discrimination is the root-cause of the present deteriorating situation in South Africa, encouraged and supported by the existing racist regimes so as to enable them to use brutal power against the black majority in southern Africa. It is, therefore, evident that the elimination of apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination will constitute a basic positive contribution towards resolving African problems.\n120.\tVorster stated last September that the policy of apartheid is the appropriate system of government for South Africa; in saying so he has shown that he is consistently acting in contravention of the resolutions of this Organization, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and world conscience.\n121.\tI would, therefore, call from this rostrum for the complete isolation of the racist regime in South Africa and for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter. I would also appeal to the international community to refrain from economic investment in South Africa, which strengthens and consolidates the system of racial discrimination and its power base, and instead to give financial, military and political support to the people of South Africa and help them to liberate their country. In so doing, the international community would prove its genuine desire to redress the injustices which beset lie people of that unfortunate country.\n122.\tIt does appear that Vorster is deliberately failing to recognize the capabilities of the present generation of South Africans, which has no illusions about the apartheid regime; the events at Soweto, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Port Elizabeth are only examples which will either bring Vorster to his senses or compel him to pack and leave.\n123.\tThe present situation in South Africa constitutes a real test for those countries which. ostensibly advocate international peace, civilization and progress and condemn killing and terrorism, while at the same time reacting differently towards the injustice, humiliation and denial of human rights to which the black peoples of Africa are being subjected. The same applies to those countries which provide illegal minority and racist regimes with financial support and technical, know-how, thereby causing more suffering to the African people, while denying the same assistance other countries under the pretext of preserving international peace and security. Our criterion should remain coherent in this respect. We Africans are able to distinguish our friends from our enemies. Those who seek the friendship of Africa should link arms with Africa today in order to uphold the dignity, liberty and independence of the African.\n124.\tUndoubtedly the presence of the racist regime in South Africa is the crucial factor that created the problem of Namibia, on the one hand, and on the other, consolidated the white minority regime that is illegally ruling Zimbabwe. The overwhelming hegemony of the ruling white minority, together with its unwarranted exploitation of those parts of the African continent; are, no doubt, the natural outcome of the failure of the international community to combat the racist regime in South Africa long before its encroachment spread westwards into Namibia and northwards into Zimbabwe and at a time when this Organization was adopting successive resolutions designed to solve that problem.\n125.\tThe' question of Namibia is and will continue to be the responsibility of the United Nations. South Africa tab failed to carry out the responsibilities of the Mandate entrusted to it to administer the region on behalf of this Organization. It is therefore the duty of this world body seriously and decisively to take appropriate measures for the implementation of its resolutions and to secure the independence of Namibia. In this respect, the negotiations between SWAPO-the only authentic representative of the people of Namibia and the only body My recognized by the United Nations and OAU as such-and the Government of South Africa should be conducted at the earliest possible time. In this connexion we would like to state emphatically that we reject the maneuvers pursued by the racist regime pertaining to negotiations and conducted in a manner that would cast doubts and negative shadows on the genuine will of the people of Namibia to achieve their full and prompt independence, with no strings attached, or any further continuation of hegemony or racist influence in the region.\n126.\tWe salute the armed struggle launched by the people of Zimbabwe, who have lived for so long under the oppression and domination of the illegal white minority regime. This armed struggle, marked by sacrifice and blood on the soil of Zimbabwe, is imposing a very important turn in the development of events. The will of the people is undefeatable; and armed struggle is the only path left to ensure majority rule as long as the Smith regime does not heed the voice of reason. Indeed, he has drifted in the opposite direction-the direction of brutal oppression.\n127.\tWe Welcome all attempts towards negotiations earnestly and seriously pursued to establish majority rule in Zimbabwe. At this juncture I wish to mention the full support of President Nimeiri for the decisions adopted at the meeting of the Presidents of the front-line African States. On the other hand, we reject all proposals aiming at the establishment of a transitional government in Zimbabwe, as conceived by Ian Smith, that would allow the white minority to retain power. Past experience and repeated tactics and maneuver only confirm our reservations. In this connexion, we quote Smith's famous saying: \\\"There will never be majority rule in Rhodesia as long as I live.'* There is a great opportunity for a final and just solution in front of Mr. Smith, and he should not let this chance slide by, otherwise he will dance on his own grave.\n128.\tAny settlement reached in Zimbabwe must, in the first place, be acceptable to the freedom fighters, the sole representatives of the people of Zimbabwe. Such a settlement must not be at the expense of the unity of the Zimbabwean people in their concerted efforts and armed struggle for independence. Such a struggle, we believe, will continue until complete independence is achieved.\n129.\tThe Democratic Republic of the Sudan has condemned in the strongest terms and categorically rejected the illegal minority regime in Zimbabwe. In order to compel this illegal and racist regime to abide by the United Nations resolutions it is imperative that the international community tighten its mandatory economic, military and political sanctions. My country appeals to all Members of this Organization to extend all possible assistance to the liberation movements of Zimbabwe in their struggle against the racist Power.\n130.\tFree Africa is deeply concerned with the inflammable situation in so-called French Somaliland (Djibouti). Notwithstanding the persistent efforts of OAU and the United Nations, the situation in that part of the continent remains tense and grave. We deem it necessary that the territory be granted the right of self-determination in an atmosphere free from external pressures with a view to achieving complete independence in accordance with the resolutions of OAU and the United Nations.\n131.\tWith the same concern, we follow the situation in the Comoros. It is our firm belief that the island of Mayotte is an inseparable part of the Comoros. Africa seeks and needs national unity, not partition or fragmentation.\n132.\tNotwithstanding all the resolutions adopted by this Organization, the situation in the Middle East is still more explosive than ever and will continue to be so unless Israel completely withdraws from all occupied Arab territories. Israel still continues to establish colonies on the West Bank, it still continues to exercise the most abhorrent types of brutality and oppression against the Arabs in the occupied territories, trampling underfoot the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international laws and practice. It went even further by applying the rule of the jungle to desecrate the sacred spiritual and religious beliefs and places in the occupied Arab lands, and perhaps its most recent aggression on the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron stands as the most striking example.\n133.\tTherefore it is no surprise to us that this Assembly adopted its historic resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975 considering Zionism as a form of racial discrimination. It is again no surprise that we witness the warmth of relations and the tight racial alliance between the governments of Tel Aviv and Pretoria, which actually represent two faces of one coin in exercising racial discrimination in \nall its forms of ugliness and brutality, in all its forms of the suppression against the Arab people in Palestine and the occupied territories and occupied territories and the African people in South Africa,\tNamibia and Zimbabwe, unmoved by the voice of conscience and in spite of the great opposition of the modern world and the disgust of human conscience, clearly represented in the resolutions of this Organization and other international and regional organizations.\t\n134.\tReal peace in the Middle East will not be achieved\tprogress in implementing decisions of the sixth and seventh before the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied\tspecial sessions. Arab territories and the full recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to their homes. It is also evident that, if Israel does not absorb fully the lesson given to it during the October war of 1973, the second lesson will undoubtedly follow.\t\n135.\tThe Democratic Republic of the Sudan believes in the necessity of establishing international zones of peace, which in turn will greatly contribute to the, easing of tension and will further, lead to the diminution of the danger that threatens peace and security in the world. In that connexion Sudan has announced its firm support of all\nthe resolutions adopted by this Organization and by the group of non-aligned countries calling for the declaration of lite Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. We also support all the United Nations resolutions aimed at the establishment of a zone of peace in Africa, as this will primarily lead to the elimination of the threat of war there and will provide the favorable conditions that will enable development in\nAfrica to take place, and will accordingly mean the betterment of the African people.\n\n136.\tThe Democratic Republic of the Sudan welcomes international co-operation in tile utilization of outer space for peaceful purposes, and calls at the same time for a reduction of military budgets, for the ceasing of production of chemical and bacteriological weapons, as well as for putting an end to all sorts of nuclear-weapon tests. Thus\nwe state in this forum Sudan's for stand, beside other States, in favor of the conclusion of a treaty for the complete prohibition of nuclear tests, as well as its full support of all efforts exerted to accomplish total disarmament in this decade of remarkable global detente. \n137.\tThe Democratic Republic of the Sudan follows with great concern the deteriorating situation in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in view of its friendly relations with the parties involved in the question of Cyprus. Our, intention for the preservation of peace and security in this region, which is so close to our country, does dictate our rum stand on the problem of Cyprus. Therefore we believe in the independence, national unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus together with the preservation of neutrality and sovereignty of the people of Cyprus, being of Greek or Turkish origin.\n138. At this forum we call upon all the parties concerned to exert maximum efforts, and to exhaust all peaceful and diplomatic means, to formulate an acceptable and lasting solution to the problem. In this regard we commend the tireless peace efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representatives in Cyprus and we hope that they bear fruit in the near future in order to restore peace and tranquility to the people of the island. \n139. The international community has embarked irreversibly on the road to the establishment of the new international economic order, which represents an important element in the continuing process of the democratization of international economic relations on the basis of equality, justice, and respect of the interests of all States. Our principal task at present is, therefore, to proceed on the basis we have laid down, to the adoption of such measures and actions that will enable us to achieve further progress in implementing decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions. \n140. The present international economic situation reflects a gloomy image and unless urgent measures are taken to alleviate the economic problems besetting developing countries, the already growing economic disparities will further add to prevailing complexity. \n141. The establishment of the new world economic order for self-sustaining growth and a stable and equitable world economy is a common cause for all countries and, further, an imperative necessity for the advancement of the entire international community. The existence of a few rich and affluent countries and a large number of poor ones will not help speed the advancement of humanity. Poverty and affluence cannot coexist endlessly. Structural changes are essential prerequisites if we are to avert potentially dangerous conflicts that have a direct bearing on the stability of world peace and security.\n142. The complex problem of crippling debts and debt servicing constitutes a serious impediment to development and requires an immediate solution. Developing countries have come up with several proposals in Manual I, and ColomboI 2 with regard to urgent measures for cancellation, rescheduling of payments and the declaration of\nmoratoriums on debts. It is our duty to frustrate all divergent and divisive attempts to delay action on this urgent issue. We cannot mortgage the future of our coming generations with these debts, whose repayment lays a heavy burden on our people. We believe the time has come for an urgent solution to this pressing problem. Furthermore,\ndeveloping countries need to receive accelerated concessionary\ndevelopment assistance and fair terms of trade in order to help build their industries and develop their economies. \n143. My delegation attaches considerable importance to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System so as to make it more responsive to the implementation of the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201(SVI) and 3202 (SVI)]. In this context we consider the restructuring process to be an essential pre-condition for the initiation of action oriented measures designed to translate the international economic order into tangible action. Consequently, my delegation calls upon the Ad Hoc Committee to discharge its mandate expeditiously by submitting detailed and specific action proposals to this Assembly during its current session. That would enable our Assembly to initiate urgent steps that would enhance the central coordinating capability of the United Nations in the economic and social field.  \n144.\tHumanity had a hard time combating poverty, disease and illiteracy. Now we witness the emergence of food scarcity as a new plague. The world has continued to suffer in the past few years from an acute scarcity of food. As we have already declared on this rostrum, the international food crisis is an artificial one; and the Democratic Republic of the Sudan can provide us with the helping tool. Our enormous agricultural resources are yet to be tapped and utilized for the production of more food to alleviate the deteriorating crisis. And I am glad to reiterate that the Sudan is willing to make these resources available for the benefit of mankind.\n145.\tWe continue to place great hopes in this Organization. Let us take care to promote its performance so that we can successfully establish a sound international community on well-founded poMiical, social and economic bases, under an umbrella of permanent peace for us and our coming generations.\n"

        "file_text": "Before I start my statement on the agenda items I should like to pay once more the homage of my country to the memory of the great leader of the Chinese people whose thoughts inspired the revolutions of many peoples in the world, Chairman Mao Tsetung. Since the President of my country had the opportunity to send a message to the Chinese people expressing the feelings and gratitude of the Mozambican people for the role played by China and by Mao Tsetung in our struggle for liberation, I will simply reassure the Chinese delegation of the heartfelt sincerity of that message and of our continued revolutionary co-operation.\n201.\tThe items on our agenda are of such great importance that it is tempting to address oneself to all of them. But since such an exercise is practically impossible, 1 shall confine my remarks to some of those items which my delegation believes require foremost attention. On the problem of disarmament it is lamentable that, in spite of the repeated recognition in this General Assembly as in the other international forums of the danger of the arms race and the stockpiling of armaments, particularly nuclear armaments, a solution capable of bringing tranquility to humanity has not yet been reached. On the contrary, we witness a deliberate resistance by the imperialist countries to the effective creation of denuclearized zones. Here I wish to refer to the countries that continue to support South Africa in the creation of its nuclear force.\n202.\tMy delegation would like to reiterate its support for the political declaration of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [A/31/197, annex I], calling for the convening of an extraordinary session of the General Assembly of the United Nations to examine the problem of disarmament, to promote and elaborate a program of priorities and recommendations and to study the question of the convening of a world conference on disarmament.\n203.\tThe international economic system that was established after the Second World War brought unprecedented expansion and prosperity to the developed countries. Since the Second World War the world has seen not only an enormous capacity of production but also a tremendous consumption capacity in the developed countries. At the same time the position of the developing countries has invariably deteriorated.\n204.\tThe struggle by developing countries to establish a more just international economic order does not require any further explanation for it emerges within a situation that can only be classified as relations of exploitation of the developing countries by the capitalist Powers. We are convinced that the new economic order has to be viewed in its proper perspective, namely the effective struggle against the unscrupulous exploitative and oppressive practices of transnational corporations and in the general struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism.\n205.\tWithin this context, developing countries have fought and are still fighting in order to bring about new relations in the following fields: first, the price of raw materials produced by them, which in great part end up in the factories of the developed countries. The foreign exchange earnings of the developing countries depend basically on their exports of raw materials and primary commodities. The relative improvement of the level of prices of some of these commodities, oil for example, in 1973/74, which was short-lived, did not at all compensate for the deterioration in the terms of trade which characterized the post-war period. The decline in their real value is continuing and is today assuming disquieting proportions as a result of the staggering rise in the prices of manufactured goods, food-stuffs, capital goods and services imported by developing countries. This situation is seriously affecting the efficacy of their efforts and puts a brake on their development.\n206.\tSecondly, improvement of the conditions for the access of goods produced by developing countries to the markets controlled almost entirely by developed countries. Despite the continuing assurance by some of the developed countries that they would relax and eliminate trade barriers for the products of developing countries, progress so far has not been satisfactory. However, it should be noted that the agreements concluded between some developed countries and developing countries constitute a hopeful sign in this field of access to markets. The generalized system of preferences, though a useful scheme of trade liberalization, needs substantial improvement. Its limited coverage, particularly in respect of products of export interest to developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, and its temporary nature are a matter of major concern. Progress in the multilateral trade negotiations has been slow and its focus has been narrow. Furthermore, with the exception of a few forward-looking developed countries, there has been no genuine attempt on the part of the developed countries to reorganize and reform the existing inequitable and unbalanced world trade system to conform to the urgent development requirements and priorities of the developing countries.\n207.\tThirdly, new terms for negotiations on their external debts (many millions of dollars of foreign debts for developing countries). There has been a phenomenal rise in the deficit of the balance of payments of developing countries, which increased from about $12.2 billion in 1973 to $33.5 billion in 1974 and to over $40 billion in 1975. Some estimates indicate that this figure could reach $112 billion by 1980 given the present trends. This unprecedented situation is not the product of conjunctural factors, but the reflection of the structural crisis that characterizes present economic relations, which stem from the colonial and neo-colonial policy of imperialism. As a result, most developing countries have over the years depleted their reserves and accumulated large external debts, a good portion of which entails heavy interest and amortization obligations. It has been estimated that the external indebtedness of these countries, which was over $100 billion in 1973, will be double that amount by the end of 1976.\n208.\tThe continuing diversion of qualified manpower and of material and financial resources from peaceful economic and social purposes to an unproductive and wasteful arms race not only widens the current economic gap between developed and developing countries but also frustrates the purposes and objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade, which envisaged a transfer of substantial resources from the developed countries to the developing countries as a consequence of reduced armament. The flow of financial resources to the developing countries amounted to only about $20 billion in 1975, in contrast to the expenditure on armaments, which has now reached $300 billion per annum. We believe that many of the development requirements of the developing countries could be met if a substantial part of the resources released by disarmament measures of the world's main military powers could be used to promote the economic development of developing countries.\n209.\tFourthly, in industry and transfer of technology, it is unquestionable that industrialization represents a dynamic instrument for the social and economic progress of the developing countries. We believe that it is also linked to the promotion and expansion of trade, not only amongst developing countries but also with the developed countries. The redeployment of appropriate industries necessary for economic development should be expedited. We believe that the monopolizing of technology processes by the developed countries has led to several unsatisfactory features which call for immediate substantive and institutional remedial action if transfer of technology is to be effected in order to achieve the targets set for the developing countries in the Lima and Manila Declarations.\n210.\tUnder these circumstances, the new economic order will not become a reality until the developing countries reach economic independence, breaking with their traditional role as producers of raw materials and buyers of manufactured goods. With this in mind, it is indispensable to direct the common efforts of the countries of the large United Nations family to establish the heavy industry in the developing countries.\n211.\tIt becomes imperative for the international community to understand that only a radical transformation of production relations can end the exploitation of many by man, a requisite condition for true economic independence. The establishment of a new economic order must be based on the sovereign equality of all the countries in the world.\n212.\tReiterating our support and commitment to the decisions taken at the Colombo Conference, we urge the States Members of the United Nations to support the declaration and other decisions of that summit on this issue [see A/31/197].\n213.\tHere I would like to relate the .question of the new economic order to our own experience in the struggle to achieve economic independence. We want the development of our country to be integrated in the context of the achievement of equitable world socio-economic relations aimed at the promotion of the well-being of mankind in both developing and developed countries.\n214.\tThe eighth session of the Central Committee of the Frente de libertafao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] decided to undertake a generalized political and organizational offensive in the field of production. The development of this offensive campaign will permit us to consolidate our independence and continue forward on the road to national reconstruction. To this end we must reconvert our economy, eliminating the relations of dependency on the minority regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa, the results of colonialism. This will permit the consolidation of our independence and the truly independent choice of the road to follow for the effective utilization and development of the human material potential of our country.\n215.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique has made significant efforts in this direction, especially through the creation of communal villages, a strategy for the development of productive forces in the agricultural sector as a basis for creating the necessary conditions for promoting industries. However, for the development of the emerging industry which was beginning to take shape in Mozambique, we have encountered difficulties in the international markets to which colonialism had linked the economy of our country; that link today impedes in one way or another our access to economic independence, designed in this way to keep us forever in thrall to the most aggressively imperialistic circles.\n216.\tOur efforts in Mozambique are the target of economic sabotage by the administrations of private enterprise with interests in our country, threatening the destruction of the few means of production that we have. We encounter obstacles to the measures taken, since most of the time the big capitalist companies refuse to furnish us with the products that we need for our industry, invoking fallacious pretexts designed to impose on us an economic system serving their interests, and not those of our people.\n217.\tNevertheless, basing our efforts on the principle of self-reliance, we have been able to maintain the productive process through the participation of the workers and of the administrative commissions named by the Government in a democratic search for the conditions needed to improve productivity. We believe that we will succeed in solving these problems because today we rely on a growing number of friendly countries, among them the socialist countries with which we have agreed to co-operate on the basis of mutual help and progress, within the just principles advocated by the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77.\n218.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique believes in the effectiveness of co-operation among the developing countries, based on individual and collective self-reliance, and invites the developed countries to support such efforts. The People's Republic of Mozambique does not see this as any kind of confrontation. The imperialist countries must not try to justify their customary sabotage of the efforts of the developing countries by interpreting our attempt to achieve economic independence and the necessary equilibrium in our relations as a declaration of war or as a confrontation.\n219.\tIf we wish to reach in harmony recognized objectives of international economic co-operation, the more technically and economically developed countries should refrain from threatening the developing countries. On the contrary, developed countries should realize that the existing economic system is based on injustice to the developing countries. Those responsible for this injustice would gain dignity and respect if they recognized this reality and helped change it.\n220.\tIn so far as Mozambique is concerned, we think that it is the obligation of the United Nations as well as of its individual Member States to help in the consolidation of our independence. The role that they performed in the conquest of independence of the People's Republic of Mozambique, obligates them to support our national reconstruction on the premise that it will lead to the prosperity of this country. This means that the Nations of this Organization are constrained to assist in the transformation of something that formerly horrified them, giving rise to their behavior in the colonial period, a process designed expressly to transform ignorance, hunger, misery, unemployment, sickness and, finally, alarming economic and technical backwardness, into social, economic, technical and technological progress capable of bringing Mozambique closer to equality with the developed countries.\n221.\tIn the last few years several sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have taken place under the capable direction of Mr. Amerasinghe. We are confident that the new convention on this subject will not discriminate against any State or group of States. The exploration and exploitation of the depths of the sea, the common patrimony of humanity, must benefit the international community, and we continue to believe that the Conference will find a way to prevent the granting of privileges in a discriminatory manner to States on the basis of their degree of economic development or of their socio-political system.\n222.\tAn international authority reflecting the predominant tendency in the world today will prevent the monopolization of the sea-bed area by the big capitalist companies and thus take part in the fight against the plunder of the natural resources of the globe by a privileged minority.\n223.\tWe support the efforts made in trying to reach solutions by consensus, which will make it possible to arrive at a workable convention accepted by a significant majority of States, and which will also contribute to the guarantee of international peace and security, In this context, effective mechanisms must be created against those who intend to profit from their present advantage in technology and know-how to launch still another attempt at colonization based on the law of the stronger.\n224.\tLet me now turn to the liberation of southern Africa, which is the fundamental task today. With the defeat of Portuguese colonialism, a new phase began in the arduous fight of the African people for independence and the end of oppression. The fight developed by the people of the former Portuguese colonies constituted an example and a victory for other peoples still under colonial domination. The victorious peoples of the new countries, tempered as they were by the experiences of their own struggle, were very conscious of the fact that their liberation would not be complete as long as there were countries dominated by racist minority regimes.\n225.\tAt this moment, our attention is focused on the situation in southern Africa. With the victory of the people of the former Portuguese colonies, the last bastions of colonialism felt themselves threatened. The victories in Angola and Mozambique, together with the actions of support in the United Republic of Tanzania, in Zambia, Botswana and all over Africa, facilitated the escalation of the struggle for the liberation of southern Africa. The development of action by the movements of liberation in the struggle against the common enemy, whose presence constitutes a permanent threat to our independence and to the normal development of our countries, marks an unequivocal and irreversible trend towards the liquidation of colonialism in Africa.\n226.\tThe international support of friendly countries contributed to the victory of our people. We do not forget this help, just as we shall make any sacrifice to help unconditionally the peoples struggling for their freedom.\n227.\tOur fight developed and is developing through co-ordination of action, in the unity of the African countries. We know very well that the secret of victory is in the unity and co-ordination of efforts of all the liberation movements and other forces genuinely interested in independence. It is through this well-defined unity that it will be possible to isolate and denounce all opportunist and puppet forces that pretend to accept situations of compromise with imperialism.\n228.\tVictory is inevitable because unity has been reached on objectives. But we still have to reinforce this unity in order to constitute one solid force in a position to confront in all domains the desperate and last-minute maneuvers engaged in by imperialism in an attempt to perpetuate its domination in Africa. In this unity there is not only an important role for the countries that are directly engaged in the fight, but also for the international community as a whole. Through our collective unequivocal action, we could make an important contribution to the struggle for national liberation.\n229.\tThe international community will have to be vigilant against attempts by the racist forces to divide the liberation movement, creating puppet movements or regimes that objectively could not do more than serve the interests of the minorities against which we are fighting. The denunciation and the non-recognition of the puppet forces is a real contribution to the liberation struggle in Africa today. Our objectives are clear: real independence, in which power belongs to the people. Our fight will be over only after these objectives are realized. And we must challenge any and all attempts intended to divert us from these objectives.\n230.\tThe situation in southern Africa is characterized by the development and intensification of the armed struggle for liberation throughout the area. The armed struggle is therefore a reality that cannot be ignored. Faced with the impossibility of achieving independence on the basis of majority rule through peaceful solutions, the liberation movements took up arms with definite objectives concerning which they would make no concessions.\n231.\tThe successes of the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa are growing daily: they are encircling the racist forces and isolating the international .forces that support the minority regimes of Smith and Vorster. The progress of the liberation struggle through the intensification of military action and the co-ordinated international action of solidarity in support of the struggle, including the intensification of sanctions against Rhodesia, has led to the deterioration of the situation at all levels. This in turn has brought about increasingly unfavorable conditions for imperialism, forcing it to reconsider its position. Objectively, at the present moment, imperialism is recognizing the inevitability of the defeat of the minority regimes in southern Africa. Thus it is quite clear that any solution that is found is the result of the armed struggle, of its intensification and of its successes. Each and every negotiated solution will have to be based on the conditions advanced by the authentic representatives of the people in the struggle.\n232.\tIn Zimbabwe, the struggle has been intensified in the last year. The intensification of military action, as well as the active solidarity of various African States, have placed Ian Smith's regime in an unsustainable position. The development of diplomatic and military action, and the condemnation and opposition by the overwhelming majority of the international community of the minority regime, have become so intense that by now it is clear to all that the days of the Smith regime are numbered and that soon the complete victory of the African freedom fighters will be a reality. Refusing to accept the principle of majority rule, trying to face a situation that was each time more precarious, the Smith regime began to develop a desperate fight against the nationalist forces, increasing its military power in a vain attempt to stop the struggle. Smith even pretended to move to the offensive, trying to expand the conflict to the free States of southern Africa through provocation and through the escalation of violence,\n233.\tIn relation to Mozambique, this conduct has been sufficiently demonstrated through the constant aggressions against our territory and through the systematic violations of our frontiers with the object of spreading death among unprotected populations. No week goes by without a violation of our land or air space by the racist forces. These actions have forced us to be in a state of constant vigilance, for the enemy's actions constitute a breach of the peace in our country and a violation of our sovereignty, and indeed pose a threat to peace and security in the area.\n234.\tThis is the way it was at Mapai. In an action that involved the use of varied military equipment, reactionary forces invaded our territory, destroying non-military targets, murdering dozens of unprotected Mozambicans, This is also the way it was at Nyazonia, a camp of Zimbabwean refugees under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In an action that went on for several hours, the Rhodesian racists murdered in cold blood 675 Zimbabwean refugees men, women and children. The brutality of the action has been clearly described by the representative of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Mozambique who visited that place.\n235.\tWe cannot but express our shock when certain countries choose to confine their preoccupation to victims of air terrorism or terrorist acts practised by small groups while ignoring completely the terrorism practised in southern Africa by the racist minority regimes. We have heard here only of 270 victims of terrorist acts perpetrated since the last time we met here. What about the 675 Zimbabwean refugees murdered at Nyazonia by the terrorists of the Smith regime? Or the Mozambican victims massacred at Mapai. And why the silence on the thousands of youths brutally murdered at Soweto and many other places in South Africa by racist troops? Was it merely an error of mathematical calculation or are we to understand that the lives of these thousands of human beings, victims of terrorism, have not the same value as the lives of those 270 people who were mentioned the other day as the only victims of acts of terrorism?\n236.\tI would like to make it clear that the People's Republic of Mozambique by no means condones any form of terrorism. I have mentioned the above example simply to draw :he attention of the General Assembly to the situation of terror prevailing in southern Africa.\n237.\tFaced with these examples, the international community that supported our struggle against Portuguese colonialism cannot remain indifferent. It is clear that the continued existence of the minority regime in Zimbabwe embodies the perpetuation of colonialism with all its attendant evils, including systematic massacres of Zimbabweans. At the same time it constitutes a permanent menace to the territorial integrity and independence of the People's Republic of Mozambique.\n238.\tIt is therefore not enough to condemn the racist and illegal regime of Ian Smith. It is imperative to take concrete action to put an end to this anomalous situation. In this connexion we are confident that the international community will offer greater support to the fighters for freedom, whose inevitable victory is recognized by us all.\n239.\tAs a result of the relentless struggle engaged on the battle-field by the freedom fighters, the Smith regime has finally accepted the principle of majority rule. At this juncture I should like to note the significant efforts of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, in trying to persuade Ian Smith to recognize reality. This acceptance, in itself, could constitute a positive factor in the evolution of the struggle in Zimbabwe and in future steps towards complete victory. But what kind of an acceptance is this? We should like to see it put into practice. At the same time, it is necessary to state here very clearly to Smith and to his allies that the problem of Zimbabwe has nothing to do with the interests of this or that foreign Power. Majority government means precisely that it will be up to the people of Zimbabwe to decide on their destiny with no external interference.\n240.\tThe objective of the freedom fighters is to bring about a majority rule that will permit the creation of a just political, economic and social order, in which everyone will have the same rights. The question is how to achieve this majority rule. We submit that only the position of the liberation movement, the real defenders of the interests of the people of Zimbabwe, should prevail.\n241.\tA lot has been said lately about minorities, about \\\"guarantee of the minority's interests\\\" and about \\\"indemnification\\\" to be made to the white minority. This is an attempt to elude the real core of the problem, to falsify the objectives of the struggle, and to introduce the specter of a struggle between races in an attempt to confuse the definition of the real enemy against whom the freedom fighters have been struggling. The problem of Zimbabwe, as we have said, is that of the establishment of a just order, in which there will be no place for privileged minorities. The problem would be correctly approached if, instead of excessive preoccupation with the so-called guarantees of minority rights, the international community were to concern itself with the needs of Zimbabwe in its task of national reconstruction after the victory of the forces of freedom.\n242.\tIt is interesting to note how easy it has been for the Western world to accept the proposed creation of a fund worth $1.5 billion for indemnification of the white minority, whereas it is still impossible to obtain even a necessary minimum to compensate the countries that decided to apply sanctions in support of the just cause of Zimbabwe's majority. In this connexion it is pertinent to recollect that Zambia's losses, incurred through its application of mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia, were to the tune of $500 million, while those of Mozambique approximated $300 million. We are not against assistance being given to the colonialists who decide to quit independent Zimbabwe, where they could be not useful anyway. But we want to point out the contrast that exists not only in the figures but also in the interest and readiness shown in the two cases.\n243 In order to promote the immediate solution of Zimbabwe's problem, the People's Republic of Mozambique supports the convening by the United Kingdom of a constitutional conference outside Rhodesia, with the participation of the authentic representatives of the nationalist forces. For us, the United Kingdom is the colonial Power in Rhodesia and for this reason it has to assume full responsibility in the solution of the problem. It will be up to this constitutional conference to establish the process of transfer of power as well as to decide on the question of a cease-fire. And it is our firm opinion that the transitional government must be a majority government, with real power, in order to guarantee the nationalists effective exercise of power.\n244.\tWe would like to state categorically that there is no question of lifting sanctions until the constitutional conference has produced results considered satisfactory by the freedom fighters. Similarly, until these objectives are attained we will continue to support unconditionally the armed struggle.\n245.\tMy Government once again salutes the Secretary- General for his efforts in searching for solutions of this problem and for his active role and that of the team appointed by him and led by the Assistant Secretary- General for Special Political Questions, Abdulrahim Farah, in seeking the support of the international community for Mozambique subsequent to our application of sanctions against Rhodesia. My Government also expresses its appreciation to those countries that contributed to offset the difficulties resulting from the closure of our border with Rhodesia.\n246.\tIn Namibia the struggle has been intensified and, there too, the illegal occupation by South Africa has become unsustainable. Faced with an increasingly adverse situation, the South African racists launched a two-front offensive.\n247.\tFrom the military point of view, the South African illegal regime has lately increased its war potential along the frontier with the People's Republic of Angola, creating a buffer-zone that is used, on one hand, as a base for successive aggressions against Angola and Zambia and, on the other hand, to repress in a more violent way the struggle for liberation of the Namibian people. Nevertheless, in spite of this military situation and of the support of various western Powers for Vorster's regime, the successes of the liberation war are evident.\n248.\tFrom the political point of view and with the objective of perpetuating its domination, South Africa has changed its tactics. It is now busy organizing pseudo- conferences for the \\\"concession\\\" of the so-called independence to a fragmented Namibia which it wants to turn into a federation of \\\"bantustans\\\", led by South African puppet leaders. Meanwhile the persecution against the nationalists in the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ goes on, many of them being now in the racist prisons or in\nexile.\n249 We are not going to dwell at length on this question of Namibia, because recently, on 1 October, we had the opportunity to express our opinion in the Security Council.  Nevertheless we find it pertinent to remind this Assembly that the action of South Africa in its illegal occupation of Namibia's territory constitutes a serious challenge to the fundamental principles of the United Nations, as well as a challenge to its effectiveness. Above all, it poses a serious threat to international peace and security.\n250.\tThe Security Council has the obligation to apply without delay the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter against South Africa. The United Nations Organization, which has long recognized SWAPO as the only liberation movement of the people of Namibia and endorsed the legitimacy of its struggle, should encourage and give substantial material help to SWAPO so that this organization may defeat the enemy.\n251.\tWe also support the convening by the United Nations of a genuine constitutional conference, in which the United Nations, the Republic of South Africa and SWAPO would participate. SWAPO should be the determining and decisive voice in the adoption of any solution in the conference. The People's Republic of Mozambique supports SWAPO's demand for the release of all the political prisoners as a priority condition for its participation in the constitutional conference. Our Government rejects any conference convened by South Africa on the Namibian question, and at the same time categorically repudiates as illegal, the so-called conference of Windhoek.\n252.\tThe situation in Namibia is intimately related with the situation in South Africa. The intensification of the struggle for liberation in Namibia is also a contribution to the decisive struggle of the South African people against apartheid. Within the boundaries of South Africa, the struggle develops every day. The revolts in the ghettos follow one another, showing once more the existence of organized forces against Vorster's regime. In the meanwhile, repression reaches proportions that clearly demonstrate that Vorster's intention is to drown in blood all organized movements against his regime. Nevertheless the struggle goes on and it is going to continue until the victory over apartheid and the restoration of a regime of justice based on human equality.\n253.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique condemns the policy of \\\"bantustans\\\" and rejects the so-called independence of Transkei. We salute the countries of the European Economic Community which, by their position of refusing to recognize the Transkei, have made a contribution to the struggle of the South African people and helped to isolate Vorster's regime.\n254.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its unconditional support to the African National Congress of South Africa and to the struggle developed by this organization, the legitimate representative of the South African people. At the same time my country expresses its full support for all actions developed towards the liquidation of apartheid.\n255.\tThe Indian Ocean was declared a zone of peace by this Assembly at its twenty-sixth session in resolution 2832 (XXVI). In 1975, an agreement in principle was reached to convene a conference on the Indian Ocean, We support the convening of this conference as we are convinced that it will be an important step towards preserving the Indian Ocean free from the imperialist interventions which constitute a continual source of conflicts and threats to international peace and security.\n256.\tWe reaffirm at this time that we are disposed to receive with hospitality all the ships that use that international communication passage with peaceful intentions. We cannot, however, refrain from firmly opposing the extension of imperialist military bases, such as that of Diego Garcia. The occupation of Diego Garcia is aimed at weakening the forces of peace and progress in the region, and at hindering the consolidation of political and economic independence of the countries of the region. The new French bases of Juan da Nova, Europa and Bassas da India, in the middle of the Mozambique Channel, very close to our country, threaten our independence. Also the occupation by France of the Comorian Island of Mayotte constitutes a flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of the Comoros, a sovereign and independent country, and constitutes a dangerous precedent in the decolonization process.\n257.\tWe can observe from certain world developments that there is a great deal of hope ahead of us in achieving most of the goals this Organization has been striving for during the last three decades. Sometimes, however, we find ourselves confronted with certain unhappy situations, created by some Member States of this Organization, Such unfortunate situations are completely incompatible with the most elementary principles of our Organization, I am referring for example to the annexation of eastern Timor by Indonesia.\n258.\tOn 28 November 1975, at the end of a long struggle of resistance to colonialism, the people of eastern Timor, under the leadership of FRETILIN, proclaimed tire Democratic Republic of East Timor, with its capital in Dili. On 7 December of the same year, the Indonesian Government occupied Dili, and later declared the annexation of eastern Timor. Nevertheless, installed in liberated zones, the Government of the Democratic Republic of East Timor continues the struggle and directs the work of national reconstruction. There is no doubt that the Government of Indonesia, violating the resolutions adopted by this Organization, has occupied militarily the territory of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.\n259.\tIn this connexion, we reiterate the appeal made by the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Mr.Samora Moises Machel, at the Colombo Conference, urging the Government of Indonesia to withdraw its occupation troops from die Democratic Republic of East Timor. We request all the States Members of the United Nations to join in this appeal and to condemn \\\"the persistent refusal of the Government of Indonesia to comply with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council\\\". We condemn \\\"the so-called official integration of East Timor carried out by the Government of Indonesia\\\". We recognize\nFRETILIN as \\\"the only authentic representative of the people of East Timor\\\". Finally, we call \\\"the attention of the Security Council to the urgent need for taking all effective steps to implement its resolutions\\\".\n260.\tEqually we add our voice to the denunciation of the occupation by force and the partition of the territory of the Republic of Sahara. We salute the heroic struggle of the people of Puerto Rico, the people of the so-called French Somaliland (Djibouti), and we hail the peoples all over the world who are struggling for their freedom and independence. We demand the liberation of Luis Corvalan, and respect for human rights in Chile. We also express our indignation at the assassination of the former Minister and Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Orlando Letelier, perpetrated in Washington two weeks ago.\n261.\tTo the people of Palestine and the Arab world, we want to express our concern at the aggravation of the situation in the Middle East. We are convinced that for a just and durable solution to the problem, the international community should take into account the principles enunciated in the political declaration of the Colombo Conference, namely, total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and exercise by the Palestinian people of all its inalienable national rights; total support and material, military and moral assistance to the Arab countries and to the Palestinian people represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization in their struggle against Israeli aggression; all States must refrain from taking any measures which will contribute to the material, military or moral support of Israeli policies; all States must condemn the complicity between South Africa and Israel, tending to create a racist expansionist axis to fight against the people and to deprive them of their national rights.\n262.\tIn respect to the Korean question, only the removal of foreign troops and the peaceful reunification of that country without external interference can be the basis for achieving a stable situation.\n263.\tThe admission of the Republic of Seychelles as the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of this Organization has filled us with happiness. We want to congratulate the people and Government of that fraternal State and assure them of our co-operation.\n264.\tIn the same degree to which we associate ourselves with those that preceded us in greeting the admission of a new Member of the United Nations, we cannot but condemn vigorously the manner in which one of the permanent members of the Security Council utilized its right of veto to exclude the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam from membership in our Organization.\n265.\tThe participation of the People's Republic of Angola in international meetings as that of the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has contributed in a significant way to the promotion of a climate of co-operation and friendship among die countries of the international community. Angola therefore must be admitted without delay as a full Member of the United Nations.\n266.\tThe decisive contribution made by Viet Nam in the struggle of the oppressed people led us to approve resolution 3366 (XXX), in which, by 123 votes in favor and none against, the Assembly requested the Security Council to reconsider favorably the admission to membership of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. Yet later the United States vetoed the admission of Viet Nam. On 2 August 1976, a unified Viet Nam submitted a new request for admission. My delegation truly supports the admission of Viet Nam as a full Member of the United Nations and unequivocally rejects any extraneous pretexts designed to frustrate its admission. We sincerely hope that the United States of America will reconsider its position so that both Angola and Viet Nam will be admitted to membership in the Organization before the end of the current session of the General Assembly.\n267.\tI cannot conclude without congratulating Mr. Amerasinghe for his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We rejoice in having as President of our Assembly an illustrious diplomat of the country that was host to the Fifth Conference of Non-Aligned Countries and received it with such outstanding hospitality. My delegation is convinced that under his wise and clear-sighted leadership, the work of the thirty-first session will be crowned with success.\n268.\tI would like also to pay my tribute to the wonderful work done by Prime Minister Gaston Thorn, President of the thirtieth session.\n269.\tLast but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my Government's sincere appreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his dedication to the triumph of the ideals of the United Nations. We thank him in particular for the successful job done in regard to the liberation of peoples, particularly his persistent concern and support for the struggle of the people of southern Africa. On behalf of my Government, I wish to affirm our full support for his continued services.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. Amerasinghe's election comes at a time when the international community has begun to accept the idea that the struggle of man for his rights is nothing more than a fight for recognition of his dignity, his worth and his entitlement to a full life in its economic and political aspects. In congratulating him, therefore, on his unanimous election to the distinguished office of President of the General Assembly-a tribute to his country and a recognition of his wealth of diplomatic experience and international standing-we of the Botswana delegation exhort him to maintain the momentum of the new vision, so that the thirty-first year of the life of this Organization will be a illogical development from its last two years, including both regular and special sessions.\n2.\tMay I also express our congratulations and thanks to the previous President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for his successful tenure of office and the part he played in the never-ending search for solutions to the intractable problems facing humanity,, and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his untiring efforts in promoting the role of the United Nations in international relations and the pursuit of liberty and human dignity.\n3.\tIt is appropriate at this point to express the sincere condolences of my delegation to the delegation of the People's Republic of China on the passing of its leader, philosopher and teacher. Mao Tsetung's qualities were such that they won respect and admiration from his great nation and from other nations as well. His memory will live long after us. May his soul rest in peace.\n4.\tResounding successes in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism in Africa, IndoChina and other parts of the world are a victory for the indestructibility of the spirit of man, determined to assert his faith in his larger freedom. Imprisonment and torture, incendiary bombs and napalm, shot-gun volleys and war planes-in fact, all the sophisticated weaponry in the arsenals of 'those sworn to resist change-succeed only in the destruction of the flesh but not the crushing of the soul and spirit of those bent on vindicating the justness of their cause. Little did our founders guess that, at this time in this century, the 51 Members in 1945 would have increased to 145.\n5.\tIn congratulating the new Member admitted at the thirty-first session-Seychelles-we equally congratulate those freedom-loving nations which continue to assist colonial peoples to achieve their universally cherished objective: their independence and freedom. It is our fervent belief that the new nation will bring with it constructive realism and contribute significantly to the ideals and objectives enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. But even as we rejoice in welcoming the new State to this Assembly, we feel concerned about those whose membership is thwarted and frustrated by super-Power ideological rivalry. I refer in this regard to the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. My delegation sees, in this act, gross interference in the internal affairs of small States, a denial of their right to self-determination and a travesty of the principle of universality of membership. Being a small State itself, Botswana can only plead, for what it is worth, that every effort should be made to ensure the immediate admission to the Organization of the States concerned.\n6.\tSince the seventh special session, there has been a series of conferences preoccupied with the establishment of the new international economic order. I refer in this regard to the Fourth Conference of African Ministers of Trade held at Algiers in November last year; the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Manila in January and February 1976; the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held in Nairobi last May; and the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo last August-to name only a few. It is worthy of serious note that, at all these Conferences, developing countries made their full contribution to the international dialog in the genuine search for lasting solutions to the ever-deteriorating world economic order.\n7.\tMany of us in the developing world entertained great hopes for the outcome of the fourth session of UNCTAD. We had hoped that the principles enunciated at the sixth and seventh special sessions would be taken a step further. \nYou are aware, Mr. President, that the achievements of the month-long session fell far short of expectations and were cynically described as \\\"UNCTAD labors and brings forth a mouse\\\" by one publication.\n8.\tThis Organization has had the opportunity of address-ing itself to the new international economic order at two special sessions. What had to be said has been said, and there will be no point in repeating it here. To sum up, I only wish to say: first, that developing countries are pressing for a change in the present international economic system, which is acknowledged by all, developing and developed countries alike, to be unjust and inequitable; secondly, that the said change should bring about an equitable transfer of resources, including the transfer of technology; and thirdly, that new institutional economic arrangements should be created and deliberately designed to be development-oriented. We commend to this Assembly the recommendations of the Fifth Conference of non- aligned countries [see A/31/197],\n9.\tThe struggle for freedom and self-determination in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the world continues relentlessly and unabated. The dangers of political domination and oppression, and the denial to peoples of their human rights, spread far and Wide. New political definitions are being coined to disguise aggression, and established international concepts are deliberately distorted to gain political advantage annexation by force and possible extinction of the territories of Western Sahara and Timor, the encouraged secession of the island of Mayotte from the rest of the Comoro archipelago, expansionist designs in Belize and Djibouti apartheid and racial discrimination resulting in enforced self-accommodation through degrading capitulation by Transkei are all, without exception, called self-determination.\n10.\tBotswana is committed to the principle of the right of peoples to freedom and self-determination, and we find it difficult to accord any form of legitimacy to these arbitrary acts of political domination. Botswana is fully aware of the reality of the existence of power relationships. We accept the existence of different political and social philosophies, ideologies and systems. We believe that only on justice and the right of all peoples to genuine self-determination and not on coercion or the destabilization of smaller nations aimed at changing their national policies or controlling their resources or even undermining their development efforts- should States Members of this Organization build-their international political order. As a member of the non- aligned movement, Botswana welcomes the observation of those who advise that the competing ideologies of East and West should be confined to those centers of power, thus releasing the energies of developing countries for the consolidation of their independence, political stability and economic development.\n11.\tIt is now two years since Turkey landed troops in Cyprus, and since then there has been little or no progress towards a peaceful settlement that would preserve the unity, sovereignty and integrity of this country. The exodus of refugees over the so-called \\\"Atta Line\\\" and the entrenchment of foreign troops in this country, as well as the progressively hardening attitudes evident as the inter- communal negotiations proceed with little or no success, are a matter of serious concern to the United Nations.\n12.\tIn a country that could very well have provided an example of peace, security, tolerance and mutual under-standing between different ethnic communities the \\\"deHellenization program\\\" in the so-called Federated Turkish State of this island nation is direct interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus and a violation of its territorial integrity. Our fear is that as the prospects for the solution of the problem recede the situation of refugees will become even more desperate.\n13.\tMy country has consistently supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus as a free, independent and unitary State. Botswana does not accept that the existence of different ethnic groups in any given independent country provides a justifiable excuse for militarily powerful neighboring countries of similar ethnic background to interfere in, and determine by force of arms, the future national ethnic character of that State.\n14.\tThe state of tension and insecurity of the peoples of the Middle East continues to occupy the attention of our Organization despite the interim accords on the disengagement of forces in the Sinai and Suez, and on the Golan Heights, which we welcomed last year. These agreements had given us reason to be hopeful for progress towards a just settlement. Our expectations have been disappointed. Israel continues to occupy Arab lands acquired by force and pays no regard to the resolutions of the United Nations. We call upon the Western Powers, in particular the United States, to bring its power to bear on Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab lands. Botswana recognizes the right of all States in the Middle East to secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\n15.\tMy delegation has noted with interest the withdrawal of the question of Korea from the agenda of this session. Botswana, however, continues to call for the dissolution of the United Nations Command, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, dialog, and the peaceful unification of the country. Advantage should be taken of the withdrawal of the Korean question from the agenda of the current session for the matter to be settled by the Korean people themselves without any extraneous external influences or preconditions.\n16.\tThe agenda of the thirty-first session of the United Nations is a long one covering varied subjects. If I should appear to have glossed over certain issues or even not mentioned some altogether, this should not be misinterpreted as being indicative of a lack of interest or that, in the view of my delegation, such issues qualify for a lower rating. The reason is that, speaking as late as we do and having had the advantage of listening to various speakers before us, we are satisfied that the essential subjects have been adequately discussed.\n17.\tBotswana urges this Organization to continue to work for general disarmament and that the vaunted Helsinki agreement  and the cooling of tension in Europe should be extended to other parts of the world. Botswana fully supports the resolution of the non-aligned nations reiterating previous resolutions that the Indian Ocean should be a\nzone of peace and that the unhealthy rivalry between the super-Powers In this region should be seen as endangering peace and the security of all the littoral and hinterland States in the area [see A/31/197, annex IV, resolution 11].\n18. Botswana as a land-locked and ^graphically dis-advantaged State attaches much importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. My delegation hopes that the United Nations will continue to play a leading and constructive role in the issue before it to ensure a successful outcome \u00a9f the Conference, successful because it takes into account the interests of all nations, big and small.\n19. My delegation believes that the continuing arms race is inconsistent with the international call for universal peace and security, for this can only be realized through general and complete disarmament. Nor is the arms race and the proliferation of nuclear armaments compatible with recent efforts to achieve a new international economic order. The channeling of huge economic resources towards the production and stockpiling of these sophisticated weapons undercuts international efforts aimed at the socio-economic development of developing nations where the infusion of aid is required to create reasonably acceptable conditions of living, Thus, while we recognize the obstacles and difficulties involved, we are sympathetic to the idea of the convening of a world disarmament conference for the promise and hope it holds for the future of mankind.\n20.\tA scrutiny of the structures and mechanisms of the United Nations reveals areas that require re-examination. The seventh special session in 1975 laid the groundwork for the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. This was not an isolated development, but the recognition of the deficiencies of the present structures and the need for a review of some of the most important organs within the United Nations. Botswana supports such a review.\n21.\tIt is not necessary for my delegation to remind this Assembly that Botswana has common borders with minority-ruled Rhodesia, colonially subjugated Namibia and minority-ruled and racist South Africa. Botswana has variously been referred to as a front-line State or as an island of sanity in a turbulent sea of racial bigotry, racial hatred, white supremacy and black degradation, suppression of the legitimate aspirations of the indigenous populations and the denial of their human rights and self-determination, and apartheid, severally referred to as \\\"separate development\\\", \\\"multiracialism\\\", \\\"multinationalism\\\" or \\\"plural societies\\\". The history of the United Nations is almost synonymous- with the repeated and sustained but unheeded, scorned and rejected warnings by the Organization of African Unity [OA UJ and other peace-loving nations that racial relations and conditions in southern Africa constituted a threat to world peace and security. It had to take the downfall of the Portuguese Fascist regime and in particular the tragic events in Angola to awaken this Organization-particularly those Members who share a\n- common history, ethnic heritage, imperialist associations, economic interests and security arrangements with the minority regimes-to the reality of the situation and to their responsibilities in upholding the Charter of the United Nations.\n22.\tFree Africa's efforts in the decolonization of that continent have consistently been frustrated by the collaboration of the West with the enemies of freedom. Millions of Africans in southern Africa continue to wallow in the slough of human degradation a id to squirm in the misery of conditions created by defenders of Western civilization. It is to southern Africa that I now wish to turn my attention.\n23.\tOn Friday 24 September the rebel Prime Minister Ian Smith issued a statement which, among other things, conceded the inevitability of change and therefore accepted the principle of majority rule, set the period leading to independence at two years, and accepted the creation of an interim government consisting of a council of State with parity of racial groups but with a white chairman. The said council would then set up a council of ministers with an African majority and an African Chief Minister, and white members responsible for the portfolios of law and order, and justice.\n24.\tThe Presidents of the front-line States not the \\\"so-called\\\" but genuinely the front-line States of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia-meeting at Lusaka on Sunday, 26 September, while welcoming Smith's declaration generally, registered their reservations on certain proposals which, if accepted, would have had the effect of \\\"legalizing colonialist and racist structures of power\\\", called upon the United Kingdom to convene urgently outside Zimbabwe a conference to be attended by the \\\"authentic and legitimate representatives of the people [of Zimbabwe]\\\", and reaffirmed their commitment to the liberation of Zimbabwe and to the armed struggle. The conference to be called by the United Kingdom would have to address itself to: the structure and functions of the transitional government; its establishment; the modalities for convening a full constitutional conference to work out the independence constitution, and the establishment of the basis upon which peace and normalcy can be restored in the country.\n25.\tThe declaration by the front-line Presidents evoked various comments in southern Africa and abroad: \\\"They agreed in advance and now have shown their total unreliability and irresponsibility\\\", said P.K. Van der Byl, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the rebel regime; \\\"If a peaceful solution in Rhodesia is to be found, the American and British Governments should clear up the confusion\\\", said Vorster, Prime Minister of South Africa; \\\"Certainly something has gone wrong with the Kissinger plan\\\", said de Villiers Graaf, leader of the opposition United Party of South Africa.\n26.\tOn the credit side, both the United States Department of State and the United Kingdom Foreign Office recognize the qualified acceptance of the proposals by the African Presidents and appreciate the danger of negotiating directly with Smith in the absence of the authentic and legitimate representatives of the people of Zimbabwe.\n27.\tThe important question now being asked is why the front-line Presidents had not expressed their reservations before the acceptance by Ian Smith of what he referred to as the \\\"package deal\\\", or whether in fact the Presidents had agreed to the detailed terms of the Smith statement in advance. The front-line Presidents did not know in advance the detailed terms of the statement issued by the rebel Prime Minister, nor did they make any commitment to accept them once they were known. To regard the stand taken by the front-line Presidents as a condemnation or rejection of the agreement negotiated by the United States Secretary of State is, at best, an untimely and mischievous agitation by those who oppose the liberation of Zimbabwe.\n28.\tSelf-determination is one of the basic principles in the African liberation struggle and African statesmen will not a'Jow themselves to usurp the role of nationalist movements by negotiating detailed constitutional arrangements on their behalf. This, we implore even those who assist us, to refrain from doing.\n29.\tBotswana welcomes what has come to be known as the Kissinger initiatives. In our view negotiations and the armed struggle are complementary strategies in the liberation effort. The armed struggle impels negotiations; meaningful negotiations showing practical progress result in the deescalation of armed warfare. While therefore we appreciate the efforts deployed by the United States Secretary of State to prevail upon rebel Smith to declare his acceptance of the inevitability of change to majority rule, we should recognize the fact that, without the successes registered by the nationalist guerrilla cadres in the armed struggle, without the sacrifice, both human and material, and the sustained efforts of the front-line States to awaken the conscience of the nationalist movements to their collective responsibility in the liberation of their motherland, without the support and determination of OAU to liquidate the remaining pockets of colonialism from the African continent and, last but not least, without the assistance -material, financial and otherwise-of freedom-loving peoples, the Kissinger initiatives would probably not have achieved the success they have. To miss this point would be to misread the Rhodesia situation and the determination of the rebel regime to resist change.\n30.\tWe concede the desirability of unity among the nationalist movements of Zimbabwe. It would be wrong, however, to make such unity a precondition for the conference. Many free countries in Africa today negotiated their independence constitutions through multi-party delegations. What is vitally necessary is that the Zimbabwe nationalists should do everything in their power to lead their country to majority rule and independence in the shortest possible time.\n31.\tIn concluding this topic I wish to express my delegation's concern at the danger of introducing divisions among African States in order to strengthen hegemonism and spheres of influence. African countries are classified as hawks or doves, Communist or Western-oriented, progressives or reactionaries. For us in Botswana, the problem of liberation and independence is the problem of the reassertion of human rights and dignity. Therefore the form of government the Zimbabweans choose should be the result of the exercise of their unhindered right to self-determination, without pandering to any particular ideological interest. The stage for the immediate transition to majority rule is set and it is for the rebel Rhodesia regime to take advantage of it, failing which the armed struggle will certainly continue until a military victory is won.\n32.\tThe Government of South Africa continues to defy the United Nations resolutions on Namibia. The so-called Turnhalle constitutional talks, based on ethnic identities, are an extension of the \\\"bantustan\\\" apparatus to a Territory under the trusteeship of this Organization. The Security Council has proved impotent in asserting its right over its own Territory and has instead taken effectual measures, the result of which has merely been to keep the question alive.\n33.\tThe continued intransigence of rebel Smith in Zimbabwe can be blamed on the United Kingdom as the administering Power. Prime Minister Vorster and his Government are responsible for the inhumanity of apartheid, but the continued colonial status of Namibia and the degradation of its indigenous people is a blot on the integrity and effectiveness of the United Nations.\n34.\tThe time for maintaining symbolic interest in the Namibia question is past. The Western Powers should now accept and exercise their full responsibility in delivering Namibia to the people of that Territory, for it is they that have consistently stopped mandatory action being taken against South Africa and consequently undermined the authority of the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n35.\tWe welcome the steps now taken in this direction by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger. We hope the South African Prime Minister, Mr. Vorstsr, finds it possible to negotiate with the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ under the auspices of the United Nations and outside of Namibia. That would be a positive step towards the solution of the Namibia stalemate. To make the talks meaningful in the search for a genuine solution to the problem and in order to create a healthy atmosphere in the Territory at this crucial period in its history, it is imperative, in the view of my delegation, that the nationalist movements should not be denied the participation of their leaders now in prison.\n36.\tBasic to all discussions and negotiations is the requirement that Namibia should emerge as a unitary State and attain its independence in the shortest possible period. The policy of \\\"divide and weaken\\\" which is applied by the South African Government to the African people in the subcontinent stands in direct contradiction to the South African national motto \\\"Ex unitate vires \\\", which applied to the whites. Nation-States are not created by whipping up racial and tribal differences or by exacerbating ethnic animosities.\n37.\tFrom the foregoing it will have become clear that the Botswana delegation, while conceding that the Turnhalle constitutional talks have done some spade-work in examining options for the independence constitution of Namibia, considers that the greatest achievement of the talks has been to expose and highlight all the characteristic undesirable features of a government based on the will of the minority determined to perpetuate their privileged position under the guise of their protected minority rights. It is our fervent hope that the proposed Geneva conference will re-evaluate its objectives, which should be the granting of independence to a unitary State of Namibia and self-determination for its united people.\n38.\tWhat we say is no academic or political theory, impractical to implement. States in southern Africa and even in this Assembly know only too well that Botswana is a non-racial State with strict adherence to the rule of law. There are minority groups who, numerically, are even smaller than those to be found in Namibia; there are different ethnic groups, yet nowhere in our independence constitution are there guarantees of the entrenchment of minority rights. One of our cardinal principles is unity, and it is in unity and complete equality that we celebrated our tenth anniversary of independence last month, and it is this unity-not disunity or federalism -that we consider to be a right of the people of Namibia.\n39.\tThe world has been shaken awake by recent events in South Africa. For those who have always conceived South Africa as a peaceful country where the African people-or the Bantu, as they are called there-are happy because, it is claimed, they have more hospitals, more schools, and higher incomes than anywhere else on the continent, it will have been a traumatic awakening, a rude shock. South Africa has always been depicted by its white rulers as the envy of the continent. They cite as proof of the better conditions the ingress of foreign Bantu labor-or, as the South African Deputy Secretary of Information put it in a United States television interview Saturday, the foreign Bantu \\\"vote with their feet\\\".\n40.\tThe unrest \\\"No, there is no crisis\\\", the South African authorities retort. \\\"The people have been put up to it by agitators, by Communists, by black power slogans. If the black people want majority rule, they can have it in their own bantustans such as the Transkei, where the soils are among the most fertile in South Africa. If they want to share power with the white man, no. Violence shall be met with violence and no concessions will be made in an atmosphere of arson and looting by irresponsible elements.\\\"\n41.\tWhat I have just said expresses in a nutshell the deep-seated attitude of the South African Government on the continuing riots where more than 300 unarmed black people, most of them children, have been shot dead, many more injured and maimed, hundreds more arrested, and a number have sought refuge in homelessness. It shows callous indifference to human suffering, a determined refusal to admit the realities of the situation which they have themselves created in their religious adherence to the outmoded belief of their chosen role as a bastion of white civilization in Africa.\n42.\tWe must accept the fact that the unrest in South Africa today-in Soweto, Cape Town, Durban and else- where-is a reaction against the philosophy and practice of apartheid-apartheid which is essentially violence, violence against human rights, including the right to be born of any race, at any place and time, the right to home and security anywhere in the country, the right to education and professional training of one's choosing in keeping with one's natural ability, the right to ownership of property, movable and immovable, the right to sell one's labor to the best market, the right to live a free and full life as a citizen of South Africa-in short, the right to be a human being.\n43.\tWe must accept the fact that the unrest in South Africa is not just an inspired and transient effervescence of political excitement or temporary political emotionalism, but that it is a spontaneous yet concerted demonstration of the strong resentment by the youth of the country of the humiliating and dehumanizing conditions which they, their parents and grandparents, and generations before them, have endured without respite. It is a call to the conscience of South African whites to abandon their supremacist posture.\n44.\tWhile we concede that South Africa is a great country, with trade and other relations with many countries represented here, and that it draws inspiration from its recognition by us all that it is a wealthy country and stands athwart vital trade routes to the East, we must accept the fact that the unrest in that country is a call to the conscience of the world community, particularly of the Western Powers, not to sacrifice the indigenous people of Africa on the altar of mercantile and mercenary interests and ideological hegemonism.\n45.\tWe noted with interest the recent shuttle diplomacy of Secretary of State Kissinger in southern Africa. I have already conceded Botswana's support for this initiative, although not for the details included in the declaration by rebel Ian Smith. We are, however, waiting with curiosity to know what initiatives the Secretary undertook in relation to South Africa itself. We in Africa have many times before now warned of the threat to international peace and security posed by the racist policies of South Africa and its Balkanization of the country into \\\"bantustans\\\". We do not see the bogus independence of the Transkei or any other \\\"bantustan\\\" as a solution to the problem, nor indeed do we consider the attempted appeasement of Coloreds, by promising them better waiting-rooms and the inauguration of their Cabinet Council, as the answer to their plight. Botswana, in common with all countries which have suffered colonial situations, cherishes the principles of majority rule and self-determination for all peoples, the blacks, Coloreds, Indians and whites of South Africa included. The acceptance by any of these groups of ethnic, racial or religious Balkanization is a criminal betrayal of the entire population of South Africa.\n46.\tComplete equality in the context of South Africa may seem a remote prospect, but so did it seem a distant dream to the Portuguese colonialists. It is our belief that, if Mr. Kissinger failed to tell Prime Minister Vorster that a Government elected by, and representative of, the people as a whole is what Africa and the world community want for South Africa, then his shuttle efforts in southern Africa will be preserved in the archives of American history under the label of one of William Shakespeare's classics, \\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\\". Peripheral and cosmetic concessions are not what the people of South Africa want. They want to lead a full life as full citizens of their own country.\n47.\tTo conclude my statement, I wish to observe that, with all the fearful warnings and signs of events to come, it behooves the Government of South Africa to reorder its society in a democratic way and to spare posterity the misery, racial hatred, chaos and wanton loss of life which we have had the misfortune to witness in IndoChina and elsewhere. For the bell that has tolled for the Fascist 518\nPortuguese regime and now tolls for Rhodesia and South-west Africa will toll for South Africa next.\n48.\tEdward Gibbon saw history as a register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind. It is time South Africa stopped the crimes and follies of apartheid and spared the black people of that country further misfortune.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I could not go to the substance of my statement without first expressing to you my sincerest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. Over and above the tribute paid to your eminent personal qualities, this election also bears witness to the confidence and esteem we feel for your country, which I am pleased to praise here for its constant efforts to establish a more just and more equitable international order. My country enjoys the best relations of friendship and solidarity with yours.\n37.\tYour predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, also deserves our congratulations and gratitude for the tact and patience with which he guided our work throughout the past session.\n38.\tThe admission of the Republic of Seychelles as a Member of our Organization is another source of real satisfaction for my country. We extend to the Government and people of Seychelles our sincere congratulations and our wishes for success. We would have wished to be able to extend similar congratulations to the People's Republic of Angola and to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which should normally have been occupying their lawful seats within our Organization.\n39.\tHie opening of our session this year coincides with a particularly sorrowful event which has profoundly afflicted the people and Government of Mauritania: the passing of one of the most eminent men in politics and one of the greatest thinkers of our times, Mao Tsetung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China. History will record the name of that extraordinary guide of the Chinese people and great friend of our people as that of the architect of modern China, an indefatigable defender of all just causes, and in particular that of oppressed peoples. To the great Chinese people and to the Government of the People's Republic of China, which are today cruelly stricken by his passing, we extend our most sorrowful condolences and assure them of our support and sympathy in these difficult hours.\n40.\tThe thirty-first session of the General Assembly opens at a time when the international community is more aware than ever of two essential requirements: on the one hand, the need to put an end to the anachronistic situations which afflict southern Africa and the Middle East and, on the other hand, the need to establish a new international economic order based on equality and justice.\n41.\tIndeed, the persistence of these dangerous hotbeds of tension and the maintenance of economic relations of inequality between the \\\"have\\\" and the \\\"have-not\\\" countries may at any time jeopardize the entire existing international system and threaten peace and stability throughout the world. It is therefore proper that these subjects should be in the forefront of our concerns in the course of the present session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n42.\tI shall briefly state the point of view of Mauritania on the first item, the hotbeds of tension in the world, and in the second part I shall refer to the relations between the \\\"have\\\" and the \\\"have-not\\\" countries.\n43.\tIn speaking about southern Africa, one cannot but be repelled at the fact that in this last quarter of the twentieth century, when there is a general trend towards emancipation, the peoples of that part of Africa are bent under the weight of the most backward racist and colonialist system, with its daily wake of horrors, impositions and injustices. Whether in Rhodesia, Namibia or South Africa, oppression and intimidation are the daily lot of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania. Their rights to a majority government are flouted; their rights to independence, national unity and territorial integrity are threatened, even as their rights to racial equality are systematically ignored.\n44.\tIn Rhodesia, a handful of white settlers proclaimed unilateral independence in 1965, thus defying not only the United Kingdom, the former colonial Power, but also the international community itself and, more specifically, the United Nations. The regime which has been in existence since then in Rhodesia is an illegal, racist and minority regime. Some 270,000 Europeans, living in a state of illusion and facing an uncertain future, have imposed their will of domination and racial discrimination on more than 5 million Africans.\n45.\tIt is in the face of this situation that the people of Zimbabwe rose up as those do who are resolved to die with dignity or to live in freedom. But, enjoying the unflagging support of all of Africa and the assistance of the inter-national community, the people of Zimbabwe sees every day that its victory is inevitable. Its struggle for freedom and genuine democracy enters today a decisive phase, imposing on the rebel regime of Ian Smith the need to seek means of survival.\n46.\tThe international Territory of Namibia also continues to be occupied by the racist regime of Pretoria, which practices there its double policy of apartheid and \\\"bantustanization\\\", despite the opinion of the International Court of Justice,  which has been confirmed by numerous resolutions, both of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, which place that Territory under United Nations responsibility and demand its independence with national unity.\n47.\tBut that is not the only defiance by South Africa. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the sole genuine representative of the Namibian people recognized by OAU and by the United Nations, is not only regarded to this day by Pretoria as a \\\"terrorist\\\" organization to be struck down but, what is more, has so far been excluded by Vorster from any discussion regarding the future of the Territory and people of Namibia.\n48.\tThis is a short-sighted policy that can neither consolidate the illegal occupation of the Territory of the Namibian people nor break the will of SWAPO to continue the struggle until it achieves independence with unity.\n49.\tComing to the close of the twentieth century, when equality among peoples, races and men is a major objective for all the members of the international community, it seems to us to be inadmissible to continue to be a mere spectator to the challenge launched by the regime holding power in South Africa, which, with impunity and in broad daylight, practices its inhuman racist policy, scorning all rules of law and morality and in defiance of the irreversible trend of historic evolution.\n50.\tThe South African regime, in order to attain its objective of separate and unequal development of the races, has provided itself with the most powerful and sophisticated military arsenal and an arsenal of laws and segregationist measures which affects all aspects of life: public transport, health, education, sports, administration and so forth, and which shrinks from no horror in order to impose its racist will. Such practices are doubtless repugnant to the conscience of each of us and arouse the indignation of all. However, it will not suffice merely to be moved by a situation so degrading for mankind; the international community must take concrete measures to outlaw the regime of South Africa.\n51.\tThe whites of South Africa do not appear to wish to preserve their future as Africans or to avoid for the people of South Africa as a whole the tragedy of a generalized racial war with unforeseeable consequences. Yet, it would suffice if they clearly and at once renounced their abhorrent and inhuman policy of apartheid, so that new perspectives could open up before them and all of Africa and so that hope might be reborn.\n52.\tPossibly it is already too late for the racist regime of South Africa to take the course of reason. The events at Soweto of the month of June last and those which have occurred a few days ago in the city of Johannesburg patently prove that the racial tension in South Africa has practically reached the point of no return.\n53.\tThe liberation movements in Rhodesia, in Namibia and in South Africa, with the strong material and moral support of OAU and of all freedom- and justice-loving peoples, are more than ever determined to win by battle that which they have not been able to achieve through moderation, dialog and negotiations. Their struggle, the sacrifices that they have accepted and the price that they must pay have already shaken the oppressive system in southern Africa, daily bringing closer the end of humiliation, racism and colonial domination in that part of Africa. The situation, in spite of its explosive character and the threat which it poses to peace in Africa, is more than ever favorable to them today because of their sense of sacrifice and their determination.\n54.\tHowever, it is true that the sacrifice of the peoples of southern Africa is not an end in itself. It is made, accepted and sustained in order to serve specific objectives: complete racial equality in South Africa; independence for Namibia with national unity and territorial integrity; and the rapid establishment of a majority government in Rhodesia. If these objectives can sincerely be achieved through a peaceful approach and in accordance with the aspirations of the peoples concerned, it is obvious that we would be the first to rejoice.\n55.\tBut if, on the contrary, such an approach were intended to demobilize militarily and morally the oppressed peoples of southern Africa so as more subtly to perpetuate domination, racism and apartheid, we could not subscribe to it.\n56.\tIt is in this spirit that we welcome the initiative taken in southern Africa by the Government of the United States of America. We are happy to see that at last the United States is more directly and more positively interested in the problems of Africa, and we are certain that if it succeeds in bringing the white minorities of southern Africa to see the light of reason, the United States would gain respect and prestige throughout the entire African continent.\n57.\tIn the opinion of my country, what ultimately matters is not the national motives which may lead a given super-Power to become interested in the concerns of Africa but the results it can obtain in the solution of our problems in accordance with the aspirations of our peoples. Therefore we express the hope that this United States initiative may finally lead to a quick, just and lasting solution to those problems, in the properly understood interest of the African peoples of the region. In the last analysis, the position of Mauritania is that of its brother countries on the front lines and of the liberation movements concerned. Whatever is the position of those countries or those movements, that is the position which Mauritania will defend.\n58.\tWhile these problems of southern Africa constitute hotbeds of tension which are undeniably active, other hotbeds of tension which are no less important and cause no less anxiety to my Government continue dangerously to threaten peace and security in the world, and foremost among those is the Middle East situation.\n59. For nearly 30 years the Palestine question and its corollary, the Middle East crisis, have been in the forefront of the concerns of the international community.\n60. This question has been the origin of four successive wars in the region, each time endangering international peace. I believe there is no need to recall the genesis of this problem, which is sufficiently well known here at the United Nations.\n61.\tYet it seems to me to be timely to recall an essential element which at present characterizes the facts of this question, that is to say, the quasi-unanimous recognition by the international community of the existence of Palestine and of the national rights of the Palestinian people.\n62.\tThe welcome accorded here in 1974 to the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine liberation Organization, brother Yasser Arafat,  the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization not only in the debates of the General Assembly as an observer but also in the debates of the Security Council, the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to an independent existence, to a country and to a sovereignty are a perfect illustration. All these elements now constitute tangible proof that any solution of the problem of the Middle East must of necessity and first and foremost include a solution of the tragedy of the brother people of Palestine.\n63.\tWhile for far too long imposing this tragic situation on the brother people of Palestine, driving them from their homes and dispossessing them of their goods, the Zionist aggressors have since 1967 extended their misdeeds to the territories of the neighboring Arab States. Those territories have been occupied by force and are still occupied, and the composition of their population has been changed because of an active policy of settling new populations.\n64.\tIt is time for the international community to assume its full responsibility and all its responsibilities in regard to this grave situation. As long as the Palestinian and other Arab peoples of the region do not recover their legitimate rights, there will be neither peace nor stability in the Middle East.\n65.\tThe conditions for a just and lasting peace in that region, as we have always stated, are: first, the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, which are recognized by the entire international community; and, secondly, withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied Arab territories.\n66.\tI could not end my remarks on this question of the Middle East without recalling with deep bitterness the fratricidal laceration which our brother country of Lebanon has been undergoing for more than a year. We sincerely regret what is happening in that brother country with which we have many links and we hope that this painful trial will strengthen Lebanon and that it will be able to play the role it has always played in the Arab world on the three\nlevels of culture, politics and economics.\n\n67.\tThere are many other important problems which normally require our attention and on which my country has a clearly defined position. Among the items on our agenda we might mention the question of Mayotte [item 122J, Djibouti [item 25] and Cyprus [item 118], which must respectively be settled on the basis of national unity and territorial integrity for the Comoros, independence in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Djibouti and a solution for Cyprus taking into account the interest of all the Cypriot people and preserving the independence and non-alignment of Cyprus. There are other items an our agenda the importance of which we certainly do not underrate, but it is impossible to go into a detailed review of all of them. However, I could not fail to mention a major preoccupation of our times: international economic relations and the law of the sea.\n68.\tThe frequency of the international gatherings which have taken place since the thirtieth session of the General Assembly on problems of development and international economic co-operation emphasizes the need for and also the urgency of a fundamental reform of the world economic system, which has so far generated injustices because it was built on inequality and exploitation.\n69.\tWhether in Paris, where the Conference on Inter-national Economic Co-operation was held, at Nairobi, where the fourth session of UNCTAD dealt with essential and controversial problems, or quite recently in New. York, where, under your distinguished guidance, Mr. President, the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has just ended, the international community as a whole has been given an opportunity to explore, within the framework of a dialog that has been direct, frank and, above all, exempt from any prejudices, the possibilities of the establishment of a new international economic order.\n70.\tOne of the most significant manifestations of the spirit of conciliation which must of necessity prevail in conceiving and carrying out a historic enterprise of this kind is, no doubt, what has been called the \\\"North-South dialogue, which was started only three months after the completion of the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly on the happy initiative of the President of the French Republic, Mr. Valery Giscard ti'Estaing, to whom I wish here to pay a tribute.\n71.\tThe vital importance for development in my country of the problems of raw materials and energy, not to mention other problems, is sufficient to justify the keen interest we have had in the work of that Conference throughout the various stages of its progress. While it may be premature to pronounce any judgment on the progress achieved so far, it is to be hoped nevertheless that the basic problems will finally be debated and that before the end of this year, or in 1977 at the latest, it will be possible to find concrete solutions.\n72.\tBe that as it may, we remain profoundly convinced, for our part, that, more than the institutional framework\nadopted and more than the complexity of the problems to be studied, it is the sincere will of all States without exception to further the \\\"North-South dialog that will determine the success or failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n73.\tOnce again this political will has been tested within the framework of the fourth session of UNCTAD, which met in May last in Nairobi. The developing countries carefully prepared for it by devoting to it practically the whole of the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, held in Manila from 26 January to 7 February 1976, and, in the opinion of those countries, the fourth session of UNCTAD was to be a decisive stage in the history of a new economic order. It was to offer an opportunity for both the developed and the developing countries to define the commitments they had undertaken at the seventh special session of the General Assembly, commitments covering such key issues as commodities, the transfer of technology, the international monetary system and economic co-operation among developing countries..\n74.\tAll those problems, to which my country attaches special attention and which summarize the difficulties facing the third world as a whole in its effort to emerge from its impoverishment, were fully discussed in Manila, where the Group of 77 once again firmly reiterated the need to increase the numbers of associations of exporting countries for all commodities and, to that end, advocated the strengthening of the role of UNCTAD by providing it with institutional means to enable it to contribute effectively to the implementation of United Nations resolutions.\n75.\tToday, four months after the end of the fourth session of UNCTAD, it would be quite appropriate to wonder whether its work has proceeded along the line of those directives, whether the dialog started at the seventh special session in New York was continued at Nairobi; and in a word, whether the fourth session of UNCTAD had, even in part, made concrete the hopes of the developing nations.\n76.\tIn this review, the crucial question of commodities, and more particularly the integrated program and the common fund, constitute, in our opinion, the most accurate index, since on it depend the improvement of the terms of trade of the developing countries and the increase of their export earnings. If the Nairobi negotiations did not lead to concrete and decisive results it was, however, possible to arrive at a consensus on the need for common action in this field. We consider that this is not negligible and that it is of the utmost importance to preserve and consolidate this.\n77.\tTo this end, we sincerely hope that the schedule established for the practical modalities for setting up a common fund to finance international commodity stocks will be implemented in due course. We are also pleased with the announcements made by certain countries in the course of the work of the Conference. We see in this a happy augury for the establishment of the fund.\n78.\tAmong the other subjects considered, that of economic co-operation among the developing countries deserves our attention both because of the importance of the objective pursued-that is, to make the developing countries capable of being the real instruments of their own development and because of its special interest at the present juncture.\n79.\tThe Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries, which was held barely 10 days ago in Mexico City, must be considered a new step in the long march towards the establishment of an economic and social system more capable of meeting the most immediate needs of the majority of the inhabitants of our planet.\n80.\tThe hunger, disease and ignorance still afflicting the poor countries which constitute the majority of mankind can be eliminated only by their combined efforts, starting with the developing countries. Hie debate on this question of co-operation among developing countries is therefore not academic-far from it. We consider it of the utmost importance that we, the developing countries, realize the gravity of the situation and endeavor to change it by relying first of all on ourselves. To this end, it is essential to intensify co-operation among our countries and to en-compass all fields that can improve the standard of living of our populations. At any rate, Mauritania wishes to reaffirm here its profound attachment to the objectives of that co-operation. It will not miss a single opportunity to make its modest contribution. It is in that spirit that we wish to support Pakistan's proposal to hold a summit conference of the countries of the third world, to be devoted to international economic co-operation and co-operation among developing countries [see A/311208].\n81.\tBut those objectives of which I have spoken and to which the conference will be devoted cannot be attained, nor the harmonious development of the world community as a whole be ensured, so long as the arms race continues at the rate that we all know. The figures speak for themselves. While every year the world spends $300 billion on arms, the net public aid to development does not exceed the modest sum of approximately $15 billion a year. To get an even more striking realization of the paradoxical nature of these investments, it would suffice to recall that the resources devoted in the last 30 years to arms exceeded $6 trillion, which represents approximately the gross national product of the entire world in 1976. TTiese figures, which continue to increase dangerously, must be considered seriously and realistically within the framework of the efforts made by the international community in the past few years in order to obtain a better world balance.\n82.\tMauritania, which is half desert, has undergone, like all its neighbors in the Sudano-Sahelian area, a period of particularly trying drought and it wishes here to express its gratitude for the praiseworthy and generous efforts of the international community and certain friendly countries to help alleviate the effects of that terrible catastrophe. In this connexion, we are particularly happy with the activities of the United Nations Sahelian Office, which has undertaken a campaign of mobilizing resources to finance and set up a series of national and regional projects in that hard-hit subregion.\n83.\tThe recent creation in Dakar of an association of friends of the Sahel, made up of States and organizations willing to give us their support and assistance, and the various meetings of financing sources and in particular that held at Geneva in July 1975, organized and presided over by Mr. Bradford Morse, who was then Under Secretary- General for Political and General Assembly Affairs-to whom I think it is only fair to pay a tribute for his dynamism and foresight constitute striking proof of the spirit of solidarity so necessary for the maintenance and development of international co-operation. We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to express our sincerest gratitude to the States and organizations which have contributed so generously to this effort for our recovery.\n84.\tThe establishment of an international economic order which we hope for cannot validly be dissociated from the establishment of a new legal order for the oceans which would reflect the legitimate aspirations of the vast majority of mankind. The skill, capability and devotion that the President has for 10 years placed at the service of this noble task compel our admiration and gratitude. My country, which has one of the major coastlines in Africa, has since the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas been able to state its views on what it thinks should be the basis;, and objective of the new maritime law.\n85.\tToday, only a few days after the end of the Conference's fifth session, we are happy to note that some principles that we have advocated for inclusion in the future convention seem to have been accepted by everyone, in particular such principles as the exclusive economic zone to which my country attaches particular importance. Full and complete sovereignty which the coastal State should exercise over the new maritime space should, in our opinion, be subject to no restriction except freedom of navigation, which is necessary to promote the role of the sea as a link between peoples. We believe that that sovereignty should be interpreted as the application of the inalienable principle of permanent sovereignty of peoples over their natural resources.\n86.\tAs regards the sea-bed, which constitutes the common heritage of mankind, according to the Declaration of Principles contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), it is our belief that in order to reflect the communal nature of that area in fact, the exploration and exploitation of its resources must be carried out under the direct and effective control of the sea-bed authority, which will distribute the profits from the exploitation of that zone in accordance with the criteria stated in the Declaration taking into particular account the needs of the developing countries. The authority must especially seek to reduce to a minimum the unfavorable repercussions which the exploitation of the resources of the area might have on the prices of the raw materials from the developing countries. I am not unaware that this is a very complex problem, on which it has not so far been possible to reach agreement.\n87.\tThat is our position on some of the questions considered by the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. I should like to affirm, however, that our concerns for, and our attachment to, the principles which I have just mentioned are not to be interpreted as a refusal to negotiate. We believe in the virtues of dialog, and we remain convinced that it will be possible to conclude an international agreement on the law of the sea. We must nevertheless not forget that this is an extremely sensitive question where unilateral initiatives are out of order and where, like our President, we believe that \\\"we have reached a stage where the ... conclusion of an agreement could be imperiled by... precipitate action\\\" [1st meeting, para. 81].\n88.\tThese are the political and economic problems which appear to my country to be a tremendous challenge to the international community and, in particular, to the United Nations. To resolve these problems in the interests of all mankind will require not otiJy true political will mainly on the part of the two developed blocs but also an appropriate framework where all members of the world community are represented. If this political will does not at the moment appear to be sufficient or does not go beyond even proclaimed intentions, at any rate the framework already exists. As an instrument for dialog and understanding among peoples, the United Nations is for its Member States a mechanism which has stood the test of time in all fields of human activity. True, it has its short-comings and its imperfections, but the United Nations is today more than ever an essential element in international life. Furthermore, it is up to its Member States to correct its short-comings and imperfections by respecting and implementing its decisions and resolutions and by adjusting the provisions of the Charter to present-day realities. If the privileges accorded to certain Member States by the Charter were justified at the outset, given the historical context in which the Organization came into being, it now seems to us to be necessary to re-examine those provisions of the Charter, taking into account the present balance of power and the emergence in the past IS ''ears of many new nations whose presence here fundamentally changes the political shape and the human dimension of the framework established in 1945,\n89.\tWhatever its imperfections and short-comings, the United Nations remains the hope of many countries such as mine as we take up the tremendous challenge of today establishing a new international order based on justice and equity. Such a task of necessity requires that the United Nations be headed by a man having a clear vision of the scope of this responsibility and capable of making the Organization a real instrument at the service of these objectives. Our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, having assumed this difficult responsibility at a time of profound and rapid changes, proved by his competence, his sense of moderation and his political realism that he is the man best suited to the task. That is why I should like to extend our congratulations to him and pay him a tribute for the task he has already accomplished and for the one which, we hope, he will accomplish in the years to come. He may rest assured that he has the complete support and understanding of my country.\n90.\tI could not conclude my statement without taking up a question which directly affects my country-that which is called the question of Western Sahara. I had not intended to do so, in order to preserve in our debates the serenity which is required by the problems to which I have already referred. However, since certain delegations spoke of it in their statements, I feel it my duty briefly to recall the evolution of this question since the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Everyone wiil remember that, under resolutions 377 (1975) and 380(1975) of 22 October and 6 November 1975, the Security Council recommended that the parties concerned start negotiations on this question, under Article 33 of the Charter and without prejudice to any measure which the General Assembly might take. While the first phase of these negotiations was not concluded because of well-known external pressures, the second was to lead to a tripartite agreement, which was signed in Madrid on 14 November 1975. This agreement provides in particular, in paragraph 3, that the opinion of the population of the Sahara will be \\\"expressed through the Yema'a\\\".\n91.\tMorocco and Mauritania, bearing in mind that, when the Security Council recommended these negotiations, it added that this would be without prejudice to any measure which the General Assembly might take, have submitted this agreement to the United Nations for assessment. The General Assembly, under resolution 3458 B (XXX), took note of the agreement, while in paragraph 3 it made the parties to the agreement responsible for ensuring respect for the aspirations of the Saharan populations. It is therefore in implementation of a Security Council resolution, an inter-national agreement and a General Assembly resolution that Mauritania and Morocco enabled the Saharan populations to exercise their right to self-determination in accordance with the procedure defined by the Madrid agreement, which was endorsed by the General Assembly. Every action taken by the two countries falls within the framework of international legality, and they are therefore justified in considering that self-determination has been exercised in Western Sahara in accordance with the decisions taken by the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n92.\tWhat is more, in the month of August last Mauritania, in its north-west region, which has been newly reintegrated under the name of Tiris el Gharbia, proceeded to hold legislative elections. As a result of these elections, which were held in the presence of many observers and foreign correspondents, seven deputies were elected to the Mauritanian National Assembly and now participate in its deliberations. Furthermore, all the higher-level personnel of that region undertake the national responsibilities for which they are suited by their training and qualifications, just like any other Mauritanian citizen.\n93.\tIn other words, for Mauritania and Morocco, which only acted in accordance with the rights recognized as theirs by the International Court of Justice and with the resolutions of our Organization, the principle of self- determination can no longer be invoked for the populations of Western Sahara, which have clearly chosen to be either Mauritanian or Moroccan.\n94.\tIf we also consider the views of the Algerian leaders, this right cannot be invoked because the result towards which its application might in due course tend has already been created and recognized by Algeria. The proclamation in Algerian territory of a prefabricated so-called Saharan Republic and the formal recognition which they immediately gave it do not warrant that the Algerian leaders should invoke the right to self-determination. Indeed, it is illogical of them to continue to call for the application of the principle of self-determination to the Saharan populations, for their attitude in this respect is precisely the very negation of that principle because they have already proclaimed the result of its implementation.\n95.\tThe Council of'Ministers of OAU, at its meeting in Addis Ababa in February last, was perfectly aware of that contradiction. It felt that since a Saharan Republic had been created, the only remaining problem had .to do with recognition of that Republic, and recognition fell within the sovereignty of each State.\n96.\tThus, it is clear that, whatever point of view one may have, the principle of self-determination can no longer be invoked in regard to the peoples of the Sahara-unless one wishes to apply the principle to imaginary Saharans or to play contradictory games, something which no one in good faith could accept.\n97.\tIndeed, the problem confronting this north-western part of Africa is a problem of tension between the States of the subregion, tension which the Saharan question in fact only revealed and of which it was the instrument. When clear and detailed information in that regard was communicated by the Mauritanian Head of State to his peers at the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU, it was decided that a special summit conference would be convened to deal with this situation as a whole. While Mauritania is sure of its rights and of the undoubted failure of the attempts made against its unity, it nevertheless has Confidence in the African Heads of State and hopes that Africa's wisdom will finally have the last word.\n98.\tThis natural and normal confidence that my country has in the African Heads of State is shared by the non-aligned movement, which, during the recent Fifth Conference in Colombo, adopted the following declaration:\n\\\"The Conference taking note of the decision of the Organization of African Unity to hold an Extraordinary Summit on the question of Western Sahara and the Situation which has resulted in the region, expressed its hope that this meeting will lead to a just and durable solution to this question.\\\" [A/31/1 9 7, annex I, para. 35.]\nThat is Africa's attitude on this question. It is the attitude also of the non-aligned countries. The attitude of the League of Arab States is so well known that I do not have to repeat it.\n99.\tI did not wish this brief outline of the development of the Saharan question to contain any element that could lead to controversy. As I said at the beginning of this statement, my concern was that our debates here should take place in an atmosphere of serenity. If, however, it appears to be useful to give more details, I shall take the liberty of speaking again at a later stage of the debate in order to place before the Assembly all the necessary information.\n100.\tIn conclusion, I should like to take-this solemn occasion to reaffirm the sincere desire of the Government and people of Mauritania-a desire that the Mauritanian Head of State has constantly affirmed-to see peace, stability and harmony reign in that north-western region of Africa; I would also state that our country is prepared to re-establish relations of confident and brotherly friendship with the fraternal people of Algeria. The only condition- and it is a simple one-that we place on this normalization of relations, which history, civilization, geography and the higher interests of Africa and the Arab world require, is that the leaders of the fraternal people of Algeria stop welcoming, financing, arming and training mercenaries, some of whom are Mauritanians, who will then be directed against our country, and that they respect our independence and territorial integrity and the unity of our people. Is that not the very minimum that we have a right to require of a fraternal people with which we share a common past and common aspirations? We express the wish that this appeal will be regarded not as weakness but, rather, as a call for friendship and fraternity, on a basis of mutual respect.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me to say a few words of farewell and a few words of welcome. My words of farewell are for the outgoing President of this Assembly, Mr. Thom, whom I congratulate most cordially for the manner in which he has discharged his mission, during which he placed at the service of the United Nations all his generous energies, his political talents and his diplomatic abilities. My words of greeting are to welcome you, Mr. President, at the head of this General Assembly of the United Nations and to congratulate you, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, on your election to the presidency. The political training and experience that we know you to possess and that have been displayed on many occasions, most recently in your wise leadership of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, your brilliant record of diplomatic service and, finally, your outstanding personal qualities are a guarantee of wise direction and inspiration for the work that this Assembly is now beginning. At the same time I wish to extend my congratulations to the officers of the General Assembly in view of the distinction, fraught with heavy responsibilities, that has been conferred on them.\n88.\tThis Assembly, as a new proof of the universality of the Organization, has approved the admission to member-ship of the State of Seychelles. My Government warmly congratulates and welcomes it and we wish to maintain with it relations of friendship and co-operation in every field.\n89.\tAt this time I am particularly pleased to pay a tribute of admiration and gratitude to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on the completion of the first period of his term of office in a post of such significance for peace and stability in the world. Mr. Waldheim has always been equal to the discharge of that heavy responsibility. It is thanks largely to him and to his competence, prudence and impartiality, that the United Nations has been able to face up to this particularly sensitive period of its history.\n90.\tThis is the first time that a Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Spain has addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations. My country is now going through a period of transformation of its internal organization which, because it is the will of the people of Spain, of the Government and of the Crown, will lead to the establishment of a democratic system based on the recognition of the principle of the sovereignty of the people.\n91.\tTherefore at the beginning of my statement in this forum I cannot fail to mention that aim as, of necessity, it influences the plans and achievements of our foreign policy. The Spain which its people and Government desire must acquire a new image and discharge a greater role in the concert of nations.\n92.\tIt is our firm will, as our final objective, to make our national community more vigorous and united with all its characteristic diversity, and to combine freedom and diversity with older, and we are convinced that this community, a community which would offer that rare and constant unanimity in the understanding of its interests and to the subordination of its differences about which the Spanish writer Angel Ganivet spoke, would lead us to greater participation in international affairs and allow our voice to be heard more clearly on all those grave problems which are of concern of the community of nations.\n93.\tThe Government of Spain is very much aware of the objective facts of the prevailing international state of affairs and the limitations imposed thereby. Spain, which belongs to a particular geographical area and has inherited cultural and historical ties, can today count on a certain potential that will enable it more readily to reconcile principles, interests and facts and to articulate and defend the permanent principles of the foreign policy of Spain effectively and with the utmost vigor.\n94.\tThis Organization, the United Nations, came into being with the triple purpose of saving \\\"succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", reaffirming \\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person\\\" and promoting \\\"social progress and better standards of life\\\". In substance, our common undertaking consists of defining new and more satisfactory margins of security, a security which will cease to bear the imprint of the alternatives in the distribution of balances and influences and will be based on the needs of mankind and on respect for his freedom and aspirations. In this fundamental task the Organization should have a double role. On the one hand, it should contribute to the standardization of rules of conduct which are generally accepted in the international community and adjust those rules to the needs of a pluralistic, changing, moving world. On the other hand, it should facilitate the collective legitimization of the expectations and aspirations of mankind at the cross-roads.\n95.\tThese ideas constitute for us a point of reference and an expression which should be the nucleus and nerve-center of our efforts. The kind of security that had as its only objective the avoidance of war was always futile. Behind hostile conflicts, the symptoms of profound diseases, lie the unjust situations which provoke and feed them. We would be gravely mistaken in our actions if, in seeking security, we were not to combine the necessary maintenance of peace with effective implementation of, and true respect for, all human rights, the only solid foundation for a real peace, and with firm co-operation on a world-wide level, which would lessen injustices and shorten the distances between communities and individuals.\n96.\tWith regard to the maintenance of peace, Spain notes the existence of a positive fact: the three decades that have passed since the end of the Second World War have not witnessed any generalized conflict. Man in the 1970 s has undoubtedly a deeper sense of security than in the 1950 s or in the 1960 s. The existence of this Organization has contributed to this, as has the dissuasive effect of a possible conflagration which, as it would of necessity be nuclear, would be cataclysmic.\n\n97.\tAll this is encompassed in one reality: the process of the polarization of world political forces, the formation of Which Spain followed from afar, since we did not participate in the Second World War, and of which we were more a passive than an active witness. This polarization has swung from side to side in what we might call the great argument of modern times, oscillating according to the mood of the times and the rhythm of underlying tensions from the \ninitial dangers of the \\\"cold war\\\" to the improved methods of accommodation which we know as \\\"detente\\\".\n98.\tThat Spain which today I have the honor to represent does not wish to be, nor can it be, a mute witness to things that affect or may affect us very directly. We are European and Western by vocation and geography; we are part of the cultural and political family from which we derive our philosophy and to which our system of beliefs and values is related. We are aware of the existence of a divided world, and we have a limited hope in detente, because the more painful asperities of the cold war have given way to more bearable forms of coexistence; because, while ideological confrontation subsists, some means of possible co-operation and understanding have been opened up; and because, finally, this is perhaps the method most in accord with historical fact that we have found to keep the intensity of conflicts from resulting in armed encounters.\n99.\tBut a static consideration of detente runs the risk of undermining and eroding one of the essential functions of the United Nations-that of being an instrument of pacification in international life because, basically, we must sincerely recognize that detente means nothing more than a more advanced stage of the former concept of the balance of power. In it elements subsist which we should like to see progressively banished from international relations: the division of the world into zones of influence, the maintenance and even the increase in level of armaments, and the persistence of armed conflicts in certain areas which are sometimes merely a concentration of tensions of a greater magnitude.\n100.\tFor Spain, a Mediterranean country, those open or concealed conflicts which today gravely jeopardize peace and stability in the mare nostrum are direct threats to the security of the region and, consequently, to world security. We give maximum priority to our concern with the objective of a prompt and satisfactory solution of the Middle East conflict on the necessary basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and with the inclusion of three equally necessary and interdependent elements: the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories; international recognition and guarantee of the frontiers of all the countries of the region; and recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people. We wish to believe that a negotiated solution to the conflict on these bases is not far off, although we must, with profound alarm, recall the dispute that has for months afflicted Lebanon and that has introduced new factors of uncertainty in the area, taking a very high toll of human lives.\n101.\tIn the Mediterranean we also recall the continuation of .the crisis in Cyprus which, with the instability and suffering it brings, continues to be a serious threat to the sovereignty, integrity and independence of a State Member of this Organization.\n102.\tIn southern Africa, neglect of the basic obligations of the Charter has so far created circumstances of the utmost gravity. Peaceful coexistence between the countries of the area requires the elimination of any policy not based on the scrupulous respect of human rights. It is my hope that the important advance in the solution of the problem of Rhodesia, to which so much has been contributed by the\nSecretary of State of the United States, will be consolidated by a process which will, without reservations or qualifications, establish the right of the peoples to self-government on the basis of the principle of majority rule while guaranteeing the rights of the minority.\n\n103.\tThe persistence and multiplication of localized conventional conflicts have been one of the most dangerous characteristics of the international community in the present decade. Such conflicts are tolerated without thought and, sometimes, selfishly, as a lesser evil and a substitute for an irreversible nuclear confrontation. They nevertheless create a threatening dialectic of unforeseeable consequences; in turn, they are directly fostered by something that has ceased to be the natural activity of the military industry and has become an unbridled arms race. We cannot dissociate the idea of security from that of disarmament, nor envisage the indefinite maintenance of a paradoxically armed detente. In the precarious state in which we find ourselves, we are still obliged to recognize the need to maintain our respective arsenals in the conditions which each State considers sufficient for the defense of its immediate security. We believe, nevertheless, that this trend should be radically altered, as soon as possible and with the decisive participation of the United Nations.\n104.\tThe bilateral or multilateral efforts which are being made, even though we recognize that the results are limited for the time being, deserve our full attention and support. But, since those efforts are restricted as regards the number of the negotiators, they can never replace the general conference that should be held under United Nations auspices before 1980-as was recently proposed at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Colombo to establish basic principles and make commitments so as to pave the way for substantive negotiations on general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n105.\tOn the other hand, along the way to security, Spain believes in the need to strengthen security systems at the regional level. That is why we actively participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and intend to continue that participation with renewed effort at all its later meetings. Therein we find the beginnings of a negotiation to replace confrontation and a unitary concept of security which covers all aspects of that term.\n106.\tWhile the maintenance of peace constitutes one aspect of security, another essential element is human rights. Ultimately, the last beneficiary of security is man himself. But man today, in large sectors of our world, suffers from a wounded dignity and an insufficient recognition of his human rights. United Nations bodies, in conformity with the purpose of the establishment of the Organization, have not faltered in their mission to promote and favor the universal enjoyment of those rights, in the conviction that it is only by guaranteeing the effective exercise of those rights that it will be possible to build peace and stability among nations on indestructible foundations. The Government of Spain has endorsed those purposes and, as its representative, tomorrow I shall sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant oh Economic, Social and Cultural Right? of 1966. With that act the Government of Spain wishes to express its firm will to make respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a corner-stone of its domestic and foreign policy.\n107.\tToday more than ever firm action is needed for the defense and international furtherance of human rights, and for this task the universal community of nations, embodied in this Organization, will always have the favor, support and endorsement of Spain. The international order is undergoing an accelerated process of humanization and in this we see one of the most promising signs of change and transformation in our universe.\n108.\tAn intolerable kind of violation of human rights in our time is terrorism, which disregards even the innocent victims and constitutes not only an attack on human rights but also a threat to the sovereignty of States by subjecting them to unacceptable blackmail and pressures. It is urgent for the international community to undertake co-ordinated action to prevent those deeds and to eliminate their causes. My delegation will support every initiative for creating appropriate international instruments and for achieving that purpose.\n109.\tFinally, within this chapter on human rights, I should like to mention the problems entailed in emigration, where human and family considerations are so interlinked with social, economic and labor factors. Here one premise must clearly prevail: everything must be subordinated to the dignity of the emigrant as a human being. It would be a grave threat to that dignity to consider the labor of the emigrant as mere merchandise subject to the fluctuations of the law of supply and demand of international labor. It is precisely in these moments of world-wide economic and labor crisis when the international community must most of all guarantee the emigrant's right to security and stability of labor.\n110.\tI stated at the beginning of my statement that together with peace and respect for human rights it is essential to achieve meaningful international co-operation.\n111.\tIt can quite rightly be affirmed that co-operation is the infrastructure of security, an affirmation which in our times acquires its full significance when we view the profound crisis which the world economic order is under-going. But in the course of the last 12 months some significant events have taken place, which Spain cannot fail to mention, in would economic relations and, more particularly, with respect to the new courses of co-operation which have been opened up by the dialog with the developing countries.\n112.\tStarting with the seventh special session in September last year and because of the general recognition of the fact that growth of the world economy cannot continue to render more acute the imbalance between the industrialized and the developing countries without endangering international peace and , security, it has been possible to lay down more sincere conditions for continued dialog, a dialog which must start with the need to build a new economic order on the basis of the requirements of international co-operation so that the concept of sovereignty may be reconciled with the urgent needs of an interdependent world.\n113.\tThe elements of the new dialog and the reasons for hope should not, however, cause us to forget the immediate state of affairs. We have not yet completely overcome the effects of the major depression which the world economy has suffered since the end of 1973. Economic and social progress, which is one of the principal objectives of this Organization, today requires a global approach which can only be achieved by concerned action on the part of all institutions of the United Nations system.\n114.\tIn this spirit, Spain, clearly aware of its role as a country in the process of economic development, although we have been very gravely affected by the consequences of the crisis, is participating in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris. That Conference, with all its limitations, must be regarded as a step forward in the joint consideration of world problems in this fields of economics and co-operation, so long as its agreements can later be endorsed in universal forums and implemented by the international community.\n115.\tAlong these lines and quite apart from any evaluation of the results of the fourth session of UNCTAD, which this Assembly will take up, my Government wishes here to repeat its support for the declaration made on the occasion of the closure of UNCTAD by 16 European countries, including Spain,  a declaration which, in my opinion, represents a milestone of paramount importance by recognizing the need for an integrated study of the subject of raw materials so as to put that subject in its right place in the new international economic order.\n116.\tMy Government realizes and acquiesces in the vast universal importance of this new co-operation and we are prepared to participate in it in every forum to the best of our ability. Urgent needs persist, and among them is the need for assistance for development channeled through the United Nations. In this respect we hope that the steps taken for the establishment of an International Fund for Agricultural Development will prove positive. Spain has already announced its intention of contributing to that Fund.\n117.\tIt has been a matter of special satisfaction for my Government to sign the Barcelona Convention,  which started a genuine plan of action with specific regional application to combat the pollution of the environment in the Mediterranean area. My Government considers that a regional approach to this problem can very effectively assist in solving the problems of the environment at a world-wide level.\n118.\tMy Government is also pleased with the establishment of the World Tourism Organization, which, by decision of its members, has established its headquarters in Madrid. In expressing our satisfaction at that decision and in expressing our appreciation for the confidence placed in our country as the headquarters of that Organization, I wish to repeat the firm willingness of my Government to offer its knowledge of the subject and its complete co-operation for the solution of the problems of world tourism.\n119.\tMy Government also intends to participate actively in the international conference on debt to be held at the beginning of 1977. The question of debt-financing is particularly acute for solving the financial problems of the developing countries, and unless we arrive at a formulation in principle that could be of general application, all those countries will encounter an overwhelming obstacle in their struggle for economic improvement.\n120.\tSpain, which is a maritime country par excellence and which has national interests to protect, attaches the utmost importance to the success of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has just concluded its fifth session and has scheduled another session for May and June of next year. It is our hope that the Conference will be able to draft a treaty on the multiple and complex aspects of the law of the sea, which will duly take into account the genuine and legitimate interests of the various States, and consequently will be generally accepted. We trust that at the next session it will be possible to overcome existing difficulties and that there will be a genuine spirit of negotiation and co-operation. I can assure Mr. Amerasinghe and at this point I address him also as President of the Conference on the Law of the Sea-that the delegation of Spain will always be ready to co-operate with him.\n121.\tWhile Spain understands and acquiesces in the need for effective international co-operation, at the same time it recognizes and nurtures, as a particular and constant guideline of its foreign policy, the special links between Spain and the Iberian-American republics. As we see it, the fact that we belong to Europe, in the unification of which we wish to take part, does not exclude those strong ties; indeed we would cut ourselves off from Europe if we did not actively and consciously consider it an important part of our European task to contribute to a better European understanding of Iberian-American affairs. Spain believes that it understands those affairs because it feels solidarity with those countries as with its family; and we think that we can bring other countries not so circumstanced to a greater understanding of them. My country does not claim that it would take on functions to which it has not been called, nor offer services that have not been requested, but nor can it forget its own history and family ties. That is why I should like to say, for what it may be worth for better understanding between these two great regions of the world, that in every possible dialog between Iberian- America and Europe, Spain, which continues to be European, will never cease to be Iberian-American as well.\n122.\tIn this policy of solidarity with Iberian-America, my country considers it essential to make a cultural synthesis of our affairs, without losing sight of our wealth of differences, to intensify the necessary and vital transfer of technology and to seek a satisfactory readjustment of the terms of trade. Spain commits itself to endeavoring to attain these goals.\n123.\tLastly, in the same policy of solidarity, we are pleased at the prospects opened by the declaration on the\nPanama Canal which was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States at its sixth regular session held in Santiago, Chile, from 4 to 18 June 1976. The course of bilateral negotiations on this matter, as well as in regard to Belize, leads us to expect fruitful results, for which we fervently hope. The same holds true for the problem of the Malvinas Islands. In all these cases, I hope that our Iberian-American brothers realize that Spain is always with them.\n124.\tWe are likewise committed to friendship with the Arab peoples. Our support for the just causes of the Arab nation remains unalterable, and I am pleased to proclaim it so today. Our cultural links and the fund of friendship and mutual understanding show us the political ways and means and plans of co-operation which are called for today.\n125.\tOne subject which has been considered as a priority by this Organization and to which I shall devote a few comments is decolonization. Spain, which in former times extended its political action over the entire world, has brought to an end its history as a colonial Power, reversing a process which was started in past centuries. Freed from that responsibility inherited from history, we have this year for the last time transmitted information to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, as prescribed in Article 73 of the Charter, in our capacity as an administering Power of a Non-Self-Governing Territory for the period ending on 26 February 1976. On that date we officially communicated to the Secretary-General the information that Spain had ceased all its international obligations with respect to the Sahara [A/31/56]. The General Assembly had already taken note of this when it adopted resolution 3458 B (XXX). Stability in that geographical area and the achievement of forms of co-operation in the Maghreb, which would do so much to promote the well-being and development of the peoples of the region is of general interest.\n126.\tDecolonization has been one of the major achievements of the United Nations and it is perhaps the outstanding event of international life in the twentieth century. Nevertheless, remnants of colonialism continue to exist; the flagrant example of Gibraltar represents a breach of the territorial integrity of my country. I wish here to recall the words of His Majesty the King of Spain when, in the first message from the Crown, he fully espoused that cause, recalling that for generations we Spaniards have struggled to restore the territorial integrity of our country.\n127.\tThe perpetuation of this colonial situation, supposedly in accordance with the wishes of a population to which Spain, through Great Britain, has repeatedly offered every kind of guarantee of their legitimate interests, is so preposterous and artificial, at a time when realism and goodwill are resolving far more difficult problems, that it is essential and urgent for Great Britain and Spain in the near future to find a way to re-establish the unity and territorial integrity of Spain. That this can be done without forgetting the legitimate interests of the residents of the area is something that Spain abundantly demonstrated by making generous proposals for a solution to the British Government, 10 years ago now, proposals which were never seriously taken into account and which Spain is at all times ready to reformulate in terms of the present circumstances.\n128.\tI shall not here repeat the history of the consideration of this item at the United Nations, a history which owes so much to the exemplary figure of one of my predecessors in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Fernando Maria Castiella. I merely wish to point out that the relevant resolutions of successive General Assemblies urging negotiations for the definitive settlement of this colonial problem have not yet been put into practice. The Government of Spain has been and is always prepared to begin these negotiations and to find a means for the solution of the problem.\n129.\tI shall now conclude with a few considerations on this Organization, which, with difficulties and contra-dictions, with limitations and doubts, has for three decades discharged an essential and valuable negotiating and pacifying function in the international community. For this function to attain its greatest dimensions and to fulfill its potential, it is essential that all Members realize the historic mission incumbent on them to improve the United Nations mechanism. I shall not go into the details of some items which will duly be dealt with by the various Committees, but I wish to reaffirm the determined will of the Government of Spain to participate fully in this effort at renewal, whether it is the important task of the Charter review, that of strengthening the role of the Security Council in accordance with paragraph 10 of resolution 2734 (XXV), that of the establishment of a system of permanent vigilance over peace or that of establishing, within the Economic and Social Council, a permanent world economic commission.\n130.\tBut the improvement and institutional updating of the United Nations will not in itself suffice to allow the Organization to discharge the functions incumbent on it in the world of today. It is necessary that there be an energetic political will among the Member States to overcome what the Secretary-General described as the old systems of conduct, which tend to place the United Nations at the service of particular and incidental policies of Governments. Only in this way will we be able to create the dynamic instrument of institutionalized co-operation which the world needs.\n131.\tThe President of this session of the General Assembly may rest assured that the co-operation of Spain in the pursuit of all these lofty purposes will never be found wanting, so that this thirty-first session of the General Assembly may constitute an important step forward along the path this Organization is following for the common good of the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure for me to extend to you, Sir, my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco is convinced that the unanimity with which you were elected is but the expression of the esteem of the international community for your outstanding qualities. That unanimity is a credit to your country and its leaders and is a manifestation of the consideration which the active policy of Sri Lanka has earned in the international arena as that of a country in the vanguard of those defending the principles of the liberation of peoples and of peace in the world, a country which was recently host to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or government of Non-aligned Countries.\n78.\tI should also like to congratulate you as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, a Conference which is of great importance for all the members of our community, in particular for the Kingdom of Morocco, a State which has a coast on one of the most important straits in the world, a coast washed by both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and which has always served as a junction and a cross-roads of civilization.\n79.\tI am happy to extend to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, our deep gratitude for having conducted with such wisdom and clear-sightedness the proceedings of the last session. The work done during that session yielded appreciable results, thanks to his competence.\n80.\tWe should like to bid a warm welcome to the Republic of Seychelles, which has just been admitted to membership after the recovery of its independence.\n81.\tI should also like to convey our warm congratulations to the Republic of Angola which has finally won its independence, after a long and heroic struggle. We hope that we will be seeing that country, too, among us soon, as well as the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, because of the universal nature of our Organization and the legitimacy of the desire of each national entity which has freed itself from the yoke of colonialism to become a Member of our Organization.\n82.\tI hope that the Secretary-General of our Organization may find here a mark of our appreciation and our gratitude for his tireless efforts to bring about a triumph of the principles which we espouse, the essential purpose of which is the promotion of a just and lasting peace throughout the world.\n83.\tFinally, I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the memory of Chairman Mao Tsetung, who in his lifetime became the great helmsman of China and left his mark on the evolution of his country and the history of our century.\n84.\tWe find ourselves on the threshold of the fourth decade in the life of our Organization, yet the world remains a scene of serious confrontations and difficult economic, social and political changes.\n85.\tWe had hoped that profound changes would occur in international relations, whether economic or political, and that a new international order would emerge; but that hope has, so far, remained a mere tissue of tentative ideas.\n86.\tInternational conferences recently held under the auspices of our Organization have demonstrated to us, even more than in the past, the solidity of the organic links between various wcM problems. It is becoming increasingly apparent that this is the result of a single but multifaceted phenomenon, that of economic and social under-development, which affects the life and fundamental needs of two thirds of mankind. It is becoming more than ever apparent that development efforts at all levels- national, regional or international-would be jeopardized if the structures and rules of the world economy were not brought into line with present-day realities, a goal which calls for total international equity.\n87.\tIt is from this standpoint that the developing countries embarked, along with the developed countries, on a dialog designed to bHng balance into existing economic relations within the framework of an economic Order which would be negotiated between equal partners; this would in no way prejudice the long-term interests of the developed countries or destroy the prosperity of their peoples.\n88.\tThis dialog was inevitable because we are living in a world of interpenetration, the elements of which are closely linked, and because our interdependence stems from the subtle and complex links between the various problems we face.\n89.\tThis dialog was necessary because it has enabled us to understand and also to discharge our serious responsibilities, which are to eliminate the genuine threat of poverty and insecurity which faces mankind now and in the future.\n90.\tScores of nations have in our day embarked upon an evolutionary process without precedent in history, a process which will determine the future of human beings and the fate of their civilizations.\n91.\tHowever, in the light of the scanty results of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and the building of international economic co-operation, we cannot but acknowledge that it is presumptuous to speak of success in this dialog, especially since the fourth session of UNCTAD.\n92.\tIt is, however, true that the protagonists are narrowing their differences in an effort of constructive consultation which was begun at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, and there are good grounds for believing that we are on the threshold of institutional and economic restructuring, which should lead to the establishing of a new international economic order.\n93.\tThe intergovernmental meetings to be convened between the end of 1976 and the end of 1978 under the aegis of UNCTAD, which are aimed at the implementation of an integrated program for commodities in all its aspects, particularly the creation of a common fund for the financing of buffer stocks, is something which deserves our attention and support. Their success will indeed determine the introduction into international trade of new rules designed to eliminate the deterioration of the terms of trade and thus help to promote the economic and social development of the developing countries.\n94.\tThese countries are striving to achieve collective self-sufficiency within global interdependence, in thus following the recommendations of the Fifth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/311197] and the resolution of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries held in Mexico.  It is important that these efforts should be supported by the international community and international organizations.\n95.\tThe objective of growth, which is included in the International Development Strategy, cannot be achieved without a rapid increase in net transfers of resources to developing countries by the end of the decade.\n96.\tAs no radical solution to the major problem of the foreign debt of these countries, which has worsened in recent years to unacceptable levels, was found at the fourth session of UNCTAD, it is essential that the developed countries should make a particular effort to see that the transfer of resources matches the projected level of the annual net capital needs of the developing countries.\n97.\tIn this context we believe that the vast social and technical progress which humanity has achieved in the first half of this century and which has made possible discoveries unknown to any other century, should itself serve as a catalyst for the emergence of a new concept of international morality worthy of our ambitions and efforts, marked by justice and equity, based on a genuine concept of democracy and having as its goal international detente and the flourishing of human society.\n98.\tIf we take a quick look at the geopolitical map of the world, we realize that there remain hot points which still constitute a threat to international peace. It is really regrettable that most questions which have been discussed before are still on the agenda of this session and awaiting a solution.\n99.\tIn spite of the retreat of colonialism throughout the world and our conviction that it will inevitably disappear, there are many parts of the world dear to us which are continuing to suffer from a yoke which is perhaps more oppressive than the one we ourselves knew.\n100.\tMorocco is legitimately proud of the role it played in its assistance to most of the liberation movements which declared war on colonialism in Africa or elsewhere. The initiatives it took in the holding of the Casablanca Conference, held from 3 to 7 January 1961, and in the summit conferences-African, Arab or Islamic -for which it had the honor of serving as host, are just a few of the reasons why we are proud of Morocco's contribution to the titration movement of peoples and its ambition to participate actively in the rapid elimination of under-development, injustice and colonialism.\n101.\tThe African continent continues to suffer from colonialism, racism and apartheid.\n102.\tThe people of Zimbabwe, who have displayed so much patience, has resolutely embarked on the path of armed resistance against a minority racist Government which is determined not to cease humiliating Africans on their ancestral soil.\n103.\tNamibia continues to suffer from subjugation, while South Africa persists: in ignoring the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and disregarding the principles and the values to which the whole of mankind has subscribed.\n104.\tFrom this rostrum the Kingdom of Morocco re-affirms that the only possible solution is to eliminate all racist hotbeds in Africa.\n105.\tIt is fitting for us to be side by side with the fighting people of Zimbabwe, to support it, to give it aid and assistance and to offer it our solidarity until it wins final victory. It is our duty to tighten the economic and political blockade decided upon by the United Nations and to prevent infiltration of mercenaries into the Territory.\n106.\tIn this regard my delegation wishes to express its complete solidarity with neighboring countries and its admiration for the sacrifices they have made and are continuing to make in the positive assistance which they are providing for the liberation of southern African countries still under foreign domination. We also wish to support the many efforts which are now being made to find a solution making it possible to place power in the hands of the majority, and this in the shortest possible time.\n107.\tFurthermore, the particular responsibility of our Organization with regard to Namibia makes it our duty vigorously to oppose any attempt to partition this country, particularly to create an artificial State on any part of its territory.\n108.\tMorocco, which considers SWAPO as the only authentic and lawful representative of the people of\nNamibia, once again supports the resolutions adopted in at the Dar es Salaam Conference in April 1975  and in Dakar in January this years with regard to Namibia.\n109.\tWith regard to South Africa itself, we remain convinced of the need to pursue the firm policy which our Organization has adopted, particularly in view of the tragic events which are occurring there and which are so repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\n110.\tThe Middle East continues to be the most disturbing hotbed of tension.\n111.\tIsrael persists in its policy of occupation of Arab territories. And while the initiatives taken more than a year ago are, to be sure, a new element in the efforts to achieve withdrawal from those territories, we note with concern a stagnation of the situation, which indicates a deliberate intention on Israel's part to protract matters for purposes that are easy to understand.\nt\n112.\tThe cases of Sinai, the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Jerusalem require that the efforts already undertaken be resumed with all the necessary diligence, in order to defuse a situation that endangers international peace and security, entailing incalculable political, economic and human consequences.\n113.\tThe tragic situation of the Palestinian people still awaits a just and equitable solution. The international community is now certain that the Palestinian resistance is pursuing a legitimate course in order to recover its inalienable right to exist as a nation. The determination of the Palestinian people, its heroic resistance and its spirit of sacrifice have indeed brought the nations of the world to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and lawful representative of that admirable people, and to allow it to be present in order to demonstrate the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to independence, national sovereignty and a return to their homes.\n114.\tIt is now for the international community to draw from the events the conclusions capable of leading to a rapid and equitable solution, which must be imposed in the face of Israeli arrogance. It is now for the international community to guarantee that the Palestinian people can return to the territories from which they were arbitrarily driven out and to ensure that that people is enabled freely to exercise its rights to independence and national sovereignty.\n115.\tOf course, the events in Lebanon have, regrettably, become a matter of priority recently in the Middle East context. But we should not lose sight of the fact that the Arab-Israeli conflict remains and could get worse at any moment.\n116.\tThe Kingdom of Morocco, whose sons gave the best example of heroism and sacrifice during the war of October 1973, side by side with their Arab brothers, in their action designed to put an end to Zionist aggression, solemnly reaffirms today its determination to support the Palestinian resistance, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, until victory is won and to support Arab action until all the territories occupied by Israel are liberated.\n117.\tMy delegation deplores the tragic situation in the fraternal country of Lebanon and shares its suffering, the cause of which lies in events which leave no member of our international community indifferent.\n118.\tForeign hands, and particularly Zionist hands, have played a nefarious role in the plot that led to the civil war in that fraternal country. We are, however, convinced that our Lebanese brothers will finally be able to thwart all these plots, thanks to their determination, their vigilance and their sense of nationality. It is indispensable that the Lebanese problem should be solved by the Lebanese themselves.\n119.\tThe Government of His Majesty King Hassan II reaffirms its total and unconditional support for all efforts towards guaranteeing Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in particular the efforts now being made by the League of Arab States. It is our great hope that in the course of the forthcoming Arab summit conference to be devoted to the Lebanese situation we shall succeed in our efforts to enable the people of Lebanon to play once again the role they have always played in our community, and to enable Lebanon to become once again a land of humanity, peace and tolerance.\n120.\tThe situation in Cyprus remains of concern. We are still convinced that the solution lies in the adoption of a constitution safeguarding the interests of the two communities, guaranteeing the independence and national unity of Cyprus and making it possible for the citizens, whether Turkish or Greek, to live together in the understanding and fraternity dictated by the imperatives of a common life and the interpenetration of interests.\n121.\tMy country has, indeed, constantly stressed the necessity of maintaining the Mediterranean, the cradle of so many civilizations, as a sea of peace. That remains our deep conviction.\n122.\tWe have the same conviction with regard to the Indian Ocean, which must be and remain a zone of peace.\n123.\tThanks to the active solidarity of the international community, to the goodwill, patience and vigilance of our Organization, and to the wisdom and determination of the peoples of Morocco and Mauritania, another decolonization problem, that of the Sahara, has been solved in a just and equitable way, in keeping both with the sacred principles that guide our action and with the aspirations of two peoples deprived for more than a century of part of their national territory.\n124.\tIndeed, today the Sahara, concerning which an item was regularly included in the Assembly's agenda for more than 15. years, has expressed its unshakable will to be reintegrated into the motherland; it has done that through its most authentic representatives, the members of the Saharan Jema'a.\n125.\tAlthough the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3458 (XXX) was not easy, because of the illegal presence in the Territory, for a certain time, of foreign troops, the consultation that took place on 26 February last did constitute faithful compliance with the provision laid down in the Madrid agreement of 14 November 1975, as indeed it was a scrupulous application of the same provision recalled in General Assembly resolution 3458 B (XXX).\n126.\tIn the introduction to the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization [see A/31/1/ Add.l, sect. Ill], it is indicated, on the one hand, that in January 1976 a Special Representative was named who undertook an exploratory mission in the region, but for well-known reasons that mission could not be concluded; and, on the other hand, that the Secretary-General then resumed his consultations with a view to clarifying the situation and decreasing the tension, but further initiatives by him were precluded by the actions of some of the parties.\n127.\tWith regard to the failure of the Special Representative's mission, I do not wish to dwell unduly on the pattern of events, but I would remind the Assembly that the mission was not successful because of certain initiatives which were taken and which did not fall within the framework laid down by common agreement, under which contacts were to have been undertaken only with Governments.\n128.\tAs for the measures taken by some of the parties, to which the Secretary-General ascribes responsibility for the preclusion of action by him, it is precisely those measures that I am denouncing; one of the most serious was the encouragement given to the creation of an artificial Saharan republic. These are, moreover, measures which are at the basis of the grave tension existing in the region. There were some examples at Addis Ababa and in Mauritius, during conferences of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], and at Colombo, during the Conference of non-aligned countries. They were all designed to ensure the so-called Saharan authorities, which had been artificially created, an international existence that no one is ready to accord them and to mobilize-although this was in vain-regional and international opinion in their favor.\n129.\tIt is to the honor of the regional organizations which were seized of this issue that they chose the path of wisdom and refused to allow themselves to be drawn on to the road of adventurism.\n130.\tIndeed, aware primarily of the concern created by the deterioration of the situation in the region, the heads of State of Africa, demonstrating the wisdom that has always characterized their initiatives, took the decision to convene an extraordinary summit conference to be devoted to the consideration of the tension in North Africa.\n131.\tAs for the non-aligned movement, noting that OAU still had this question on its agenda, it expressed the hope that that organization would succeed in its task of good offices, which it had voluntarily undertaken, thus refusing to take a stand on what is after all only a regional dispute, but, rather, completely supporting the African initiative and thereby conceding the inadvisability of any other measure.\n132.\tIt is thus apparent that the question of the decolonization of the Sahara has been replaced by another question just as delicate but more dangerous that of relations among the various States of the area.\n133.\tBorn of different concepts of the question of the Sahara and diametrically opposed assessments of the solution required by this problem, tension between the adherents of the two schools of thought is increasingly becoming a matter of concern.\n134.\tMorocco has no intention of allowing itself to be intimidated by pressures or threats, still less of accepting any renunciation of any of its legitimate rights whatsoever.\n135.\tThe history of our relations with the States of the area over the last 15 years eloquently demonstrates the constant concern of Morocco in the search for peaceful solutions to problems between us and our neighbors.\n136.\tBut the spirit of good-neighborliness, understanding and co-operation which has constantly prevailed in its regional and international policies, and for the sake of which, in other circumstances, it was willing to make considerable sacrifices should in no way be interpreted as willingness on its part in any way to pay the price of the ambition of others.\n137.\tWe believe that, above all, there is a limit to patience, and we cannot indefinitely remain indifferent to the provocations we are suffering.\n138.\tIt is therefore our conviction that any discussion of the question of the Sahara at the present stage is liable to be dangerous, premature and inappropriate-dangerous, because unfortunately there is every ground for believing that some people are looking for any pretext in order to lend any possible future military action the semblance of legality and international justification; premature and inappropriate, because OAU has decided to devote to this question an extraordinary special summit meeting and it has always been our Assembly's practice to respect procedures that have been embarked upon by a regional group.\n139.\tThe true problem to which our Organization should now devote all its efforts with all appropriate diligence is that raised by the situation of our brothers who came from the Sahara but are now being kept in Tindouf. These are Moroccans and Mauritanians living in the most precarious conditions. They are, in fact, involuntary refugees and exiles.\n140.\tI do not want to get involved in detailed explanations as to the process which led these people into the situation in which they now find themselves, but I think I can claim that most of those at Tindouf are there against their will and if they were given the opportunity they would return home without the slightest delay or hesitation.\n141.\tThe special problem of these refugees is a matter we have been raising for months now.\n142.\tWhen, July last, His Majesty King Hassan II spoke with the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, Mr. Moktar Ould Daddah, a joint communique was issued, stating, inter alia:\n\\\"The two Heads of State, fully aware of the state of extreme poverty in which a number of Saharan natives live in the region of Tindouf, issue an urgent appeal for them to return to their respective homes, where they are sure to be welcomed with all the solicitude and concern merited by their situation. The duty of the Saharans is no longer to live on international charity in a foreign country but to return home and rejoin their families and to take part in the building of the prosperity of their countries alongside their Moroccan and Mauritanian brothers in a climate of liberty and dignity.\n\\\"The King of Morocco and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania are determined to do everything in their power to ensure the repatriation of their nationals in close co-operation with the competent humanitarian international organizations. They invite those organizations to help them and to put an end to the tragic plight of the Saharans. We assure them of our determination to provide them with all the facilities and all the necessary guarantees to permit these men, these women and these children, who come from the Sahara, to rejoin the society to which they belong and to live among their own in peace and freedom.\\\"\n143.\tSince then Morocco and Mauritania have placed this distressing question before all competent humanitarian organizations, particularly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n144.\tThe only objective and humane solution to this problem lies in the repatriation of all the Tindouf refugees who are natives of the Sahara. The plight of these unhappy uprooted people cannot leave our Organization indifferent. TTiat is why the King of Morocco feels entitled to call for your participation and assistance to help them return home as soon as possible. Any other solution would be ineffective and would certainly tend dangerously to increase the state of tension, which is already very serious, in the region.\n145.\tMorocco certainly does not wish to avoid any discussion of the substance of the problem, particularly in an Organization which has given so much proof of its objectivity, its maturity and its effectiveness.\n146.\tMorocco certainly does not wish to shirk explanations which would in any case establish once again the lightness of its position and initiatives, the international legality of the measures it has taken and what it has done.\n147.\tBut, concerned as we are for our dignity as an African country, and recognizing that the heads of State of Africa have made tremendous efforts and have undertaken praiseworthy initiatives in order to find a way of avoiding the worst with regard to the three fraternal countries involved, we for our part express our total confidence in them.\n148.\tOur respective countries are living in a state of expectation, anxious in the case of some and confident in the case of others. In this state of expectation, the Sahara, which has rejoined the motherland, is binding up its wounds and pursuing with determination the rehabilitation of its economy.\n149.\tIn this meritorious work the solidarity of all the inhabitants of the country has been manifested vigorously, and the Moroccan nation as a whole is now mobilized in the service of the Saharan provinces.\n150.\tA few weeks ago His Majesty King Hussan II floated in Morocco a loan of $225 million for the development of the Saharan provinces. A month would have been enough for this loan to be largely covered and even exceeded, because it produced more than $250 million.\n151.\tThe Sahara is now living in an atmosphere of peace and hard work, and there is a feverish climate of activity in reconstruction and rehabilitation.\n152.\tMorocco, like Mauritania, confident of its rights and satisfied that it has given our Organization a modest contribution for a solution in the settlement of the question of the decolonization of the Sahara, once again would like to declare its confidence in our august institution, its unshakable faith in our ideals of peace and justice, its determination to persevere along with you in a constructive search for an equitable and harmonious settlement of all the other problems of the same kind which still await a solution, convinced, as we are, that no sacrifice is too great ultimately to preserve the dignity of man, to consolidate his achievements and to ensure his prosperity.\n153.\tFrom its very foundation, our Organization, with generosity and discipline, with perseverance and determination, has attempted to lay down the principles of its mission and the rules for its activities.\n154.\tThroughout its constant efforts it has reconciled the imperatives of the most diverse ideologies and has transcended particular circumstances for the benefit of an emancipated and objective concept of man and his ideals.\n155.\tThanks to the wealth of its ideas, the multiplicity of its options and the relevance of its preferences, it has roused the conscience of mankind to fight for the total liberation of the peoples of the world and for respect for their restored sovereignty.\n156.\tIn this noble work it has not hesitated to resort to different ways and means of finding the most judicious solutions, bearing in mind the specific features of each case and the collective aspirations which have been expressed, or the needs which have made themselves clearly felt.\n157.\tTherein lies the secret of the success of the noble mission which it has agreed to undertake. That in itself amply justifies the confidence and gratitude of present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in addressing this Assembly for the first time, I am conscious that you have given long and distinguished service to the United Nations. My delegation is confident that your knowledge and wisdom will contribute to the success of our deliberations and pledges its full co-operation to you in carrying out your duties.\n55.\tMay I also welcome the newest Member of the United Nations-Seychelles. Canada looks forward to establishing friendly relations with the people and Government of that new Commonwealth country.\n56.\tI take this opportunity to express to the delegation of China the condolences of the Government and people of Canada on the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung. The world has lost a great man.\n57.\tThis is a time of difficult adjustment for the United Nations. Our membership, with some notable exceptions, is virtually complete, yet there are pressures to define more strictly the obligations of membership. Efforts to adapt the procedures and structure of the United Nations to accommodate new policy priorities introduce new tensions in some traditional bodies and activities. Agreement on standards and principles of human rights is not matched by an equal determination to implement those standards without discrimination. The Security Council meets more frequently than before, but there is no comparable increase in the number of agreed resolutions. Acts of piracy and terror, both within and between States, undermine the principles of international law and behavior on which the United Nations Charter is based. The ideal of greater economic and social equality between nations is still far from translation into practice. And, finally, the choice between anarchy or order on the seas stands out before us in unmistakable clarity.\n58.\tCanada supports the objective of universality of membership. The Charter, it is true, speaks of certain conditions for membership, but my Government takes the view that all States which apply for membership ought to be given the benefit of the doubt, if such exists. Any question about the degree of independence of such States should be resolved on the basis of the opinion and practice of the majority of Member States.\n59.\tBut Canada also believes that a Member, once admitted to membership, should remain a Member. We hold that it would be a dangerous precedent to recommend expulsion of a Member State on the grounds of violation of the principles of the Charter, unless that is the consensus of the whole membership. To purge this Organization of so-called unpopular Members could lead to the withdrawal of support by others and the paralysis of our activities. That is too high a price to pay.\n60.\tWe also hear threats from time to time to suspend the right of Israel to participate in the General Assembly. Canada would oppose such action. To deprive Members of their rights in the General Assembly on grounds not justified by the Charter makes a mockery of the Assembly. Our purpose is to debate the issues, not to stifle them.\n61.\tOne implication of universality of membership must be a willing acceptance of the obligations of membership, especially by those States which play a major role in the Organization. A responsible measure of participation in United Nations activities, especially those voluntary programs which relieve suffering or help to maintain the peace, is a sign of such willingness. As a matter of principle, Canada will maintain its full and complete support for all United Nations organs of which it is a member. We would regret any trend towards the boycotting of United Nations institutions, or the unilateral reduction of assessed contributions to United Nations agencies, even though certain of their activities may be regarded by some States as harmful or irregular.\n62.\tNevertheless, we believe it is unwise to press resolutions to a vote on issues which deeply divide the membership. Canada regrets, tor example, that the campaign against racial discrimination, on which there is wide consensus, should be associated with Zionism, about which there is profound disagreement. If this link is maintained, my Government will not participate in the conference to be held in 1978 on racial discrimination.\n63.\tThe structure of our Organization and the priorities which it follows from time to time must reflect change in the world situation and in the membership. The shift over the years towards economic and social priorities is therefore desirable and understandable. We hope that some restructuring of the economic and social sector of the United Nations will take place as a result.. We see merit in proposals to give a more central role to the Economic and Social Council and for arrangements in the Secretariat designed to support that role. It is not too soon to envisage the Economic and Social Council in permanent session, taking up groups of issues in some orderly fashion and giving close attention to the implementation. of decisions taken at United Nations social conferences. The recommendations of the Habitat Conference,  for example, of which Canada had the honor to act as host, require thorough and expert scrutiny.\n64.\tWe recognize as well that many Members believe the Charter reflects better the world of 1945 than the world of today. We agree that useful changes might be made. But here, as in other matters, the best may be the enemy of the good. Canada takes the view that the present balance of power between the General Assembly and the Security Council, which is the central issue of the Charter reform, is preferable to any alternative. The question of the Council's membership may be debatable, but its powers and structure still serve us well. So, too, does the principle of equal rights in the General Assembly. If the United Nations is to evolve gradually into a body capable of making decisions which affect the vital interests of all States, it must follow procedures which give confidence to its Members that those interests are secure.\n65.\tThe coming into force this year of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex] is a major step forward for the United Nations. As a member of the Commission on Human Rights, Canada will now direct its efforts principally towards the protection of the rights defined in the Covenants and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One obvious means is to make effective the investigative and appeal mechanisms that are now established. These mechanisms require that States be willing to accept impartial examination of their alleged failure to abide by their commitments. A court of human rights, as proposed by my German colleague, is a step we should consider. None of us has a perfect record. To fall short of the aspirations inscribed in the Covenants and the Declaration of Human Rights is not a matter for partisan polemics, but for sober assessment.\n66.\tThe obstacles ahead are formidable. Appeals against violations of human rights can be a threat to the legitimacy of some Governments and an embarrassment to others. No State is immune to criticism in this regard, although some manage to deflect attention, while others become the center of attraction. Canada will speak out to the best of its knowledge without regard for power or favor. We attach particular importance to the full implementation of the terms of the Declaration on torture which the General Assembly adopted in 1975. \n67.\tOur experience with peace-keeping has been different from our experience with human rights. The concepts and principles of United Nations peace-keeping have been the subject of strong disagreement, whereas the practice has been modestly successful.\n68.\tThreats to peace and security vary from year to year, but we are rarely able to claim that none exists. This year we have been shocked by the continuing loss of life in Lebanon. The United Nations has not been able to contribute to peacemaking efforts there but should remain ready to respond if the situation so requires.\n69.\tA few weeks ago southern Africa was on the verge of disaster. It may still be so. But I am sure we are all encouraged by the developments of recent days. I pay a tribute to the patient diplomacy of the Secretary of State of the United States and welcome the apparent change of mind in Pretoria and Salisbury which his efforts may have achieved. My Government agrees that the early independence of both Namibia and Rhodesia on the basis of majority rule and racial harmony is essential to the peace of Africa. It believes as well that South Africa must meet the legitimate political, social and economic demands of the majority of South Africans, supported by the virtually unanimous opinion of this Assembly, if such peace is to endure.\n70.\tIn the Middle East the United Nations has no choice but to continue the peacekeeping duties authorized by the Security Council. We are encouraged at this time and were at this time last year, by the interim agreement reached between Egypt and Israel on the withdrawal of their forces from Sinai. We look forward to further negotiations which could lead eventually to a peace settlement on the basis of the principles agreed upon by the Security Council in its resolution 242 (1967), and which would take into account the legitimate concerns and interests of the Palestinian people. Whether negotiations are resumed bilaterally with the help of third-party mediation or whether they take place multilaterally in the presence of all the parties directly affected is less important than a joint determination by the States concerned to accept the necessity of establishing and maintaining peaceful relations between them. Pending the achievement of this objective, Canada will continue to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping operations and will oppose actions or initiatives which imperil the security and independence of States in the area, or make it more difficult for the United Nations to help in achieving a settlement.\n71.\tIn Cyprus the United Nations Peace-keeping Force still faces a difficult situation. The parties to the dispute are no\ncloser to agreement now than before. The situation on the ground remains tense and dangerous. It is generally agreed that the United Nations Force plays a vital role, but the costs of the Force are running $40 million over the contributions collected. We believe strongly that all Member States, in particular the permanent members of the Security Council, should make appropriate contributions to duly authorized United Nations peace-keeping operations. The fact that only a dozen or so Governments have made payments to the United Nations Special Account for the first sue months of this year is not a record of which we can be proud. I can only conclude that, unless the dispute moves towards settlement soon, my Government will have to review its position as a troop contributor in Cyprus.\n72.\tWe are concerned as well about continuing acts of terrorism throughout the world and about innocent people who have been threatened or killed.\n73.\tThe General Assembly established a Committee four years ago to study both terrorism itself and its underlying causes.  The Committee came to no conclusions, and the Assembly has not even studied its report. We believe the Assembly should now concentrate on a single aspect of the problem in an effort to achieve concrete results.\n74.\tI therefore support the proposal of my colleague from the Federal Republic of Germany [7th meeting] that priority should be given to action against the taking of hostages, and that international agreement should be reached to ensure the punishment of those who engage in such acts wherever they seek refuge. But we must not forget that conventions against aerial hijacking already exist. If all States were to ratify them we could be more confident that such hijackings would stop.\n75.\tMy predecessor spoke last year  of the \\\"totally unsatisfactory rate of progress in achieving disarmament measures\\\" and said that the General Assembly must continue \\\"as a spur to action in the field of disarmament\\\". A year later the record is little better. In the words of our Secretary-General, \\\"the problem of armaments continues to present the most serious threat to a peaceful and orderly future for the world community\\\" [see A/31/l/Add.l, sect. V]. We should be ready to explore new avenues, and in this spirit my Government is prepared to consider sympathetically a proposal to convene a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in 1978.\n76.\tWe must not delude ourselves, however, that the principal obstacles to progress on disarmament will be removed by discussion in this Assembly. These obstacles are the differences of view among States as to the best ways of ensuring their security. Our examination of ways of improving the role of the United Nations in the field of arms control and disarmament will have achieved little unless Member countries redouble their efforts to overcome those differences.\n77.\tAt this mid-point in the Disarmament Decade the responsibility to address ourselves to the real obstacles to progress is shared by ail Members of this Organization. But this responsibility falls most heavily on the nuclear-weapon States and other States of military significance. Progress will be meager, , unless we re-examine traditional assumptions, take adequate account of the security concerns of others, and seize all opportunities for concrete action.\n78.\tAll of us acknowledge that the money spent on weapons might be put to better use. Few of us reduce our defense budgets. To do so requires better understanding and mutual confidence. Such understanding and mutual confidence is difficult to achieve in the best of cases and not least in a world divided between wealth and poverty. That is why a common effort to accelerate the process of development and to reduce disparities is in the interest of all States.\n79.\tThe fourth session of UNCTAD has now taken place. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation, of which my predecessor, Mr. MacEachen, has the honor to be Co-Chairman, along with Mr. Perez Guerrero of Venezuela, has been meeting since the conclusion of last year's General Assembly. It has not been an easy year. The results of the fourth session of UNCTAD were achieved with difficulty and the Paris Conference is not assured of success.\n80.\tYet, our difficulties should not obscure the fact that we have made significant progress towards agreement on the nature of our agenda and priorities, despite the apparent lack of concrete achievement. If our preparation is thorough, and our approach to it sincere, achievement will be more likely to follow, provided that the requisite political will exists on all sides. It is now my earnest hope that the present phase of the Paris Conference will bear fruit.\n81.\tThe work of the Paris Conference is proceeding in parallel with work in the larger international bodies associated with the United Nations system. Its participants are aware that they must retain a global perspective on the problems before them if non-participants in the Conference are to have confidence in its results, and if these are to influence the actions of Governments in the longer term.\n82.\tThe Conference is part of a continuing process of negotiation aimed at narrowing the gap between rich and poor. The process is complex and it is permanent. Old problems will not disappear quickly and new problems will emerge. In the pursuit of a more equitable international economic system, Canada is prepared to commit its efforts and its resources.\n83.\tThe fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended here in New York a little while ago without agreement except to meet again for a further session in the spring of next year. Significant progress has been made on many issues, but the Conference remains deeply divided on other issues to a point where a strong sense of impatience and even despair has set in about the seemingly endless nature of these negotiations.\n84.\tCanada is strongly committed to the objective of the Conference-a new legal order for the oceans based on equity and sound management principles. As a major coastal State Canada is acutely conscious of the inadequacy of the old order, based largely on the concept of freedom of the seas, which developed 300 years ago but which has become, with the force of modern technology, license to foul the shores and ravage the fisheries of the oceans. As a Canadian from an Atlantic province, Newfoundland, which is heavily dependent upon the resources of the sea, I wish to leave this Assembly in no doubt about the strength of Canadian concerns on this matter.\n85.\tGravely depleted fisheries resources off our coasts led to a decision by Canada to extend our fisheries jurisdiction out to 200 miles as of 1 January 1977. This action is being taken within the framework of a system of sound conservation and rational management which we have negotiated on a bilateral and regional level with major fishing States operating off the Canadian coast. This action is also consistent with a growing consensus among nations reflected in the provisions of the single negotiating text that emerged from the Conference on the Law of the Sea last year and which has been confirmed in this year's revised text.  Other States, including our immediate neighbors, have taken or announced similar action.\n86.\tThere are positive features and areas of progress in the work of the Conference which, I must add, Mr. President, are in significant measure due to your own skillful and tireless efforts as President of the Conference. Although unduly protracted, because of differences on a narrowing list of unresolved, hard-core issues, the Conference process has seen the emergence of a growing international consensus on a variety of important matters, in addition to the fisheries provisions that I have mentioned. The concept of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone with important coastal- State powers has achieved broad acceptance. There is general recognition of the need for special controls against marine pollution in ice-covered areas such as the Canadian Arctic. The rights of States in respect of the mineral resources of their continental shelves extending out to the continental margin are widely accepted in the Conference, although differences remain on the definition of the margin and on proposals for revenue-sharing in areas beyond 200 miles.\n87.\tA major remaining obstacle to further progress has been the deadlock on the question of mining the rich resources of the deep sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. On this and other unfinished business we must find internationally agreed solutions to avert a serious risk of conflict and for the benefit of all mankind. The process may be long and many are weary, but we must not flag in the effort to achieve agreement on an overall regime for the oceans at the moment when, finally, success may be within our grasp.\n88.\tI have spoken about our hopes and disappointments as Members of the United Nations. I conclude with the pledge that Canada will continue to be a loyal and, I trust, constructive Member. The United Nations suits Canada. We are a country of many peoples and cultures. We understand the meaning of compromise and consensus. We prize the opportunity to cultivate relations with near and distant friends. We remain committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr, President, your election to the presidency of the General Assembly is the crowning of long and distinguished service at the United Nations, and a most deserving tribute to your personal qualities as a diplomat. It is a matter of particular satisfaction for the Iranian delegation to see so distinguished a representative of our continent elected to guide the counsels of this Assembly. We are confident that your proven qualities of leadership will be a great asset to the success of the work of this Assembly during these troubled times. I also take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who so ably guided the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. For the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, we once again re-iterate our support and wish him well in the discharge of the challenging responsibilities of his high office which he has performed with dedication.\n55.\tWe are delighted, also, to welcome into our midst the delegation of Seychelles. Its presence here brings our Organization even closer to the goal of universality.\n56.\tIn the period since we last met there have been new setbacks in areas affecting world peace. It is indeed distressing to observe that the situation in most of the major problem areas was either kept stagnant or allowed to deteriorate. Such was particularly the case in the Middle East, where a new tragic war threw confusion in the already complex and untenable situation.\n57.\tIn Africa, however, following a traumatic experience, a wave of diplomatic activities had produced encouraging signs of a break-through.\n58.\tThe lack of progress was striking in the economic field. Hopes raised at the seventh special session have not yet been translated into action, and this was particularly evident at the fourth session of UNCTAD and at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n59.\tI do not propose to deal with the entire range of problems confronting the world today. I would rather confine myself to areas of more direct interest and concern to my Government.\n60.\tIn the Middle East, we find that this troubled area, already the victim of perennial crises, is now thrown into further chaos and turmoil.\n61.\tThe initiatives taken last year in the Sinai had made us hope for a brighter future. Nevertheless, the very core and substance of the Middle East problem remains unresolved. Whatever the modalities and the specifics of the eventual settlement, one thing remains abundantly clear: no one can harbor the illusion that a lasting peace will return to the area until such time as Israel withdraws from the Arab territories occupied by force.\n62.\tWe commend the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force and the acceptance by Syria of the renewal of the mandate of the United, Nations Disengagement Observer Force. But the role that the United Nations peace-keeping forces can play in this situation, however useful, must of necessity be interpreted to be of limited scope and duration. This instrumentality for preventive action must not be allowed to perpetuate the uneasy and unacceptable status quo in the area.\n63.\tIn this respect, we wish to reiterate our conviction that the key to the solution of the Middle East problem lies in the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), together with other relevant decisions, including those dealing with the status of Jerusalem. It is evident, furthermore, that any proposed solution of the Middle East problem should fully take into account the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.\n64.\tI cannot leave this subject without mentioning that yet another distressing situation has emerged in the Middle East. No responsible nation, especially States enjoying close and historical ties with Lebanon, can ignore the tragedy that has befallen this land, which had symbolized for the world the tradition of peaceful coexistence. Courageous and just action must therefore be forthcoming to put an end to the agony and bloodshed. Peace must be restored before it is put beyond reach.\n65.\tThe situation in Cyprus remains stagnant and still fraught with serious potentials for armed conflict. My Government has always urged the continuation of inter-communal talks with a view to arriving at a just and durable solution in conformity with the aspirations of both ethnic communities. We regret that these talks that have been conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General have not yet yielded results. In the political climate now prevailing in that region the Aegean problem between Greece and Turkey last summer demonstrated how any dispute can reach crisis level.\n66.\tIn recent years, Iran's co-operation with other countries situated to its east has assumed ever-increasing importance. It is only natural that peace and stability in Asia and the Indian Ocean littoral should be one of the major concerns of Iran's foreign policy. It is, therefore, no small cause for rejoicing when we perceive the recent developments towards the normalization of relations among the countries of the subcontinent, especially the restoration of diplomatic relations, communication links and the resumption of private trade between India and Pakistan. In the same vein, we welcome also the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh and the improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n67.\tSpeaking of this region, we continue to view with great interest and concern all developments related to the Indian Ocean. My country has consistently stressed the necessity of keeping this area free from great Power rivalry and tension. In our opinion, it is up to the littoral States themselves to assume the responsibility for the peace and security of the region. We wish, therefore, to reiterate our abiding faith in the value of positive co-operation on the part of the littoral States. Furthermore, such co-operation, we believe, can assume greater depth and significance if supplemented by arrangements designed to foster trade and economic relations among the countries of the region.\n68.\tWith respect to the Persian Gulf, my Government's policy is based on our belief that there should be in this region the fundamental stability in which the nations of the area can pursue their goals of development and progress. And, in our opinion, friendly and productive relations among the countries of the region is a prime element for the existence of such stability. It is with this purpose in mind that we have repeatedly stated that we consider the maintenance of security in the Persian Gulf to be exclusively a responsibility of the littoral States and that such peace and stability should be safeguarded by co-operation among these States, free from any outside interference. In this context, we are gratified to note that our neighbors in the Persian Gulf have, during the past year, demonstrated keener interest in closer co-operation among the littoral States designed to promote closer ties in various fields and to buttress the safety and security of the entire region.\n69.\tWhile on this subject, allow me to report that following my announcement at the last General Assembly session that all outstanding differences between Iran and Iraq had been settled as a result of the Algiers agreement of 6 March 1975,  the two countries have now succeeded in building even more solidly on the foundations laid last year. As a result, a treaty and final agreements have been concluded on a whole range of issues which had for so long been points of contention between the two traditionally friendly countries.\n70.\tThe continent of Africa has been the scene of much turmoil in the recent past. Largely as a result of this state of affairs intensive diplomatic activities were undertaken which in recent days have produced interesting developments with a potential promise of a settlement in Rhodesia. My Government sincerely hopes that, following the acceptance of the principles of majority rule and the establishment of a transitional government, prompt and meaningful dialog will now commence to determine the form and modalities of a peaceful transfer of power to the black majority in Rhodesia.\n71.\tWe also look forward to a parallel progress with respect to the question of Namibia and towards a final eradication of the evil policy of apartheid in South Africa. My Government does not minimize the complexity of the issues involved. We nevertheless find the policies of racial discrimination not only abhorrent and unacceptable, but also self-defeating. My Government has undertaken a basic review of its policy to determine in what way it can most effectively contribute to the efforts of those African Governments which strive with political realism to eradicate apartheid, promote majority rule and remove the last vestiges of colonialism in southern Africa and turn their region of the world into one of peace and prosperity free from alien domination and interference.\n72.\tIn reviewing progress in the field of disarmament, we find that, although we continue to draw encouragement from ongoing negotiations and well-intentioned efforts, the over-all situation leaves much to be desired. General and complete disarmament remains an elusive goal for the international community. Confidence-building and partial arms-control agreements, while steps in the right direction, cannot provide a substitute for genuine measures to reverse the nuclear arms race. And while the dangers of horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons are pointed out frequently and with undiminished vigor, we believe that a genuine, general and complete disarmament cannot be achieved unless the major Powers which have themselves stockpiled an arsenal of nuclear and other sophisticated weapons work more actively towards this goal. In this connexion it is encouraging to note that the Soviet Union has taken the initiative of proposing the conclusion of a treaty designed to prohibit the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction. We express the hope that such a treaty may be elaborated in the near future.\n73.\tAs far as my Government is concerned, we will continue to play an active role in efforts to achieve the vital objective of general and complete disarmament. But as long as this goal eludes us and as long as there Is no secure machinery to guarantee peace and international security, nations have no other recourse but to provide for their own security needs.\n74.\tI would be remiss in my duty if I moved on from my discussion of disarmament without mentioning how greatly encouraged we are by the near unanimous support received at the last General Assembly session by the draft resolution, originally sponsored by Iran and Egypt, on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East, which became resolution 3474 (XXX). The basic concerns that underlay our proposal when we first made it have not diminished over the intervening time. On the contrary, subsequent developments have exacerbated the turbulent political atmosphere of the region. And this has reinforced our conviction that the introduction of nuclear weapons into the area would undoubtedly have the most ominous consequences for the entire region and indeed for world peace.\n75.\tIn the past two years we have witnessed an increasing focus on the need for ending the obsolete scheme of dependence and dominance and the need for its replacement by a new international economic order in which the legitimate interests of all countries-particularly the developing ones- would be met.\n76.\tIn assessing the prospects for the implementation of the specific decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions, we had expressed doubts whether some of the industrial nations would ever translate their promises at the United Nations into effective and concrete action. Unfortunately, subsequent events in the intervening period have done little to dispel these misgivings. In fact, the meager response of the industrialized nations to the problems of the developing countries have reinforced our apprehension.\n77.\tThis is not to deny that much effort and some progress have been made towards the achievement of the goals and objectives of the new order. Nevertheless, the outcome of the strenuous work and intensive debate conducted within and outside the United Nations framework has not so far been commensurate with the gravity or magnitude of the problems facing the world.\n78.\tFor instance, the results of the fourth session of UNCTAD were by no means encouraging. A certain amount of limited progress was achieved in Nairobi in areas related to primary commodities. However, the session failed to come to grips with the needs and aspirations of the developing countries in other substantive areas.\n79.\tAnd to compound our disappointment, the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation has not, to date, achieved positive results, mainly due to the preoccupation of the developed countries with energy- related problems and to their lack of interest in other items on the agenda of the Conference.\n80.\tThe Assembly will recall that the idea for the Paris Conference was initiated at the time when most of the industrialized countries were severely hit by a largely self-inflicted economic crisis. Hence the genesis of the Conference lies not only in the developing countries' desire to terminate past injustices and inequities in their economic relations with the industrial countries but also in the developed countries' anxiety to resolve their own energy and other problems. However, as far as the developed world is concerned the situation has to a large extent been transformed. During the interim period the industrial world has managed to emerge from its economic crisis and is now launched on the way to recovery. In contrast, the situation in the poor countries has gone from bad to worse.\n81.\tThe world-wide inflationary spiral, accompanied by the decline in commodity prices, las continued to erode the purchasing power of the developing countries, and the terms of trade of their primary commodities relative to manufactures, services and technology which they import from the industrial world have continued to deteriorate.\n82.\tWe have been saying all along that the erosion of the purchasing power of our depleting assets cannot be allowed to continue. None the less, last year the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries f OPEC/ agreed to freeze the price of oil in the hope that the industrial world would put its economic house in order.\n83.\tBut inflation in most of the developed economies continues to pose new hardships for us and we can hardly be expected to follow the present policy in the face of soaring inflation and currency fluctuations. Therefore, it is the developed countries which will have to shoulder the responsibility for any new adjustment of the price of oil.\n84.\tIn spite of the financial difficulties that we have recently experienced we have continued to lend our assistance to needy countries. Our bilateral and multilateral assistance has continued more or less at the same level as in previous years. In the past few years, Iran's foreign aid has amounted to nearly 6 per cent of its gross national product. Moreover, last year we proposed the setting up of a special fund by OPEC to grant assistance to the less privileged countries. The proposal materialized last January, though with a lesser contribution than had been originally proposed. I am, none the less, happy to note that the $300-million fund has now become operational.\n85.\tIt is worth noting that, while OPEC aid has increased in the past few years, official assistance by the developed countries has been progressively declining. It is only natural to expect that the industrial countries should make every possible effort to live up to the expectations in this respect.\n86.\tAs we go over such a disquieting balance-sheet we cannot fail to note that the yearning of the third world to catch up with the industrialized nations is in the long run a struggle for survival. What this awareness means in practical terms is that the failures of the past efforts should not discourage new initiatives. In this connexion, I wish to note the proposal made by Prime Minister Bhutto of Pakistan to hold a summit conference of all the developing countries.\n87.\tThe negotiations conducted within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, have been among the momentous diplomatic activities of the past year. The participation of 150 nations in this important international enterprise attests amply to the significance of the issues involved and the complexity of the task at hand in drafting a single comprehensive global convention.\n88.\tIt is our firm conviction that, in order to capitalize on the momentum already generated, efforts must continue to resolve contending claims on the basis of an equitable balance between the legitimate rights and interests of the international community as a whole. In this connexion, I find it pertinent to reiterate my Government's view that, while it is essential that transit through international waterways be ensured to facilitate international trade and communication, it is equally imperative that the legitimate rights and interests of the strait States be respected as well.\n89.\tI wish now to refer to an item which deserves particular attention: that of international terrorism, which continues to be a source of major concern for the world community.\n90.\tDuring the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth sessions of the General Assembly I had occasion to express my feeling of dismay and abhorrence at acts of violence involving threats to, or loss of, lives of innocent people. We have repeatedly reiterated our position calling for strong international action. Recent developments- which have pointed up the new ramifications and additional dimensions of this question strengthen our belief that, if unchecked, this problem threatens to throw the whole fabric of international order into disarray.\n91.\tThe rule of law must prevail in the interest of the entire international community, and every available resource must be mobilized to rid the world of this cruel malaise. It is in this spirit that we have supported action to combat all manifestations of terrorism including its underlying causes. It is in this same spirit that we now whole-heartedly welcome the initiative on the part of the Federal Republic of Germany in urging the preparation of a convention on international measures against the taking of hostages [A/31/242].\n92.\tAllow me to say in conclusion that, while we look upon the present gloomy panorama of world events, we should not lose our faith in the prospects of international harmony and co-operation. Let us therefore hope that our endeavors at this Assembly, as well as the intensive diplomatic efforts which are being exerted outside its framework, would bring us closer to the objectives we all pursue -those of universal peace, progress and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. I am confident that, as an eminent representative of a friendly Asian country, you will greatly contribute to the success of this session of the General Assembly, because of your wide experience and dedication to the United Nations.\n2.\tI should like also to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim, for his untiring efforts in the search for a more effective role for our Organization in its efforts to achieve international peace and harmony.\n3.\tAt the outset of almost every session of the General Assembly of the United Nations history registers new victories for the peoples of the- world-victories against colonialism and imperialism in all their manifestations. The admission of an increasing number of independent States to the United Nations is symbolic of the progressive changes that have taken place and are still taking place in the international arena since the establishment of the United Nations. We were greatly looking forward to the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and Angola as Members of our Organization this year, and this hope could have been realized had it not been for the United States vetoes, which were not based on any logical justification. On this occasion we should like to welcome Seychelles to the United Nations.\n4.\tThe struggle of peoples for political independence has given the United Nations its universal character by increasing its membership; but that struggle has, at the same time, brought about new challenges, because independence from the colonial yoke is not an end in itself. The aim for which millions have sacrificed their lives has always been and still remains human progress, human dignity and human freedom. The achievement of those noble objectives for which people are striving is hindered by some economic, social and even cultural problems and by the manifestations of neo-colonialism, which constitutes a real obstacle to genuine independence. The inequitable international economic relations and the undemocratic patterns of existing relations among States in which the sovereignty of the small nations is not respected and attempts are made to impose colonial values and cultures on those peoples are all clear signs of the dangers of neo-colonialism to the existing international situation.\n5 Despite certain developments here and there, and particularly in the Middle East, traditional colonialism is fading away and the system of apartheid is being violently shaken in southern Africa, while zionism has been internationally condemned as yet another racist and exclusivist ideology. Since the great victories achieved by the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos, international imperialism has resorted to a new system-one which assigns the role of combating national liberation movements and progressive forces to local sub-imperialist Powers, which have jointly undertaken the task of consolidating its influence and domination.\n6.\tIn our part of the world a national liberation movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, has been struggling for genuine independence and national sovereignty since 1965. Today, it is not only facing an expatriate army and a host of international mercenaries in the pay of the Sultan but also the military intervention of a neighbouring State, which is acting as a military gendarme in our area. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen strongly condemns all military intervention in Oman and reiterates its firm support for the just struggle of the Omani people against foreign intervention and for self-determination-a principle which we unequivocally uphold, whether it be in Oman or elsewhere in the world.\n\n7.\tIn the Middle East, too, the Palestine liberation Organization [PLO] is being subjected to an unprecedented military and political assault. While expressing our increasing concern over those regrettable developments, we strongly condemn all actions designed to stifle, weaken or circumvent the political and military integrity of the PLO-for the liquidation of the PLO would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian cause as a whole. Without a strong and viable PLO any solution to the Palestine question is simply inconceivable. The warm welcome shown by the Governments of the United States and Israel to the realization of the murderous plans to annihilate the Palestinians and the progressive Arab forces is living proof of the extent of the conspiracies that aim at the liquidation of the Palestinian people and their just cause together with that of the entire Arab liberation forces. History will record that the unfolding tragedy in Lebanon has only bred more violence and instability, not peace.\n8.\tIf the Palestine problem is the core of what is called the Middle East conflict, the PLO is the sole legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people. Without the satisfaction of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to establish an independent secular State in Palestine, peace will be elusive. But without the consolidation of the PLO genuine peace will be unattainable.\n9.\tThe recent Israeli plan for a peaceful solution of the conflict, proposed by its Foreign Minister, & indeed a mockery, when unremittingly new colonial settlements are established in the occupied territories and when the comer-stone of the Israeli policies is the increase of its immigrant population and the displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian people. Now, more than ever, it is clear that no solutions or resolutions can force Israel to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories; neither will the national rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood be implemented unless they are backed by force. For what has been taken by force can be retrieved only by force.\n10.\tIn southern Africa, the long and arduous struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania is beginning to bear fruit. The minority rebel regime in Rhodesia is staggering; Namibia is on the verge of drastic changes; and the apartheid regime in South Africa is profoundly shaken by popular revolt. No pacifying moves or delaying tactics can deprive the African peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania of the attainment of their final goals. We salute their struggle and call for their unreserved international support.\n11.\tAt long last, the African continent is ridding itself of the yoke of colonialism. In two areas, however, the process of decolonization should not be delayed. We call upon France to respect the national unity of the Comoros and to return the island of Mayotte. In East Africa, we look forward to the earliest independence of the territory of Djibouti, and call for the removal of all military bases or installations from that territory.\n12.\tIn Korea, we call for the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea, so that unity can be achieved by peaceful means and a unified Korea may be admitted to the United Nations.\n13.\tAnd in Cyprus, too, we call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and bases and for the full respect of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.\n14.\tIn the Latin American continent, we salute the Cuban revolution, which is proving to the world that a small nation can resist all sorts of imperialist pressure and economic blackmail, thanks to the determination of the Cuban people and its leadership. We fully support the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico for self-determination and national independence. We also support the just demands of the people of Panama to assert their sovereignty over the Panama Canal. In Chile, we strongly condemn the Fascist junta, which is not only suppressing the heroic Chilean people but is extending its terrorism beyond its borders.\n15.\tAt the outset of the fourth decade of the United Nations, we are faced with new problems and issues, such as the new international economic order, the law of the sea, and organized State terrorism on an international level. But some of the old problems still remain with us. Although the imminent danger of large-scale war has subsided, partly because of the policy of detente, the arms race and its qualitative destructive capacity is ever increasing. Almost simultaneously, the gap between the developed and the developing countries is widening, thus creating an unbalanced international growth, which in itself is not conducive to peace and stability. It is in this sense that the new international economic order is seen as yet another necessary condition for international security and harmony. For, without collective economic security, international peace is illusive. The new international economic order, whose guidelines were laid down by the sixth and seventh special sessions, is not only intended to redress the economic grievances of the developing nations; it is primarily an important condition for genuine international co-operation and peace.\n16.\tThe maintenance and promotion of international peace and security is a prerequisite for progress and prosperity. Permanent peace cannot be realized through a state of no war accompanied by temporary tranquility and stability; it can be realized only when it is established on principles of justice and equality. We notice with satisfaction the easing of tension in some parts of the world; yet the continuation of foreign occupation and imperialist aggression in other parts, the arms race and the economic imbalance pose a threat to international peace and security.\n17.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen supports all measures to curb the spiraling arms race. The declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] should guarantee the security, sovereignty and independence of both the coastal and land-locked States and the reduction of huge expenditures on arms by the States of the area, thus releasing those amounts for the purpose of their economic and social development. The security of the coastal and land-locked States in the Indian Ocean is not only endangered by the establishment of foreign aggressive military bases, such as the base in Diego Garcia, but also by the expansionist ambitions of certain States in the area through their direct military interventions in the affairs of the others.\n18.\tThe role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security is indispensable. That role can be enhanced only when the Charter of the United Nations, its principles and its purposes are fully respected and when its resolutions are implemented. \\\"Before we set to review the Charter, we should ask how its principles and purposes are being observed by Member States.\n19.\tDemocratic Yemen once again reaffirms its firm support for the United Nations and its commitment to its ideals and purposes.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to express to Mr. Amerasinghe, on behalf of the Government of the State of Kuwait, heartfelt congratulations on his election to his high office. I should like to commend the high status he enjoys in international circles as a diplomat with wide experience and an outstanding reputation. The confidence the General Assembly has reposed in him is not only a recognition of his exceptional qualities but also a token of the international community's appreciation of the role Sri Lanka has played in international affairs. Many of us returned recently from the Colombo Conference  where we were able to admire the indomitable spirit and determination which characterize the efforts of his countrymen to uphold the principles of equality and justice among all nations. I should like also to pay a tribute to his predecessor Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the able manner in which he presided over the deliberations cf the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n49.\tKuwait advocates respect for the principle of universality within the United Nations. We believe that any applicant that meets the requirements laid down in the Charter should be admitted without delay. In this respect, I would like to congratulate the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations and at the same time express the hope that Viet Nam will be admitted very soon to this Organization, as it possesses all the qualifications set out in the Charter.\n50.\tKuwait highly commends the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and to promote international peace and security. The Government of Kuwait welcomes the frequent visits of the Secretary- General to Member States to make direct contacts with their leaders and get some first-hand knowledge of their particular problems. Kuwait believes that the Secretary- General should take even greater initiatives to promote greater understanding and amity among nations. The limited powers assigned to him by the Charter have been largely expanded by the enabling resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The decisive factor, however, has been sincerity, dedication, and his constant efforts to mobilize States behind the principles enshrined in the Charter.\n51.\tMy Government would like particularly to commend the efforts of the United Nations to organize international assistance to provide relief in cases of natural disasters. Drought, floods and earthquakes have become a matter of frequent and regular occurrence in recent years; it must be a source of consolation to the innocent victims of such disasters to realize that they are not alone in their plight but can depend on the sympathy and material support of public-spirited people everywhere.\n52.\tInternational relations have been alternating between dialog and confrontation. A major dialog has been taking place for years within the United Nations over questions of decolonization and apartheid. Though the process of decolonization has made rapid strides there has been little success in inducing racist countries to abandon their outmoded policies of apartheid which are a crime against humanity. The near universality which the United Nations has achieved is in itself a tangible proof that the cause of freedom and independence has been largely successful. However, the violent events which agitate South Africa, Namibia, and Rhodesia are further proof that peoples cannot remain patient forever when the international community fails to take adequate measures to redress their grievances.\n\n53.\tThe recent developments in South Africa attest to the fact that the will of the oppressed people in South Africa to resist the tyranny of apartheid cannot be suppressed. The uprising of the majority of the people of South Africa reveals the bankruptcy of the notion of the supremacy of one race over another. The continuation of the racist policy of South Africa is not only an act that degrades human dignity but constitutes a threat to the stability and security of the African continent in particular and the world in general. Kuwait salutes the people of South Africa for their \nfearless resistance to the abhorrent policy of apartheid and their struggle for equality. The question of Namibia is a test of the ability of the United Nations to prevail over South Africa to withdraw its troops from Namibia and allow the Namibians to determine their own destiny without outside interference. The Government of Kuwait believes that mandatory sanctions against South Africa should be applied if that Government persists in its refusal to abide by the rule of law.\n54.\tThe situation in Rhodesia also is very critical and fraught with danger. The white minority still dominates the majority and resorts more often than ever to force to terrorize the indigenous majority. In spite of recent developments in Rhodesia, the final aim should be the assumption of power by the African majority.\n55.\tKuwait whole-heartedly supports the people of Zimbabwe in their struggle against discrimination and oppression. The only remedy to the explosive situation in the southern part of Africa is the acceptance of majority rule and all the consequences that flow from it; that is an essential prerequisite for the restoration of normal conditions in that Territory.\n56.\tThe fabric of international security is very weak. Small countries do not feel they can escape from the evil designs of more powerful countries. There is nothing to curb the temptation of powerful countries to advance national interests through the use of force or to use military power to secure national objectives. The irrationality of the situation is revealed by the discrepancy between the action of the General Assembly and the apathy of the Security Council. The resolutions of the General Assembly reflect the determination of the peoples of the majority of Member States to eradicate the remnants of colonialism, create a more favorable political climate and establish a sound relationship between the developing and developed countries. The work of the Security Council has on the other hand been characterized by inaction and omission. Draft resolutions are constantly revised under pressure from the big Powers so that the final texts are lacking any authority or effectiveness. Frequent and irresponsible exercise of the veto by the big Powers has consistently prevented the Security Council from exercising a healthy influence in times of international crisis. The conduct of the Security Council has created great anomalies within the United Nations and in the conduct of international relations. During the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly in 1974 the contrast between the wishes of the majority within the Assembly and the minority in the Council was very vividly shown when, after a proposal to expel South. Africa from the United Nations had been vetoed in the Council by some big Powers, a majority of the members of the Assembly upheld the rejection of the South African delegation's credentials and thus forced it to withdraw from the session.\n\n57.\tThe termination of the Mandate for South West Africa in 1966 was brought about by an Assembly resolution to establish a United Nations administration in Namibia [resolution 2145 (XXI)] which could not be implemented without action by the Security Council. Examples can be multiplied to show how the Security Council has not discharged the primary responsibility assigned to it by the\nCharter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Nothing can be more harmful to the United Nations than to have two of its main organs working at cross-purposes. The Security Council has failed in its duty to condemn defaulting States and to enforce compliance with the wishes of the international community.\n58.\tNo cause is dearer to the nations of the world than that of complete and general disarmament. It is a cause of great regret that disarmament negotiations are still being conducted in the form of a dialog between the two super-Powers. The negotiations being conducted during the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT} have so far failed to produce any real disarmament measures or impose any restrictions on the Soviet-American arms competition of a truly vital nature. They have merely transformed the arms race from one of quantity to one of quality. The major nuclear Powers have the capacity to destroy each other and the world. The small countries cannot be treated as curious bystanders. They have a vital stake in disarmament, which affects the well-being and survival of their peoples. Expenditures on armaments are diversions of resources that could better be employed in meeting social needs or coping with inflation.\n59.\tMy country has from the outset supported the call for convening a World Disarmament Conference as the proper forum in which the views of all nations, big or small, will be taken into consideration. The preliminary work for holding such a conference has shown that the prospects are not encouraging, at least in the near future. My Government would therefore endorse the proposal to convene a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament as being & more practical measure at the moment.\n60.\tWe have on many occasions welcomed detente between the two super-Powers. The least that detente can do is to preclude political competition among the super-Powers from spilling over into military conflict. However, detente has been hampered by the lack of progressive disarmament measures. Arms control can stabilize not only the military balance but also political relations which might otherwise be affected by uncertainties and suspicions concerning the intentions of the other side. Detente, however, as we have stated time and again, should in no way be used as a means of consolidating a big Power hegemony in international affairs or dividing the world into spheres of influence. The interests, needs, rights and aspirations of the developing and non-aligned countries are the pillars and mainstay of any international political order, and detente can only be seen as a necessary complement to this basic structure.\n\n61.\tIt is true that a halt in the arms race is a necessity in order to reduce the possibility of a military confrontation, but it is equally true that a halt in the arms race cannot be attained while uncertainty, .colonialism, denial of peoples' right to freedom and foreign occupation prevail. The world of today is replete with such cases. In the Middle East the situation remains as explosive as ever. Over nine years have elapsed since Israel launched its aggression against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The people of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza have been subjected to the most abominable form of foreign rule. I should like to take this opportunity to pay them a warm tribute for their glorious struggle against Israeli oppression, which captured the attention of the world. The Israeli authorities believe that through brute force they can breed in the Arab population of Palestine a feeling of fear, despair and submission. The Arab people in the occupied territories every day give fresh proof of their determination to resist oppression and to struggle for their civil and national rights. Like all other peoples they have a right to live in dignity and freedom. Israel has already built more than SO Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. Piles of resolutions of this Assembly as well as other organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council, are net only ignored by Israel but treated with contempt. Yet Israel still enjoys membership in this Organization, whose injunctions and decisions it flouts defiantly. Kuwait submits that this anomalous situation has to be corrected in order to uphold the tenets and the principles of the Charter. The world recognizes more than ever that peace in the Middle East will remain elusive and that all efforts to obtain it will founder so long as Israel persists in its refusal to withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied and as long as the people of Palestine suffer from the agony of displacement and the misery of the refugee camps.\n62.\tThere are two basic conditions for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories under occupation and the exercise by the people of Palestine of its inalienable right to self-determination and independence, including the establishment of a homeland in Palestine. Without the fulfillment of these two basic and fundamental principles the Middle East will remain a hotbed of war and bloodshed and all the attendant dangers of a possible nuclear conflagration will continue. Kuwait believes that the international community must face its responsibility by invoking the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter relating to sanctions, the severance of diplomatic relations and collective condemnation of countries that have persistently violated the Charter and defied its principles and norms.\n63.\tKuwait supports the efforts made for the achievement of a just and equitable solution of the crisis of Cyprus on the basis of equality between the Greek and the Turkish communities and believes that these efforts should aim at the preservation of the independence and the territorial integrity of Cyprus and the continuation of its non-aligned character.\n64.\tKuwait believes that the problem of Korea should be resolved by peaceful means through a constructive dialog between the parties concerned. Foreign troops should withdraw from the Korean peninsula and foreign Powers should desist from meddling in the domestic affairs of the people of Korea.\n65.\tKuwait supports the efforts made for the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations which proclaimed the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. It is imperative that the riparian States should refrain from granting military and naval facilities to foreign Powers. The establishment of military bases in some islands of the Indian Ocean is by no means conducive to the relaxation of tension and the elimination of rivalry between major Powers in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, we are of the view that such bases should be disbanded and that the major maritime users of this Ocean should respect its character as a zone of peace.\n66.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is an endeavor designed to prevent conflict or even wars from arising between States who rivalry is frequently based on unilateral declarations rather than on generally accepted norms of law. In the race for the control of the oceans and their vast resources there is a conflict between the ambitions of the State acting in its own self-interest and the common good. The main obstacles to the success of the Conference have so far been posed by the avarice of industrially advanced countries which wish to use their capital resources and technology to make a mockery of the common heritage of mankind and by some coastal States which wish to establish a creeping jurisdiction over increasingly larger parts of the oceans. Unilateral declarations by coastal States and unilateral action by industrially advanced countries to exploit the resources which belong to mankind as a whole can only lead to chaos and sow the seeds of further rivalries and conflicts. The only hope is in an international convention that will curb national ambitions and preserve the common heritage of mankind under a stable legal regime.\n67.\tThe North-South dialog which has been going on in some form or other for the past two decades is a supreme test for the pattern of new relations to be established between the developed and developing countries. Developing countries will remember all too vividly their countries' experience of foreign domination and exploitation. The conduct of some developed countries shows that some of them still harbor some nostalgia for the lost days of domination over palm and pine. The disparities in the standards of living, know-how, productive capacity and bargaining power between the two groups have not only been responsible for their political rift; they have constituted some of the most forceful impediments to an orderly utilization of world resources for the benefit of present as well as future generations. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Program of Action designed to implement the Declaration [resolution 3202 (S-VI)J are the outcome of a dialog that continued over two decades and was frequently marked by recrimination, disillusionment and a widening gap of hopes and expectations which finally culminated in the first collective attempt to establish a North-South partnership. The major pillars of the new order are sovereignty over natural resources, improved terms of trade for the raw-materials producers and increased transfer of resources to the developing countries. Once the Program of Action has been agreed upon, why should it be difficult to agree on measures for its implementation? There are no defects either in the new order or the Program of Action. It is the political will, among the developed countries that is so desperately lacking. The Secretary-General summed up the situation very neatly in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization in this manner:\n\\\"Much of the necessary apparatus already exists both within and outside the United Nations system. But the mere apparatus is not enough to move things forward. The sails must be filled with the wind of political will and the desire of constructive change.\\\" [A/31fl/Add.l, sect. XIV.J\n68.\tIn spite of its imperfections, the United Nations constitutes the moral conscience of mankind. Because it is not a world government, the United Nations cannot function properly without the co-operation of its individual members. If we are to build a world based on justice and moral Ian, we shall do well to heed the conscience of mankind as exhibited by the overwhelming majority of the States of this world. The United Nations represents the only realistic point of departure for the sustained effort of succeeding generations. The vocation of our age is to give man a mastery of his own lot comparable to that which he has attained over the world of nature. If we achieve this, the prospects before mankind are infinite. The crux of the problem is world order, which is the fundamental condition without which things more inherently good in themselves cannot be achieved or maintained. The Charter of the United Nations is the political constitution of mankind. There is still a wide gap between promise and performance, between the hopes and pledges of 1945 and the frustrations of 1976. We have yet to make a reality of our determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person, to establish conditions under which justice and respect for obligations of treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained and to promote social progress and better conditions of life in larger freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend through you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq, our warm congratulations to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, representing the Asian Group to which Iraq proudly belongs. What makes us all the more proud on this auspicious occasion is the continuing consolidation of the relations of friendship and amity between Sri Lanka and Iraq, particularly through their co-operation within the framework of the non-aligned movement.\n2.\tThe great success achieved by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Colombo a few weeks ago, from 16 to 19 August, served to bring into relief the commitment of the people and Government of Sri Lanka to the principles and abjectives of this movement, which Iraq regards as the corner-stone of its foreign policy.\n3.\tI am equally happy to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the positive contributions Mr. Amerasinghe has made to the various fields of activity of the United Nations. I have particularly in mind his chairmanship of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, and the Special -Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories. The efforts which the latter committee continues to make under his chairmanship in order to achieve the tasks entrusted to it by this Assembly, in spite of the intransigence and defiance it had encountered on the part of the Zionist entity, are but an indication of his dedication to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, his concern for the role of this Organization and his insistence on the necessity of ensuring the implementation of its resolutions. This record makes his election as President of this session a source of deep satisfaction and encouragement to us all.\n4.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for the efforts he has exerted to ensure the success of the work of this Organization.\n5.\tThe Iraqi delegation offers its most sincere congratulations to the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles, which has joined our ranks at this session to take its part in our common effort to build a new international order on a basis of peace, justice and prosperity. In extending my congratulations to Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations, I should like to assure it of Iraq's friendship and earnest desire to establish the closest relations with it in the interest of our two countries.\n6.\tI should also like to place on record here our condemnation of the stand taken by the United States of America against the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola to membership in our Organization when they are so well qualified to play a constructive role in the establishment of the new international order.\n7.\tToday, our world is going through ail historic period characterized by a unique phenomenon. Developments in the field of international relations over the past few years have proved beyond any shred of doubt that world problems in the last quarter of the twentieth century have grown so interlinked and intertwined that it is now impossible for any State or group of States, no matter how strong or capable, to solve these problems by themselves. It is imperative that they be dealt with by the international community as a whole. Those developments have also demonstrated the fact that the will of the peoples who have now entered the world stage constitutes a factor that cannot be ignored in the search for a solution to any international problem. By contrast, any attempt at settlement in which the will of peoples is disregarded would further intensify international tension and be inevitably doomed to failure.\n\n8.\tThe logic of these historic facts has begun to force itself increasingly upon world public opinion, so much so that the transition from the traditional order to the new international order has become an historical necessity on which the destiny of man and his very survival depend. It pains us, therefore, to see that there is yet a clear reluctance to face these facts and to take the preliminary steps to lay the foundations of the new international order, particularly \non the part of the States which used to hold undisputed sway over world affairs in the past. The attitude of these States is prompted by their erroneous belief that all the world needs is a few minor changes and, every now and then, the granting of a minimum of unavoidable concessions that have no effect on the essential structure of the old order and keep it under their domination.\n9.\tRevolutionary Iraq stands with those who believe, because of the logic of the events we are living through, that the forces of good throughout the world cannot but join together in order to lay down new, strong foundations for international relations and to prevail over those systems which seek only to stand in the way of history in a hopeless attempt to hinder its march.\n10.\tThe period since the thirtieth session of the General Assembly has witnessed the continuation and escalation of the conflict between the new and the old; between the forces that oppose colonialism, economic and racial domination and the receding remnants of those colonialists and racists and their allies; the conflict between the peoples who will accept no substitute for the full exercise of their inalienable political and economic rights and the unholy alliance formed by colonialism and racism, particularly in South Africa and Palestine, the heart of the Arab homeland, an alliance which desperately seeks to continue the usurpation of those rights through methods which have been condemned by contemporary international law; the conflict between the States advocating the necessity of establishing a new political, social and economic order based on the aspirations of the peoples to a real peace predicated on justice and universal prosperity on the one hand, and the forces tenaciously using all the means at their disposal in order to perpetuate their domination, exploitation and spheres of influence, on the other.\n11.\tAllow me to discuss a number of questions and developments as examples of our analysis of events taking place on the stage of international relations.\n12.\tA year ago, I had the honor of acquainting this esteemed Assembly from this rostrum with the broad outlines and the fundamental principles of the policy pursued by the Republic of Iraq regarding the question of Palestine which truly represents the most glaring example of racist colonization, the forcible usurpation of land and the uprooting of a whole people from its homeland. It also constitutes the substance of the conflict between the Arab nation and zionism and its ally, colonialism. I made particular reference to the persistent intransigence of the Zionist entity and its acts of defiance of the will of the international community, of the principles enshrined in the Charter and of the resolutions of the United Nations. I said at the time that the responsibility for the Palestine tragedy rests, primarily with this world Organization, and particularly with this Assembly, which in 1947 adopted the resolution on the partition of Palestine [resolution 181 (II)] in violation of the provisions of the Charter, thereby overstepping its mandate. In contravention of the principle of the rights of the peoples to self-determination, that resolution ignored the wishes of the Palestinian Arab people, who constituted then the overwhelming majority of the population of Palestine. While commending General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), which affirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine, including the right to self-determination, to independence, to sovereignty and to return to their homes from which they have been uprooted, I stated:\n\\\"The resolutions of the United Nations, despite their importance, are not sufficient in themselves as remedies for a problem which threatens international peace and security. Those resolutions must be accompanied by action which will guarantee their implementation\\\".!\n13.\tIf we review, in brief, the most important events in the Arab lands and within this Organization during the past year, we would find reasons for satisfaction and optimism, as well as others to confirm our regret and condemnation. The continuous uprising of the people of Palestine in their occupied land in the face of the barbaric acts of repression committed by the usurper Zionist entity, and their successful resistance against all the plots hatched inside and outside Palestine to contain and liquidate their revolution, have once more proven to the world the true mettle of the Arab people, their adherence to their full inalienable rights, and their readiness to make all the sacrifices necessary for the recovery of those rights.\n14.\tWith regard to the responsibility of theJJnited Nations for what happened and is happening in Palestine, we consider General Assembly resolutions 3376 (XXX) and 3379 (XXX) a decisive turning-point both in the way of dealing effectively with this tragedy and in the attitude of the General Assembly towards the Arab-Zionist conflict in general. In adopting the specific resolution by which the General Assembly determined that zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination, the international community, in spite of all the acts of defiance and the threats made by the forces of zionism and colonialism, found enough courage to recognize a simple truth which those forces have invariably sought to suppress. The overt steps taken this year by the racist regime in South Africa and the Zionist entity to reinforce their unholy alliance have perhaps put an end to all doubts as to the true nature of the entity now existing in Palestine.\n15.\tBy resolution 3376 (XXX), the General Assembly expressed agreement with what we said a year ago, namely, that the adoption of resolutions (190 of them by the end of last year) would not be of any help in compelling the Zionist entity, supported as it is by colonialism, to respect the will of the peoples represented here. Accordingly, the Assembly decided that specific and binding measures should be taken by principal organs of the United Nations for the Zionist entity to be forced to implement those resolutions.\n16.\tI would like, on this occasion, to pay a tribute to the seriousness and the objectivity with which the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, established by the General Assembly under the latter resolution, discharged the specific tasks entrusted to it. The recommendations submitted by this Committee in its first report to the Security Council particularly the measures and time-tables relating to the withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces from the Arab territories, and the program of implementation of the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to return to their homes and their right to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty, constitute an important development in the performance by the United Nations of its principal role in resolving the question of Palestine. Although the Committee saw to it that only the acceptable minimum of its recommendations were submitted to the Security Council, those recommendations ran against the American veto, and it is now up to our Assembly to shoulder its responsibility and deal with this abuse and with the wrongs and injustice it entails.\n17.\tZionist plans had and continue to have as their essential aim the elimination of the Arab nation by every possible device. Besides its ceaseless activities aimed at enlarging the area of the Zionist entity, Zionism strives to fragment the Arab world. What happened and is still happening in Lebanon is but a living example of this evil endeavor fostered and implemented by world Zionism which is responsible for the attempt at the dismemberment and total destruction of Lebanon, employing for this purpose all possible ways and means.\n18.\tAs a progressive Arab country, Iraq cannot remain silent about the plots which are being carried out in Lebanon with a view to destroying or weakening the Palestinian resistance, as well as the national movement of the Lebanese people. Iraq will, therefore, remain steadfast in its struggle to prevent this outcome and to preserve the unity and independence of Lebanon against any external interference in its internal affairs.\n19.\tIraq and Palestine are two integral parts of the Arab nation, which, more than any other nation, has suffered and continues to suffer from fragmentation, aggression, occupation and exploitation. Hence our premise that the question of Palestine is the crux of the matter and that the liberation of the Arab land from Zionist occupation and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights are among the most important prerequisites for the achievement of Arab unity. Iraq stresses once again its belief in the unity of the Arab nation, in the continuation of the struggle and the employment of all the resources at its disposal to achieve the desired union and to create an Arab society which would play an active role in building the greater human society to which we all aspire.\n20.\tThe Republic of Iraq considers the non-aligned movement one of the corner-stones of its foreign policy. It upholds the principles of this movement and attaches the highest importance to its effective ability to promote security and peace in the world. Iraq has been anxious to contribute to all efforts aimed at implanting those principles firmly in international relations ever since the inception of the movement, when it focused its attention on the achievement of freedom and economic and political independence for all peoples, and sought to spare those peoples the pitfalls of military alliances and the axes of polarization. The movement has thus become a potent means by which the non-aligned States can cope with international events and currents. The non-aligned movement has been able to surmount many of the obstacles standing in the way of its development. It has consequently made a fruitful contribution to the achievement of full independence for many peoples of the third world and to sparing them the ravages of war by steering them away from blocs and axes and the dangers of military bases. This activity was accompanied by the growth and expansion of the movement. It has thus become able to discharge its responsibilities ever more effectively and to play distinctive roles in charting international policy, disproving, in the process, the allegation that it is no more than a transient international grouping, and at the same time, asserting itself as an embodiment of the will of the peoples and their aspiration to a free, independent life within the framework of justice and peace.\n21.\tIt gives the Republic of Iraq genuine pleasure to be in the forefront of those States which have contributed to this turning-point in international relations. I also have the pleasure to pay a tribute to the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Colombo, which was the crowning achievement of the goodwill of the States of the movement. The success of the Conference as demonstrated by its numerous resolutions and its final declaration [see AJ31I197], which we support and uphold in the political and economic spheres, is the finest embodiment of the clear vision and the resolve of the leaders, peoples and Governments of the member States. Their aspirations coincide with the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations; and the endeavor and activities of the States members of the movement serve to complement the endeavor and activities of this Organization.\n22.\tIraq stresses, once again, that it welcomes the policy of international detente which has replaced the policies of confrontation and cold war. However, we would like to emphasize at the same time that we want such detente to be universal, permanent and based on justice and respect for the rights of the peoples to independence, sovereignty and progress. It should not be based on polarization or the apportionment of spheres of influence, nor do we want it to be achieved at the expense of small and weak States. In this respect, we fully support the contents of the final declaration issued by the Colombo Conference.\n23.\tAmong the foremost problems threatening world peace and security, indeed the very destiny of man, is the unremitting continuation of the arms race in the world. How painful it is that the annual costs of armaments have risen to $300 billion from $200 billion only a few years ago, and that his should happen at a time when nuclear disarmament, in particular, has become one of the most urgent requirements of the new international order to which we have already referred. The diversion of those fabulous sums from the achievement of the lofty goal of. an equitable socio-economic development represents in the most striking and cruel sense the vast disparity between the requirements of human society and the actual policies of States. It confirms what we have already stated, namely, that what our world needs is more effective measures, on the regional and global levels, to reduce the arms race, to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to confine the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes only. Although we welcome the new agreement concluded between the\nSoviet Union and the United States of America,  we would like to stress anew the necessity of taking effective steps to put an end to all underground tests. We would also like to reiterate our support for resolutions and projects aiming at the establishment of nuclear-free zones. We also attach special importance to the necessity of the accession of all States, without exception, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].\n24.\tThe developments that have taken place in southern Africa during the last year constitute, in our view, the beginning of the final phase of the bitter struggle between the forces of liberation and progress and the racist settler colonialism supported by the imperialist Powers, in the forefront of which is the United States of America. The victory achieved by the people of Angola in attaining their full independence and sovereignty, in spite of all the conspiracies hatched against them, including overt military aggression, was the last phase of the liberation of the peoples of the Portuguese colonies and the attainment of their independence. They have thus reinforced the front of the forces struggling for the establishment of a new international order. The effective measures taken by the Revolutionary Government of Mozambique to tighten the grip of the embargo imposed upon the racist minority regime in Rhodesia, despite the economic sacrifices involved, and the mounting African and international support for the liberation movements of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania, augur well for the final elimination of colonialism and racism from the African continent in the near future.\n25.\tI would like to reaffirm, here, the solidarity of the Republic of Iraq with the African liberation movements, and its full support of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] in its battle with colonialism and Zionism.\n26.\tAttempts are being made in Latin America by which certain great Powers seek to create such regimes as would toe their line. They seek to ensure, against the will of the peoples concerned and their interests, the existence of regimes that are aligned with them, that act in collusion with them and silently accept the exploitation which has been gnawing at the economies of the countries involved. Those who refuse to toe the line are exposed to constant attempts to undermine their regimes by all possible means. We wish to express Iraq's firm support for the progressive trends and the liberation movements in Latin America. We particularly salute the struggle of the Chilean people and the firm stand it has taken against dictatorship.\n27.\tIraq attaches the highest importance to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. It would like to express its concern over the continued imperialist presence therein, and over the indifference to the Lusaka Declaration,  to the numerous calls issued subsequently by the conferences of non-aligned\nStates and to the repeated resolutions adopted by this Assembly to this effect. The continued existence of the influence of the imperialist Powers in the Indian Ocean and the fact that some of them are reinforcing their presence, strengthening their military bases and building new ones, constitutes a direct threat to the security of the littoral and hinterland States and contributes to the intensification of international tension. We stress once again the necessity of supporting the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, particularly with regard to expediting the convening of the conference called for by the Assembly in resolution 3259 A (XXIX), in which the littoral and hinterland States and the major maritime users would be represented. We also stress the necessity of guaranteeing for all States the freedom of commercial navigation, passage, fishing and scientific research in the high seas of the Indian Ocean.\n28.\tIn this connexion, Iraq supports and adheres to the resolution on the Indian Ocean adopted by the Colombo Conference [see A)31/197, annex IV, resolution II]. It goes without saying that the Indian Ocean is of more immediate concern to the States of the non-aligned movement, since they constitute the overwhelming majority of its littoral and hinterland States.\n29.\tFollowing the victory over imperialism and its local agents achieved by the people of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Democratic Kampuchea, we would like to commend the constructive steps taken by those countries towards consolidating their independence and rebuilding their societies and economies which had been subjected to devastation by colonialist aggression. We particularly welcome the steps taken towards the reunification of the two parts of Viet Nam. As to Korea, we regret to see the mounting tension there and the fact that imperialism is reinforcing its military presence and bases in South Korea, a matter which increases the danger of the outbreak of a new war and constitutes a real threat to world peace. We stress once again the necessity of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea in order to enable the Korean people to determine their future without foreign interference, as well as to reunify their territory.\n30.\tEver since the developing countries attained their political independence, they have been striving to overcome the problems of under-development bequeathed to them by the long periods of exploitation, and to achieve decent growth rates that would enable them to develop their economies in such a way as to narrow the gap separating them from the developed countries. These strenuous efforts, however, have invariably run against the realities of the present inequitable international economic order, which is working against the interests of the developing States.\n31.\tIraq has actively participated, along with other developing States, in the various international economic conferences held with a view to achieving equitable international economic relations and creating a new international economic order which would enable the developing countries to deal on equal terms with the developed countries and help them to realize their legitimate aspirations to raise the living standards of their peoples and rid them of exploitation. It was for this purpose that the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly were convened. Iraq, at the time, was among the States voicing optimism over the outcome of those two sessions.\n32.\tI pointed out at the conclusion of my statement at the seventh special session on 10 September 1975,  that Iraq believes that a radical solution to international economic problems lies in rectifying the balance of forces in economic relations, and that the merit of positive proposals and constructive plans to this effect should be assessed case by case, in an objective manner, taking into consideration only the benefits that each proposal or plan could bring to the cause of economic justice among States and of their sovereignty over their economic affairs. Such assessment should be made without regard to the source of the proposal and provided that it should be implemented in good faith and at no political cost.\n33.\tNow, however, when our delegation reviews the outcome of one whole year of negotiations, we are left with a deep sense of disappointment. I referred at the beginning of my statement to the conflict between the forces seeking to create a new international order and the forces holding on to the old order. This conflict manifests itself most glaringly in international economic relations in various fields and on various levels. There is no doubt that the main reason for the regrettable stagnation besetting such meetings is the negative attitude of certain capitalist industrial States and their intransigence vis-a-vis the legitimate demands of the developing nations. After this Assembly had, at its sixth and seventh special sessions, set the broad outlines of the new international economic order and drawn up the plan of action for its implementation, we find that those States stand against all measures aiming at laying the foundations of the new order. This leads us to the conclusion that those States were not serious when they submitted their proposals; their conduct points to the lack of the necessary political will to implement the proposals that they themselves made.\n34.\tThis deplorable attitude has led to the difficulties encountered by the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation in which Iraq is an active participant. The Conference has almost reached a deadlock owing to the intransigence of certain capitalist industrial countries towards the acceptance of the just demands of the developing countries, particularly in matters relating to the preservation of the purchasing power of their export revenues and to the debts which weigh heavily on them and form a serious obstacle in the way of their economic progress.\n35.\tThe situation was repeated at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held at Nairobi from 5 to 31 May 1976, to which the Group of 77 had attached great hopes, especially since they submitted to the Conference an integrated program which had been prepared by the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group at Manila.  The results of the\nConference have been disappointing and have fallen short of the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries. In addition, some of the capitalist industrial States have begun to take certain negative attitudes, such as their recourse to tactics designed to disrupt the unity of the developing States and to sow differences among them, with a view to diverting them from their main objectives. However, we are deeply satisfied and proud of the fact that all those attempts have met with dismal failure, thanks to the solidarity of the Group of 77, which came out of the Conference all the more unified and with a stronger faith in the justice of its cause. It is even more convinced than ever of the necessity of expediting the establishment of the new economic order. The Group of 77 has refused to enter into side conflicts that might divert it from the main objective. It has even succeeded in establishing a practical program for economic co-operation among its members during the recent Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Mexico City, and the meetings which preceded it [see AlC.2131/7].\n36.\tI am happy to say that during the Colombo Conference, Iraq called the attention of the developing countries to the necessity of establishing specific organization for the producers of raw materials along the lines of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Iraqi delegation to this Conference contributed an economic study on this question, in the firm belief that the producers of raw materials among the developing countries should close their ranks to counter world monopolies and to secure equitable prices for their products, which is their one and only means of increasing their capacity to import what they need for the development of their countries.\n37.\tWe believe that the attitude of certain capitalist industrial States, led by the United States of America, and their repeated attempts to choose the way of confrontation, or of making promises which they fail to carry out rather than to enter into fruitful negotiations and a positive dialogue, indicate an egotistical outlook in analyzing the future requirements of international economic relations. On the other hand, we would like to express our appreciation and satisfaction to some of the industrial States in western Europe for their relatively positive attitudes and for their growing understanding of the justice of the urgent demands of the developing countries. We appreciate in particular the sympathy shown by these States towards the developing countries during the meetings of the fourth session of UNCTAD and the sessions of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n38.\tBefore concluding any statement, I would like to refer to the attitude of Iraq towards the United Nations. Persistent efforts are being made to weaken the role of international organizations and to belittle their importance. This Organization, in particular, has been a target of such efforts. Voices have risen condemning the new majority and the just resolutions it adopts. Yet we heard no such voices during the initial period of the life of the United Nations when the Western States, under the leadership of the United States of America, held complete dominance over the Organization and could muster the required majority at will. It is only regrettable to see a number of States, particularly the United States of America, increasingly shaking the confidence of the international community in the ability of this Organization to' achieve the desired objectives. The use of the veto in the Security Council has made it impossible for the Council to discharge the functions entrusted to it under the Charter. The best example of this is the continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa, and the persistence of the Zionist entity in its defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations and the international community by refusing to withdraw from Jerusalem and the other occupied Arab territories.\n39.\tThe exercise of the right of veto or the threat of its use against a resolution aimed at achieving the aims and purposes of the United Nations runs counter to the principle of good faith in the implementation of international instruments and should, therefore, be Considered as an illegal abuse of that right. It is bound to weaken confidence in the ability of the Security Council to safeguard the territorial integrity of States, thus compelling such States to revert to the traditional methods which have brought down on mankind the scourge of two world wars.\n40.\tWe believe, above all, in the democratic character of international relations. We believe in the application of such democracy within the organs and agencies of the United Nations as well as in their programs. We advocate the strengthening and consolidation of this world Organization on a sound democratic basis, because we know that the future society which we desire for our peoples will not be realized, nor will it survive, unless there is a strong international organization that can ensure the administration and development of the new order with the active participation of all its members in its work. Strengthening the United Nations and enabling it to play a central role in the community to which we aspire is a noble objective; we should all diligently pursue its attainment.\n"

        "file_text": "As our Organization enters the last quarter of this century, in its thirty-first year of activity, it will at least benefit from the enlightened and experienced direction of President Amerasinghe at a critical point in international affairs. I know the President is averse to compliments, but I have no doubt that his direction will stamp its mark on our work this year, and for this we need to congratulate ourselves as much as we congratulate him. His diplomatic pragmatism, perhaps more than ever before, is essential in our work if the United Nations is to maintain its credibility which is under attack from the cynics of the contemporary world. He has already established some precedents in the way he has expeditiously disposed of normally lengthy controversy. My delegation will encourage and help him to create even more, and to identify, that common harmony which exists in our discordant voices in the Assembly so as to maximize the quality of our output at this session, and so perhaps to start a new trend in the history of our Organization.\n170.\tThe delegation of Malta wishes to place on record its appreciation of the dedicated and admirable way in which the thirtieth session of the General Assembly was led by Prime Minister Gaston Thorn of Luxembourg.\n171.\tA sad event reminded us only recently of our frailty and our universality. We joined in paying a tribute to a teacher, leader and statesman who majestically bestrode the international stage and left behind him a lasting contribution to the course of history. Chairman Mao Tsetung's voice is now silent, but his works will continue to inspire mankind for generations to Come.\n172.\tOne of the major international events of the year under review was the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Colombo. I will be dealing with some of the specific results of that Conference later in this statement, but I would not wish to miss this opportunity to express to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mrs, Bandaranaike, the gratitude and compli\u00acments of my Government for the cordial hospitality and excellent organization extended to the ever-growing community of non-aligned countries, including the delegation of Malta.\n173.\tMrs. Bandaranaike's moving and detailed statement [11th meeting] explaining the perspectives behind the decisions of the non-aligned summit should facilitate our work. Taking up so many of the items debated at the United Nations, countries coming from all regions and with different preoccupations have already ironed out divergencies to make common recommendations [A/31 /197]. The difficulties in arriving at such recommendations needs no stressing in this hall, and hence the recommendations cannot be lightly dismissed, for the reasons so eloquently advanced in Mrs. Bandaranaike's statement.\n174.\tThe hectic pace of conference diplomacy rarely affords us the opportunity to collect our thoughts; however, every major organization needs to look introspectively to measure its performance at regular intervals. It is particularly appropriate for the United Nations to do so, since it represents nothing less than the aspirations of the international community in a period of change taking place with disconcerting rapidity. But our review should not be a mere ritual in which we pay a token tribute to the principles that inspire us. We have to look critically at our past performance and to see where we are going, and whether we cannot improve.\n175.\tAmong the substantive issues, the most pressing problems, and the least encouraging results, are in the field of disarmament. Few will deny that our past approaches on this question call for reassessment. The shocking totals of wasted resources and destructive potential have been repeated so often that our senses are numbed. A dangerous fatalism seems to be creeping in. Technological advances out pace the static negotiating process; the strategist overwhelmed the negotiator; fear prevails over reason. The finest rhetoric cannot obscure the grim realities. The super-Powers seem to be mesmerized, unable to move away from the brink of the precipice. We find ourselves much worse off than we were when disarmament became a priority item. It is enough to mention that the conditions under which these admittedly complex negotiations are being held are such as to be considered unsatisfactory by two of the existing nuclear-weapon States. There appears to be no positive future in our present endeavors unless we broaden our approach and come to grips with the heart of the matter, rather than discuss numbers and the mega-tonnage of missiles. This might well be our last chance before a flash-point is reached.\n176.\tMalta in the past devoted much effort in trying to advance constructive approaches for promoting progress in global disarmament. For instance, my delegation suggested to the members of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament that it might be advisable to consider the implications of the potential use of lasers for military purposes. The suggestion met with the usual disdainful delaying tactics and skepticism of the super-Powers. Yesterday it was reported that for the first time a laser beam was used experimentally to shoot down aircraft. Further implications are under consideration. I have no doubt the eventual weapons system will initially be labeled \\\"bargaining chip\\\". I have no doubt it will be deployed, developed and further refined. What I do doubt is whether, under present approaches, this and similar deadly products will become showpieces in a military museum when the proposed convention for the non-use of force sees the light of day in the age of detente.\n177.\tWe remain attached to the goal of global disarmament, but we feel that the evident lack of progress indicates that we should concentrate more on pragmatic action, on concerted political approaches, in different regions of the world, designed to remove mistrust and eliminate pockets of tension and so gradually to reduce the perceived need for military confrontation by opposing forces.\n178.\tMalta's geographic situation in the center of the Mediterranean makes us particularly susceptible to the prevailing influences in our region. Our history is a microcosm of the major events that left an indelible mark in molding the region. We have taken a hard look at the past, and we are trying to penetrate the future. We have seen in the past the fratricidal division that gradually led to supremacy in the Euro-Mediterranean region passing into the hands of outside Powers. The majority of the countries in our region were drawn into the orbit of one or the other of the two dominant military blocs. Our most recent experience has been a number of smaller conflicts and the persistence of tense situations, together with a massive accumulation of armaments, which carry with them the danger of escalation into a world-wide conflict. I need hardly recall that a recent episode led to a world-wide nuclear alert. The super-Powers, engrossed in their unrelenting competition, seem to be too preoccupied to innovate, and are suspicious of change. Unfortunately, the best we can expect from them in future is more of the same, perhaps in more limited doses, or else one-sided initiatives which are foredoomed to failure.\n179.\tThe present situation has been described starkly, as recently as 19 September, by the weekly German Tribune, which saw Europe as a pawn and bugbear in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the two super-Powers. The relations between the two super-Powers fluctuate unpredictably; a decade of peaceful coexistence has not lessened military confrontation, and the Euro-Mediterranean countries are caught in this vicious circle. But this is neither the role nor the destiny of the region. Its restless genius chafes in this situation. The imagination of youth can neither understand its necessity nor condone its continuance. The politics of perpetual rivalry are obsolete. Movements for regional unity are gaining strength and are reaching out for one another. It is time for change; it is time to broaden our horizons. Change must come from within the region, and in a concerted manner, so as to provide a credible alternative.\n180.\tAgainst this background, Malta has been a foremost advocate of, and is striving actively to bring about, this change, and to stress new dimensions in the politics of our region-based on convergence of interests in the pursuit of a cause which all recognize as desirable: the cause of expanding regional co-operation, with economic progress, stability and peace as the objective. At every opportunity, against initial hesitation, we have made strenuous efforts to promote understanding between the countries on both shores of the Mediterranean. We are convinced that our region can have no lasting peace and can make no worth-while social and economic progress without first affirming its own identity, its own integrity and its real independence of the super-Powers. The potential in skill, technology and human and natural resources is immense and mutually complementary, and it can be merged into a powerful combination for peace and prosperity.\n181.\tA concerted approach has been lacking in the past, but a start has been made. In Malta's immediate subregion\nthe natural affinities between us and neighboring countries have been placed on a more enduring basis. Other countries are showing interest in a collective approach, and our new role in serving as a bridge for peace and progress among the peoples of the Mediterranean is gaining momentum.\n182. The Conference on Security and co-operation in Europe was a unique opportunity to focus attention on the problems of the region, of which the Mediterranean is an essential component. The broad outlines of the potential for Euro-Mediterranean co-operation, supported by historical and statistical evidence, was the clarion call contributed by Malta to that Conference. We wanted to strengthen the muted dialog initiated in such a way as to increase mutual confidence and promote contacts at all levels and in all fields. Despite initial doubts and, at times, outright opposi\u00action, we persisted in our approach. The eventual result was the adoption of the Mediterranean declaration as part of the Helsinki Final Act. The declaration spelled out the intentions of the participating States \\\"of maintaining and amplifying the contacts and dialogue as initiated by the [Conference} with the non-participating Mediterranean States to include all the States of the Mediterranean, with the purpose of contributing to peace, reducing armed forces in the region, strengthening security, lessening tensions in the region, and widening the scope of co-operation, ends in which all share a common interest, as well as with the purpose of defining further common objectives\\\".9\n183. The results of the Conference were hailed in this hall as a triumph of common sense and reason. That observation would apply if all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act are put into practice. Malta naturally attaches particular importance to the provisions of the Mediterranean document. While we appreciate that time is required for its full implementation, we also recognize that it is incumbent on us to promote action. We shall therefore seek common action with our friends to monitor implementation and ensure progress. In one sector, Mediterranean States have already acted in concert. In order to protect the Mediterranean from pollution, Mediterranean States have accepted a regional convention and two protocols, and have established a regional center in Malta to combat oil-pollution effectively. But much more remains to be done, and the scope for co-operation is unlimited.\n184. This stirring of inquietude, this yearning for change, is as natural as it is inevitable. It is also in the interests of international peace and security. It would be universally beneficial to harness the rich potential of a spontaneous, outward-looking, free association of Euro-Mediterranean States acting independently of and in friendly relations with the two super-Pawers and making its own contribution to world economic advancement and political stability. The benefits would be truly incalculable. It would at the very least eliminate the possibility of direct confrontation between the super-Powers in the most sensitive area of the world; it would relieve the super-Powers of burdens they may have felt it necessary to assume in the past, and thus perhaps enable them to make a more significant peaceful contribution in the transfer of technology and skill to developing countries. The possibility of a more lasting and genuine rapprochement between die super-Powers would also be greatly enhanced.\n185.\tWe are pleased that at Colombo the non-aligned countries recognized this potential and therefore took up the matter. The Conference \\\"urged the States Parties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to proceed without delay to the full implementation of the Mediterranean document of the Helsinki Final Act\\\" [see A/311197, annex 1, para. 26 (b)]. It also called on the non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean to \\\"act in concert in accordance with the decisions and resolutions of the Non-Aligned Conferences, in order to remove all obstacles that prevent the conversion of the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and co-operation for the benefit of the countries concerned and in the interests of international peace and security\\\" [ibid].\n186.\tMalta does not overlook or underestimate these obstacles. It is becoming increasingly urgent to tackle them collectively with vision and with vigor. In the Mediterranean, the lack of progress in Cyprus has maintained it as one area of insecurity. Malta has lent its support-at Commonwealth meetings, at the Council of Europe and at non-aligned conferences-to each and every effort that was made in an attempt to promote progress. Passion and resentment apparently have not yet sufficiently subsided. We stress once again that there are legitimate and peaceful means whereby the protection of human rights can be guaranteed. It is now a time for healing; division runs contrary to the interests of all the parties concerned and of the region; and the preoccupations of the two communities can be safeguarded in a peaceful solution which guarantees the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. The resolutions adopted by this Assembly and by the Security Council provide the basis for implementation, and procedural devices should not retard their implementation.\n187.\tA second enduring area of tension in the region, and one of the greatest single contributors to the turbulence in the Mediterranean, is the uneasy situation in the Middle East, now further inflamed by disturbances in Lebanon. The involvement of the major Powers in this issue, aggravated by the concentration of their naval forces in the Mediterranean is such that, despite their best intentions, the military and political confrontation has never decreased and remains a threat to international peace. The time has come, and is in fact long overdue, for a pragmatic and just approach which will lead to comprehensive progress. Here again my delegation has made its contribution in an attempt to identify the root-cause of the trouble, and to support a program of action to remedy the situation in an equitable manner, by peaceful means, in progressive stages, and at all times under the auspices of the United Nations. We recognize the right of all States in the region to exist within safe and recognized boundaries, internationally guaranteed if necessary. But we also realize that, against all obstacles, the Palestinian people are rightfully determined to change their present plight. The humiliation and suffering of the disinherited Palestinians can no longer remain on our conscience. We have to recognize their legitimate rights as a people to a homeland; only then can peace reign in that historic region.\n188.\tFurther away from Malta's immediate vicinity-but none the lets urgent after years of neglect-comes the anguished cry of people unjustly oppressed by racist minorities. We have as consistently condemned apartheid as we have maintained support for the principle of majority rule. We note with appreciation that finally a political will to change the intolerable situation has apparently found expression. We will await with interest the reaction of the people most directly concerned. Nevertheless, we express the fervent hope that the required progress will be brought about without bloodshed and destruction, and that the horrors of Sharpeville and Soweto will not be repeated.\n189.\tThe people of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea have secured peace after their great sacrifices. It is regrettable, however, to note that, in the same area, a divided country, Korea, which yearns for peaceful unification and freedom from foreign interference, still has its objectives frustrated; attempts continue to be made to perpetuate the division of the country, and this to put further obstacles in the path of national unity. We reaffirm our position: the reunification of Korea should be achieved independently by the Korean people themselves, free from outside interference, by peaceful and democratic means.\n190.\tWhat I have stated above relates to some of the major political problems tfrat this Organization has inherited from the past and for which solutions elude us because of big-Power involvement, complicated by lavish arms supplies to client States.\n191.\tYet we cannot but stress that where enlightened cooperation prevails, progress is recorded. Therefore, we express double satisfaction that one more country has joined the community of independent nations, whose membership in this Organization we were happy to co- sponsor. I extend a warm welcome to the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles and congratulations to the United Kingdom. I also express the hope that others waiting in the wings will not be denied, by arbitrary decisions, their proper place in the family of nations.\n192.\tAs our President is well aware, since he shared the labour with us almost from the day the sea-bed item was introduced by the delegation of Malta in 1967,\\\" the far-reaching proposals which we then suggested are slowly but surely reaching a stage of maturity, and we now cannot delay much longer the crucial moment of decision: deliberately, and in full knowledge of its magnificent potential, we have to agree on the rules of conduct which will govern the activities of States in the marine environment including its subsoil beyond national jurisdiction.\n193.\tThe fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended without .the conclusions to which we have been aspiring for a number of year. It is understandable, in the circumstances, to give way to a mood of pessimism or, worse still, to resort to unilateral action. But we are embarked upon a Herculean effort from which there can be no turning back. The Conference must end successfully, since the alternative to agreement is too bleak to contemplate. It is with this faith in the work of the Conference, and in accordance with our foreign-policy objectives of becoming a center for harmony among nations that my Government has offered Malta as the site of the proposed international sea-bed authority when it is established by the Conference. This would be a fitting climax to our efforts, and a living symbol to the people of Malta, and to the world, that the idealism of a small country is seeking to promote international co-operation in a newly-emergent area of human endeavor was eventually crowned with success for the benefit of all, in accordance with the concept of the common heritage of mankind, to which my delegation gave birth and sustenance.\n194.\tThe same universalist vision inspires my country as we consider the economic field. The existing international economic imbalance has increasingly become a subject of major concern both within the United Nations system and outside it. The problems concerning economic relations among States have now properly assumed their primary role in our discussions. Unfortunately, however, an appreciation of the hazards historically associated with the failure of established politico-economic forces to respect the legitimate demands of newly-emergent forces has not yet become a consciously recognized characteristic of the debate on the establishment of a new international economic order.\n195.\tThe difficulties that industrially advanced societies are experiencing in promoting efficiency, in reducing unemployment and inflation, and in the acquisition of raw materials are not, and cannot be, disassociated from the insistence of developing countries on a sustained but accelerated growth in their lagging development processes. There is an interdependence in these modern phenomena that requires global solutions and mutual understanding.\n196.\tBut this understanding, this deeper awareness, is still lacking in a majority of developed countries, and perhaps even in some developing countries. A different order of progress is required both in the dialog between rich and poor and in the co-operative undertakings among the nations of the third world.\n197.\tThe dialog between rich and poor has suffered serious setbacks in the past 12 months. The minute achievement of the fourth session of UNCTAD cannot erase the realization that most of the initial expectations aroused by the seventh special session of the General Assembly have not been fulfilled. The stalemate at the Paris dialog is a further indication of dwindling hopes. On other fronts the results have been similarly disappointing. I will not give further details except to mention that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System has, ironically, almost transfigured itself into an appendage to the plethora of committees and sub-committees it was originally set up to restructure.\n198.\tOf course, if we strain the imagination, we can claim to identify microscopic signs of progress. We can indeed we must-derive some hope that the present dark clouds of hesitation are only temporarily obscuring the dawn of enlightenment and progress. This escapist tendency of squeezing optimism out of recalcitrant facts is, however, in itself an indication of the lack of deeper awareness of the nature of the problem confronting us. The needs of the present cannot be satisfied by vague consensus texts; they cannot be advanced by half-baked schemes arbitrarily injected in the middle of difficult negotiations; they cannot be suppressed by the imposition of negative attitudes, nor can they be deflected by the deployment of delaying or divisive tactics.\n199.\tThe necessary progress can be achieved only when all rations approach the dialog well prepared, when attitudes become more open and sincere, and when the issues debated are more specific.\n200.\tThe needs and demands of a majority of mankind have today converged on a common platform, based on justice and equity, which has certainly no parallel in the past. Hasty criticism of the iron-clad demands of the so-called automatic majority is therefore simply a further indication of a lack of awareness of the problem. The majority exists; it will continue its clamor for its legitimate claims to be satisfied. Any attempt to stem the tide of time or to diffuse its impact will only compound difficulties and prolong appalling inequity.\n201.\tApart from the dialog between rich and poor we recognize the parallel need for a greater effort at collective self-reliance among the developing countries themselves. We have before us eloquent appeals by several leading statesmen from developing countries, including the most recent by the Prime Minister of Pakistan [see AI31I208], that call on the third world to develop a personality of its own, to devise a strategy for the future, and to mold appropriate institutions, to support this strategy. Malta supports this call for action. We have applied it in the past and will continue to do so. We have entered into agreements with several other developing countries on joint ventures in light industry and even in more sophisticated enterprises such as ship-building and civil aviation. We share the feeling that the latent energies which exist in the developing world, which have already manifested themselves on various fronts, should not be allowed to dissipate in uncoordinated and haphazard initiatives.\n202,. Malta's support for the concepts and objectives of the new international economic order is unqualified. As a small island economy totally lacking in conventional natural resources, we uphold objectives which ensure respect for the rights of all States while acknowledging the special needs of particular categories of disadvantaged economies. For us the new economic order does not mean a simple reshuffle among the oligarchy of the powerful, but a new and durable structure based on justice and mutual respect.\n203. As we face one conference after another, and the pressure of all that needs to be done on the meager resources we have available to deal with them, our spirits are bound to falter. Yet Malta, among the smallest countries in the world, has never flinched in the face of adversity. In the last few years we have done much in our region which constituted a veritable transformation of our former roles. We also believe firmly in the potential of this Organization; We know we can rely on the enthusiastic service of our distinguished Secretary-General and his staff, who are dedicated to promoting the ideals of this Organization. We seek only to move forward in peace. It is a simple, demanding and compelling task. It is also the common ideal of all peoples. We can have no other choice but to redouble our efforts with vision and determination, avoiding the errors of the past and searching for new avenues to peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its thirty-first session, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you in the name of the Yemen Arab Republic delegation. I wish you success in carrying out the deliberations of this current session in order to achieve positive results which will enhance the aspirations of the peoples throughout the world for peace, integration and close co-operation in various fields, free from exploitation, control and domination.\n87.\tAs I congratulate you on your election to this high office, allow me also to congratulate, through you, the Government of Sri Lanka and its friendly people, with whom and with whose national leadership we have strong links within the framework of the principles and goals of the non-aligned movement. This movement has contributed and still contributes to the drawing of a framework for an independent policy for the third-world countries, aiming at eliminating the obstacles which hinder the growth, development and co-operation of their peoples, and seeking to narrow the gap between industrialized and developing countries.\n88.\tMr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, your predecessor as President of the last session, has conducted with great tact the debates of this Assembly.\n89.\tAllow me also to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the valued efforts which the Secretary-General, Mr, Kurt Waldheim, is undertaking for enhancing the importance of this Organization, and for his constant dedication for ensuring the safety and freedom of all peoples. His courageous role in seeking a solution for the questions of Cyprus, the Middle East, Africa and other regions in our agitated and often changing world made a very good impact, for it emphasized the importance of this world Organization as a necessary and indispensable tool for directing the international community toward finding just solutions for problems arising from aggression, intimidation and foreign occupation, as well as putting an end to the domination and exploitation of poor States by rich States. A person characterized by wisdom, insight and experience such as Mr. Waldheim deserves the co-operation and support of all Member States during the coming period of activities which is marked by complexity and challenge.\n90.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic welcomes the Republic of Seychelles to the membership of our international Organization emphasizing the universality of this world body. The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic would also like to address a sincere appeal to some of the permanent members of the Security Council to avoid misusing their veto power to deny other nations their right to join, and become full Members of, the Organization, thereby enabling them to contribute to the crystallization of the aspirations of their peoples and to participate within the international family towards finding solutions for all the problems which are the responsibility of the United Nation* as a free forum for the peoples of the world, without any discrimination or special considerations.\n91.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic expresses its deep concern for the obstruction of the implementation of United Nations resolutions and recommendations dealing with serious and essential questions relating to. the new international economic order. Hits order is the result of the efforts of the overwhelming majority of nations throughout the world and an expression of their determination to initiate and formulate resolutions which will bring about a fundamental change designed to reform and rectify the relations prevailing in the world of economics, trade and the international monetary order in such a way as to ensure equal opportunities and balance in these areas.\n92.\tThe General Assembly at its sixth special session adopted resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) on the Declaration and the Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. At its twenty-ninth session, the Assembly adopted resolution 3281 (XXIX), which laid down the foundations for the implementation of the new international economic order. The Assembly, by its resolution 2626 (XXV), had also approved the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, which was confirmed during the seventh special session by its resolution 3362 (S-VII) stressing the importance of cooperation between the industrialized and the developing countries in the fields of trade, industry, science, technology and all other economic fields since this co-operation would contribute to the consolidation of peace and security amongst the nations of the world. We hope that the efforts being made to reassess this Strategy will be successful.\n93.\tThe resolution of the Fifth Conference of Head* of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo last August [see A/311197; annex IV] emphasized the belief of non-aligned States in the principles and goals of the United Nations. They also emphasized that the adherence of States, whether big or small, to the principles of the Charter, persistence in implementing all of its provisions, as well as harmony and coexistence between different systems are the only way to achieve a better life for mankind as a whole. These principles are embodied in the political and economic declarations of the Conference of non-aligned States in Colombo [ibid., annexes I and II], as well as the Action Program for Economic Co-operation [ibid., annex III]. The documents of this historical Conference should be seriously and fully taken into consideration during the proceedings of this session.\n94.\tWhat mainly concerns the human community today is the constant concentration, particularly on the part of the big Powers, on increasing the production of lethal weapons which threaten the world with destruction and annihilation. The annual expenditure of over $300 billion exclusively on armament is conclusive evidence of the proliferation of nuclear and destructive weapons. Today, more than ever before, the United Nations is called upon to make an effective and constructive contribution to reaching a universal agreement to put an end to the arms race and to achieving complete elimination of the existing arms in order to protect mankind-which has already suffered tragically in the past two world wars-from the scourge of a third war which could very well annihilate our planet.\n95.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic stresses once again the need for detente. The Helsinki Declaration  should include a larger geopolitical area so that the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean would become peace zones, free from the presence of foreign bases and naval fleets. The Declaration should go beyond its present scope in order to cover wider regions in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n96.\tThere are also other questions which are equally important relating to international trade, the restructuring of its foundations, the reorganization of the world economic order, and the balancing of the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods. The rich and developed States should take swift and effective initiatives to prevent further complication of the international situation, being guided in this by the resolutions of the United Nations, the specialized agencies and conferences of an international character, especially that of the Fifth Conference of non-aligned States, whose political and economic resolutions are characterized by precision of statement and objectivity. The Conference enhanced the Charter of the United Nations and restored the confidence of the majority of nations throughout the world in the effectiveness of this Organization at present and in the future, and the belief of the nations all over the world in the role of the United Nations to prevent mankind from self-destruction.\n97.\tThe peoples of the Middle East, cannot be sure of their security and peace as long as the racist Government of Israel refuses to withdraw its forces from the occupied Arab territories and to restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Israel today practices sea piracy in the territorial waters of other countries, and takes advantage of the American presidential elections as a propitious political occasion for exercising its well-known hobby of political blackmail, pushing the big Powers to their ruin in order to serve its continuous and illegitimate ambitions and to conceal the strengthening of its disgraceful, racist, and aggressive policy.\n98.\tThe peoples of Palestine, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania struggle daily for the achievement of their freedom, self-determination and independence. The indications of their near victory are certain and reassuring. The people of Palestine -whose land has been occupied for almost 30 years by Zionism and who have been rendered refugees- are struggling today to defend their freedom and dignity, their right to survive, to live in peace on their own land and to regain their national rights. This people, who are represented in their just struggle by the Palestine Liberation Organization, will continue their struggling march, and will overcome all the obstacles which hinder their struggle against Israel and the racist Zionist regime, until they achieve victory.\n99.\tThe odious acts of aggression committed every day by the forces of the Zionist occupation against innocent men, women and children in the occupied West Bank, the consolidation of Zionist settlements, the desecration of holy Islamic shrines, the confiscation of lands, the changing of the historical and demographic character of the area in order to sanction Israel's illegitimate presence in Palestine and to perpetuate its occupation of the Arab territories all this cannot escape the notice of the international community and cannot continue without international condemnation and disapproval and the adoption of urgent and practical measures in order to eliminate these actions.\n100.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic is also deeply concerned with the situation prevailing under the two racist regimes in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, whose Governments daily commit repulsive crimes against African citizens. My Government joins the international community in strongly condemning these crimes.\n101.\tResolutions have been repeatedly adopted; however, the misuse of the veto power has prevented the implementation of sanctions against Israel and South Africa. This has led a large number of Member States to call for fundamental amendments to the Charter of the United Nations.\n102.\tThe United Nations, therefore, is called upon today to seriously consider effective measures to solve the Palestine question, to achieve the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories, and to implement its resolutions in such a way as to ensure the recognition of the national rights of the Palestine people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of their national authority in Palestine.\n103.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic also reaffirms the right of the Arab States to permanent control over their natural resources in the occupied territories.\n104.\tThe situation confronting the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania is a source of increasing concern. The United Nations, through its specialized committees, especially the Fourth Committee, which deals with decolonization, should take into consideration and supervise all political and constitutional initiatives envisaged for putting an end to injustice, terror, racial discrimination, apartheid and the white minority regimes, so as to enable the African majority to rule its own territory and people, in closer co-operation with the African Member States and with OAU, and to avoid the dangers arising from foreign intervention, which often have negative effects on the future of the peoples of the African continent.\n105.\tMr. President, your continuous efforts have contributed to a large extent to the success achieved so far by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In order to ensure that nations adhere to and respect the provisions of this new law, they should be compatible with the principle of equal rights of States and should emphasize the absolute sovereignty of coastal States over straits within their territorial waters. All efforts made in this context should be devoted to the interests and well-being of the peoples of the world, without prejudice to the sovereign rights of States. This was the position of the Yemen delegation which participated in all meetings and conferences on this subject and which presented more than one proposal as a compromise solution for problems which were discussed and on which the participating delegations had different viewpoints. In these proposals we emphasized the need to adhere to the principle of innocent passage in straits and to oblige war vessels and military navigation to be committed to the principle of prior authorization or notification. We hope that the coming sixth session, which is scheduled for May 1977, will provide greater opportunities leading to the formulation of a convention governing the law of the sea in order to avoid the threat of unilateral action on the part of the big Powers, which would create confrontations and conflicts and therefore lead to instability in international relations.\n106.\tSevere natural disasters have befallen the People's Republic of China and its noble people, who have shown an extraordinary capacity for perseverance and endurance in times of distress. The Chinese people have reaffirmed their self-reliance in rebuilding within a short period of time what earthquakes had destroyed.\n107.\tThe peoples of the third world received with deep sorrow the news of the death of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Tsetung. The world has lost a wise leader who accomplished miracles for his people. He was a source of inspiration and an ideal for a large number of world leaders, especially among the countries of the third world, who followed his example and his steps.\n108.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic shares the grief of the Chinese people and from this international forum pays homage to the late leader Mao Tsetung and wishes the friendly Chinese people continuous prosperity and progress.\n109.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic devotes special attention to the Korean question. It stresses the need for the unification of the Korean people by peaceful means and for the creation of conditions conducive to the continuation of a dialog between the Korean parties concerned.\n\n109. The Yemen Arab Republic also reaffirms its position on the question of Cyprus, which calls for providing the two communities-the Turkish and the Greek-with equal opportunities so as to maintain the unity, independence and non-alignment of the island.\n111.\tWith respect to our region, we support the right of the French Somaliland Djibouti to full and speedy independence, and we welcome the steps taken by the French Government to grant the people of the Territory their independence and right to self-determination.\n112.\tMy country's delegation has heard the statement made at the 22nd meeting by Israel's Foreign Minister, which was delivered in a Nazi and racist spirit, thus confirming the soundness of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session in which it condemned Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination [resolution 3379 (XXX)].\n113.\tThe soul of a new Hitler has been resurrected in this hall to distort facts and to mislead the international community by providing it with incorrect and false information. Israel remains-as its Foreign Minister wants it to be-the most stable, developed and peaceful State, while everything surrounding it does not even deserve to exist. Israel, which has parachuted arms and military materials into Lebanon and contrived to open tobacco factories employing 20 Lebanese, while itself suffering from mass unemployment, clearly revealed through the statement of its Foreign Minister its real goal-namely, the refusal to establish a secular Palestinian State in which Moslem, Christian and Jewish Arabs would live in peace side by side. This part of the Israeli Minister's address only confirms, without any further effort, that the sole, political exploiter of the Lebanese war tragedy and the red source of death for both Lebanese and Palestinians is Israel.\n114.\tThe human touches contained in the Israeli delegation's address before this Assembly are but an actual reaction to its guilt complex -the guilt Israel feels in continuing to occupy the territories of others, displacing an entire nation and its people from its land and home, desecrating the holy places in occupied Palestine, insulting the countries of the third world, and failing in its concealed attempts to justify its rejection of all the resolutions of this Organization. Finally, Israel repeats its song of peace in the Middle East: peace outside the framework of the United Nations, outside the framework of the Security Council and outside the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. All these facts confirm that the soul of a new Hitler has been resurrected. The international community is surprised to see that those who for a long time have practiced financial and political blackmail against European people are the new image of the odious Nazi soul, and have not revealed themselves as such against the other peoples in the Middle East.\n115.\tI shall not dwell long on this subject. Israel's slogan towards the Arab people remains the same: distortion of facts, concealment of its aggressive and expansionist intentions and exaggeration of its need for money, peace and protection. Israel remains isolated from the international community. No one shares its isolation except the racist regimes in Africa and other isolated groups in a few European countries and the United States, which have not yet fully understood all the relevant facts. As every day \npasses, however, the light of truth becomes brighter, and Europe and the United States will become free of the influence of intellectual terrorism which has become a deep-rooted tradition of the Israeli policy. The European and American public are discovering the heavy losses sustained by their national interests as a result of the unjust support given to the Israeli point of view. This is the only comment of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic on the Israeli delegation's statement at this juncture.\n116.\tFinally, the Yemen Arab Republic, while reviewing all the problems which afflict the world, modestly tries to exceed its limited potential in order to make the goal of co-operation and understanding among the States of the Arabian peninsula and the Gulf a good model to be followed in international relations so as to ensure the progress of the peoples of the area and the constructive and purposeful contribution by its Governments in all aspects which would contribute to peace, development and equal co-operation between all nations of the world. Moreover, we in the Yemen Arab Republic seek to resolve many of the regional conflicts quietly and with a sense of responsibility including even those conflicts which constitute deliberate or unintentional violation of our territorial waters and territory. By this behavior we affirm our full adherence to, and respect for, the United Nations Charter and international law in. finding appropriate solutions through dialog and bilateral and cordial contacts. We hope that this world Organization will remain strong, firm, effective and able to face its heavy responsibilities without faltering or hesitating in the case of all challenges until peace prevails throughout the world and until tension and the specters of war and conflicts disappear completely from the international arena so as to achieve welfare and stability for all peoples. We sincerely believe that the thirty-first session of the General Assembly will pave the way for a more equitable, stable and secure future for all peoples throughout the world. It is the responsibility of all of us in this Assembly to assure the highest degree of success to the proceedings of the current session.\n"

        "file_text": "168.\tIn the name of the President, people and Government of the Somali Democratic Republic and on behalf of the Somali delegation to the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, I wish to express our deep sorrow over the sudden departure of that great leader, Chairman Mao Tsetung, and our sincere condolences to the great people of China over this immense loss. Words fail me to pay a tribute to the late Chairman Mao, one of the greatest thinkers and statesmen of all times. He was not only a great leader and revolutionary who led the most populous nation in the world through an epoch-making revolution, the historical significance of which transcends the borders of his nation but he was equally the source of inspiration to all freedom-loving peoples in the human quest for liberty, equality and the betterment of mankind.\n169.\tSir, I wish to begin my statement in the general debate of this Assembly by expressing to you, on behalf of my Government and delegation, our wannest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. I am particularly happy to see in the Chair a great son of Sri Lanka, a country with which Somalia has maintained relations of brotherhood from time immemorial. You are indeed uniquely qualified for this high office through your wide experience in international affairs, so ably demonstrated in your competent direction of the complex deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, as well as in the Co-ordinating Bureau of Non-Aligned Countries, which made possible the successful conclusion of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held in your beautiful capital in August this year. Your knowledge, personal qualities, experience and diplomatic skills constitute a guarantee of the successful conclusion of the work of this Assembly.\n170.\tMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate most sincerely Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy\nof Luxembourg, on the skillful manner in which he presided over the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n171.\tI also wish to express well-deserved appreciation of the tireless efforts of our Secretary-General Mr. Kurt Waldheim in the effective discharge of the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him. I hope that he will agree to continue his mission for the benefit of our Organization and of all mankind.\n172.\tThe welcome which Somalia extends to Seychelles on its accession to membership in the United Nations is particularly heartfelt since we are also saluting the indomitable courage and determination of the people of Seychelles, whose victory constitutes another landmark in the oppressed peoples' struggle against colonialism and imperialism.\n173.\tThe welcome to the young Republic of Seychelles calls to mind the denial of the application for admission to the world body of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. In this connexion, we express our disappointment and concern that the arbitrary use of the veto power by a permanent member of the Security Council has once again been brought to bear on international affairs -in this case, on the admission of Angola and Viet Nam to the United Nations. My Government reaffirms its total support for the admission of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and expresses its respect and admiration for the heroic peoples of Angola and Viet Nam, which, under the most trying conditions, have scored the greatest of victories: that of winning independence. The majority of the Member States have already extended their full recognition to those two States, and the same majority, we are confident, will continue their work until such time as Angola and Viet Nam take their rightful places in our Organization.\n174.\tIn the 30 years of this Organization's existence, international stability and peace and security among peoples of the world have continued to be threatened by acts of aggression, oppression, injustices and glaring inequalities between rich and poor. As long as the subjugation and exploitation of man by man is allowed to exist, the peace and tranquility of the world will remain in danger, and a situation of permanent conflict and confrontation will reign.\n175.\tThe primary objective of the United Nations, in conformity with its Charter, is to promote all efforts likely to advance the well-being of man and to serve the cause of international peace and security. This Organization would, no doubt, have achieved more successes in this regard than it has so far if all nations, and particularly the more powerful ones, had given practical application to the lofty principles which they so vociferously espouse in inter-national forums.\n176.\tIt follows that such conduct will continue to contribute to the oppression, the inequalities and injustices of the past unless the Members of this Organization face up to their responsibilities under the Charter by agreeing on a workable and satisfactory solution to the ills of this world, which threaten mankind with untold suffering in all spheres.\n177.\tAt this juncture, I wish to address myself to some of the most salient international problems which call for firm and resolute action by the General Assembly at this session. I am confident that they will receive the utmost attention and will not be relegated to future sessions, thus keeping the bomb ticking, to go off at any moment.\n178.\tFirst and foremost among such pressing issues are the dangers posed today by apartheid and Zionism. In spite of the expressed concern of the United Nations and its condemnation of the unholy alliance between apartheid and Zionism, whose links are historically and ideologically deep-rooted, the two Governments have now established in formal agreements complete collaboration in all fields and, most significant to us, in the political and military spheres, as clearly shown in the report of the Special Committee against Apartheid [AI31/22]. Their main political objective is to create division among the African countries and between them and the Arab countries, to further their misleading propaganda, on the one hand, and to bind together the South African minority racist regime and Israel as common strategic concerns of the imperialist Powers, on the other. Buttressed by those Powers, South Africa and. Israel militarily provided one another with additional sources of arms supplies and technological know-how, as well as with access to classified information on strategies and tactics. Thus, unabatedly, the regimes of these two abhorrent identical ideologies based on racism are brutalizing the peoples under their rule with utter disregard of basic human rights and are treating world public opinion and the Charter of the United Nations with the utmost contempt. Apartheid and Zionism, like their forerunners- Nazism and fascism-carry with them the seeds of destruction.\n179.\tI am confident that no one who is familiar with the unfolding of the southern African situation will deny the fact that the peoples of Africa have given a fair chance to the minority racist regimes in those territories to hand over power to the majority by peaceful means. Unfortunately, however, there are no signs that the South African Government is prepared to make the necessary changes. On the contrary, Mr. Vorster and his cohorts have publicly reaffirmed their stand that apartheid is fundamental and immutable. Thus, the commitment before the Security Council in October 1974 that the Pretoria regime would move away from racial discrimination -to use the words of the Special Committee's report-soon proved to be a fraud. The wanton daily killings of innocent and defenseless populations and the arrest of African leaders are glaring evidence of the poverty of ideas and the desperation of the regime and its determination to continue its inhuman policy which will in the final analysis lead to more bloodshed and catastrophic results of the greatest magnitude.\n180.\tToday we witness the unfolding of the systematic suppression and violation of the most fundamental rights of man in a troubled political situation characterized by an orgy of bloodshed and wanton destruction of human life by the Pretoria regime; and, as the inevitable harvest is being reaped, the massacres at Soweto and elsewhere in South Africa have been added to Sharpeville as another tragedy in the abominable history of apartheid which challenges the conscience of all civilized and peace-loving nations.\n181.\tIn the face of the recrudescent challenge of Pretoria and in the light of the present crisis, those countries which found it convenient to acquiesce in and to accept South African excuses for apartheid can no longer do so and maintain their credibility or self-respect.\n182.\tAs the brutal suppression of legitimate protests against unbearable conditions goes on, and as the indiscriminate slaughter of children and young people continues, the world community is brought face to face once again with its responsibility towards the oppressed people of South Africa-a responsibility long assumed by the United Nations because of the exceptional inhumanity of apartheid, but more positively expressed at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly in resolution 3411 C (XXX) and Security Council resolution 392 (1976).\n183.\tWith regard to Namibia, recent developments ind the revelations in the Security Council debate on the question sufficiently indicate that a truly dangerous situation prevails in that Territory. The continued illegal occupation of that Territory by the South African racist regime, the introduction of inhuman and debasing practices of apartheid, \\\"bantustanization,\\\" the militarization of the Territory and its use as a springboard for aggression against neighboring independent African countries continue to create a veritably explosive situation which calls for immediate and effective United Nations action.\n184.\tThe pseudo-constitutional conference conducted at the instigation and under the close supervision of the racist regime is an exercise in deception and constitutes a manifestation of the height of cynicism and political immorality. A valid constitutional conference in Namibia could take place only under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the South West Africa People's Organization, the only authentic representative of the people of Namibia, as recognized by all world organizations. The convening of such a conference naturally presupposes the withdrawal of all racist occupation forces from the Territory.\n185.\tThe responsibility of the United Nations is clear and defined in this respect. Since the General Assembly and the Security Council have already rejected the South African Government's mockery, there is no alternative for the Security Council but to apply the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter to end the racist occupation of Namibia and the aggression against its people.\n186.\tIn Zimbabwe, as in South Africa and in Namibia, the intransigence of a racist minority has caused the failure of peaceful negotiations and has led to the violence and bloodshed of armed struggle. The inhuman tyranny, the suppression and oppression perpetrated by the Smith regime against the people of Zimbabwe has now been coupled with that regime's aggression against the People's Republic of Mozambique and, indeed, leaves the world community in no doubt about the scope of this conflict and about its dangerous dimensions and extension to all neighboring countries. The People's Republic of Mozambique deserves the highest commendation of this world body, as well as the unqualified support of the entire world community, for its noble commitment to the cause of liberation in most effectively applying sanctions against a regime that can best be described as a monument of inhumanity bereft of any moral or ethical restraint. The front-line States, long torn by the liberation wars and already burdened with the task of national reconstruction, are making tremendous sacrifices to support the peoples still under the yoke of colonial domination in the southern part of Africa. Their laudable determination to act in accordance with United Nations resolutions, albeit at great national sacrifice, is in sharp contrast with the materialistic and unprincipled attitude of many developed countries.\n187.\tThe chances of success of the current diplomatic activities of Britain and the United States, which we consider to be a belated attempt, will, in the last analysis, depend on their measure of acceptability to the people of the Territory. The legitimate call for majority rule in Zimbabwe is the central issue of the problem. We would emphasize that, unless and until such time as the current diplomatic moves are proved to be a genuine search for the attainment of such an objective, and not mere maneuvers for political and other ends, the fighting forces of Zimbabwe will continue their armed struggle and will remain vigilant.\n188.\tI believe that if these proposals are motivated by sincerity, good will and the faithful application of United Nations principles, there should be no moratorium on the independence of the people of Zimbabwe. Majority rule, with the concomitant democratic representation allowing for transfer of power to the true representatives of the people, should be granted now.\n189.\tI shall conclude by observing that not one of the dangerous developments in southern Africa has crept unseen and unheralded upon the international community. The key to all the southern African problems has always been the apartheid policies of the South African regime, and indeed it cannot be denied that on all counts South Africa poses a threat to peace and security. The United Nations has the right and the duty to take action under Chapter VII of the Charter because of the uniquely inhuman nature of apartheid; because of the illegal occupation of Namibia; because of the economic and military support given to the Smith regime in spite of mandatory sanctions; and because South Africa's racist policies increasingly involve aggression against neighboring States. In this regard, the deliberate arming of Pretoria, including the supply of nuclear capacity by France, is indeed reprehensible and should be stopped forthwith. My Government strongly believes that the total isolation of that regime should be made mandatory.\n190.\tThe Middle East situation, like that of South Africa, illustrates the historical truth that large-scale injustices, left without redress for long periods of time, lead inevitably to violent conflict. The Palestinian people were uprooted and\n, displaced by Zionist aggression 29 years ago and since that time have been denied the right to return to their homes and property. This festering injustice has been the cause of four wars and chronic unrest in the Middle East. The tragedy of the current strife in Lebanon is yet another\neffect of the expulsion of the Palestinian people into neighboring territories and the expropriation of their lands and possessions.\n191.\tNo one denies today-and this includes even Israel's closest friends and supporters -that peace and stability can be established in the Middle East only when the rights of the Palestinians have been restored and when the Arab territory, occupied by Israel in contravention of inter-national law, has been duly returned. In dealing with the Middle East question the United Nations has never lost sight of these central facts. My Government strongly supports the continuing efforts of the world Organization to promote the return of peace to that troubled area. In particular, we support the most recent efforts on behalf of the Palestinian people.\n192.\tAlthough the full implications of the Palestinian problem were not dealt with until recent times, the United Nations has never ceased to call for the return of the Palestinians to their homes and for compensation for their property. Indeed, as will be recalled, this was the condition of Israel's acceptance as a Member State of the United Nations. Israel's intransigence on this question over the years has brought into prominence the unjust denial to the Palestinian people not only of their homes but also of their inalienable right to national independence. The constant effect of the Zionist presence in the Middle East has been aggression and expansion aimed at eliminating the indigenous Palestinians and substituting the Jewish people.\n193.\tThe establishment of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People by the General Assembly at its thirtieth session was a logical development in view of the resolve of the United Nations that justice be done to the Palestinian people and that the Middle East problem not be allowed to stagnate. The Committee emphasized certain principles which the world community can ignore only if it has abandoned the search for peace in the Middle East. In the view of my Government, the most important of these principles are the following: that the inalienable right to self-determination can be implemented only if Israel evacuates Palestinian territory occupied by force and in contravention of the United Nations Charter; that the establishment of an independent Palestinian State is a prerequisite to peace in the Middle East; that the Palestine Liberation Organization, the recognized guardian of the rights of the Palestinians, is entitled to participate as a principal party in all efforts to resolve the Middle East problem; and that the Palestinian rights must be achieved in the context of a comprehensive settlement which would include Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab lands occupied in June 1967.\n194.\tParticular attention must be given to the question of Jerusalem, a city which is as sacred to Islam and to Christianity as it is to Judaism. Israel cannot be allowed to continue with impunity its unilateral and illegal annexation of the old city and more particularly the obliteration of its character.\n195.\tThe same is true of the creeping annexation of occupied Arab territory through the deliberate and large- scale establishment of Jewish settlements, which constitute a flagrant violation of international conventions to which\nIsrael is a party. These principles, already approved by the United Nations, need to be given practical application. My Government welcomes, as a useful basis for action, the program of implementation prepared by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. In this regard, we believe that the Security Council has the inescapable duty to take action, and we urge it to do so, using all the powers conferred upon it by the United Nations Charter, especially under Chapter VII. We believe also that the Security Council will be obliged to reconsider the validity of Israel's membership in the United Nations if the Zionists persist, as they have done for nearly 30 years, in refusing to implement United Nations resolutions.\n196.\tThe situation in French Somaliland has continued to command the attention and interest of the international community ever since the French Government's declaration of 31 December 1975 expressing the intention of granting independence to the people of that Territory. While the declaration of intent by the French Government to decolonize that Territory is a welcome development, the long-drawn-out and intricate processes leading to independence unfortunately indicate the lack of concrete progress being made by the colonial Power in the decolonization of the Territory.\n197.\tThe desire of the people of the Territory for independence and freedom has been established beyond any doubt by an OAU fact-finding mission which recently visited the Territory and which has ascertained this to be a fact. Questioning the desire of the people of the Territory for independence at this stage can only, therefore, be construed as an effort to mislead public opinion and thereby retard the fulfillment of the just aspirations of the people of French Somaliland.\n198.\tThe granting of speedy and unconditional independence to the Territory as called for by the United Nations, OAU and the non-aligned countries is a responsibility that must be discharged. In resolution 3480 (XXX) the General Assembly at the thirtieth session called on France to grant immediate and unconditional independence and create the necessary conditions favoring the acceleration of the independence process.\n199.\tThe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, at its thirteenth session, made a similar call, while deploring the maneuvers hindering the independence of the Territory and urged France \\\"to proceed as soon-as possible to settle the problems of nationality and the reform of electoral lists with a view to organizing the referendum before the end of 1916\\\" [see A/31/196, annex, resolution 480 (XXVII)].\n200.\tAt this juncture, 1 wish to spell out in no uncertain terms that it has always been the policy of the Somali Government to assist the people of that Territory to achieve their unconditional independence. Somalia has repeatedly made clear, and reiterates once again, that we respect the wishes of the people and their independence and sovereignty as masters of their destiny, and we call upon all others to desist from any act or behavior that might directly or indirectly interfere with, jeopardize, condition, compromise or impose limitations of any nature whatsoever on such hard-won independence. Somalia has always stood for such ideals and supported the just aspirations of that people and stands opposed to any move, on whatever grounds, that might adversely affect the sovereignty of the people of French Somaliland.\n201.\tIn view of the legitimate preoccupations of the people of the Territory and the doubt of the international community at large about the true intentions of the colonial Power, it is most opportune for the General Assembly at the current session to address itself to the ways and means of obtaining a firm commitment from the French Government on the exact date of independence for the Territory and the assurance that such independence will be attained under fully democratic conditions.\n202.\tAnother unfortunate example of French colonialism is the illegal occupation of the Comorian island of Mayotte by France. That action constitutes not only a flagrant aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Comoros but also threatens the independence and security of other African and Asian States in the region. My Government is confident that the General Assembly will call on France to withdraw immediately from Mayotte, which is an integral part of the Republic of the Comoros, and to respect the sovereignty of that State.\n203.\tMany other regional problems are potential threats to international peace because of the involvement of outside forces and interests. This is particularly true of the Korean situation, which continues to be one of the major threats to international peace and security. The basic requirement for defusing that dangerous situation is the achievement of national reunification by the Korean people. That noble goal cannot be reached so long as the powerful infusion of arms to the South continues. My Government will continue to give strong support to those efforts within the United Nations that are aimed at promoting the conditions necessary for peace and stability u Korea. We are convinced that there can be no end to tension and to the threat of regional and wider conflicts without the withdrawal of the foreign forces stationed in the South under the false pretense that they constitute a United Nations presence.\n204.\tOn the question of Cyprus, my Government expresses its appreciation for the peace efforts of the Secretary-General. We believe in the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of that Republic, where all Cypriots should live in peace and with the full enjoyment of equality and freedom.\n205.\tFinally, as the decolonization process comes within measurable distance of completion, it is disturbing to note that there are still Territories which still suffer colonial and imperialist domination. In pursuance of the noble principles of the Charter and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the United Nations must endeavor to bring about the end of colonial domination.\n206.\tThe lack of progress towards general and complete disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament, continues to overshadow the constructive efforts of peoples everywhere to create a better world. My Government once again expresses its disappointment that a total test-ban treaty has not been concluded; that the balance of terror maintained by nuclear missile systems continues with ever wider potential for world destruction; and that conventions for the prohibition of chemical, bacteriological and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as conventional weapons, have not yet been adopted.\n207.\tA new danger to world peace and security lies in the desire of a number of countries to acquire plants for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel for the production of atomic bombs. An even greater danger is posed by the eagerness of certain States-notably France-to supply such plants. This development threatens to undermine the efforts of the United Nations to contain the spread of nuclear weapons through the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. New guidelines and enforceable regulations governing the supply of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes are obviously imperative. This is a matter which calls urgently for the attention of the world community. The constancy accelerating arms race in weapons of all kinds frustrates both the aims of the Disarmament Decade and the efforts to achieve a new international economic order. The diversion to development purposes of a fraction of the billions now being spent on aims would be an investment in peace and progress, rather than in destruction and bloodshed.\n208.\tIn view of the aforementioned, my Government is concerned over the deterioration of the disarmament situation. In this connexion, we reiterate our strong support for the proposal of the non-aligned States.\n209.\tFaced with the grim reality of militarism and power struggles, the non-aligned and peace-loving States must attempt to devise arrangements for their own peace and security. The establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Latin America and proposals for similar zones in Africa, the Middle East, the Asian subcontinent and East Asia constitute a progressive trend in keeping with the aspirations of peoples for peace and security.\n210.\tThe implementation of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] would be another significant contribution to disarmament goals and to international stability. Somalia, a non-aligned State in the Indian Ocean, reaffirms its strong support for the principles and objectives of the Declaration and calls for the elimination from the area of all foreign military bases.\n211.\tThe principles of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean have been endangered by the expansion of the imperialist naval bases on the inland of Diego Garcia and elsewhere. This question is of particular concern to my country, which joins others in the widely expressed condemnation of such provocative and dangerous action.\n212.\t\\\"The efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to implement the Declaration on that area are being hampered by the uncooperative attitude of maritime big Powers. We hope that those States will enter into consultations with the Committee, since the success of its work depends to a great extent on their co-operation. My Government will continue its support for the speedy convening of a conference of littoral and hinterland States to adopt measures for the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations on the Indian Ocean.\n213.\tThe slow pace of negotiations to conclude a treaty on the law of the sea is a matter of general concern and it is regrettable that certain major issues have not been resolved. However, significant progress has been made in resolving problems arising from the political and economic rights of States. My Government particularly welcomes the wide acceptance of the principle of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone, a concept which has been given practical effect by over 70 States, including my own.\n214.\tThe question of free scientific research within these zones is one which, we believe, needs further study, since it is well within the bounds of possibility that such research could be used as a pretext for activities detrimental to the security and sovereignty of States. In our view, such research by third parties within national economic zones should only be carried out with the consent and under the laws of the States whose waters are being used.\n215.\tThe over-all progress at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been overshadowed by the current stalemate on the question of the supervision over deep-sea-bed mining by an international authority. My Government deplores the attempt of industrialized countries to use their technological expertise to sabotage or to use the Conference as an instrument affording them an advantageous position vis-a-vis the developing countries.\n216.\tTechnological superiority has been used throughout the colonial era to further the exclusive interests of those who possessed it and constituted the basis for the miserable domination of the colonized peoples, whose natural re-sources have been mercilessly exploited. The efforts of the developing countries to place all deep sea-bed exploration and mining in international water? under an international authority is aimed at preventing the recurrence of the past unjust situations. An acceptance of such an international authority by the technologically advanced countries would have afforded them the possibility to show, for once, their goodwill and readiness to share with the other countries the benefits of their technological advancement and thus effectively contribute to the bridging of the present dangerous gap between the two camps. We trust that, in the great international venture being embarked upon by the Conference on the Law of die Sea, the discredited doctrine that \\\"might is right\\\" will not prevail and that the current impasse will be resolved in the light of the principle accepted without dissent by the United Nations membership that the riches of the ocean floor are the common heritage of mankind.\n217.\tThe world community has focused its attention in the past on the solution of political problems which endanger peace and security. I believe that it will have to deal increasingly in the future with tensions caused by the glaring disparities in the global standard of living; in other words, by the ever widening economic gap between the rich and the poor countries.\n218.\tThe demand of developing countries that this dis-parity be ended has of course been expressed in recent years in the Declaration and Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VJ) and 3202 (S-VI)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n219.\tThis demand does not stem from a narrow and envious view of the relationship between rich and poor countries. It stems from an awareness that the political character of the globe has been transformed and that this transformation makes economic change inevitable.\n220.\tJust as man's best hope for political peace and security lies in replacing the old power-politics with a democratized international political system, so his best hope for economic peace and security lies in an economic order which is not built on the interests of the powerful and wealthy alone but which takes into account the needs of all nations. I believe that the two processes, political and economic, are closely related and must increasingly go hand in hand.\n221.\tThe fourth session of UNCTAD offered the most recent test. We share the generally positive assessment of the progress and the shortfalls of the Conference made by the Conference's Secretary-General in his report to the General Assembly [A/31/15J. The principal achievement of the fourth session of UNCTAD was the establishment of an integrated program for commodities, which was the main proposal of the developing countries. Significant progress was also attained with regard to the elaboration of a code of conduct for the transfer of technology.\n222.\tOn the other hand, little was achieved with regard to the urgent debt problems of developing countries and the longer-term.question of monetary reform and flows of development assistance.\n223.\tWe should maintain the momentum of the fourth session of UNCTAD and adopt a constructive attitude. We should not be under dismayed by the shortfalls of the Conference but instead strive to build on its positive achievements and persevere in our efforts to examine further possibilities of agreement in the unresolved areas of indebtedness and monetary reform. Much effort lies ahead of us ahead unnecessary delays in implementing the new economic order would only undermine the peace and stability which the United Nations has been striving to promote and preserve for so long.\n224.\tThe Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States accepted by the United Nations was a clear exposition of the economic philosophy of the non-aligned movement and indeed of the whole world community. Its acceptance meant also the rejection of the systems of exploitation that have persisted until now.\n225.\tThe non-aligned Heads of State or Government clearly expressed at their last Conference their conviction that the principles to safeguard and protect the weaker nations of the developing world in an age of interdependent relationship are enshrined in the Charter. The non-aligned movement, with its cohesive economic and political perceptions and progressive orientations, has continued to shape and mold the economic thinking of the developing countries and to present its position to the other camp in all common forums.\n226.\tMy Government fully endorses the principles and processes outlined in the Economic Declaration of the Colombo Conference of the non-aligned countries [A/31/ 197, annex II].\n227.\tThe Dakar Conference on raw materials  is fraught with the most important consequences for the economic development of the developing countries. The Lima Conference in 1975  set up a new set of guidelines in its program for mutual assistance and solidarity. The Manila Declaration  was a comprehensive statement of ground rules for international economic negotiation and further progress in the establishment of the new international economic order.\n228.\tIn this context my Government views the Paris Conference for International Economic Cooperation as an initiative of the greatest importance, since it will provide the machinery for a continuing dialog and for detailed negotiations between developed and developing States. Price stabilization is essential for all of us in a world situation still governed by unequal trade arrangements, rampant inflation and a defective monetary system which we did not create and do not control.\n229.\tMy Government will continue its support for the following measures, which, we believe, are vital to the success of development planning. We support the establishment of an integrated program on commodities, including a common fund to finance buffer stocks in basic commodities and the indexing of prices as a means of redressing the imbalance in the exchange of raw materials for manufactured goods. We expect to see a greater understanding by the developing countries of the causes and crippling effects of the debt burdens of developing countries and a willingness on their part to agree to proposals for overcoming this problem. We also hope to see the flow of financial resources from developed to developing countries reach the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade, and in this context we note with disappointment the difference between the $20 billion spent on development in 1975 and the $300 billion spent for arms in the same year.\n230.\tIn the establishment of a new world economic order, economic co-operation between the developing countries on the basis of national self-reliance will be of the greatest significance if they are to break out of the inhibiting vertical structure of current economic relations. In that context my Government strongly supports the efforts being made to increase trade between developing countries and to establish machinery for co-operation in a wide variety of fields.\n231.\tThe establishment of producers' associations has been, and we believe will continue to be, one of the most significant developments aimed at a breaking away from old patterns of economic domination. Of equal importance is the decision of the developing countries to work towards a countervailing currency which would be backed by the economic potential of non-aligned and other developing States.\n232.\tIf a new world economic order is to be brought about peacefully and with goodwill between nations, the world community will have to be prepared to reverse the patterns of trade, production and monetary matters which formerly seemed immutable. It will have to be prepared for bold and imaginative change, both in fundamental concepts and in practical processes.\n233.\tSomalia believes that these changes can be brought about in a spirit of co-operation rather than confrontation and in the best interests of all mankind.\n234.\tIn conclusion, this session of the General Assembly will deal with a number of vital questions in the wide areas of peace and security, human rights, colonialism and the world economic order, whose urgent solution constitutes a condition sine qua non for the healthy world society which we all cherish and aspire to build.\n235.\tIn the first instance, the United Nations must provide specific remedies for healing the danger spots of our troubled world. Secondly, it is imperative that the world community take note of, and react to, the ever-growing trend of certain imperialist and neo-colonialist policies which, characterized as they are by a new sense of aggressiveness, are creating tension and instability in new areas, since they are relentlessly bent on sowing the seeds of war.\n236.\tIn addition to its efforts to deal with specific problems, the world Organization has developed a number of prescriptions for bringing about a healthy climate in which the peoples of the world can work for development and progress.\n237.\tIn the view of my Government the most urgently needed of these prescriptions is the one which calls for the ending of the arms race and the reduction of armaments as a first step towards general and complete disarmament. We believe also that the establishment of an effective system of universal collective security is a fundamental approach to the removal of those tensions which can lead to large-scale conflicts.\n238.\tWe believe that the democratization of international affairs has become urgently necessary in a world where the sovereign nation-State, rather than the colonial empire, is the basic political unit. This political evolution requires that all States have the right to participate on a basis of equality in the settlement of international problems.\n239.\tElementary human rights continue to be callously trampled underfoot by the racist regimes of apartheid and Zionism; that constitutes a constant threat to world peace and.security and, at the same time, it diverts much-needed attention and energy from other areas for the progress of the world community,\n240.\tThe prescription for the self-determination and independence of peoples has been one of the most widely and\n. successfully implemented prescriptions of the United Nations for bringing about a just political order. This accomplishment is often threatened by political or economic neo-colonialism, a development which calls for emphasis on the principle of non-intervention and on the\nprinciple of the sovereign right of States over their territory and natural resources. Where the independence process continues to be opposed by colonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism, the legitimacy of the struggles must be supported until such time as we have liquidated all forms of colonialism.\n241.\tAlong with the denial of human rights and freedom, poverty and hunger constitute a bastion of human degradation in a world where affluence and increasing misery are strange bed-fellows. Given the present economic inter-dependence relationship, the ever-widening gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" poses no less a threat to peace and security than other situations.\n242.\tThe prescriptions for all these problems have their foundation in the Charter and the subsequent decisions of the United Nations and constitute the necessary prerequisite for ushering in a well-ordered and truly harmonious global society. Somalia believes that the world community can find a solution to these problems and that the United Nations can and will play its unique role in the attainment of these noble aspirations of all men.\n"

His wealth of experience in international affairs and his active participation and leadership in matters of vital importance for global peace and the well-being of all mankind assure us that under his able guidance this session of the General Assembly will result in meaningful progress on the range of issues with which the international community is faced. His most positive statement at the opening of the session attests to this.\n111.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who was President of the General Assembly during a year of far-reaching developments. I take note of his very forthright statements in his address at the opening of this Assembly, particularly on the subject of global economic injustices.\n112.\tTo Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, I should like to add my congratulations, yet again, for another year of unselfish dedication to the task of maintaining the peace of the world. In this context my delegation also wishes to welcome Mr. Buffum, the new Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, and to express our appreciation of the role played by his predecessor, Mr. Bradford Morse in the work of the Assembly over the past few years.\n113.\tOn behalf of the Government and the people of Jamaica, I wish to express profound regret over the passing of Chairman Mao Tsetung of the People's Republic of China. This is a loss not only for China but for the entire world, which mourns a great leader and statesman of immense standing, whose place in history has long been assured as one of the giants of the twentieth century. I offer my condolences from this rostrum to the delegation and the people of China.\n114.\tMy delegation joins others in welcoming Seychelles as a new member of this world body. We also look forward to the removal of obstacles in the way of early admission to membership of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet-Nam.\n115.\tThe last two decades have witnessed a dramatic evolution of the international system from the colonial towards the post-colonial era. The question during that period was not whether colonial, imperialist and racist domination could be overcome but how long the process would take and whether it could occur with a minimum of violence, upheaval, oppression and dislocation of mankind. Today we are in the crucial and final stage of transition towards the post-colonial era-a stage where the major outstanding issues can no longer remain unresolved without posing the gravest of threats to international peace and security and risking a degree of human calamity beyond anything we have so far seen.\n116.\tThe continuing delay by the international community in coming to grips with long-standing major problems increases the likelihood of new tensions and problems arising from them. The upsurge of international terrorism, the real possibility of a full-scale racial holocaust in southern Africa and nuclear proliferation are but examples. Economic crisis after economic crisis and the continuing massive under-development of mankind can be largely attributed to the unwillingness of the industrialized countries to take positive and constructive steps towards removing economic inequity through the establishment of a new international economic order. In short, we are in a situation where the United Nations, and particularly the major Powers, must come to grips with the long-standing major problems affecting international peace and security, if we are not to find ourselves faced with critical problems arising largely from those which they have not managed to resolve.\n117.\tAmong the many reasons for our seeming inability to overcome a number of major international issues facing us is that the order of the day appears largely to be a matter of belated crisis management stemming from earlier failure either to perceive an obvious problem or to engage in a genuine search for lasting and rational solutions.\n118.\tAnother factor is the increasing tendency of some Powers to ignore even the most widely held views of the body of world opinion represented here. This is clearly shown by the abuse of the veto in the Security Council, particularly in situations where all but the party using it are agreed. It is a natural consequence of this that even lesser Powers are prepared to risk ignoring the opinions and resolutions of this body-until, of course, it is too late.\n119.\tThere is also a fundamental obstacle to the solution of critical political issues in terms of the extent to which the issues are viewed by the major Powers in the context of spheres of influence policies. They fail to recognize that such policies as well as the outmoded international system which gave rise to them are increasingly more difficult to sustain in a world in which the vast majority of developing States have declared themselves firmly in support of non-alignment and against competing Power blocs.\n120.\tIt is indeed a happy coincidence that Mr. Amerasinghe should have assumed the office of President of the General Assembly only a few weeks after his country was host to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. The outstanding success of that Conference is clear testimony of the determination of the non-aligned countries to act with unity and solidarity in accelerating the transition from an international system centered on colonialism, imperialism, racism and super-Power domination and rivalry to a new world order based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and political independence of all States, the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, regard for human rights and the dignity of the individual and international economic justice and equity. The texts of the consensus declaration and resolutions reached at Colombo, which have been transmitted to this Assembly [A/31/197], provide both an incisive analysis of many of the complex issues facing the international community today and concrete proposals for dealing with them.\n121.\tOf major concern to all of us at this time is the situation in southern Africa, and particularly the recent diplomatic developments relating to the struggle for liberation of the people of Zimbabwe from the minority racist tyranny of the illegal Smith regime. We support the African stand that it be clearly understood that the terms of any settlement for the liberation of Zimbabwe will be dictated by the front-line warriors of liberation themselves who are fighting in the bush and not by belated diplomacy resulting in a formula for settlement which would only serve to perpetuate and entrench the position of the illegal racist minority regime. Why is it necessary, for instance, to have a two-year period of transition at all? And why the revocation of sanctions before the achievement of the objective or at least significant progress in drawing up the constitution on the basis of majority rule?\n122.\tThe time for majority rule is not two years from now, or one year, or even six months, but now. Now! Such arrangements as might be considered necessary for the finalization of a constitution should themselves be based from the outset-that is, from now-on the full application of the principle of majority rule at all levels of the decision-making process, with basic safeguards to protect the fundamental rights of the individual, regardless of race, sex or creed. Blood has been shed and is still being sued by black Africa to achieve this end, and until it is achieved my Government will continue to give full support to the further intensification of the struggle for liberation.\n123.\tTurning to Namibia, we have witnessed yet another example of the criminal arrogance of the Pretoria regime in presenting to the international community the results of their manipulations with the \\\"settler\\\" interests of that Territory over its political future. But let it be made clear that further efforts in this direction will also come to naught if two basic principles are not adhered to by the racist Vorster regime-first, that representatives of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] fully participate in constitutional discussions and early attainment of full independence for Namibia; and secondly, that free elections be supervised by external machinery acceptable to black Africa. The question of confrontation in Namibia is not only between the Vorster regime and the indigenous peoples but also between that regime and the entire international community in the form of the United Nations. There is not one single legal impediment to prevent the Security Council from exercising its authority over Namibia today.\n124.\tAs to South Africa itself, I stand here with mixed emotions-of profound horror at the massacres which have been perpetrated against children by the racist Pretoria regime with trained dogs and brutish men; and of pride that the indigenous peoples have demonstrated to the world that they are prepared to die en masse for their freedom. To those who continue to support the Vorster regime by supplying military equipment I say this: let it be known that not even nuclear capability can save the Pretoria regime from being consumed in the determination of the millions of black Africans at home and abroad to rid their continent of alien domination.\n125.\tI turn now to the situation in the Middle East. The Palestinian question, which has long been recognized as the central problem in the Middle East, remains unresolved. At the same time, the increasing collaboration between Israel and the Pretoria regime constitutes a major cause for concern.\n126.\tIn order to move towards an urgent settlement in the Middle East my delegation joins with others in calling upon the parties concerned to ensure the early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, including the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n127.\tIn addition to the Middle East, we are faced with the impotence of the United Nations to deal effectively with the dismemberment of Cyprus, whose sovereignty and independence have been sacrificed on the altar of big-Power military relationships and alliances. It is clear that no lasting solution to the problem will be found as long as foreign troops are stationed on Cyprus, not only to give aid and comfort to one party to the dispute, but also to maintain the status quo of partition. Progress appears therefore to hinge on the phased withdrawal of foreign troops coupled with the resumption of meaningful negotiations between the two communities towards a satisfactory solution.\n128.\tI wish to dwell a little on the question of participation in international peace conferences, particularly where the failure to reach agreement on who should have the right of participation prevents the commencement of meaningful negotiations on a major issue constituting a threat to international peace and security.\n129.\tThe Charter of the United Nations provides for pacific settlement of disputes, and in Article 33 the obligation is placed on the parties to any dispute the continuance of which is likely to endanger international peace and security to seek a peaceful solution. Regrettably, the obligation is sometimes either flouted or rendered practically meaningless principally on account of differences as to who the parties to the dispute are or, put in another way, as to who should have the right of participation at the conference table.\n130.\tIn these circumstances, surely the time has come for the international community as a whole to lay down a basic definition of \\\"interested parties\\\" as well as rules governing the right of participation in international peace conferences. That is a matter which it appears can no longer be left to be decided by tilts of diplomatic or political strength. At the present moment there are two major outstanding international problems among many the Middle East and Korea-and there can be no headway on these either, largely because no agreement can be reached on who should sit at the conference tables. Moreover, it is interesting to note certain inconsistencies in the different lines of argument being pursued in each case concerning the question of participation. My delegation calls upon this body to establish once and for all appropriate machinery under an international convention for the purpose of determining universally applicable criteria for the right of participation in peace negotiations based on real and identifiable interests. This we feel would be a significant step towards international peace and security, which has suffered immensely from unnecessary and arbitrary delay in the conduct of negotiations towards lasting settlements.\n131.\tMy delegation notes with interest the initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany in proposing a convention on international action against the taking of hostages [A/31/242], we completely abhor and denounce the inhuman act of taking hostages, which endangers the lives of innocent individuals. We are, however, equally concerned to see that the measures taken to stamp out this evil not only are consistent with the recognized principles of international law but do not in themselves create possibilities for the violation of international law in securing the release of hostages. For that reason my delegation is of the view that any convention on this subject should extend beyond international action against the taking of hostages to include procedures for securing their prompt and safe release and that this should be reflected both in the content and in the title of the convention.\n132.\tWe are all aware of the grave threat posed to mankind by the intensifying arms race. Repeated calls for general and complete disarmament have gone unheeded by those major Powers which continue the production and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. It is a sad state of affairs for humanity when not only are we unable to control our propensity for self-extinction but also the growing callous disregard for human economic and social deprivation can permit expenditure on armaments to. reach $300 billion a year, thereby exceeding by 20 times the net flow of official development assistance. The issue of disarmament is thus to be seen as one of the most urgent issues of international peace and security, as a means of averting catastrophic warfare and in terms of increasing the availability of financial resources for development. My delegation wishes to add its support to the call for a world disarmament conference to deal with the basic issues of general and complete disarmament under strict international control.\n133.\tThe process of political decolonization is nearing completion. In addition to the major problems already mentioned there are, however, a number of other important issues to which solutions have to be found. Of particular concern is the situation in regard to Belize. The in-dependence of that country has been delayed under the threat of aggression from neighboring Guatemala. My delegation deplores this situation and calls upon the international community to take urgent measures in accordance with resolution 3432 (XXX) with a view to ensuring the exercise of the inalienable right of the people of Belize to self-determination and independence as well as the preservation of the inviolability and territorial integrity of Belize.\n134.\tAs we proceed through the final stages of transition towards the post-colonial era there is one fundamental principle upon which the new international system must be built. That is mutual respect for the sovereign equality and political independence of States. Only by observance of this principle can we lay to rest the classic relationship of the domination of the many by the few. Regrettably, despite the constitutional liberation brought about by the decolonization process, there is evidence of increasing interference in the internal affairs of States. This is in flagrant violation of respect for sovereign and political independence and is contrary to the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co\u00acoperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and is also contrary to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n135.\tAs the Political Declaration of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries points out, such interference could assume multifarious forms, political, economic and military, as well as being exercised through the information media [see A/31 / 197, annex I, para. 146]. It includes the politics of pressure and domination, economic subversion and measures calculated to cause disruption and destabilization in an effort to undermine the independence of sovereign States. Urgent action by the international community is required to bring this issue under close scrutiny and to come up with appropriate solutions for the removal of this constant threat to international peace and to the principle of sovereign equality and the political independence of States.\n136.\tIn the field of international economic matters the current year has been disappointing. The sixth special session of the General Assembly held in May 1974 laid the groundwork for the new international economic order based largely on proposals of the non-aligned countries. The seventh special session, which took place in September 1975, although disappointing in many respects, at least provided some hope for a transformation of die style of the dialogue between the developed and the developing countries in order to ensure progress towards the implementation of a new economically just order.\n137.\tOn the initiative of the developed countries, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation was launched in Paris early this year against a background of reservations on the part of many developing countries concerning the fact that such a conference was being held outside the ambit of the United Nations system. The Conference has been meeting for nine months, and participating developing countries have publicly expressed their deep concern at the absence of progress. At this stage of the Conference, and on the basis of the attitudes displayed by the developed world over the past few months, it is still most uncertain whether significant and concrete results can be achieved by December of this year.\n138.\tThe results of the fourth session of UNCTAD are viewed by my delegation more as an avoidance of the disaster of total failure than as a positive achievement. The insensitivity with which most developed countries treated the debt situation of developing countries only adds to our despair. The acid test will be the negotiations on the major issues of primary commodities and the common fund.\n139.\tIn summary, developing countries are facing a situation in which, with few exceptions, the international community has far too little that is significant* meaningful or concrete to show as a result of the series of intense negotiating events held with the aim of achieving equity for developing countries since the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly. In fact it would appear that in little more than a year since the much hailed seventh special session developed countries, with a few notable exceptions, have retained much of their attitudes and approaches of 1974 and earlier. This is borne out by the relatively decreasing support of developed countries for even long-standing development programs which are themselves based on traditional but not irrelevant concepts of development.\n140.\tDespite the disappointments of the current year, the developing countries have maintained their thrust in the area of economic co-operation among themselves. The succession of meetings of the non-aligned countries from Lusaka to Colombo which culminated in the non-aligned Action Program for Economic Co-operation [see A31ll97, annex III] has been paralleled by similar endeavors by other developing countries, leading up to the dialogue of the third-world countries which recently took place in Mexico.\n141.\tAnother matter which we regard as being inseparably linked to the new international economic order is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. While significant progress has been made on many important issues, the resolution of the well-known central and fundamental issues, such as the composition and functions of the international sea-bed authority, now requires high- level political representation in order to expedite the completion of the work of the Conference. We join in urging all the participants to accelerate the negotiations towards a successful conclusion of this major endeavor in international cooperation.\n142.\tIn closing, my delegation wishes once again to stress the urgent need for the international community, and particularly the major Powers and the industrialized countries, to come to grips with the crucial political and economic- issues before us -not by trying to postpone or to freeze them but by tackling them squarely, having regard to the body of opinion expressed in this and in other forums of world opinion.\n143.\tUnless the developed countries now begin to display some degree of urgency and sincerity in tackling the international economic issues affecting the developing countries, the result will be a further widening of existing disparities between North and South, forcing the developing countries towards more effective alternatives in order to ensure improvement in their situation. It is all too apparent that the lack of foresight, and self-interested delays, which so obviously pervade the treatment of major international political issues, also extend to international economic issues. Yet, it should be clear to all that the consequences of failure to find effective solutions in either sphere could be equally disastrous. The future depends on our determination to resolve the urgent political and economic problems before us. It is only by so doing that we can hope to maintain international peace and security and ensure the well-being and progress of mankind based on the fundamental principles of equality. As my Prime Minister, Michael Manley, said in his address to the General Assembly in October 1972,\n\\\"We believe that the idea of equality is the only enduring principle by which mankind may be guided in the conduct of national and international affairs\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "It is for me an honor and a great pleasure to extend to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe, on behalf of the delegation of Senegal on my personal behalf, our warm congratulations and our best wishes as well as those of the Government and people of Senegal on his being elected to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are indeed fortunate to be able to rely during this important session on his distinguished qualities and his wealth of experience. His election is also a tribute paid to his country and to its people, as well as to its traditional policy of friendship and co-operation to serve mutual interests with all peoples who love peace and justice. I can assure the President, that my delegation will give him its full support in the performance of his onerous duties.\n118.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express my warm thanks to Mr. Amerasinghe's predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg for the distinguished services which he rendered to the international community particularly through the skill and the devotion with which he tackled the problems the General Assembly had to take up during the past year.\n119.\tIt is also a source of great pleasure for me to applaud the constant efforts which are being made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in order to strengthen the chances for peace in the world and to impart to our Organization the place and the role which are its due.\n120.\tI should also, on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal, to reiterate to the delegation of the People's Republic of China, our deep-felt condolences at the passing of Chairman Mao Tsetung, which was a tremendous loss for all peoples who have known domination, suffering and scorn and who aspire to dignity and respect. Chairman Mao was not only a source of inspiration of the valiant Chinese people but also a model of wisdom and of leadership for all peoples of the third world. Because his action was devoted to the total development of man, the thoughts of Chairman Mao will, always represent something which remains forever bright in the memory of mankind.\n121. The United Nations is an instrument the purpose of which is to mold the future of mankind and \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\\\" The purpose was to build a single world based on peace, justice and co-operation, but instead of that, very shortly we found ourselves in a world which was divided into separate entities by conflicts and inequalities, a bitter world, ravaged by the destructive furor of war, caught in the trap of confrontation between antagonistic military blocs. Fortunately, an encouraging degree of progress can be, seen every day, essentially because peoples and nations are becoming more and more aware of their interdependence and are daily becoming more conscious of the essential needs and legitimate aspirations of each. This has meant that there have been more numerous meetings leading very often to agreements which have been away with the ghost of generalized war and even arriving at collective decisions which benefit all.\n122.\tIt is in the context of this awareness that we have seen the victories which have been scored against colonialism. The former colonial empires have in fact been dismantled and the colonial yoke has been ended in most parts of the world. More than half of the delegations who have met here represent newly independent States.\n123.\tThe United Nations, which has done a great deal in order to speed up this evolution, thus is daily drawing closer to its aim of universality. This is why we are pleased to welcome among us this year the delegation' of the sovereign State of Seychelles.\n124.\tIn conveying our congratulations to this fraternal State, I would like to express the conviction that this nation will strengthen our Organization and will lend its firm support to those peoples who are still struggling for their liberation. Similarly my delegation believes that the admission of Angola and of Viet Nam is a necessary prerequisite to bring about the principle of universality of the United Nations.\n125.\tHowever, despite the major successes which have been scored in the field of decolonization, we are still confronted either by problems to which we have not \nmanaged to find a just solution and which cause violence, or matters whose deterioration creates fresh complications. Can we not agree to speed the onset of the day when colonialism will cease to be the subject of our discussions because the liberation of peoples in an inexorable, irresistible process which is part and parcel of the laws of evolution of mankind? How can we agree to the continued clinging to power of the regime of Ian Smith despite international condemnation and opposition? All the efforts to date of African leaders and the African National Council for a peaceful solution to the problem have been frustrated by the intransigence of the white minority, leaving those leaders no choice but to support the people of Zimbabwe in their armed struggle.\n126.\tAs a result of the visit of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, Ian Smith today stated that he will accept the rule of the majority. If this declaration which had never been made in the past in such a solemn manner, contains no covert desires to perpetuate in a camouflaged form the minority domination in those countries, undoubtedly this could be regarded as a tremendous step forward to peace. We hope therefore that Great Britain will soon resume its full responsibility to ensure that, at a constitutional conference at which all parties are represented, the practical ways and means of transferring power will be defined. Whatever the case, the United Nations should in this new phase give its full support to those who are struggling to be freed from the yoke of the racist minority. This is the very least our Organization can do to avert the serious danger of war that threatens not only African States: as we all know, this contains the seeds of world-wide confrontation. It seems to us to be indispensable and urgent to enlarge the scope of sanctions in order to exercise maximum pressure on Ian Smith's regime.\n127.\tIn Namibia, South Africa continues to display an anachronistic fanaticism, not only by perpetuating its colonial presence but also by extending its racist policies to this international Territory.\n128.\tThe responsibility of the United Nations as far as Namibia is concerned is dual: first, in the context of the general struggle to put an end to colonialism wherever it exists and, secondly, by dint of the fact that in this particular case a colonial challenge affects an international Territory which is directly under the responsibility of the United Nations. \n129.\tUnfortunately, the United Nations has failed to discharge its responsibility concerning the problem of Namibia, where the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" tends to perpetuate colonialism by stratagems aimed at distracting the attention of the international community. The Soweto massacre proves that South Africa, both in its own territory and in Namibia, is not prepared to stop defying the will of the international community. It is true that South Africa is aware of the support lent it by certain great Powers who continue to paralyse the action undertaken by the United Nations. However, we hope that the ever more serious events occurring in South Africa since the Soweto massacre will impress upon the authorities in Pretoria, once and for all, that law is more powerful than brute force and the people of Namibia under the leadership of their legitimate representative, SWAPO, will be free whatever happens.\n130.. Turning to the situation in South Africa itself, it is quite clear that the minority racist regime is not a representative one, since it takes no account whatsoever of the aspirations of the vast majority of the population. This regime is doubly hateful: first, because of its policies and its practice of apartheid and, secondly, because of its maneuvers aimed at perpetuating the status quo. May I here make an urgent appeal to all States and foreign interests who continue to co-operate with the racist regime of South Africa and which, by the same token, encourage it to persist in its inhuman policies, asking them to refrain from supporting this regime and to respect the decisions taken by the United Nations. Any delivery of weapons or military material to this repressive minority regime by any country at all cannot but be considered by us an act of aggression perpetrated against all African States. It is high time, particularly in view of recent events culminating in the massacre of young schoolchildren, for total isolation of the regime of Pretoria.\n131.\tRegarding the Western Sahara and the so-called French Somali Coast, it would appear that these problems are on the point of being given, an African solution because OAU has taken charge of the situation. My delegation considers that in accordance with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter and since these problems pit African States against each other, this examination at the African level should be supported by all. Article 33, after all, stipulates that \\\"the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security , shall, first of all, seek a solution above ail by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\\\"\n132.\tOn the .. her hand, as far as the island of Mayotte is concerned, my delegation considers that the action of the French Government is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of the Comoros. Senegal would therefore make an appeal to France to countermand the measures which have been taken in order to detach the island of Mayotte from the State of the Comoros and thus to destroy the unity of the archipelago.\n133.\tAfrica is not the only continent which has known armed conflict. The situation in the Middle Bast and in Palestine is one of the most serious problems confronting our world today. There is not a single Member State here who does not recognize that the problem of the Middle East has become the source of numerous international disputes and the point of departure for conflicts whose consequences transcend the confines of the region and threaten peace throughout the world.\n134.\tFor many years now, this matter has been a regular feature of the agenda of our Assembly, requiring study in order to find a solution to it or at least to reduce its seriousness. The most important result reached by the United Nations in this connexion may well be the decision taken by the international community to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the only authentic representative of the Palestinian people and to grant it observer status [resolution 3210 (XXIX)]. In a similar context, we can see the creation during the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of a special committee to draw up a program enabling the Palestinians to exercise their rights [resolution 3376 (XXX)], It has become dear to one and all that the solution to the problems of the Middle East does not lie solely in separating the armed forces con-fronting each other nor in the partial or total withdrawal from the occupied territories, but rather in the settlement of the fundamental problem: that of Palestine.\n135.\tFor my delegation, such settlement would necessarily involve the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to recover its homeland in the land of Palestine. It is for that reason that Senegal has always defended, and will continue to defend, the principle of restoring the inalienable right to self-determination and to the creation of an independent State in Palestine. And it is precisely because we consider that this people has fallen victim to intolerable expansionism that Senegal voted in favor of resolution 3379 (XXX) equating Zionism with racism. In doing so, my country condemned neither Judaism as the religion of the Jews nor Jewry as a set of cultural values belonging to the Jewish world, but, rather, expressed a protest against its expansionist and its racially discriminatory aspects.\n136.\tFurthermore, my delegation is profoundly concerned by the situation in Lebanon and would address a pressing appeal to all the parties to the conflict to put an end to their fratricidal struggle, to re-establish peace, and to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity and non-alignment of Lebanon.\n137.\tRegarding Cyprus, my delegation would like to reiterate its support for the respect for the territorial integrity, non-alignment and the resumption of inter community negotiations to bring about harmonious coexistence within a single State.\n138.\tAs far as Korea is concerned, my delegation favors any negotiated, solution. to the problem without foreign intervention. Hence, the resumption of the North-South dialog pursuant to the joint communique of 1972 is a necessary condition for there to be just and lasting peace in that region.\n139.\tGenerally speaking, we can see that detente, in the sense of a relaxation of international tension, cannot be observed on a world scale. Not only does it sometimes mean that the world is divided into exclusive areas reserved for one of the great Powers, but further, sometimes it seems to establish as a rule the transfer of conflicts to the countries of the third world which have become the best customers of the arms merchants.\n140.\tFirstly it should be noted, as the Stockholm Inter-national Peace Research Institute has pointed out, that the sale of arms has considerably increased in recent years, which has made it even more difficult to establish any form of control. At any rate, it is well known that as far as conventional armaments are concerned, there are at least three or four suppliers corresponding to the major Power blocs who can always serve as alternatives if a traditional supplier refuses to supply arms, particularly as it is publicly well known that the sale of death-dealing weapons is a lucrative activity which unfortunately serves in the case of certain national budgets as a compensating factor for an adverse balance of payments. It follows that the international transfer of arms has passed the point where it could be considered as being purely a side-effect of the East-West arms race and has become an extremely important phenomenon, the control and limitation of which can be carried out only on the basis of a general commitment to reduce the relative role of military force in international relations.\n141.\tNext, and most important, it should be noted with some regret that the developing countries are major arms purchasers. Thus, in two years-1974 and 1975-the value of resources transferred to the third world in the form of arms increased by 60 per cent, whereas the cumulative value of major arms transfer in the six years-1970 through 1975-was $US 14.2 billion, more than twice the value of the transfers which occurred in the -decade 1950 through 1959, which was $US 6.8 billion. These figures give food for thought.\n142.\tFor all these reasons Senegal has come out in favor of the convening of a world disarmament conference, which is something which the Organization is at present studying. This project, if it wins die support of all the military Powers, could free the problem of disarmament from the deadlock in which it finds itself at present. At any Ate, it is the duty of the international community to intensify its action in order to strengthen the role and the influence of the United Nations in the negotiations and working out of a solution to disarmament problems by drawing up a vast program of concerted measures which is the necessary prerequisite for the initiation of the process of general and complete disarmament under international control.\n143.\tWe should firmly state our determination to {day an effective role in the easing of international tension and in seeking for just and equitable solutions to the major world problems. This is the main purpose and the raison d'etre of our Organization. Our responsibility to all the peoples of the world who love peace and justice is to redouble our efforts to achieve this end.\n144.\tRegarding economic problems, I should like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of my Government at the significant results which have been reached by the international community. In effect, we have managed to start a movement towards the establishment of an international economic order based no longer on criteria of power, but rather on the respect of common interests and the aspirations of all to life in peace, prosperity and social justice. Although the results are not yet up to the wishes expressed by die developing countries, the international community nevertheless has reached a consensus on the steps to be-taken in various areas which are vital for the existence and the development of a considerable portion of mankind.\n145.\tMy delegation is particularly gratified at the spirit which prevailed throughout the various international meetings a spirit characterized by understanding and cooperation which we hope will continue to reign during coming international economic conferences. Furthermore, it is our hope that all States will ensure that the decisions taken are implemented in the same constructive spirit and that in the case of those points which have not yet been the subject of a consensus, efforts will continue in order to bring opinions closer together as between the-developing and industrialized countries, the intention being to establish co-operation in a new international economic order based on complementary and equitable relations.\n146.\tIn that connexion, the United Nations and the specialized agencies can be regarded as embryonic forms of a political power which could be both powerful and effective vis-a-vis the dominating and monopolizing powers of multinational corporations. That would be one way for us, the developing countries, to make our own voices heard, however weak they may be on the bilateral level, and especially to resist pressure from the \\\"great\\\" Powers.\n147.\tUndoubtedly certain international organizations such as the monetary institutions have up till now more often than not appeared, not as protectors of the \\\"small\\\" countries against the major Powers, but rather as organizations closely linked with imperialist expansion. But it is the duty of our Organization to work strongly for their reconstruction along the lines of a new international economic order based on equity and complementarity.\n148.\tThe United Nations, which is already a considerable counterweight to the hegemonistic policies of the great Powers, can, in point of fact, provide the framework for action to bring about the general development of mankind. It can make available to all the experience which has been acquired here or there, organize assistance for those who need it, and promote a new system of international relations based on the conviction that the fundamental interests of the people of the world are not contradictory to each other.\n149.\tWe feel bound to say something about human rights. I hardly need to recall in this connexion that the date of 10 December 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted was one of the most striking events in the history of mankind.\n150.\tThus, for the first time the responsibility to proclaim and to defend human rights was assumed by the international community and accepted by it as a standing obligation. With the hopes of millions of human beings reduced to an animal level of existence vested in it, this Declaration appeared to mark a turning-point in relations among people.\n151.\tUnfortunately, a climate of civil and civic violence flouting elementary human rights and condoned more and more by the conscience of men and peoples has arisen almost everywhere since the end of the Second World War. our Organization, however, has failed to react to such violations, preferring rather to imitate most of the Governments who remain silent, either because they wish to spare the feelings of friendly countries or for ideological, political or other reasons under the pretext of not interfering in the internal affairs of other States.\n152.\tThe condemnation of such acts of violence is by no means unjustified interference because the respect of human rights is essential to the establishment of friendly relations and relations of co-operation among States. But our Organization has as one of its tasks, as proclaimed in Article 1 of the Charter, the achievement of international co-operation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.\n153.\tOf course, it is perfectly true that many countries have expressed their disapproval of the oppression which prevails in Chile and their solidarity with the victims. But in other countries, which seem to attract less attention from the United Nations, there are persons who are still deprived of their elementary human rights. The international community must react to all forms of oppression and terror, wherever they occur. It is not natural that there should be virtually no reaction to the massacre of men and women because they hold certain views or, in some cases, simply because they are accused of holding certain views, an accusation which is swiftly transformed into a plot against the existing regime. At the present time, millions of people are languishing in prison and being tortured for no greater crime than their failure to declare their allegiance to a particular policy vociferously enough. The United Nations has an important role to play in this area.\n154.\tThe United Nations system is the only universal instrument currently available. Through certain reforms to its Charter-particularly the right of veto, its structures and far-reaching operational decentralization -it would be capable of assuming responsibility for the major objectives of renewed international co-operation. It might thus be entrusted with the task of managing the common heritage of mankind constituted by the oceans beyond the limits of territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone, space, the science and technology accumulated by mankind, and so forth. It might supervise the implementation of a new international policy for the transfer of resources to the less advantaged countries.\n155.\tIt is only in this way that our ultimate goal, which is the establishment of total and permanent world peace in prosperity and justice can be attained. Thus, we can affirm to all peoples of the world that the United Nations has successfully discharged its mandate, essentially by democratizing international relations and by creating conditions conducive to the realization of equality, justice and international co-operation throughout the world. We have too high an opinion of the United Nations, of what it represents for us and of the results which it has already achieved, to have the shadow of a doubt that the goal which is so vital for the survival of mankind -the maintenance of international peace and security- will be achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "The election of Ambassador. Amerasinghe to preside over this session of the General Assembly could not have come at a more opportune time. He is a man totally committed to the cause of justice and the restoration of human dignity in the areas of the world where both attributes are being trampled with reckless abandon. He represents a country which has actively promoted the cause of world peace and universal progress through common discussion of problems in conditions of sovereign equality. Having the opportunity to participate in the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo two months ago, I saw at first hand the great devotion of the Government and people of his country, Sri Lanka, to the promotion of international friendship, on which peace and progress must necessarily rest. On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, therefore, I congratulate him warmly and pledge him our support in guiding the deliberations of this session.\n145.\tI should like also to pay a tribute to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, whose devotion to duty and enthusiasm in the pursuit of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations have endeared him to us. Nigeria's confidence in him is unqualified, and Africa's hope for his continued service to this Organization was reflected in an appropriate motion which I had the honor to propose, adopted at the last OAU conference held in Mauritius in July this year. \n146.\tSince the inception of our great Organization, real peace has eluded the world. We have groped our way in search of better quality of life for all mankind. The successful solution of the problem of strife, hunger and poverty that plague the international community hinges on our understanding and realization that we, the Members of this Organization, are closely interdependent. Racial and national diversity are facts of life which do not, however, preclude coexistence. Ideology, like nationalism, serves as the motive force for group survival, but need not supplant coexistence among groups and nations.\n147.\tAlthough banners have been formed and placards invented, in spite of our common goals and objectives, progress appears lost in cliches. We are all agreed that the purpose of our Organization is the promotion of human well-being, the dignity of man and a well-ordered inter-national society in order to ensure the survival of the human race. These are basic human values and common experiences which transcend the boundaries of race, creed and color. The evolution of planet earth and its people does not ignore these reactions of man, nor can they be permanently suppressed.\n148.\tCollectively, we must share our various burdens and distribute our benefits. We must appreciate that, through the matrix and complexities of the present state of affairs, one of the fundamental instincts of man is his affinity with those who have shared common experiences.\n149.\tUnfortunately, the present international economic relationship does not reflect the ideals of collective security and responsiveness to the realities of international order based on realistic co-operation in a world divided between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". Self-reliance must therefore necessarily be emphasized, in addition to close co-operation among those who share common experiences and objectives.\n150.\tNigeria belongs to the third world, encompassing the non-aligned movement and the Group of 77 within the framework of the United Nations system. These groups are not inconsistent with the aims an objectives of our Charter. It is therefore sad to observe in some statements made earlier in the course of the general debate that some see this co-operation as a trend to dissipate and emasculate the effectiveness of the United Nations. It is even sadder to note that these criticisms emanate from those who have formed themselves into economic, military and political blocs for the purpose of defending their interests.\n151.\tIt is very clear to all that the non-aligned movement was born in the wake of international ideological conflicts with the objective of defusing the cold war tension. As long as these ideological conflicts exist, albeit at a reduced level, the non-aligned movement will continue to serve its purpose. As long as the world continues to be divided into the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\", the developing countries will continue to seek ways and means to articulate programs for collective self-reliance in protection of their legitimate interest within the New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n152.\tWe in Nigeria, in spite of our population and our gigantic development program to combat illiteracy, disease and poverty, and to provide the infrastructure lacking from years of colonial neglect, have diverted a modest but substantial proportion of our resources to economic co-operation with other developing countries, particularly in our region. Along with the international community, Nigeria responded to the compelling needs of our neighbors in the Sahel region. We have contributed modestly to infrastructural development in our region. We have, in response to the needs of our region, afforded bilateral assistance to our neighbors.\n153.\tIn concert with our neighbors, we have embarked on programs to develop our natural resources in the Chad Basin Commission, the Niger-Nigeria joint Commission and the River Niger Commission. Nigeria is embarking on a gigantic program to improve the navigability of the River Niger and to promote easy access to the sea through Nigerian ports, for our own benefit and that of our land-locked neighbors.\n154.\tAlso in our region, we are dedicated to making economic and social co-operation a reality with the establishment of the Economic Community of West African States. Here again, Nigeria is committed to playing its full part in the implementation of the aims and objectives of the Organization.\n155.\tRecently, Nigeria made available to the African Development Bank the sum of $80 million as a trust fund to provide soft loans to the neediest of African States. In addition, so as to strengthen the Economic Commission for Africa and to maximize its operational effectiveness, we have provided the sum of $1 million to augment its resources from the United Nations.\n156.\tThese are all modest and practical measures. Despite the pressures of internal requirements, we have managed to share our resources with other developing countries.\n157.\tNigeria is fully committed to co-operation among developing countries. We shall fulfill any obligations which flow from these commitments, be it in the non-aligned solidarity fund for economic and social development or in the special fund for the financing of buffer stocks for raw materials and primary products of interest to developing countries.\n158.\tAs a means of assisting developing countries outside Africa, Nigeria has increased its contribution to inter-national financial institutions in order to enhance their capacity for providing additional resources for development. Nigeria has also joined with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] in launching the OPEC Fund for Development and in making substantial contributions towards the operation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\n159.\tThe developed market-economy countries and, to a certain extent, the countries with centrally planned economies have gone through a devastating recession and an unprecedented inflation and unemployment, from which they are only just recovering. One of the main contributory factors to this recovery has been the availability of the huge investment by third-world countries, particularly from the oil-exporting countries. In any case, the recycling of surplus liquidity from third-world countries contributed in no small measure to this recovery.\n160.\tThis is interdependence. This amply illustrates the desirability for a reorientation of approaches and patterns of solution in the context of the new international economic order, based on reciprocity.\n161.\tDeveloping States like ours, in view of the constraints on our economy, can play a role to the extent which I have attempted to outline. It is the responsibility and obligation of the developed countries to make concessions and adjustments in their approach to international economic relations for the development of the entire human society. I believe that it is about time that the international community began to take positive steps to show that it regards itself as an organic whole and, like any nation State, avoid fragmentation of society into groups composed of the rich and the poor.\n162.\tThe results of recent international conferences have not encouraged us to believe that these realities of economic interdependence have been fully appreciated and accepted. There is a growing frustration among third-world countries and a polarization between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". Only two weeks ago, in Mexico City,  the third-world countries met to articulate measures designed to ensure their collective survival. If this lack of sensitivity continues, this polarization could entrench a permanent chasm.\n163.\tThis is a situation that we would wish to avoid. We therefore call for a reappraisal of attitudes and positions towards international economic co-operation. All of us must demonstrate a willingness to adopt concrete measures to ensure: a free flow of trade; stability in the real income of developing countries; easy access to capital market on preferential terms; the attainment of the official development assistance target; the acceleration of the pace of industrialization in developing countries; the transfer of appropriate technology on favorable terms and conditions, and the redeployment of suitable industries from developed countries to developing countries; and the finding of urgent and adequate solutions of the problem of the official debts of developing countries, particularly the least developed countries.\n164.\tIt is distressing to note that, while they quibble over funds for economic development, powerful States Members of this Organization continue to lavish outstanding amounts on armaments. The current estimate of annual expenditure on armaments by the developed countries is $300 billion, in contrast with a mere $20 billion in the flow of financial resources from the developed to the developing countries. When, therefore, we emphasize the imperative need for disarmament, we bear in mind both the security and economic implications of disarmament. We continue to believe that every country has a role to play in disarmament because it concerns peace, and peace is indivisible. But year after year, while we continue to appear to play some role in disarmament negotiations, a feeling has been created that we are gradually being relegated to an observer status. The truth is that progress in disarmament is being hampered by the super-Power concept of the balance of strategic power-in other words, a balance of terror. The vertical proliferation of nuclear and conventional armaments continues unabated. In the meantime, the prospects of a nuclear horizontal proliferation of nuclear armaments have become the nightmare of mankind.\n165.\tThe third world has continued to maintain that the disproportionate human and financial resources committed to armaments and to the acquisition of nuclear capabilities for destructive purposes are totally unjustified in an era of relaxation of East-West tension. Last year, the Assembly reiterated the link between disarmament and development, and requested the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to continue to explore this link [resolution 3470 (XXX)]. We in Nigeria fully support this move. It is our conviction that efforts should be made in this direction. Nigeria has opted for utilizing its resources for development and international economic co-operation. We believe in peace; we live at peace with our neighbors and have not fallen prey to the compulsive urge to become a phantom military power against the grain of reality. In this same forum last year, I said that if the attempt to convene a world disarmament conference continued to be frustrated, my delegation would not hesitate to join in demanding the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to focus attention on disarmament.  The Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries in Colombo emphasized the need for such a session when it decided to work towards convening it not later than 1978. The General Assembly should take appropriate steps at this session towards this end.\n166.\tNigeria regrets that the problems of the Middle East still defy solution. The people of Palestine continue to live in refugee camps or to be scattered in many foreign countries. Nigeria wishes once more to reaffirm its belief that there will be no durable and lasting solution of the Middle East problems except one which, inter alia, takes into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own and the right of all States in the region to exist in peace within secure and recognized borders.\n167.\tIt is obvious that the impasse in the Middle East imbroglio constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Nigeria reiterates its call for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories it occupied as a result of the 1967 Middle East war. Nigeria fully supports the idea of convening a conference to which all the parties concerned in the Middle East problem, including the Palestinians, should be invited to discuss and settle all the issues at stake.\n168.\tAllow me now to turn to the dominant theme of this session and the major preoccupation of my delegation, the problem of southern Africa. Before we disperse to our various capitals in December, we may witness the culmi-nation of momentous events concerning the explosive situation in southern Africa. Without being unmindful of other issues that will confront the General Assembly, I venture to say that this session will justify itself by the way it reacts to the rapidly evolving situation in that part of Africa. It has been clear for some time that that area is the last bastion for the preservation of everything that is the antithesis of the Charter of our Organization: namely, colonial exploitation, deprivation of elementary human rights, the blatant practice of racial discrimination, the dehumanization of the indigenous people of the area, daily exploitation by powerful economic interests and, what is more, the perpetration of that heinous crime against humanity, apartheid. It has also been apparent that the United Nations, which Africa looked up to for the eradication of the evils that plague southern Africa, was being increasingly rendered powerless to discharge its obligations. The cynicism and hypocrisy of those who should be in the vanguard of the United Nations action against the racist imperialists of southern Africa rendered this Organization almost irrelevant in the drama that was unfolding in that area. Even those who normally sympathize with the plight of the misused and oppressed people of southern Africa began to wonder whether we had not reached the end of the road as far as liberation on the African continent was concerned.\n169.\tThe continent of Africa has for three centuries been afflicted with a malaise inflicted from outside our continent. We are all too aware of this historic evolution-an evolution tinted with despair. We have always looked forward to, and relied on, the conscience of mankind and the changing value systems of the international community, in our continuous search for peace, justice and equality. Africa has been a continent of unfulfilled hopes. It appears to be in a state of flux. Once we hoped that slavery was behind us only to be engulfed in colonialism. Next, we hoped for freedom-only to be immersed in a whirlpool of frustrations. Today, the dimensions of these uncertainties are reflected in the lack of will on the part of the Western World to grapple effectively with the problems of southern Africa. The racist regime of South Africa has compartmentalized its people into classes. Some are categorized as white, some as Colored and others as black. The black man, in his own country, is treated as subhuman. The white man, by the powers inherited through the same system of colonialism, has by brute force transformed colonialism into an instrument of repression, oppression and chicanery. This process has been synthesized into a system which is notoriously known as apartheid, a veritable crime against humanity. A major part of the world community continues to be indifferent, judging by its responses to and its actions regarding this problem.\n170.\tIn South Africa, Vorster, like his predecessors, is a great ally and companion in the exploitation of the resources of South Africa in the interest of the white minority and the Western world. He is today being proclaimed the hero in the complex process which is yet to unfold in the search for a solution in Zimbabwe and Namibia. This adulation is misplaced and unacceptable.\n171.\tFirst, my Government has not seen any positive basic shift in policy by Vorster and his racist henchmen which can lead to a just solution to the problems of southern Africa generally. Thus Vorster is merely being given a ticket of respectability for a role he has not played.\n172.\tSecondly, Vorster has not relented in spite of the impression being created that he has ceased his intervention in propping up the racist regime in Zimbabwe.\n173.\tThirdly, the nationalists and most African leaders will not wish for a settlement in which Vorster is appearing to play a role.\n174.\tFourthly, the quid pro quo for the so-called co-operation of Vorster in resolving the problem of Zimbabwe appears to be not only this respectability which I mentioned earlier but also an agreement to relegate to the background the basic issues of apartheid, which is the crux of the problems of South Africa.\n175.\tIn South Africa itself, while our attention is being diverted, 26 October is almost here with us, when the first \\\"bantusan\\\", the Transkei, will be declared \\\"independent\\\", a show window in the \\\"bantustanization\\\" process.\n176.\tIt is worth mentioning here what I said in the Security Council a few days ago, that \\\"we will not accept any dialogue with the racist regime of South Africa without its renouncing the policy of apartheid.. .\\\".  In addition, we must not be diverted from the reality of the situation in\n. South Africa, where \\\"bantustanization\\\", the quintessence of apartheid, continues to be implemented.\n177.\tAs I also stated in the Security Council, no African will endorse a solution in South Africa whereby 6 to 7 million blacks are to be forcibly herded into 200 scattered locations within South Africa that will be constituted into about eight \\\"bantustans\\\". Nineteen million owners of the land cannot be repressed by brute force or be bullied by 3.5 million whites at the muzzle of the gun and resettled into 13 per cent of the poorest land areas in South Africa.\n178.\tWe shall never relent until the South African racists appreciate that such abuse of power, such degradation of human values, cannot stand the test of time. We in Nigeria are convinced that the genocide being perpetrated by the racist regime in South Africa, to which some powerful Members of this Assembly continue to turn a blind eye, cannot solve in perpetuity the basic problems of human resistance and reaction to suffering.\n179.\tThe events of the past few weeks ought to have made that point clear even to the most complacent supporter of the apartheid regime and its instruments of terror. We have all been living witnesses to the spontaneous uprising of the oppressed people of South Africa against the barbarism of the Vorster regime and its apartheid policy. The children born in the wake of Sharpeville -events that shocked the world 16 years ago -who are now in their teens have spearheaded the beginning of a revolution that is bound to destroy apartheid and its apostles. Against the arsenals of the Vorster Government, these children are daily showing a determination to sacrifice their blood for the destruction of apartheid.\n180.\tApartheid pervades every fact of life in South Africa. Combating it requires action at all levels. Following the African action at the Montreal Olympics, I hope that those who hide under the hypocritical view of separating sports from politics now realize the depth of our feelings. Apartheid does not exempt any sphere of human activity from its very long arm. Therefore, anyone who believes he can verbally condemn apartheid but in practice helps to sustain it must count on concerted African reaction.\n181.\tMy delegation is extremely concerned that in spite of the record of the Vorster regime, in spite of numerous United Nations resolutions, an important Member of our Organization has decided to co-operate with South Africa in a very sensitive and dangerous area nuclear technology. Itself a nuclear Power, France knows the danger of the weapon. As a permanent member of the Security Council, France knows what danger the Vorster regime constitutes to international peace and security, especially as South Africa has refused to join the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Yet, in spite of all those facts, France has decided to encourage South Africa's nuclear ambition, thus making real Africa's fear of nuclear blackmail by South Africa.\n182.\tEven with the conclusion of the safeguards agreement between France, South Africa and the International! Atomic Energy Agency, Africa's fears cannot be allayed. For the safeguards agreement is no guarantee that South Africa will not divert nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes. In the interest of the security of Africa, therefore, this session of the General Assembly must call on France to cancel its nuclear power deal with South Africa. France, which has a lot of goodwill, as well as economic interests, in Africa, cannot continue to presume on Africa's verbal protests alone in the ever-growing chain of France's contacts with South Africa in defiance of the international community. I hope that France will take this friendly advice with all the seriousness in which it is given.\n183.\tThe Federal Military Government of Nigeria believes that the call for change has been sounded by the Africans and other non-whites in South Africa; the international community must listen, to the call and must give all assistance.\n184.\tLast week 1 had the opportunity to state in the Security Council Nigeria's views on Namibia.15 The basis of an end to Vorster's illegal occupation of the Territory should be Security Council resolution 38S (1976) which, characteristically, Vorster has ignored. In keeping with his usual trick of confusing the unwary, Vorster has convened a fake constitutional conference in Windhoek. The facts about that conference are too well known to be repeated. That conference is a gross insult to the international community. It did not deliberate, and was not intended by Vorster to deliberate, on the fundamental issues. It merely rubber-stamped the South African plan for a so-called independence \\\"with reasonable certainty\\\" in December 1978.\n185.\tThe world community has laid down specific conditions for the process of self-determination for Namibia. Those conditions include the unconditional withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia, the release of all political prisoners, the maintenance of the territorial integrity of Namibia, and negotiations between the Vorster regime and the authentic representatives of the Namibian people, SWAPO, on the modalities for the withdrawal of the South African administration. It is the hope of my delegation that the United Nations will not relent in its determination to ensure the implementation of those conditions. SWAPO must be given all necessary support to continue and intensify the struggle against South African atrocities in Namibia. It is the responsibility of the United Nations to ensure that an independent Namibia, under the leadership of SWAPO, will take its place in the community of nations very soon.\n186.\tIt is quite clear to my delegation that a number of factors have led to the present situation in Zimbabwe. First is the nationalist military pressure which has shattered the resistance of the rebel regime of Ian Smith. Second is the increased material and political support that the Zimbabwe People's Army has enjoyed from progressive forces all over the world and, in particular, from the front-line States. Third is the continued pressure of the United Nations for the maintenance of mandatory sanctions against the illegal regime. The combination of those factors has obviously brought the rebels virtually to their knees.\n187.\tMy Government believes that those pressures must be kept up and not relaxed until the racist minority regime in Salisbury has been completely toppled. Nigeria accepts its responsibilities in this respect and will continue to discharge them.\n188.\tIn keeping with the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa and the Dar es Salaam declaration to which we subscribe, Nigeria notes with considerable interest that arrangements are being made for a constitutional conference as a follow-up of the Anglo-American initiatives on Zimbabwe. While we welcome the efforts to work towards a negotiated settlement, we should not be lured by Ian Smith into an impossible and unworkable position. Such is likely to be the result of the proposals for an interim Government announced by the leader of the rebel regime. According to Ian Smith, there is to be a council of ministers with a black first minister and a Council of State with legislative powers to be white dominated. It is obvious to us that the functioning of the council of ministers will be immobilized by that arrangement.\n189.\tIt is also clear that arrangements whereby the law-enforcing institutions -the military, finance and the judiciary- would be controlled by white ministers is unrealistic. An interim Government so constituted could and would easily interfere with the forces of change and thwart the process of evolution to majority rule, with their advantage of retaining the forces of law and order in Zimbabwe. Once those arrangements have given the racist government legality, there is the likelihood that, as soon as sanctions are removed and guerrilla action stopped, the racist Government of Ian Smith would renege on its obligations, to judge by the experience of the past.\n190.\tWe also understand that a trust fund is being set up for the purpose of compensating the white minority in Rhodesia. Those who wish to set up the fund appear to be oblivious to the suffering of thousands of blacks who are in goals and refugee camps and of many others in exile in various parts of the world. Nigeria is opposed to any such solution, which would not take the needs of the entire people in Zimbabwe, black and white, into consideration and would entrench white security at the expense of the blacks. Nigeria hopes, in addition, that independent Zimbabwe would not be burdened by such indebtedness for financing white security.\n191.\tI should make it clear that no solution in Zimbabwe can be expected to succeed unless the military wing and all ideological shades of the liberation struggle are carried along in any negotiations; otherwise, we shall again be faced with civil strife and with the world Powers jockeying for positions of advantage and aggravating the problems of Zimbabwe.\n192.\tI said earlier that this session of the General Assembly will to a large extent be judged by its reaction to the rapidly evolving events in southern Africa. Having played a commendable role in the process of decolonization, the United Nations cannot now be a mere bystander when the final push against the last bastion of imperialism and racism in Africa is in progress.\n193.\tWe in Africa have faith -faith in the inexorable forces of the wind of change which nothing can stop; faith in the human spirit which, as has been shown over and over, will not perpetually submit to oppression; faith in the basically good and sympathetic nature of the generality of mankind; faith that those who profit by oppression will find that in the long run they are bound to lose, unless they face realities early enough; faith, above all, that the United\nNations will ultimately live up to the ideals of its Charter, notwithstanding the obstacles placed in its path.\n"

        "file_text": "Speaking for the first time from this rostrum as the representative of a country whose policy is profoundly attached to the noble principles of dialog and tolerance, a country devoted to universal peace, the self-determination of peoples and their right to development and prosperity in justice and dignity, I cannot refrain from paying a tribute to all those today, dead or living, who have given their best for the foundation and survival of the United Nations. It is therefore with a feeling of deep pride mingled with deep emotion that I speak today before this Assembly. I am moved, I say, because it is in this very same great American city which offers us its hospitality each year, in this same glass palace, the symbol of truth and human solidarity, that is the scene where the fate and destiny of the world in profound change is determined and will continue to b? determined, a world which certain sorcerers' apprentices may bring to final catastrophe.\n39.\tI am proud, too, because as the representative of a country that cherishes peace and justice, I should like to state this here on behalf of my country, and particularly on behalf of the Head of State, His Excellency, President of the Gabonese Republic El Hadj Omar Bongo, who from this very rostrum  himself proclaimed the firm conviction, indeed the profound faith of the Gabonese Republic in the strength of this international Organization to measure up to the world crisis and to do so in total conformity with the spirit of the Charter. Accordingly, after the minute of meditation and silent prayer which we all observed in this hall at the beginning of this session, I appeal-if there is any need to do so-to all delegations to tackle the problems which confront us with the responsibility, the faith and the determination which the gravity of these questions demands. All the questions with which we shall have to deal in the course of our work will always have as their focal point man himself. Hence our paramount concern must be to guarantee man's physical, moral and spiritual well-being and his total and complete fulfillment.\n40.\tBefore turning to the substance of the subject, it is a particular pleasure for me, Mr. President, to convey to you the warm congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of our Assembly. We are convinced that your tried and tested abilities and your exceptional diplomatic qualities will permit you to measure up to the noble and highly delicate task which has been allotted to you. Furthermore, your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly is also a tribute to your great country, Sri Lanka, which recently so brilliantly played host to the important Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. The Gabonese delegation convinced, Mr. President, that our debates, which have always been distinguished in the past by moderation and restraint, will under your leadership preserve the same character of tranquility and judiciousness and will be carried on in a spirit of mutual respect, which is the sine qua non of the success of meetings as important as those of our Organization, meetings which for three months will be in the spotlight of the attention of the whole world, because they carry with them the hopes of a mankind which has been the victim of its own contradictions, a mankind torn by conflict and consumed by fear, but hungry for peace and thirsty for happiness. The experience which you have accumulated,' Mr. President, throughout a long and brilliant political and diplomatic career constitutes, in the view of my delegation, a guarantee of the final success of our work.\n41.\tThere is no need,, of course, to stress that these congratulations are also extended to the Vice-Presidents and the other officers of the Assembly who play such an important role by your side in the conduct of our debates.\n42.\tI am happy to pay a particularly well deserved tribute to the President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly for the remarkable work that he did at that session. Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for\n- Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a country which has very good relations with my own, caused us to marvel at the ceaseless mastery which he displayed throughout the last session, thanks to his perfect command of his role, his consummate skill and his remarkable dynamism. The results of the work of the last session were a striking success, which we attribute to the brilliant qualities of that statesman. I hope that he will find in this the profound expression of our congratulations and of our sincere gratitude.\n43.\tBefore turning to the views of my Government on the important items on our agenda, I should like to welcome among us the fraternal State of Seychelles. On behalf of the Gabonese delegation and people, it is my agreeable duty to bid welcome to this new Member of our great United Nations family.\n44.\tWe would have liked at the same time to welcome the fraternal State of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam among us. We venture to hope that the day is not too far off when these two States, which meet the conditions laid down by the Charter, will be among us. The admission of these two countries will genuinely give our Organization its proper universality,\n45.\tThere has been much talk of a world crisis situation, of a universe on the brink of collective suicide and, indeed, crisis and the temptation to collective suicide do undeniably exist, because there is no doubt that whichever way we turn we find war, repression, poverty, hunger, disease, racism in all its forms and the growing disintegration of the world economic order, whose appointed victims are of course the countries which are constructing their economies.\n46.\tWe are still living under hegemonism and selfishness of all kinds, phenomena which maintain inequality among men and different parts of the world. We are still living in the reign of hotbeds of tension and explosive situations, of which the most dangerous are, as everyone knows, southern Africa and the Middle East.\n47.\tThe peace and security for which we so ardently wish and the justice and happiness for which we so deeply yearn are a common heritage which nature has bequeathed to be shared equally among all men and all peoples on earth. They are not the preserve of any special category of men; they belong to all human beings. To disregard this truth, to deny this obvious fact would lead to frightening consequences and the most bloody tragedies.\n48.\tA mere handful of men of disparate minorities are, on the pretext that they' belong to the white race, making life a nightmare for the indigenous majority on this part of our continent.\n49.\tThese minorities belong to another age; they are deaf to the voice of all the other nations in the world; they refuse to restore their rights and their freedoms to the peoples which they keep under their domination; this is intolerable and unacceptable.\n50.\tThe policy of apartheid imposed by these white minorities of South Africa and Rhodesia on the black\nindigenous populations which they have stripped of their rights, their land and their resources is deeply repugnant to the human conscience. Such a reckless and short-sighted policy can only engender hatred, pit the various communities against each other and inexorably lead to violence and chaos. The events which occurred in Soweto and in other South African cities and which are still occurring there are a concrete illustration of this. This tragic situation would never have occurred if the South African authorities had taken the opportunity offered to them in 1969 by independent Africa through the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa.  Unfortunately, the Vorster racist regime and its white supporters have remained impervious to reason. They prefer to insist on carrying out their racial policy even at the risk of endangering international peace and security.\n51.\tGabon firmly condemns the policy of apartheid because it is absurd that this policy of the Government of South Africa should continue at the very time when our Organization has affirmed its determination to safeguard human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination. It it absurd that South Africa should continue to belong to our Organization when it is defying the Charter, its principles and United Nations resolutions as well as the public opinion of the whole world. Just as we condemn apartheid, so we condemn those countries which for commercial reasons are giving active assistance to this regime in maintaining itself thanks to various kinds of agreements, which thus give the regime the appearance of invincibility.\n52.\tWe know that the Vorster racist regime is still deaf to the appeals of the international community that it should see reason. Not only does this notorious regime refuse to change its policy inside South Africa but it has even extended it to Namibia, a Territory under United Nations administration.\n53.\tThe situation in Namibia causes us great concern. The Security Council should again take up this problem, which was the subject of its resolution 385 (1976) of 30 January 1976. If South Africa persists in its refusal to withdraw from Namibia-assisted as it is by certain countries-the Security Council should in that case have recourse to the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of our Organization.\n54.\tWe know that a so-called constitutional conference is now going on in Windhoek. Gabon firmly opposes this masquerade, which excludes the South West Africa People's Organization, the authentic and sole representative of the Namibian people. Gabon will also oppose the results of this conference, the only purpose of which is the \\\"bantustanization\\\" of Namibia and the establishment of puppet regimes in the pay of Pretoria.\n55.\tWith regard to the problem of Rhodesia, Gabon is following with particular attention the current efforts of Mr. Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, to find an acceptable solution for this distressing problem. However, there is a sacred principle which is non-negotiable for the Gabon Government: majority government. So what is necessary is an urgent transfer of power to the representatives of the black majority. The position stated on 26 September by the five front-line African Heads of State should serve as a basis for any negotiation. Gabon for its part will continue to provide material assistance and moral support to the courageous freedom fighters of Zimbabwe until they achieve final victory.\n56.\tOn the question of Comoros, we hope that the French Government, which has always shown such wisdom in decolonization matters, will grant this fraternal country it* legitimate claim in order to preserve the unity and integrity of its territory just as they were respected in the years of colonization.\n57.\tMy delegation is gratified at the process of decolonization which has already been embarked upon in Djibouti with a view to the independence of this Territory in accordance with the aspirations which have so often been expressed by its people.\n58.\tThe Middle East today is the most dangerous source of tension. Four frightful wars have caused a heavy loss of human life in that part of the world.\n59.\tThe deep reason for that situation is the refusal by the State of Israel to recognize the Palestinian factor. We do not think that there will be peace or detente in that area as long as the Palestinian people remains stripped of its rights. As everyone knows, the Palestinian people, uprooted from its territory, stripped of all its rights to return to its homes and property, is languishing in refugee camps. That people must have a territory, a national territory; it must exercise its rights as a people and as a nation. Any solution that fails to recognize that reality and that fails to provide for direct, full and complete participation by the Palestinian people, represented by the Palestine liberation Organization, in all conferences will not be acceptable. Peace in the Middle East cannot be based on the fruits of aggression. Israel must unconditionally withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied by force in 1967.\n60.\tThe Lebanese tragedy is of concern to my country, which has always had very good relations with Lebanon. Gabon very sincerely hopes that peace will return to that country. That peace can only be the result of mutual agreement among the Lebanese themselves, without any outside interference. Of course, the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon must be safeguarded.\n61.\tThe Cyprus crisis has, unfortunately, not yet been settled. In spite of the unanimous decisions taken by our Organization, Cyprus is divided into two separate territories, each with its own administration. Gabon firmly supports the efforts of our Secretary-General to find a solution acceptable to all the Cypriot communities, a solution that will safeguard the independence and integrity of the island.\n62.\tGabon is gratified at the fact that the Korean problem is no longer on our agenda. Gabon, which enjoys friendly relations with the two Korean States, believes that the settlement of the Korean question is to be sought in candid and sincere North-South dialog, and that that is the most realistic way of enabling the two parties to lay the groundwork for a peaceful solution without outside interference. The Korean question is a matter above all for the Koreans themselves. The role of our Organization is to help the two Korean States to meet again around a conference table in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country.\n63.\tWith regard to Latin American, I should like to assure the peoples of that continent of the whole-hearted support of Gabon for the efforts they are making to strengthen their national security. For Gabon is convinced that that is one of the most positive contributions to the historic current of the liberation of enslaved peoples.\n64.\tI should like on behalf of my country to extend here our warmest congratulations to the Mexican authorities for having established the Centre for Third-World Economic and Social Studies.\n65.\tIf, from a purely political point of view, the picture of the world we have just painted seems to us to be undeniably marked by disorder and disarray, that should surprise no one, because it is a consequence and a logical emanation of an anachronistic world economic system that is itself dominated by disorder.\n66.\tIndeed, that disorder is manifested in different forms, of which inflation, the worsening of the terms of trade, and the constant impoverishment of the third world are just a few examples.\n67.\tThat problem is of such concern and so crucial to our countries that it has led to the convening of two special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly to debate the matter and lay the foundations for a new and more just international economic order. Our country, which is a major producer of primary commodities, cannot be indifferent to this situation. Accordingly, the President of the Republic of Gabon, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, took an active part in the laying down of the guidelines for this new economic order, which from now on should take the greatest account of the interests of the primary- commodity-producing countries. And, in order the better to defend those interests, our country and other partners, following the example of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, have just established the Organization of Timber Producing and Exporting Countries.\n68.\tWithin the world structure of relations there is no sphere more manifestly saturated with inequalities, unilateral advantages and lop-sided contracts than the sphere of economic relations.\n69.\tIndeed, if we look at the world scene we see that about 80 per cent of world trade and about 95 per cent of private investment are controlled by a minority of States, while more than two thirds of the world's population continues to live in conditions of poverty.\n70.\tWe believe that the time has gone by when the international economic system was directed by that minority. We believe that the time has gone by when the will of that minority was imposed upon the majority.\n71.\tWe think that economic relations should be based upon new factors: interdependence, international solidarity, absolute sovereignty over primary commodities, the setting of prices for primary commodities at equitable and remunerative rates by producers, and active and respected participation by the developing countries in international economic negotiations.\n72.\tWillful disregard of those factors by the affluent countries is putting a brake on the actual establishment of the new international economic order, as defined and accepted by the international community during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly of our Organization. That bad will on the part of the developed countries is also at the basis of the partial failure of the fourth session of UNCTAD, in which the developing countries had placed so much hope.\n73.\tThe overcoming of the present economic crisis is a fundamental goal with a high priority. There can be no question of returning to a past which everyone acknowledges has been superseded.\n74.\tThe problem of under-development will be genuinely solved only if the developed countries manage to overcome their selfishness, which is at the basis of the poverty of the third-world countries.\n75.\tThe former relations of domination and dependence must give way to the legitimate interests of the vast majority of the international community. Any partial solutions or solutions that would take account of the interests only of the minority could not be supported. Solutions must be global and must be in keeping with the urgent needs of all the peoples of the world.\n76.\tIf there is one subject which is of the greatest interest with regard to the economy, development and sovereignty of nations, it is the subject of the ocean.\n77.\tAlthough its importance is not matched by any great interest on the part of the public at large, it remains crucial for contemporary needs, as indeed it has been crucial throughout the history of mankind. The ocean occupies 71 per cent of the earth's surface and is an inexhaustible source of wealth. Its role in the life of mankind has become particularly great in the past 10 years. That is why Gabon is following with very close attention the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n78.\tWe recognize that the problem of the oceans is very important and very complex, and that any hasty solution in this area is unacceptable. The Conference must take account of the legitimate interests of coastal States as well as the aspirations of land-locked States.\n79.\tGabon wishes to encourage the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to continue its work until it produces an international treaty on the subject.\n80.\tThe elimination of hotbeds of war and the settlement of all armed conflicts which are dividing nations constitute the first stage on the way to peace and security. The peoples of the world can live in peace only if they have a true sense of security untroubled by threats. When we realize that the military arsenals of the great Powers are each day being swollen by ever newer weapons, ever more sophisticated and improved weapons, ever more powerful and deadly weapons, when we realize that many developing countries are themselves embarking on an arms race-as an example, according to the Institute for Strategic Studies, the countries of Asia are devoting to the arms race about 1.9 per cent of their gross rational product and those of Africa about 5.3 per cent-our minds are clouded by doubt. Are the great Powers which play such a decisive role in the affairs of the world and are the only ones producing these arms and responsible for their dissemination really sincere and consistent when they speak of peace and call for disarmament?\n81.\tThe attitude of those merchants of weapons makes us doubt it. In the face of the risks to international peace and security posed by the production, accumulation and reckless distribution of armaments, it is becoming necessary to combat the folly of some in order to guarantee the security of others.\n82.\tAt a time when the threat of hunger is a reality to so many millions of people, vast amounts of money are being spent on the work of destruction. The gross indifference of the weapons merchants, the tranquil assurance of the buyers and sellers at a time when the business of supplying food to countries suffering from hunger poses such difficult problems, is something to cause us concern. The statistics of the World Bank show that in 1970 the world spent $183 billion on armaments-some 24 times the total amount allocated for aid programs. Military expenditure is rising by about 6 per cent a year, so that the growth of the forces of destruction is greater than that of the total production of all the goods and services in the world. We can therefore see that, in spite of speeches and conferences on disarmament, the international arms market has never been so prosperous.\n83.\tIt is therefore the duty of our Organization to step up its efforts and its actions in this area in order to prevail upon Member States to reach an agreement which would lead to general and controlled disarmament.\n84.\tBut the Government of Gabon is always wondering what can be the purpose of the bombs already stockpiled before She entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].\n85.\tIn order to assuage our fears and to give a satisfactory reply to all countries which dream only of peace, there is only one solution, and that is the solemn, formal banning of the production of new nuclear weapons and the immediate formation of international commissions under the aegis of the United Nations that will embark upon the systematic destruction of existing stockpiles. To us, failure to agree to that simply means the shirking of a sincere search for peace.\n86.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm here our unswerving faith in the United Nations. In spite of the difficulties in which our Organization finds itself, we hope that the international Community will continue its efforts to make of the United Nations an indispensable instrument for the building of a just and peaceful world order. Gabon, for its part, is ready to make its own modest contribution to the realization of this noble ideal. Long live the United Nations!\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure at the outset to offer Ambassador Amerasinghe the congratulations of the delegation of Bahrain on his election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. His wide knowledge and experience as an able statesman and diplomat has qualified him for this high office. I am fully confident that, with his wide experience in presiding over our deliberations, we shall reach valuable results, to the benefit of man and of progress.\n133.\tI commend also on this occasion the efforts of his predecessor, the President of the thirtieth session, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the competence which he showed at the last session, which produced positive results.\n134.\tOn this occasion, I should mention with all appreciation the efforts and remarkable diligence exercised by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for strengthening the role of the United Nations in all fields. The report which he has submitted at this session [A/31/1 and Add.l] shows the importance of the responsibility assumed by him for finding stable international conditions in which security, peace and prosperity prevail.\n135.\tThe international Organization is passing through, its thirty-first year with its universality strengthened by the increase of its Members to almost threefold what they were when it was established in 1945. Each year the Organization gives one proof after another of its universality and durability against challenges and obstacles. Last year a number of States which had obtained their independence after long struggle joined the Organization. I welcome the presence among us in this hall this year of the delegation of Seychelles, and congratulate, in the name of Bahrain, the people and Government of Seychelles on their independence and admission to this Organization. At the same time, I do hope strongly that all States possessed with the qualifications contained in the Charter will join the Organization.\n136.\tI am fully confident that the day will come soon when we will see all the peoples of Africa and other peoples in the world who still thirst for freedom and independence taking their place among us in this Organization.\n137.\tIn this respect, I should commend the work done in recent years by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for increasing the momentum of the movement for the independence of small nations in the world.\n138.\tThe world has become smaller owing to the tremendous technological advances in communications and in other fields. It is regrettable, however, that in this Organization we have not come further from what we were or nearer to what we seek to do. The most important objective of this Organization is to lead the people of the world to greater understanding and harmony.\n139.\tThis is due to the unnatural conditions prevailing in some parts of the world where racial discrimination and colonialist and Zionist greed prevail, as is the case in South Africa, Namibia, Palestine and-Rhodesia.\n140.\tFor years the United Nations has warned the racist authorities of South Africa of the consequences of their continuous occupation of Namibia and their racist policy in South Africa. They have not heeded or paid attention to such warnings, relying on moral support and military and material aid given to them by some Western States and by\nIsrael. Last year we criticized those States which were supplying the Government of South Africa with military and material aid, and warned that such support would drive the racist authorities to trespass on their neighbors in southern Africa. What we have expected has happened. Last July, the forces of South Africa crossed the frontiers of the Republic of Zambia and destroyed some of its villages and killed some civilians there. Today we .reiterate that the policy of military support given by some States will drive the military racist authorities of South Africa to commit incessant aggressions against the people of other neighboring States in Africa.\n141.\tThe bloody incidents that occurred in recent times in South Africa indicate that citizens there flatly reject the existing racist regime and look forward to living in a society that guarantees them their rights as nationals and safeguards their human dignity, as enjoyed by other people.\n142.\tWe believe that it is the duty of this Organization to do its utmost to terminate the imperialism of South Africa in Namibia and to frustrate its plans to partition that country and impose its rule there through a minority that does not represent the people for the purpose of perpetuating its domination over the country and of exploiting its resources. We should like to express on this occasion our appreciation for all the efforts made by the United Nations Council for Namibia to secure the independence of the people of that country.\n143.\tAgainst this situation we reiterate what we called for in the past, namely, that a complete blockade be imposed on the supply to the Government of South Africa of arms and military equipment, and that States which assist that Government should stop their military and economic support, in conformity with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations in this respect; that efforts should be increased to put pressure, by all means, on the Government of South Africa to abandon its colonization or disguised domination of Namibia and to give that country complete independence under the supervision of the United Nations, and to relinquish its abhorred policy of apartheid in South Africa.\n144.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the white minority Government continues to exploit the people of Zimbabwe, oppress them and deprive them of their legitimate national rights, in spite of warnings and repeated calls to give those people the opportunity to participate in the administration of their country in accordance with the principle of majority rule. We support the efforts being made these days to persuade the Government of Southern Rhodesia to change its racist policy and establish a democratic and just administration without discrimination as to race or color, and we hope that this will be done peacefully to avoid bloodshed and safeguard world peace and security.\n145.\tThe question of the Middle East, including the problem of Palestine, is one of the most important and complex problems facing this Organization, considering that the Organization bears a great responsibility with regard to this problem, which emerged when the Organization adopted the resolution for the partition of Palestine in November 1947 [resolution 181 (II)]. Since that time the area of the Middle East has not known security or stability.\nWhereas imperialism has collapsed in many parts of the world, the Middle East has been afflicted with something more disastrous: namely, settler racist imperialism, which is one of the cruelest forms, of injustice in history, where the land of the people of Palestine was usurped by force and they were expelled from it by brute force at the hands of foreign invaders who had come to establish a racist regime supported by imperialism.\n146.\tAs if this were not sufficient, Israel occupied in June 1967 the remaining parts of Palestine and other neighboring Arab lands. That was not the result of accidental war but part of the expansionist Zionist policy in the Middle East. In the years following the aggression of June 1967 Israel requisitioned Arab lands in occupied Palestine, expelled their owners and changed the landmarks of the country. It took military and political measures in all the occupied areas to strengthen its existence there, against the resolutions passed by the General Assembly and the Security Council to solve the longstanding crisis. The policy adopted by Israel in the Middle East is the greatest threat to peace and security in the area. The danger of war will persist as long as Israel continues its aggressive policy.\n147.\tThis Organization bears the responsibility for this situation by having originally adopted the resolution for the partition of Palestine. States also bear this responsibility when they support Israel by military and material aid and in its violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n148.\tThe bloody incidents which occurred in the occupied parts of Palestine, in the West Bank, Gaza and Galilee have shown the world that the Palestinian people are determined to get rid of Israeli domination and Zionist racist oppression and that they will accept no alternative to their land. Israel has tried to wipe out Palestine and the Palestinian people but it will never succeed. The Palestinian people within and outside the occupied territories are determined to survive and have decided to continue their struggle to recover their legitimate rights in Palestine. These rights have been confirmed by this Organization many times ever since Israel was created.\n149.\tNone the less, Israel continues its aggression against the neighboring Arab countries and its rule of the occupied territories, and plays a policing role in the area. The bloody clashes which are taking place in Lebanon and. which have cost numerous lives are no more than a result of this critical situation in the Middle East. This policing role of Israel has extended to other parts of Africa. The attack launched recently on the sovereignty of Uganda and on its airport is only one aspect of its arrogance and trespassing on the sovereignty of others.\n150.\tThe extent of the relationship between the two racist regimes-the Zionist in Israel and apartheid in South Africa has recently become clear to all as a result of the strengthening of the military and economic ties between the two regimes. This was not new to us, as we had already drawn attention to it and warned many times of it in the past. This relationship between the two racist regimes has existed for many years past, in which it has taken various forms of military , economic, political and diplomatic co-operation. This has been made clear by the report of the Special Committee against Apartheid which is submitted to us at this session [AI31/22]. It also proves the correctness of our firm stand in support of General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX) of the last session, which determined that Zionism was a form of racism and racial discrimination.\n151.\tIt is not a mere accident that bloody incidents recur in South Africa and cost hundreds of innocent lives of Africans, alongside the similar incidents which occur on the West Bank in Palestine, particularly every time the relation-ship is strengthened between the two countries, as happened after the return of Mr. Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa, from his recent visit to Israel. The aggression committed against Zambia last July and the role played by the forces of South Africa on the African continent are merely a reflection of the incessant aggressions waged by Israel against the neighboring Arab countries and the role it plays in the Middle East: both are part of the same racist policy of the two regimes.\n152.\tI do not wish to recall the many resolutions passed by the United Nations for the solution of the Middle East question and the problem of Palestine, which Israel flatly rejected. The important thing now is to find a peaceful, just and acceptable solution which would restore security and peace to the region. In our view, the solution of the problem of the Middle East is not confined to the conclusion of bilateral agreements between some countries in the area. The main problem is the question of Palestine and the Palestinian people and their entity and right in their land and heritage. The occupation of parts of the neighboring Arab States is no more than a result of the expansionist policy of Israel in the area. The solution of this problem lies in the complete withdrawal of Israel from the Arab lands occupied since 1967 and the return of the Palestinian people to their homes and granting them the right of self-determination, like any other people, through their representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n153.\tThe Security Council considered last June the report prepared by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people [A/31/35], which was convened under resolution 3376 (XXX) adopted by the General Assembly at the last session. The report, in our view, is good as a basis for finding a peaceful solution to the problem of Palestine. Although it does not contain all the matters we call for, yet it may be considered a positive step towards finding a sound basis for the solution of the problem of the Middle East in its entirety. As we see it, it is the least that the General Assembly should do to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Palestine. We believe that the plan proposed in the report to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their lawful rights in Palestine is pragmatic, as it takes into consideration the current situation in the Middle East.\n154.\tIt is regrettable that, in spite of the positive contents of the report, the Security Council was not able to take action upon it, because of the objection of a permanent member of the Council and its use of the veto. The report contains proposals and recommendations that go to the heart of the question of the Middle East, as we believe that any effort to solve this question without taking into consideration the lawful rights of the Palestinian people will never succeed. As this report is before the General\nAssembly at this session, we call for its support and confirmation and for all necessary measures to be taken to implement it, for the General Assembly bears great historic responsibilities at this stage to restore peace and comfort to the area of the Middle East.\n155.\tIt has become clear that this Organization is the only instrument for understanding and co-operation among States and for finding solutions to the economic, social and political problems facing the world, provided that States Members have the true intention and desire to co-operate and are prepared to avoid selfishness and national fanaticism.\n156.\tThe importance of this Organization in creating an atmosphere of co-operation and understanding among States has become evident on many occasions. Programs have been laid down for economic and social co-operation, for development, food, population, the regulation of the exploitation of the resources of the seas and other matters. Many conferences have been held for this purpose under the auspices of the United Nations, and reference may be made to some of them in which we participated this year.\n157.\tThe United Nations Conference on Human Settlements was held at Vancouver, in Canada, last June, in accordance with the General Assembly resolution of 9 December of last year [resolution 3438 (XXX)]. The Conference issued \\\"The Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements\\\" and recommendations for national action and international co-operation.  The Declaration and recommendations issued by the Conference contain principles and priorities for the establishment and location of human settlements, the protection of the environment and the satisfaction of the basic needs of all individuals in every country without discrimination, and other health, economic and social matters, for the purpose of improving the quality of life of human beings in general. Among the priorities adopted by the Conference to which we should like to refer in particular are the call for the rehabilitation of expelled and homeless people who have been displaced by natural or man-made catastrophes, and especially by the act of foreign aggression, and the duty of all States to co-operate to guarantee that such people return to their homes and recover their properties and belongings without obstruction or interference.\n158.\tWe support the recommendation adopted by the Conference that the General Assembly should at this session request the Secretary-General to prepare and submit to the next session a report on the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We believe that these principles and recommendations deserve attention and consideration.\n159.\tIt is regrettable that the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended here last month without reaching a general and comprehensive agreement on the law of the sea. It has been decided, therefore, to convene a sixth session in May of next year. It may be useful, however, to reflect on the difficulties which have stood in the way of reaching the agreement which we all seek, and th? progress which has hitherto been made.\n160.\tIt is well known that the seas cover almost two thirds of the surface of the earth; they are a principal source of food, energy and mineral resources and an essential means of transport and communication among States. No State can do without the resources of the seas, whether it is naturally favored by lying on wide seas or is less fortunate by lying on narrow seas or being land-locked. The interests of States vary according to their geographical location, navigational interests, technical or financial capabilities. It appeared during the discussions in the Conference that no agreement can be reached on one objective without the other, and that the only way to reach a general and comprehensive agreement is by way of compromise in a package deal accepted by all States in general.\n161.\tIt is known also that the subjects before the Conference are numerous and complex, and enough time to study, discuss and settle them would be needed. On the other hand, circumstances require that an agreement be reached as soon as possible to forestall unilateral actions which may lead to disputes and confrontation among States that would undermine the political and economic stability which we all seek. The continuous increase in the population of the world -which is likely to double in a quarter of a century-requires that speedy action be taken to exploit the resources of the seas in an atmosphere of amity and understanding, so that the basic needs of food and energy may be met for present and future generations.\n162.\tOpinions may differ on the extent of the real progress hitherto made by the Conference. There is no doubt, however, that some tangible progress has been made during the last five sessions. The Conference started work without a draft agreement or any basis for such an agreement-as happens in many conferences. At first it relied on numerous and at times conflicting proposals submitted by many States. It was able at the third session, held at Geneva last year, to issue an informal single negotiating text. At its fourth session, held in New York last March, the Conference issued an informal revised negotiating text and started discussion on other subjects.\n163.\tThe views have been crystallized and the points of difference were concretised during the fifth session, which ended last month. It is hoped, therefore, that States will make more effort to narrow their differences and agree on a general system for the seas which would be to the benefit of all. We hope also that States will not take unilateral actions before reaching the final agreement which we all seek; otherwise, any progress reached now in this respect would be wasted, and a valuable opportunity would be lost to mankind to regulate the exploitation of the resources of the sea for which we are now in great need.\n164.\tIt may be appropriate to refer to another important conference held this year at Colombo, Sri Lanka, between 16 and 19 August-the Fifth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, of which we have the honor to be a member.\n165.\tThe Fifth Conference of the non-aligned countries issued a Political Declaration, an Economic Declaration, an Action Programme for Economic Co-operation, and political and economic resolutions [see AI31I197]. The Political Declaration of the Conference made it clear that the non-aligned movement symbolizes mankind's search for peace and security among nations and the determination to establish a new and equitable international economic, social and political order. It consistently upholds the principle of international co-operation as the basis for a secure world order and opposes the notion that confrontation is the proper course for the comity of nations.\n166.\tThe Political Declaration indicated the stand of the non-aligned countries as regards many of the matters before us at this session, such as detente, and their criticism of its non-implementation, their opposition to all forms of colonialism, to racism and racial discrimination in South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and Palestine. The Conference made clear also the stand of its members on the situation in the Middle East, the questions of Palestine and Cyprus and problems in other parts of the world. It called for a special session of the General Assembly to be convened to review the question of disarmament and affirmed the support of its members for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n167.\tOn the other hand, the United Nations faces many difficulties in other fields owing to the failure of some of its Members to secure the implementation of its resolutions and the non-existence of an efficient system or a genuine desire of some interested States to enforce the will of the international Organization. This Organization has adopted many resolutions on many matters of importance to the family of nations. If all States Members worked for the implementation of those resolutions the world would not have been exposed to crises and all peoples would have lived in progress and prosperity. This Organization has adopted resolutions by great majorities on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the question of the Middle East and the problem of Palestine, in addition to many others in the political and social fields. Such resolutions were adopted by great majorities; but the minority, which can play an effective part in solving many of the problems before us, was not prepared in many cases to implement those resolutions.\n168.\tThe United Nations is the greatest international institution which can contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of peace and security in the world. This Organization has proved in the last 31 years that it can stand against international difficulties and challenges and can adapt itself to the changes occurring in international relations; nevertheless, the ability of this Organization to enforce its resolutions is still limited.\n169.\tWe believe that 31 years after the establishment of this Organization a review should be made of its system and some amendments introduced, so as to adapt it to the changes that have occurred in the world and the developments in international relations in recent years.\n170.\tWe consider it imperative that the role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of world peace and security be strengthened, in conformity with the principle of the sovereign equality of all Members of the international Organization, particularly as the maintenance of peace and security is of concern to all States, large and small. Important resolutions on vital matters threatening inter-national peace and security have been adopted by the General Assembly but have not been implemented, under the impression that they are not legally binding. When they were referred to the Security Council they were rejected by the use of the veto by a permanent member of the Council.\n171.\tWe believe that the veto should not be used for the purpose of blocking or preventing necessary measures to protect world peace and security or sanctions against flagrant violations of United Nations principles and decisions.\n172.\tThis situation has weakened the prestige of the United Nations and the value of its decisions in the eyes of the international community. Therefore, we urge that efforts be co-ordinated and proposals made to the enlarged Special Committee, which was reconvened by resolution 3499 (XXX) to review the Charter for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purpose.  We call also for the amendment of the Charter to conform to the principle of the sovereign equality of States.\n173.\tIt appears that the amendment of the Charter will not of itself be sufficient to introduce the necessary reforms in the system of the international Organization, unless it is accompanied by the firm intention of all Member States to enforce the resolutions of the majority in the Organization, in accordance with the Charter and the exigencies of international democracy. The strength of the Organization is derived from the will of its Members. Without solidarity in the enforcement of such an international will, many of the resolutions of the United Nations will remain ineffective and the temporary solutions applied by it, particularly in the field of maintaining international peace and security, will in the course of time develop into intractable problems threatening the existence of the United Nations itself and world peace in general.\n174.\tLast year we hailed the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in the belief that it was necessary to establish peace and stability in Europe and keep it out of the danger of a major war. This belief is based on the fact that Europe was the source of great wars that involved many States which had no interest in such wars and which were exposed to destruction. We believed that detente was necessary for peace and security. We regret, however, that such objectives have not all been achieved, as detente has been confined to relations between the big Powers within limited areas in the world.\n175.\tPolitical detente, if not supported by military detente in all parts of the world, particularly in areas exposed to tension and the threat of war, has negative results. Detente will not be complete unless all States concerned apply the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly for the maintenance of peace and security in the world, for the solution off the main political and economic problems and on the question of disarmament. Clearly, this means the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and adherence to the principles contained in the United'Nations Charter.\n176.\tWe reaffirm our support of the principle of peaceful coexistence among nations and the elimination of tensions from all parts of the world by safeguarding the security of all nations and allowing the participation of all States in the search for solutions to current international problems.\n177.\tThe elimination of tensions in the world will not be realized without finding solutions to existing problems in certain parts of the world. When aggression against nations is stopped, when some regimes are rid of the policy of racial discrimination, when States refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other States, when some States relinquish their policy of colonialism and when all economic relations are established on an equitable and just basis for all countries, then we shall have actually achieved the peace and security we seek for this world and then the principle of detente will be an established fact.\n178.\tThe General Assembly held two special sessions within the last two years to discuss international problems and reconsider the international economic order. To regulate economic relations in the world and establish them on an equitable basis for the progress and prosperity of the world, the General Assembly adopted at those two sessions declarations and resolutions aimed at an over-all change in current economic relations. Subsequently, many conferences were held to pursue these matters and initiate their implementation. It is regrettable to note that the developed States, which are supposed to have a better understanding of the problems of the third world, have not till now made substantial efforts to apply the principles and rules contained in the international Declaration and the Program of Action.\n179.\tThe continuation of these crises and economic problems with no attempt to solve them will inevitably tend to perpetuate the dangers that threaten many parts of the world. It is imperative that something be done to change the existing inequitable economic relations between the developing and developed States. We realize that it is primarily the responsibility of the developing States them-selves to achieve the progress they seek and that self- reliance is important for that goal. Therefore, such States are trying hard to discuss their problems with their partners of the developed States, which enjoy great privileges within the existing international economic relations. Seventy per cent of the population of the world, which now comprises the States of the third world, accounts for only 30 per cent of the total income of the whole world. It is to be noted, however, that these developing States are the source of much of the primary commodities upon which the industry of the developed States mainly depends and which are the source of their prosperity.\n180.\tThe elimination of the wide disparities between the developing and developed States cannot be accomplished without the co-operation of us all in the implementation of the principles of the new economic order. In fact, the spirit of understanding and co-operation which appeared during the discussions at the seventh special session still prevails, in spite of the failure of the fourth session of UNCTAD held in Nairobi to fulfill the hopes arising from the Manila Declaration.  The resolutions adopted at that session  , are, however, necessary for the achievement of the political objectives and for establishing justice and equity in inter-national economic relations. We hope that the door is still open for understanding and discussion.\n181.\tThe peoples of the third world are determined to attain economic and social progress and rid themselves of foreign domination over their destinies. This was made clear by the political and economic declarations issued by the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries, which was held in Colombo last August, and also emerged during successive conferences.\n182.\tThus we have many important matters before us at this session, which, we hope, will lead to positive and acceptable results in a spirit of co-operation and under-standing among all States. Millions of people in the world are looking to this Organization to save them from the evils of war and destruction and provide them and future generations with a life of peace, security and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "254. Since my appointment as Foreign Minister of Paraguay this is my first opportunity to address the General Assembly of the United Nations to express the view of my Government with regard to the extensive agenda for the discussion of which we are here convened. As is customary, may I begin by greeting all the representatives seated in this international arena: President Amerasinghe, whose efficient work in this normal climate, so well suited to his innate qualities deserves our praise; Prime Minister Gaston Thorn, whose keen clear-sightedness has left a shining imprint in the roster of those who have brilliantly presided over the deliberations of our Assembly in the past; and our Secretary-General, Mr.Waldheim who has, through the fruitful years of his activity, which we hope will continue in the future, shown constant and unequivocal proof of this great oecumenical vocation. I should also like to welcome most cordially the Republic of Seychelles, which has become a Member of our Organization, and in so doing places in it high hopes for its future, with a promise on our part not to disappoint them in this joyous undertaking to preserve peace and to act together to promote the economic and social progress of all the peoples of the planet.\n255.\tThe balance of power is governed by well-entrenched patterns which hardly ever change for the simple reason that history has been weaving an increasingly complex fabric of appetites for prestige and domination. Thus those who do not have power are at the mercy and whim of those who use this power as the dreadful tool of their conduct. However, this Organization seeks, through the proclamation of its principles and objectives, to establish the rule of reason^, and under its protection we welcome those peoples to whom fate has denied the opportunities given to others of being the only lords of war and peace. It is with eagerness and uncertainty that we struggle, and our agony is a reflection of our faith in the principles laid down in Chapter I of the Charter.\n256.\tFor this reason, although not always with encouraging results, we come here year after year to profess our persistent faith in the imponderable forces which govern mankind and without whose existence and assistance our planet would more than once have turned into a pyre of atomic madness.\n257.\tAnd thus, for countries like mine, and we are a majority here in this Assembly, the issue of world peace is only the repeated expression of a hope which we voice with some trepidation, since the political decision to establish it on firm and lasting foundations is beyond our control. However, despite our handicap, we realize that our unity is a powerful tool with which to destroy the frontiers of scepticism and thus Paraguay, in its association with the United Nations, contributes its enormous spiritual strength to the cause of peace.\n258.\tAs in the case of human beings where somatic make-up and physical traits are merely accidental, we do not recognize some countries as being greater than others because of the size of their territory or their population, or some as being more deserving than others merely on the basis of computer data. For us, the peoples of the United Nations, there is only one criterion of dignity, and that is purity of blood gained at the service of great ideals. Because of its heroic past and its promising present my country, Paraguay, occupies its rightful place in this Assembly of the peoples and believes it is its urgent duty to play an active role in this contest where, in the final analysis, the fate of the universe itself is being played out. My country occupies a seat of honour in this Assembly because it has forged its ultimate shape, its features, and its personality through hard work and virtues difficult to acquire; and let this just patriotic exaltation stand in support of the voice of a nation which feels genuinely self-confident.\n259.\tClearly, out of the many items on the agenda before the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, all important, there are some on which we should like to dwell, be it ever so briefly, because of their special interest for our country.\n260.\tWe have the highest regard for the extremely important functions of the Security Council and those of the Office of the Secretary-General, and when we recall the crucial role which they have played in dealing with numerous crises, we can expect from them nothing less than the strictest, even heroic accomplishment of their lofty mission. Often they hold the thread of life itself in their hands, and Paraguay, like the overwhelming majority of the countries represented here, has full confidence in the vital mechanism of this world body, and we hope that the elections that will take place for several vacant posts will justify cur confidence in their sound and serene judgement.\n261.\tAs the protagonists of this problem in days gone by, and because of our own experience, we have a well-defined position on colonialism, although this word, like many others in modern international parlance, often lends itself to regrettable misinterpretations. Accession to independence is a right which cannot be denied if the necessary requirements exist to meet the challenges of independent life; but the rupture of administrative links is not always the right solution. Indeed, there are cases where the process of self-determination should avoid giving the stamp of approval to former ownership of territories which, by history and by law, belong to other political entities. Thus my delegation will support all efforts made to find the right solution for each individual case.\n262.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea resulted in a number of valuable achievements. The 1958 Geneva Conventions did not fully meet the challenges offered by the sea at that stage in the history of technology. Countries that have from time immemorial derived profit from their seashores, as well as those which were deprived of them, turned to the ocean in search of wealth with great hopes and aspirations. For although trade is facilitated by the ownership of seaports, with modern means of communication and existing conventions on terrestrial transit, trade is no longer the only reason why nations want to have a coastline. Science and technology have discovered new wealth in the subsoil of the sea bed, a wealth which makes their possession especially desirable, and as the population explosion, which reduces our breathing space, creates new and urgent problems concerning food and the production of energy, the sea offers ever greater opportunities to overcome these crises through the efficient exploitation of fishing industries and the skilful utilization of petroleum as well as other mineral resources of the sea.\n263.\tHowever, the Third Conference does not seem to hold the promise of satisfactory solutions. The conquest of the sea will go the way of the conquest of the earth and although certain limits may be established now which seem to meet present needs, we seriously wonder whether in future the criteria and aspirations of this Conference will prevail.\n264.\tThe proposal for an \\\"exclusive economic zone\\\" of 200 miles has given rise to serious differences of opinion, as land-locked countries still wonder whether they will be given what they consider to be theirs by right, namely the possibility to share in the benefits of the exploitation of the resources of the sea. Faced with this uncertainty and for political, historical and geographical reasons, Paraguay will continue to seek solutions to this fascinating and fundamental question of the law of the sea through bilateral negotiations.\n265.\tThis is an extremely important undertaking not unlike that which has transported man from his planet into outer space. Those who with optimism and courage embarked upon this great adventure are in a manner of speaking the new conquerors of modern times.\n266.\tMay I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe for his conduct of the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea, from which we continue to expect the positive results due to his great ability and enthusiasm.\n267.\tWe are all concerned with the question of disarmament but we recognize with satisfaction the efforts made by the Ad Hoc Committees to ease the tensions caused by this old but persistent problem. We have crossed the half-way point in the Disarmament Decade and yet regrettably no effective progress has been made which could allay our fears. Many commendable efforts have been made to achieve denuclearization in various parts of the planet, designed to bring about general and complete disarmament, and yet we are concerned as we observe the beginnings of an arms race in the Americas. We hope that this existing war fever will soon pass, for it is the duty of our countries to seek integration rather than aggression.\n268.\tParaguay is sensitive to the question of human rights and I mention this specifically because our country has been the target of a malevolent campaign designed to undermine its international prestige.\n269.\tEach nation has its own way of life and ours was shaped many centuries ago when the peaceful settlements of the Guarani Indians intermarried with Spanish soldiers. The result was the birth of a nation that has the highest regard for life, freedom and independence, which are rooted in our existence. My country has never had an ethnic, social, or religious problem which could jeopardize its unity or prosperity. There is no racial discrimination or other forms of discrimination in Paraguay. The Government of the Republic continues, as always, to make every effort to incorporate into society the few indigenous groupings in its territory which are still outside the mainstream of civilization.\n270.\tCertain modern philosophical and political trends, particularly certain Marxist philosophies, have tried to subjugate the will and the thoughts of the Paraguayan people to foreign interests. This ill-intentioned attempt to disrupt the harmonious development of our nation has been unanimously rejected by our people. However, this propaganda campaign has made allegations of violations of human rights, attempting to distort the meaning of the legitimate defence measures which our Government has taken and will continue to take in order to protect our nation against those who are plotting to subjugate us to Communist imperialism. Thanks to the political stability of the Government of President Stroessner, Paraguay can boast of a record of continued progress which has enabled it to maintain a stable currency, to exploit its natural resources, and to establish progressively the necessary infrastructure to bring about a speedy development of the country and the improvement of our democratic form of Government.\n271.\tFor all these reasons, we, like others, are concerned with the question of human rights and our delegation will give its unswerving support to all initiatives designed to ensure their real protection.\n272.\tThere is another item closely related to this one and that is international terrorism. This painful experience, together with the threat of nuclear war, is the inexplicable price of a better world. We strongly condemn all violence and, as the most brutal expression of a return to primitive animality, this infernal machine must be rooted out lest our so-called \\\"civilization\\\" be allowed to perish in misery. We are prepared to give our firm support to all drafts designed effectively to combat terrorism, this modern version of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n273.\tThe Organization has convened a United Nations Water Conference, to be held next year, a subject to which my country attaches special importance. The world's population growth, industrial activities, the expansion of farmlands, as well as other lesser problems make the existing sources of water supply inadequate. The large human settlements which have changed the landscape have also created an ecological imbalance which is reflected in inadequate rainfall and an alarming index of water pollution and erosion.\n274.\tThere now exists an awareness of these problems among States and international organizations, and this is reflected in the holding of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the International Hydrological Decade, the World Weather Watch programme, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements and the studies prepared by various committees on natural resources and the environment. All these initiatives emphasize the importance of the forthcoming water Conference, to which we will give our special support and from which we expect encouraging results.\n275.\tThese are the general guidelines which the delegation of Paraguay will follow in dealing with the questions to which I have specifically referred. I wish to express the hope that the deliberations of this session of the Assembly may contribute to strengthening our faith in a troubled world which, perhaps without quite realizing, continues to cling to certain irreplaceable values which will always serve to explain the wondrous daily miracle of life in this region of the universe, so dear to our hearts, which we call earth.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all I should like to convey to you and, through you, to the representatives gathered here the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.\n157.\tLet me associate myself, Mr. Prudent, with the sentiments expressed by various speakers in extending to you our sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of the presidency of this session. The Assembly, in electing you as the President, has bestowed a fitting recognition and honor upon you as a distinguished diplomat and statesman of a great Asian country, SriLanka. The vast knowledge and experience you have gained in your distinguished career will undoubtedly contribute to the success of this session. May I extend, on behalf of my delegation, assurances of our full co-operation with you in the discharge of that heavy responsibility of which you and all of us are so well aware.\n158.\tMr. President, just a month ago your beautiful island country had the honor of acting as host to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. We still vividly recall the success of the Conference and, also, the warm hospitality accorded to us by the Government and people of SriLanka, with whom we have close and cordial relations. We shall cherish for a long time to come the attitude of understanding and co-operation shown to us by your Government at the Conference.\n159.\tI also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the services rendered by your distinguished predecessor, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who discharged his functions as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly in a most exemplary manner.\n160.\tMy delegation is happy to welcome the Republic of Seychelles in our midst as an independent and sovereign country. The admission of Seychelles to the United Nations is a positive step towards the attainment of the principle of universality of this Organization. This clearly manifests the decline of colonialism and also indicates the principle of the equality of nations.\n161.\tWe welcome the reunification of Vietnam. My delegation is confident that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam will soon find its rightful place in this world Organization and play a dynamic role in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n162.\tEvery year we gather in this Assembly to review and seek solutions to major world problems. Positive and satisfactory developments have taken place in certain parts of the world, but by and large we are still confronted by the same old issues and problems which have taken most of the time of our debate. The situation in the Middle East remains critical; apartheid and racial discrimination still endure in southern Africa; and the arms build-up seems to be the main preoccupation of the major Powers. Among other issues, the questions of Korea and of Cyprus remain to be solved. The problem of the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor countries remains as acute as ever and more pressing than before.\n163.\tAs a peace-loving nation, Nepal is deeply concerned over the situation in the Middle East, which remains explosive. Nepal is of the firm belief that any problem or dispute, given goodwill and co-operation between the parties involved in the crisis, can be peacefully solved through constructive dialog and negotiations. But peace will not prevail in the Middle East so long as Israel continues to occupy forcibly and illegally Arab lands. We plead once again, as we have done in the past, for the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied since 1967. It is equally important that Israel cease all its activities which relate to demographic change in the occupied territory. In my delegation's view, any solution loading to a settlement of the Middle East problem must take into consideration the national rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right to create a homeland of their own. Furthermore, a just solution of the Middle East problem must ensure the right of every State in the region, including the State of Israel, to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\n164.\tAt present, the wont form of chaos, turmoil and war prevails in Lebanon, a small non-aligned country at one time peaceful and beautiful. For more than a year the people of Lebanon have been deprived of peace and tranquility. My delegation wishes to express our profound \nsympathy to the people of Lebanon for the sufferings that have been their lot through no fault of their own. My delegation strongly feels that Lebanon should be left free to decide its own destiny.\n165.\tPhenomenal progress has been made in the field of decolonization, but the last remnants of colonialism, oppression and racial discrimination still subsist in southern Africa. The South African regime is making every effort to convince the international community that it is undertaking reforms in South Africa that it is keen for a settlement in Zimbabwe and that it is leading Namibia to independence soon. The so-called reforms in South Africa have so far proved to be more propaganda on the part of the racist regime to divert world opinion from the struggles of the majority black people for self-determination and independence. The racist regime is not only denying fundamental rights to the majority black people, in contravention of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, but is also trying to accelerate the fragmentation of the international Territory of Namibia into so-called \\\"Bantu homelands\\\" in defiance of the decision of the International Court of Justice.\n166.\tThe decision of the General Assembly at its twenty- ninth session to bar the South African delegation from participating in the work of the Assembly was motivated by the desire that the Pretoria regime should come to understand and appreciate the basic values of human life, and thus terminate its heinous policy of apartheid. But the recent killings at Soweto and at other black townships in South Africa clearly indicate that the South African regime is not yet willing to abandon its inhuman policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. The decision of South Africa to grant so-called independence to Transkei is nothing but \\\"eyewash\\\" and only serves to perpetuate the political domination of the racist regime.\n167.\tIn Zimbabwe, the racist minority regime continues, in spite of its promises for constitutional reforms, to resort to ruthless oppression, repression and exploitation of the indigenous people. My country has always supported and will continue to support the people of South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe who are waging just and legitimate struggles for equality, freedom and national independence. Furthermore, we welcome any constructive effort that may help attain the legitimate aspirations of the majority people of southern Africa.\n42\n168.\tThe situation in Cyprus remains as grave as ever. Cyprus, a small non-aligned country, still endures the consequences of foreign intervention. The cessation of all foreign interference and the withdrawal of all foreign, armed forces from Cyprus are vital if constructive dialog is to take place between the two Cypriot communities. Nepal firmly supports and respects the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. Thus, as in the past, we will continue to reject the notion of a State within a State. However, the continuing stalemate in Cyprus indicates that no genuine efforts are being made by the parties involved in the dispute to solve the Cyprus problem. We appeal to the two Cypriot communities to forget their minor differences and resume negotiations once again with a view to finding a just solution to this problem.\n169.\tNepal supports the reunification of more than 50 million Korean people in a single nation. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea are the principal parties to this problem, and we believe that reunification should be peacefully achieved through the efforts and agreement of the parties concerned. The international community should encourage them to resume negotiations to that end.\n170.\tIt is encouraging to note that some progress has been made in the field of disarmament, but, unfortunately, the arms build-up continues to proceed at an alarming rate. My country continues to express its deep concern over the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. As a peace-loving nation, we also oppose all proliferation of nuclear weapons and their testing in all environments. My country believes that a comprehensive test ban is the principal step towards nuclear disarmament. Hence, we appeal to the nuclear-weapon States to resume negotiations in good faith and without further delay on a comprehensive test-ban agreement.\n171.\tBillions and billions of dollars are spent annually on discovering new types of sophisticated nuclear weapons. We feel that, in view of the deteriorating condition of the world economy, the nuclear-weapon States should channel part of their armaments budget to assistance to developing countries. Such a step would not only improve the economy of the developing countries but also create a favorable atmosphere for international peace and security.\n172.\tWe find that nuclear arms proliferation is no longer limited, to the major Powers. There are also emerging Powers which have the capability of developing nuclear arms and are keen to acquire sophisticated nuclear weapons. Hie arms build-up has been the major concern of all peace-loving countries, and therefore my delegation feels that a world disarmament conference should be held under the auspices of the United Nations as early as possible.\n173.\tLet me take this opportunity once again to reiterate my delegation's support for General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)S regarding the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Our continued support for that declaration is based on our desire for peace and stability in that sensitive area. We hope that all possible efforts will be made to implement the declaration as early as possible.\n174.\tSimilarly, my delegation considers that the proposal of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations for a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality is a constructive effort towards the strengthening of the peace, stability and development of the South-East Asian region. We fully and strongly support this effort. My own country has offered itself as a zone of peace, and this has been clearly reflected in several addresses and speeches by His Majesty the King of Nepal. Recently during the Fifth Conference in Colombo, His Majesty King Birendra made the following observations:\n\n\\\"In February last year, I made the proposition that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. This proposition \nimplies a desire, on our part, to look for a permanence in our country's destiny when, free from turmoil or turbulence, we can work out our future in peace and freedom. For a country placed in a geopolitical situation such as that of Nepal, there is nothing unnatural about harboring a desire for peace. Nepal wants no situation, either for the present or in perpetuity, that leaves room for tension, fear or the anxiety of instability. This is not to suggest that the Nepalese have misgivings about other countries. Far from it, we have relations of peace, friendship and co-operation with all countries of the world, particularly with our neighbors, and our efforts to develop these relations further on the basis of co-operation and understanding continue. For the moment, we are wholly committed to an orderly and uninterrupted economic development for our people. Being a small land-locked country, we hardly can afford to waste our resources on presumptions. On the contrary, exigencies demand that we continue to intensify our efforts at economic development. Hence the zone of peace proposition, which in our view gives substance to our faith in the principles of both the United Nations and non-alignment.\\\"\nThe proposal for a zone of peace is, therefore, an expression of our desire to carve out a permanent destiny for our nation in an atmosphere of absolute peace and tranquility. In this connexion, I want to make it very clear that Nepal is prepared to enter into all necessary commitments, such as a guarantee against the use of our soil for any hostile activity against another country. We believe that the institutionalization of peace alone can make for the speedy and uninterrupted development of my country.\n175.\tWe are now in the middle of the Second United Nations Development Decade. The International Development Strategy for this Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has been biennially reviewed, and the mid-term review was also made during the last session. During the last four years, we have seen two special sessions devoted exclusively to economic problems. The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States was also adopted [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. In spite of such resolutions and programs of action, die question still remains, Has there been substantial progress on the economic front? The answer, to our regret, is in the negative. The world economic situation continues to present a depressing picture. Though the economy of the developed countries has somewhat recovered from recession, the deteriorating conditions of the developing countries have further worsened.\n176.\tThe trend of growth of the least developed among the developing countries is even more alarming. If no special measures are urgently taken to mitigate their specific problems, not only will the gap of economic disparity between them and the developed countries continue to widen but also the very basic problems of food, clothing and shelter faced by the vast majority of people, who are virtually hungry and naked, will continue to grow more acute and complex. Urgent and increased inter-national assistance and co-operation should, therefore, be generously forthcoming for alleviating the plight of these less fortunate among the developing countries.\n177.\tIt is a matter of regret that the record of present international assistance shows a discouraging downward trend. The contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product by the developed countries set as the target in the Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has not been realized; and the volume of international assistance is actually decreasing both in percentage and in real value. During my statement before this body last, year  I suggested that the assistance for international development should be conceived of as \\\"international taxation\\\" for the richer and developed countries, so that they might gradually accept it as their responsibility and obligation to contribute towards inter-national economic development. I still hold this view, because I strongly feel that, though the primary responsibilities for economic development lie with the countries concerned, the developed countries have a special responsibility for bettering the lot of developing countries through generous assistance in terms of both finance and technology.\n178.\tMy delegation is convinced that the new inter-national economic order should be further pursued with a view to the more successful implementation of its action program, so that all countries of the world could justly and equally share the benefits of the world's prosperity.\n179.\tWe are aware that the fundamental problem of the developing countries lies in the pattern of their economy itself. The economic pattern of the developing countries, which are mainly dependent on the production and distribution of primary goods and raw materials, is responsible to a great extent for their disadvantageous position in the world economy. The restructuring of the world economic order, by consolidating the positions of countries producing raw materials and primary goods, has been the main subject of discussion in various international forums for quite some time. New measures have been suggested and various initiatives taken with a view to their implementation by the Group of 77 in Manila, in Nairobi and, recently, in the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries.  Though at Nairobi final agreement could not be reached on the integrated pro-gramme for commodities, nor could the proposal for a common fund for financing the internationally owned buffer stocks be unanimously adopted, it is, however, a matter of satisfaction that a basis, or rather a framework, for future action has been laid down. We are of the conviction that, with political will on the part of the developed countries to co-operate with their less fortunate brethren, the future negotiations to be carried out by UNCTAD over the period of 18 months, in accordance with the mandate given to it at Nairobi, can yield fruitful and equally acceptable results in these fields.\n180.\tApart from the question of commodities, trade, manufactures, finance and external debt, the transfer of technology, co-operation among developing countries and trade with countries having different economic and social systems are some of the areas of vital concern for the economic development of the less developed countries -that is, of the developing countries. We are aware of various painstaking negotiations being carried out in all these fields in various international forums, including the Paris' Conference on International Economic Co-operation. Though the outcome of the Paris negotiations-the north-south dialog, as it is called-has not been so encouraging, we very much hope that the current session of the General Assembly will review the progress of the Paris Conference and persuade the participating countries to continue the dialog to reach a commonly acceptable formula which might provide a valid basis for future international economic co-operation.\n181.\tThe Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, recently held in Colombo, has come up with many important decisions and an action program in various fields of economic co-operation among developing countries, on the one hand, and international economic co-operation, on the other. As economic co-operation among the developing countries forms one of the important agenda items of the present session, the decisions of the Fifth Conference might serve as a useful basis for discussion.on that subject. The United Nations forum might, we believe, greatly contribute to fostering and further developing the economic co-operation among the developing countries which has been accepted to be one of the most important and necessary factors for rapidly improving the economy of the third world.\n\n182.\tAs a representative of a least developed and land-locked country, I would fail in my duty if I did not explain the additional hardship borne by my country. The geographically disadvantageous position arising out of the land-locked character of my country-which is the main obstacle to our economic development-coupled with many other serious problems is responsible for the least developed nature of our economy. Through you, Mr. President, we implore this body to give serious consideration to the specific and other related problems of countries in this category, because without the recovery of the low-income and poorest group of countries from prolonged economic hardship, the economic uplifting of the developing countries as a whole is not conceivable. The question of filling the gap of economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries will be a matter of frustration to the poorest and weakest if they are left behind without due attention being given.to their problems. We fully realize the importance of the proposal for reviewing the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade and very much hope that the revision will include special measures of priority for mitigating the problems of such countries.\n183.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which just concluded its fifth round of negotiations without agreement, cannot be viewed in isolation from the efforts to establish a new international economic order which is the preoccupation of all countries today. In the context of a new international economic order, the Conference on the Law of the Sea must evolve an international convention which is just and equitable. Such a convention cannot be just and equitable if it fails to take into account the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, including the landlocked ones. However, it is regrettable that the coastal countries have remained adamant on certain issues that vitally concern the land-locked countries. It should not be forgotten that pressure tactics being used by the coastal countries do not yield fruitful results and cannot help to promote international co-operation and understanding. There have been several multilateral conventions in the past. The convention to be adopted by the Conference on the Law of the Sea should be one that is acceptable to all. My delegation hopes and trusts that the forthcoming session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea in May will be able to elaborate a convention to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned.\n184.\tMy country being a land-locked one, the question of transit trade and access to the sea is of paramount importance for our survival as a sovereign, independent entity. We insist on the recognition of free access to the sea and unrestricted transit in terms of free flow of goods and people as the natural right of land-locked countries. We urge the coastal countries and the international community to recognize the difficulties of land-locked countries and take a positive attitude in this regard.\n185.\tBefore I conclude, allow me to say a few words about this Organization, which has emerged as a community of nations. My delegation reiterates its faith in this august body which, despite its occasional reverses, has played a vital role in maintaining international peace, security and understanding. This world body has been seized of, and taken decisions on, major issues such as the establishment of a new international economic order, food, population, the environment, the law of the sea and so many others. The creation of a new world order is the responsibility of all, big or small, developed or developing. We strongly believe that no nation can live in peace and amity unless the entire family of nations represented by this world body is developed as an organic whole. This end can be achieved if all of us, particularly the countries which are in a more advantageous position, are willing to sacrifice a little of our interests for the common good of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "In the name of the Government and people of Liberia, I am pleased to congratulate and salute you, Mr. President, and the people of the land from which you hail, and to extend felicitations on your unanimous election to the office of President. Your personal preeminence as Chairman of the various sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and your profound conversance with the endeavors of the United Nations; your skilful identification with the constructive and progressive forces for a new world order free from injustices and discrimination and free for equitable resource application, all confirm our belief that this session of the General Assembly, under your wise guidance, will fulfill its awesome responsibilities in these challenging times.\n3.\tThe Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who skilfully guided the work of the General Assembly of the United Nations during its thirtieth session, similarly deserves our high commendation, and we congratulate him on his successful handling of the affairs of that thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n4.\tWe must also express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldlieim, our thanks and appreciation for his lucid annual report on the work of the Organization [A/31/l[Add.l], which clearly presents the current state of international relations and appeals for positive international statesmanship in order to prevent a deterioration in relationships among nations. To the Secretary-General, for his sincere and continuing efforts in the interest of advancing genuine international peace and security, we pay a special tribute.\nA/31/PV.9\n5. In regard to the recent home going of a great Chinese statesman and patriot of renown, Chairman Mao Tsetung, who has left an indelible mark on history, I renew the sentiments of profound regret of the Government and people of Liberia for the irreparable loss sustained by the Government and people of the People's Republic of China.\n6.\tOn the occasions when I have been privileged and honored to speak from this rostrum I have endeavored to share with this august Assembly the concern of the Government and people of Liberia and have called for accelerated progress towards the realization of a new world order that would be responsive to the legitimate aspirations of all peoples in our one world. Since 1974 the world itself has made perceptible progress towards the evolution of that new order of international co-operation based on economic equity and social justice. On the other hand, the world has palpably failed to answer the cries for fundamental freedoms and human dignity. Nevertheless, as I review with you today the advancement in global reform and the regression in sacred human values, I remain convinced that political will and moral purpose and a fortified world conscience of dignity and development these alone can bring the collective strength of peace and prosperity to this, our one world. These alone can forge strengthened co-alliance among institutions and peoples and nations. These alone can banish the imminent rift of cleavages and confrontation and prevent disastrous conflagration.\n7.\tThe Government of Liberia considers it extremely significant that newly independent States seek membership in the United Nations. We are convinced that through the United Nations in particular can be created the true international community so essential to global and inter-dependent aspirations. But, more than this, we are convinced that it is only through the United Nations that the legitimate interests of all nations alike can be safeguarded and upheld.\n8.\tNothing, therefore, gives me greater joy and satisfaction at this time than to salute the Republic of Seychelles, a sister African State which has been admitted as the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of this Organization following its admission to the Organization of African Unity and the non-aligned movement. This is another milestone in our journey towards the goal of universality of membership, a universality which we earnestly hope will soon embrace all independent States, especially those recently liberated from the yoke of colonialism. We extend to the brotherly people of Seychelles our heartiest congratulations and very best wishes.\u2003\n9.\tWhile we welcome our sister 'African State to member-ship in this Organization, we note with deep regret that the People's Republic of Angola, a sister African State, has after a long and arduous struggle for freedom unfortunately experienced a denial which impedes the advancement of the principle of universality of membership.\n10.\tIn this connexion the time seems at hand when the United Nations must undertake a progressive adjustment of the veto power so as to place it in conformity with the democratization of international relations. As a first step we should here and now most seriously consider building into the current veto arrangement the requirement that the admission of independent States to membership in the United Nations be determined outside the framework of the veto by a two-thirds majority vote of the membership of the Security Council.\n11.\tMeanwhile it remains our ardent hope that very soon Angola will rightfully take its appropriate seat as a full Member of this world body.\n12.\tThe people of Africa, seized with a consciousness of affinity, are being drawn closer and closer together. Once divided by apparently insurmountable barriers of language, ustance, political intrigues and sectionalism, Africans are more aware of their indivisibility even against the forces of tension, of conflict and of social advantages and disadvantages. They recognize (hat their principle source of lasting peace and security lies in the mutual understanding of each other's problems and in collective efforts at eradicating their disabling effects.\n13.\tImbued with a sense of mutual respect and an equitable sharing of the advantages of modern technological advances, Africans, I can firmly say, will march together with all the nations of the world in a collective effort towards achieving the victory of peace over war, the triumph of love over hatred, and the supremacy of solidarity over discrimination, towards the dominance of prosperity over poverty, towards the imposition of human rights over human wrongs, towards the ascendancy of multiracial aspiration over selfish nationalism.\n14.\tIndeed, if the 31 years of existence of this Organization have taught us anything, it is that the United Nations is a durable and highly viable Organization, that the vision of those who drew the founding plan was indeed far- sighted, and that the soundness of its guiding principles is unshakable.\nIS. Yet, as new perspectives and new experience follow change, and as change is a fundamental characteristic of our world, the Organization must be strengthened and made more responsive to the requirements of our times. Indeed, the efforts initiated at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and advanced in a number of other international forums, with particular reference to the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations with the aim of redressing structural imbalances and creating a more equitable system for the benefit of the entire world community, must be pursued with greater vigor, with urgency and collective commitment, in order to hasten the dawn of a new world order.\n16.\tIt must be the mission of the United Nations today to shape and give direction to this new order, for upon the speedy realization of this new order rest the very requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security, the continuing purposes of our great Organization.\n17.\tI speak of an order which would seek to introduce into contemporary international relationships the concept of the family of man, a family whose members are interdependent, interested in the welfare and respectability of the community of nations and of one another, a family of nations wherein territorial integrity is inviolable, where international piracy is not permissible.\n18.\tI speak of a new order that will actively battle to eradicate from human society the age-old enemies, ignorance, disease and poverty. I speak of a new order free from prejudices and complexes, from rancor and recoil. I speak of a world order where majority rule will freely embrace inviolable equal rights for all.\n19.\tBy both the circumstances of its birth over 129 years ago and the hostile external environment in which it existed during its early years-conditions which have contributed to the shaping of its unalterable convictions-Liberia has been impelled always to give uncompromising and constructive support to oppressed peoples struggling for their freedom and their inalienable rights. We solemnly reaffirm that support and renew here our commitment to buttress the legitimate efforts of all peoples striving to attain self-determination and independence.\n20.\tAs I stand here today, representing the people of Liberia, I assure you of our hearts' most fervent wish that abundant strength and courage be the possession of those who strive for a world of reason and understanding; that the good in all men be magnified; and that those issues which unite them, not those which divide them, will be distinctly perceived. It is our deepest wish that, as we move forward within our one world, we shall envisage the victory of man over his own evils and human frailties and that ultimately will prevail that peace within which to build and to grow, to live in harmony and in empathy with others, and within which to pursue our tomorrow in the fullness of confidence and crowning prosperity.\n21.\tOur present hope is seriously marred by urgent problems affecting the conscience and continuity of the human quest for peace and social justice everywhere. Those problems, as contained in the situation in southern Africa, have reached crisis proportion.\n22.\tStubborn colonialism, racist minority rule, and the sinister policy of apartheid seem determined to stem the inevitable tide of total African emancipation. But that unjust and cruel effort must not be permitted to prevail over the dogged determination of the African peoples of the subregion to release themselves from the shackles of oppression and of justice denied.\n23.\tThe well-known 1969 Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  and the 1975 Dar-es-Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa  have served both as guides and as instruments of reference as we face the problems of the subregion.\n24.\tIt was thus that as ill will characterized the attitude of the rebel Smith regime in the various negotiating efforts over the years, the struggle to end illegality and racist minority rule in Zimbabwe intensified. As delaying tactics and subterfuges were employed by the illegal and repressive regime in Namibia, the people of that Territory, led by the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ, continued to rise up in arms.\n25.\tWe must not forget that while more than 16 years separated Sharpeville from Soweto, spontaneous revolts have occurred with telling regularity in a number of African townships in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Capetown and elsewhere. Not even the repressive, barbaric and violent reaction of the murder squads of the apartheid regime has sufficed to quell the surging spirit of an oppressed but determined people.\n26.\tIn the end, it is their will to be free which will determine the outcome of the current struggle. The nationalistic will of the African people far outweighs the strength of any ideology or any resistance whatsoever. This determination must bring the nations and people of the earth to realize that Africans evolve their independent destinies.\n27.\tIt is clear that the armed struggle approach to liberation has not been Africa's first choice of method. In fact, such an approach has been forced on us, for there never has been, and there never will be, any compromising whatsoever on the sacred objective of total liberation from the remnants of colonialism, racist minority rule and apartheid.\n28.\tAs we in Liberia have welcomed, and engaged our-selves in, peaceful initiatives in respect of the problems of southern Africa in the past, the Government of Liberia can now only welcome the encouraging initiatives currently underway, notably the commendable efforts of the United States of America.\n29.\tNow that tit rebel Rhodesian leader has apparently bowed to the inevitable, and accepted the fundamentals of the British-American proposals the convening of a constitutional conference and the creation of a transitional government leading to majority rule\u2014Liberia fully associates itself with the view that the constitutional conference, under the auspices of the United Kingdom, should be immediately convened outside of Zimbabwe, and that clear modalities for effective transfer to majority rule be established and implemented without delay.\n30.\tThe time is thus at hand for maximum international goodwill and leadership, caution and patience. Failure to maintain the momentum towards accommodation already acquired; failure to maximize the current prospect for negotiated settlements based exclusively on the objectives of decolonization, majority rule and inviolable human equality; failure to defuse with timeliness the dangerous,\n2 Adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its ninth extraordinary session held from 7 to 10 April 1975.\nviolent hostility which has everywhere been building up in southern Africa-this could irrevocably invite deepening and widening external involvement which would imperil the peace of the world.\n31.\tGenuine and durable peace on the subcontinent demands steady progress on all of the fronts of oppression.\n32.\tIt is our prayerful wish that the outlines of a clearer settlement on both Zimbabwe and Namibia will soon emerge, and that far beyond the token desegregation of sports and other half-hearted, insufficient measures, the South African regime will heed the warning signals and take timely and positive action to dismantle its pernicious apartheid system.\n33.\tIn the region of the Middle East, where an abrasive and hostile stalemate prevails, I call on Israel to release to the Arab States the lands it obtained by conquest and has occupied since 1967.\n34.\tI also urge the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in all the processes leading to a just and lasting solution of the problems in that area of our one world.\n35.\tI call also on the Arab States to recognize the legitimate rights of Israel to exist in the Middle East as a free and sovereign nation.\n36.\tI call on the great. Powers to desist from contributing to a military build-up in that area, which is already dangerously explosive and a threat to international peace and security.\n37.\tIn Lebanon, where a complicated internal rift continues, I appeal to all parties to exert their maximum efforts and understanding to ease tension and accelerate the dawn of a just and lasting peace in that region.\n38.\tThe question of Korea also lies heavy on the hearts of all peace-loving people, for we should like to see that peninsula devoid of violence and more vigorous for unification. In this regard, we remain deeply hopeful that, in the spirit of the North-South joint communique of 4 July 1972,  dialog will be intensified by the parties and encouraged by all nations.\n39.\tOn the critical matters of development and trade, I note with regret that proposals made by the Group of 77 at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, aimed at lessening the inequality in wealth between developed and developing countries, have been impeded by reservations on the part of some countries. Yet, I am pleased by the continuing positive posture of the United States and other major Powers, renewing the hope of dialog and negotiation which I believe will, in time, constitute one of history's greatest turning-points towards harmonious international relationships.\n40.\tThe world situation as it exists today offers a challenge to the developed nations to effect the necessary 126\nredress of an unbalanced international socio-economic order. The extent to which the developed nations are willing to meet the challenge is left to be seen.\n41.\tIn a world where few are rich and many are poor, peace cannot flourish. Equally, in a world where the gap between countries continues to grow ever wider, a policy of genuine solidarity and collective self-reliance among developing countries, and between them and the developed countries, must be evolved as the best guarantee of true independence and freedom.\n42.\tTo this end, support for regional and multilateral institutions that would foster such efforts is one of the major policies of the Liberian Government. His establishment of the Mano River Union between Liberia and Sierra Leone and our active support of the Economic Community of West African States are well-known efforts in the interest of international co-operation for development.\n43.\tMoreover, the linkage among the alliances in Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in which Liberia cherishes its membership is another manifestation of our faith in forging co-alliances for international co-operation.\n(\n44.\tThe arms race is accelerating. In the Ad Hoc Committee on the Review of the Role of the United Nations in the Field of Disarmament, the pace of negotiation is rather discouraging.\n45.\tDespite the General Assembly's appeal to all States, in particular to the nuclear Powers, to exert concerted efforts in all the appropriate international forums with a view to the formulation of prompt effective measures for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, I regret to note, and it is even very disheartening, that there remains a stalemate in the Organization's efforts. There are yet some countries which are not parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annexJ and the Treaty banning nuclear-weapons tests. \n46.\tWe are appalled that the world's expenditure for armaments has reached a level of approximately $US 300 billion per year. This vast sum spent on arms of all types is an important factor in the failure of the developing nations to make greater progress in the advancement of the Second United Nations Development Decade. It is, indeed, regret-table that some of the developing countries themselves are increasingly participating in this destructive, rather than constructive, spending process.\n47.\tI believe that because the arms race, despite some progress made towards its containment, is a continuing threat to peace and human welfare, the General Assembly should focus on this problem in a special session. In this regard, the Government of Liberia fully endorses the recent resolution of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Colombo in August, calling for such a meeting to convene not later than 1978 [see A/31/197, annex I, para. 139],\n48.\tThe Colombo Conference also appealed for disarmament in the context of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), which declares the Indian Ocean a peace zone [ibid., annex IV, resolution 11]. Let us all veritably resolve to move expeditiously towards the implementation of the resolution, making of the Indian Ocean a zone of peace from which must be excluded all power rivalries and competition as well as bases conceived in such contexts. Indeed, let us move creatively ahead in the progressive establishment of zones of peace throughout the world and thus usher in an era of serenity and security for our one world.\n49.\tThe vital importance of establishing a new inter-national regime for the world's oceans can never be overemphasized. We associate ourselves, therefore, with the continuing efforts to endeavor to build upon the successes achieved so far in negotiations and, in the interim, to work assiduously to ensure fuller understanding in this strategic area of international co-operation.\n50.\tIn this thirty-first year of the existence of this noble world body, let us earnestly renew our commitment and dedication in the search for a permanent solution of the burning problems of our times, so that relations among nations can enter a higher plane of mutual accommodation and veritable peaceful coexistence. Let conciliation, and not conflict, co-operation, and not confrontation, be the order of the day.\n51.\tWe have faith sublime in the spirit of the single family of man. We have faith in the capabilities of selfless zeal to produce international brotherhood. We have faith that the pathway of morality and human solidarity will lessen tensions, bring new dimensions to international relations and fulfill the aspirations of all peoples within a wholesome functioning world society.\n"

        "file_text": "Our session opened a few days ago under the provisional presidency of Mr, Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, whose qualities of heart and mind we have long appreciated. Once again he placed his talents and dynamism at the service of the world community, presiding with authority over the work of our thirtieth session. It is a pleasant duty for us again to tell him of the high esteem he enjoys in our delegation and in the Government of Cameroon.\n199.\tOn behalf of the people of Cameroon, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, His Excellency El Hadj Ahmadou Ahidjo, our Government and our delegation, we rejoice at seeing Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe presiding over our thirty-first session. There is no doubt that his presidency is a tribute to Sri Lanka which, despite centuries of foreign domination, has been able to conserve the best treasures of its culture and history. It is a tribute to one of the founders of our movement of non-aligned countries, the latest meeting of which was held in Colombo. Mr. President, in your opening statement [ 1st meeting] you rightly recalled that that movement is, beyond doubt, the hope of tomorrow because it is in constant emergence, it carries a new vigor in international morality which fights selfishness and it rejects violence in international relations at a time when more than ever force tends to prevail over the rule of law.\n200.\tWe are convinced that your well-known qualities as a mature statesman will enable our deliberations to proceed in a positive manner and that you will bring to them the humanism so necessary for dialog, concerted agreement and mutual understanding.\n\n201.\tAnd let us not forget the outstanding role played here by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. The Government of Cameroon follows with sympathy the ceaseless efforts he makes to gather together the elements for a solution to the numerous and serious problems which the world community faces. We avail ourselves of this opportunity to pay him a well-deserved tribute for his devotion and integrity.\n202.\tWe warmly welcome the delegation of Seychelles, which is with us for the first time.1 We had hoped to be able to do the same for-the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, whose long struggle finally set the seal on the spiritual unity of the people and nation of Viet Nam.\n203.\tOur delegation also profoundly regrets not being able today to extend its warm, brotherly congratulations to the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola. A peaceful State recognized by more than a hundred States, Angola completely fulfills all the conditions laid down in the Charter for admission to the United Nations. We sincerely believe that the People's Republic of Angola has its legitimate place within the United Nations family, where, we are firmly convinced, it will make its contribution to the effort we are all making to build a better world. Its admission will constitute an additional illustration of the trends towards the universality of our Organization.\n204.\tSince the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the world situation has been characterized both by the crystallization of certain existing situations and by dangerous and explosive developments in certain hotbeds of tension.\n205.\tThe state of generalized confusion in international monetary policy, aggravated by inflation, has brought the world economy to a deadlock. The imbalances in international trade, the gaps between developed and developing countries, the somewhat disappointed hopes of the fourth session of UNCTAD, the procrastinations at the Paris Conference, do not particularly arouse optimism for the attainment of our common objectives, in particular the advent of a new international economic order.\n206.\tThe political panorama facing the international community is very worrying. Despite the hopes born with the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the effects of detente felt in Europe have not been felt elsewhere in the world. In the absence of a genuine will for peace and co-operation, weapons have continued to proliferate, creating and thereby sustaining new centres of\n- tension.\n207.\tThe most sought-after trade has become that of conventional or sophisticated weapons, as well as nuclear reactors, supposedly for peaceful uses.\n208.\tIn this cloudy sky of international relations, there have nevertheless appeared some rays of light.\n209.\tThe super-Powers have not broken off their discus-sions on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.\n210.\tThe presence in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China has powerfully contributed to remodel-ling the geopolitical physiognomy of the world, and the heartfelt tribute paid by our Organization to the memory of the illustrious Chairman Mao Tsetung, the great leader of the Chinese people, bears witness to this.\n211.\tIn South-East Asia, the long VietNamese war is now history, while the weapons have been silenced in Cambodia as well.\n212.\tLet us look for a moment at Africa, a hospitable continent where some people still suffer the cruel fate inflicted on them by greedy and unscrupulous invaders.\n213.\tThe disappearance of the Portuguese colonial empire has accelerated the movement for the decolonization of our continent. This is a result which is to the credit of African peoples, their Governments and the friends who support them; it is the culmination of long liberation struggles during which African nationalists have given proof of unparalleled courage and determination, bearing in mind the hostile environment and the conditions in which they were fighting an enemy supported by the imperialist Powers. Many courageous Africans died during those liberation wars, but the cause they were defending-the cause which every African worthy of that name defends- will inevitably triumph, and their memory will live forever in the minds of all. For us, the independence of those countries is a victory cry, the echo of which now resounds in the very heart of the kingdom of apartheid, sowing panic among the oppressors and rallying the oppressed for decisive combat in the name of democracy, liberty, justice and equality.\n214.\tThat is why the People's Republic of Angola has become a target and a nightmare for the South African racists, who have not accepted the stunning defeat suffered by their troops to the great surprise of those who still believed in the bluff about an invincible South Africa. But it is not only Angola which is at stake.\n215.\tMozambique, because it decided to apply the sanc\u00actions decreed by the United Nations against the white minority regime of Zimbabwe, is the victim of incessant threats and armed incursions by the white racist rebels. The same is true for other independent African countries bordering on South Africa and Rhodesia.\n216.\tAs in the past, we are in firm solidarity with them-not only because they are our brothers and because their fight is curs, but also, and above all, because the cause they defend is that of every man who loves justice and peace.\n217.\tIndeed, there is enormous indignation over the scandalous situation that has existed in Zimbabwe for 11 years. Despite the sanctions imposed by the United Nations, despite the goodwill of African States exemplified by the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  for a\n* peaceful approach to the problems of southern Africa, the intransigence and arrogance of the arch-rebel, Ian Smith, have become more and more blatant, because he relies on the same Powers which provide him with all sorts of arms. Nevertheless, from the point of view of African nationalists, the will to settle problems peacefully has not been lacking: even defying the suspicions and warnings of their friends, some of them agreed to sit around a table and start negotiations with the rebels who were then at bay. But that was simply to hear conditions for submission imposed on them in arrogant and overbearing language.\n218.\tIn Namibia too, the South African white minority racists remain deaf to the appeals for reason, and continue\nto ignore the decisions of our Organization. The white racist regime of Pretoria has simply intensified its repressive measures against the Namibian people and sown hatred, bereavement and misery, which are the corollary of its odious apartheid policy.\n219.\tIn order to perpetuate its presence in that inter-national Territory, despite the injunctions of the Security Council, the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  and innumerable resolutions of our Assembly calling for its immediate withdrawal, the racist regime has for several months been engaged in maneuvers which are only too crudely obvious, since their only purpose is to divide the Namibian leaders by means of so-called constitutional conferences which exclude the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ, the only movement recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the United Nations as being the genuine representative of the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people.\n220.\tIn Azania itself, the policy of apartheid, which arouses the reprobation of the entire world because it is recognized as constituting a crime against mankind, has finally proved the extent of its absurdity. The patience of a people is not infinite, even if its martyrdom has lasted for centuries. This is why for months the repressive South African hordes have been on a war footing. The barbarity with which they exterminate hundreds of women and children who peacefully call for a minimum of justice is proof that the white racists are fighting with their backs to the wall. These racists, frightened and condemned to the most painful revisions, imagine that by their diabolical will they can delay the irreversible evolution of Azanian history. The people of Azania, aware of its strength and its rightness, is courageously resisting, and its revolt is becoming a genuine revolution.\n221.\tWe know, and our Secretary-General recalled it some weeks ago, that the situation prevailing in Azania and throughout southern Africa constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\n222.\tThe South African army and police will still kill many children, old people and peaceful and unarmed laborers, but from the blood of these martyrs to liberty, justice and human dignity will be born other children, other laborers and other fighters determined to take over so long as the struggle for liberation lasts. There was Sharpeville, there was Soweto and other names which have been immortalized and which cannot but cause the wheel of history, which is one of anguish, to turn more rapidly for the adherents of the inhuman Pretoria regime.\n223.\tThe responsibility for the failure at attempts at dialog, the complete responsibility, we would say, for the present situation rests on the advocates of apartheid as well as on those who have abused the racists by causing them to believe they are fighting on behalf of an ideology against the establishment of another one in that part of the African continent. It would be an insult to consider the South\nAfrican regime as the symbol of a society of liberal democracy and a defender of its most sacred values. On the contrary, it personifies obscurantism. Responsibility rests finally with those who, by increasing its military potential and consolidating its economy, gave that racist regime the illusion of invincibility.\n224.\tSpeaking of the events at Soweto last June, the Cameroonian Head of State declared:\n\\\"By this revolt the people of Azania, in the struggle against racial discrimination, has wished once more and in an indisputable way to show its determination to put an end to the invidiously inhuman regime of apartheid to which it is subjected, to conquer by any means liberty, equality, dignity and to establish in Azania a majority Government... The Government of the United Republic of Cameroon hopes that these tragic events will be proof to all of the impossibility of a constructive dialog with the advocates of racial domination and firmly condemns all those who continue to strengthen that regime by maintaining relations with it of which the United Nations and OAU disapprove\\\".\n225.\tIt is our firm conviction that tomorrow will be too late if today the international community does not decide to act decisively against South Africa.\n226.\tCameroon is attentively following the efforts which have been made for some weeks by the United States Secretary of State. But it is not useless to recall that any solution in southern Africa must be based on the principles which have been clearly defined by the United Nations and tend to assure the immediate transfer of power to the authentic representatives of the people, in accordance with majority rule which is that of any genuine democracy.\n227.\tSince nothing in the past has given us the slightest assurance of good faith on the part of those governing at Salisbury and at Pretoria, we could not approve of any procrastinations which they are now manifesting when the sword is plunged within them and which for us are simply subterfuges whereby they hope to win time, intensify their policy of the worst which has been theirs so far and ultimately reaffirm their wavering power.\n228.\tThe Government of the Cameroon, which has always given multiform aid to the valiant fighters for freedom, will continue to encourage them to be vigilant. They are duty-bound to pursue and intensify the armed struggle which has proved to be the only language that these racist minorities, avid for domination, understand.\n229.\tAs for Nambia, the Security Council will have to draw the consequences of the persistent refusal of South Africa to withdraw from that Territory and to bow to the injunctions contained, in particular, in resolution 385 (1976) of 30 January 1976. It is time for the Council to decide finally to take the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter in order to enable the Organization to assume its responsibility in regard to that international Territory.\n230.\tThis last quarter of a century is that of the final liquidation of all colonial domination. So we rejoice at the wisdom of the Government of France in its decision to ensure the accession to independence of the Territory of the Afars and the Issas in the near future.\n231.\tWe sincerely hope that the same wisdom will prevail with regard to the Republic of the Comoros in its legitimate claims for the unity of the country and preservation of the territorial integrity under which it was administered in the past.\n232.\tIf we have dwelt at some length on the situation in southern Africa because of the extremely alarming nature of the tragic events which are taking place in that part of the world, we are no less concerned with regard to other hotbeds of tension.\n233.\tIn the Middle East, since the last session there has been no positive evolution. The situation remains precarious. The Arab territories continue to be occupied in defiance of all the relevant resolutions of our Organization. The Palestinians, driven out everywhere, continue to be Ignored or treated as common refugees or simply as terrorists. And yet, they are without doubt one of the major components of an over-all solution of the Middle East problem.\n234.\tThe Government of the United Republic of Cameroon wishes to reaffirm here that the Israeli-Arab problem must be dealt with, bearing in mind the positive elements contained in resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. It is clear and incontestable that Israel must withdraw from the territories which it occupied by an act of war. Israel, whose right to live within secure and recognized boundaries we do not deny, must likewise recognize the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, and in particular their right to a country, which is the corner-stone for the restoration of a just and lasting peace in that region.\n235.\tThe great Powers, and particularly those which have a determining influence on Israel, have a duty to use this influence so that at the peace negotiations at Geneva, which should be resumed quickly, that State will adopt a realistic attitude by entering into a constructive dialog with all the parties concerned, particularly with the Palestine liberation Organization, which is the authentic representative of the Palestinian people.\n236.\tThe situation in Lebanon is one of extreme anguish. \u2022 Cameroon feels painfully the events in that country, the land of meetings and of tolerance, the cross-roads of civilization, whose people have for the people of Cameroon feelings of profound friendship based on a long history. We urgently appeal to the international community to assist that country to recover peace and safeguard its unity and integrity. We urge the conflicting parties to find again that spirit of tolerance which has always been characteristic of them and to embark on the negotiating process which is the only means of safeguarding the existence of Lebanon.\n237.\tForeign interference has done grave damage in Cyprus and introduced in that part of the Mediterranean an element of instability which is likely to lead to a major confrontation among the States concerned. The first steps towards a calming of minds should be the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the island and the return of the refugees to their homes. In this respect we appreciate the efforts made by our Secretary-General and we warmly encourage him to pursue his actions so as to find a basis for a definite and final agreement within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council so as to preserve the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus.\n238.\tThe division of Korea is for us a subject of constant concern. In fact Cameroon maintains friendly relations with the two Korean States, that is to say, actually with the entire Korean people. Therefore our most ardent wish is that, within the framework of brotherly dialog, incessant efforts will be pursued towards the peaceful reunification of Korea, without any foreign interference. The status quo is far from being a guarantee of peace in that region. Recent incidents have once again reminded us how fragile the present situation is.\n239.\tThe Cameroonian Government believes that the senseless proliferation of weapons in the world so as to conquer and enlarge spheres of influence generates hotbeds of tension, of which we have just given a summary indication. It seems laughable to us to speak of detente in a world dominated by the war psychosis which is reflected in stockpiling, which is difficult to control, of weapons of mass destruction. We will not go console ourselves by saying that in the event of a nuclear conflict nobody-not even the happy sellers of today-will find shelter from the holocaust.\n240.\tThe question of general disarmament under effective control should not become a series of miscellaneous events in world politics. We are very pleased with the agreements, although very limited, which irregularly occur between the United States and the Soviet Union, but at the same time we wish to state here today before this Assembly that the problem of disarmament is a problem for all mankind. Because the last two world wars spared no continent, all the peoples of the world must have the opportunity, indeed the duty, to shoulder their responsibilities in this matter. We are profoundly convinced that world peace no longer depends today on the will of some Powers alone.\n241.\tThat is why the Government of the United Republic of Cameroon ardently supports, with the other non-aligned countries, the principle of convening a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Such a conference should advocate measures that will ensure the destruction of war devices, prohibit all nuclear tests and establish strict control by appropriate international bodies of the sale of nuclear devices and reactors.\n242.\tWe are aware that this session would have to be preceded by careful preparation, without thereby delaying it unduly. However, it would be desirable at present to multiply the denuclearized zones. Within this perspective, the Cameroonian Government firmly supports any proposal to make the African continent a denuclearized zone.\n243.\tWe believe in the idea of general disarmament for several reasons, one of which is that the sums of money devoured in designing and manufacturing weapons of mass destruction could serve to lessen the suffering of mankind in the fields of health, education, food and lodging, to mention only those. In brief, the financial resources thus released could serve the well-being of peoples, as our Organization has affirmed in resolutions 2602 E (XXIV) and 3470 (XXX).\n244.\tThe Disarmament Decade and the Second United Nations Development Decade called for a transfer of a considerable amount of resources from the developed countries to the developing countries; but we see with alarm that enormous human and material resources are diverted from economic and social activities to a senseless arms race. The flow of financial resources to the developing countries was $20 billion in 1975. During that same year armament expenditures amounted to $300 billion. Such a situation gravely jeopardizes the attainment of the objectives which the international community has set for itself for development and in particular in the foreseeable future in order to lessen the gap separating the developing countries from the developed countries.\n245.\tWith a few rare exceptions, the developed countries, despite many declarations of good intentions, are doing every thing to maintain the enormous advantages they have conferred on themselves. We shall never sufficiently denounce such selfish behavior, because the gap that separates the rich from the poor is a threat to human dignity and to international peace and security, since it can lead three quarters of mankind to desperate actions in order to survive.\n246.\tIn fact we note with bitterness that the very principles of the new international economic orders although generally accepted, come up against strong resistance when it comes to reflecting them in deeds. This resistance cannot but dangerously affect the manifestation of the essential component in restructuring international economic relations, namely, the manifestation of a sincere political will on the part of the members of the international community.\n247.\tIt is because of the fervor with which the \\\"have\\\" countries cling to their privileges and because of their lack of political will that so many international gatherings have been unable to fulfill the expectations placed in them, whether it be the fourth session of UNCTAD, the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation or the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n248.\tUNCTAD at its fourth session was to take up the basic problems of long-term development. It was then to take certain immediate and concrete decisions and adopt specific programs of action for problems which were ready for operational action. We are thinking in particular of the case of commodities and external debt of the developing countries. Some of the results obtained were satisfactory; others were disappointing.\n249.\tThe United Republic of Cameroon is pleased with the consensus regarding the integrated program for commodities and the objectives and mechanisms which are its essential elements, the provisions of the resolution relating to that program contain some innovations and improvements regarding commodities. We are convinced that that resolution represents an acceptable framework in which the problem of commodities must be discussed in the future.\n250.\tWe also consider as a promising indication the decision taken at Nairobi to start negotiations on a number of products which are of particular interest to die developing countries.\n251.\tOn the other hand, we were disappointed with die results embodied in the resolution concerning the common fund for financing international buffer stocks, Cameroon, like the other countries of the Group of 77, had requested that the establishment of that fund be decided on at the fourth session of UNCTAD. The negotiations to be started were to be only on the modalities and detaiJs, became the in-depth studies prepared by the Committee on Commodities had demonstrated the feasibility of the project. The resolution adopted on the subject contains no declaration reflecting acceptance by aH countries of the principle of a common fund. For Cameroon, the decision taken at Nairobi to convene at the latest in March 1977 a conference to negotiate on the common fund for financing is an invitation for negotiation as to substance. It is for that reason that we insist that all other Governments participate in good faith so as to arrive at a generally satisfactory agreement.\n252.\tIt is a conference which seems to us to be of major importance for the process of working towards a new international economic order. It would be an opportunity to prove, as President Ahidjo declared, that mankind can, in a deliberate concern for justice and co-operation, organize on a basis of consensus and stability the objective interdependence of peoples so as to ensure their economic development.\n253.\tIt is regrettable that at Nairobi there was no constructive reaction to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries. The developing countries have, throughout the years, exhausted their reserves and accumulated large external debts which impose heavy burdens an them of interest payments and amortization. The indebtedness of those countries, which was more than $100 billion in 1973 will at the end of this year amount to $200 billion.\n254.\tNor has any positive solution been found to the problem raised by the payment difficulties of the developing countries in the present inflationary spiral, nor to the problem of the long-term transfer of resources, nor, finally, to the disturbing problem of international monetary reform.\n255.\tThe convening of the Paris Conference on Inter-national Economic Co-operation had roused hopes in the developing countries. We had expected indeed that, benefiting from oil the meetings that have been held since the sixth special session of the General Assembly and from die bread consensus and the new awareness in the international community, that conference would start decisive action for development. Unfortunately, it has not been able to fulfill those hopes because of the refusal of certain developed countries resolutely to embark upon really significant changes as required for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n256.\tMr. President, you have already had occasion to deplore the scant progress of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. We know what an eminent role you play as President of the important international negotiations which are to establish the new legal regime for the use of the oceans. We also know that, if for the time being your efforts are ineffectual, it is again because of the selfishness of certain States or groups of States which have been particularly favored by history and which are striving to accumulate the majority of the resources of the oceans, while ignoring the fate of the small countries and the developing land-locked or geographically disadvantaged countries.\n257.\tWe wish to reaffirm here that Cameroon, in keeping with the options defined by OAU and by the Group of 77, does not intend to approve a convention which would create privileges for some in sharing what should remain the common heritage of mankind.\n258.\tWe have always declared that there can be no real peace in the world so long as three fourths of mankind live in poverty, hunger, illiteracy, destitution and disease.\n259.\tThere will be no real peace in the world so long as the minority continues to exploit for its own benefit exclusively the resources of the majority of the countries of the planet.\n260.\tThere will be no real peace, we maintain, so long as the members of the international community do not perceive, without ulterior motives, that it is necessary to have a just and equitable distribution of the resources of our globe for the good of all.\n261.\tWe reaffirm that only a total recasting of inter-national economic relations can bring a positive and lasting response to the crisis of civilization which the world is now going through.\n262.\tThat recasting of international economic relations, we believe, must of necessity lead to a new international economic order and include the following elements: a fundamental revision of the systems of world trade so as to improve the terms of trade of the developing countries, with the aim of ensuring for them, on the one hand, equitable and remunerative prices for their raw materials and, on the other, protection of the purchasing power of their peoples; a reform of the international monetary system in the direction of greater democratization, so as to. establish a link between creating liquidity and financing development; the guarantee of the transfer of resources and technology in a sure, constant and predictable fashion; lastly, as regards debt, the preparation of solutions which will take particularly into account the concerns and proposals of the developing countries.\n263.\tThis is the place to recall-and we can never do so often enough-that the world is one. It follows that the prosperity and security of the wealthy countries will not be guaranteed unless the present imbalances between developed and developing countries are progressively reduced by concerted action and consequently by free consent.\n264.\tThe United Republic of Cameroon is a non-aligned country; it has always been and will continue to remain faithful to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. As in the past, our country will continue to support this Organization because it represents the hope of the world. We shall continue to support it because it undertakes actions which seek to maintain international peace and security and to the liberation and development of peoples.\n265.\tThat is why we attach the utmost importance to the functioning of the United Nations, which will enable it to carry out really effective action and which would thereby most likely ensure for it the support and respect of all. To attain that objective we believe that the time has come to make its working methods more rational and to make some of its organs more democratic.\n266.\tFor years now we have been trying to improve the procedures and the organization of the General Assembly. We are very pleased with the recommendations of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly, which are now being implemented. In fact the agenda of our sessions would stand to gain if it were made lighter. We should avoid including certain questions which could be considered in other forums. Thus, we could concentrate all our attention and all our thinking on questions which are urgent in character or are current. It is only in this way that the United Nations will best be able to fulfill its functions as a center for negotiating.\n267.\tWe also believe that the decision-making bodies of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, should be restructured, taking into account the new world geopolitics.\n268.\tFinally, we persist in believing that a revitalization of the United Nation is required if we wish it fully to play the role incumbent upon it in promoting development and international economic co-operation.\n269.\tThe Economic and Social Council should, in this respect, take over the main tasks conferred on it under the Charter and play a decisive role in reconciling positions and in concentrating all efforts towards the establishment among nations of new economic relations which are more orderly and more just.\n270.\tEven though our means of action are so limited, we now have our eyes open, and wide open, on a world in crisis in which we certainly do not intend to assume the role of a martyr. And since in that world we, the poor, are now a conscious majority, nothing can be the way it was, nothing can now easily be done without us, and far less, against us.\n271.\tThe order of values must be reconsidered so as to build that universal civilization to which we all aspire and which will make room for the values of a third world whose interests, aspirations and even dignity have been ignored for far too long.\n"

        "file_text": "The changes in the international situation, which have occurred in the first half of the 1970s, can, without exaggeration, be described as the start of a new phase in international development. We have witnessed the surmounting of numerous seemingly eternal road-blocks on the way to peace and good-neighborly relations between countries and peoples. Detente resulted in creating the objective prerequisites for eliminating the threat of a nuclear war. Such evolution in international relations has been largely brought about by the active and constructive policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community, which act in the international arena in close alliance and invincible unity.\n2.\tWe should first of all note the radical improvement of the political climate in Europe. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was signed just over a year ago, but its influence on all aspects of relations among European countries is evident even now.\n3.\tUnderstanding of the fact that relations of friendly co-operation, based on equality and non-interference in internal affairs, are more desirable and fruitful than confrontation in an atmosphere of hostility, which recently reigned in Europe and all over the world, is something which is gaining more and more ground among States which take a serious approach to the implementation of the Helsinki agreements.\n4.\tProcesses of detente prevailing in the political climate have accelerated positive changes in various parts of the world. Noteworthy among them are the victory of the just cause of the peoples in IndoChina, the defeat of colonial-ism and racism in several African countries such as Angola and Mozambique and others. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of our delegation, the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations. At the same time, together with other countries, we strongly demand the immediate admission to the United Nations of a big new peace-loving State, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and of a young independent African State, the People's Republic of Angola.\n5.\tWe sincerely acclaim the positive changes in the international arena, but, at the same time, we realize the complexities and discrepancies in present world evolution. It would be wrong to ignore the fact that the arms race and the improvement of weapons of mass destruction continue at the same destructive rate as before. It would be unpardonable complacency to disregard the fact that the military-industrial complex, neo-Fascist and other reactionary forces are systematically attacking detente, which renders their existence senseless. V. V. Shcherbitsky, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, said the following on this score at the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Ukraine: \\\"Those who are against the Soviets evidently mourn the past days of the 'cold war' and try to revive its sinister ghost at any cost.\\\"\n6.\tNumerous mass media organs in the West and often some prominent figures toe the line of those forces. Such politicians make attempts at interfering in internal affairs of other countries, sometimes even in the affairs of their partners in military and political blocs.\n7.\tSuch actions, naturally, do not contribute to detente. Though the shoots of detente are taking root in the political fields, they are still young and vulnerable, and they should be ardently guarded against various weeds of the \\\"cold war\\\". Therefore, concrete steps of States aimed at the further relaxation of tensions, including steps which relate to the creation of an atmosphere of mutual trust among States, are of primary importance in this matter.\n8.\tTo protect such an atmosphere from pollution, it is necessary for peoples to have a better knowledge of one another, to respect one another's culture, historical traditions and the achievements of nations and, of course, to refrain from interfering in the affairs of other countries. This goal requires a resolute struggle against misinformation and elimination of vestiges of the \\\"cold war\\\", violence, racism and inhumanity. We believe that we must find common ground in the solution of sometimes very complicated international problems on the basis of political realism and that we must settle jointly complicated problems at the negotiating table.\n9.\tBroad international co-operation is necessary, not only for strengthening peace, but also for an early solution of such problems as the elimination of illiteracy, as environmental protection, control of pollution of the atmosphere and the high seas, development and exploitation of new energy sources, prevention of natural calamities, prevention and treatment of the most dangerous diseases.\n10.\tEvery thread of mutually advantageous co-operation among States, woven into the texture of peaceful relations, strengthens the fabric of international peace and security and facilitates the achievement of agreements on problems of military detente. The majority of countries favor the policy of ensuring international peace and security, which was convincingly evident in the decisions adopted by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo in August [see A/31/1971].\n11.\tReflecting the unquenchable aspirations of the peoples for lasting peace and security, for a cessation of the arms race and for disarmament and detente, the World Congress of Peace Forces, held at Helsinki from 23 to 26 September 1976, strongly advocated these goals. This Congress, attended by more than 90 countries and 50 international organizations representing various political parties, governmental and non-governmental organizations, called upon the peoples of all countries not only to put an end to the arms race, but also to accelerate the attainment of general and complete disarmament, and also to support the idea of the conclusion of a world treaty of the non-use of force in international relations.\n12.\tThe memorandum of the Soviet Union on questions of ending the arms race and disarmament submitted by Mr., A. A. Gromyko, USSR Foreign Minister, for the consideration of the current session of the General Assembly [A/31/232], quite rightly draws the attention of all States and peoples to the central and urgent task facing humanity at present-to stop the material preparation for war. The memorandum convincingly showed that, during the nuclear missile era, the arms race is a formidable danger for the future of peoples of our planet. Despite its utter absurdity, the search for ways and means of gaining military superiority, which is the main preoccupation of aggressive military- political blocs, entails staggering expenditures of material resources. The following figures graphically demonstrate the rate of growth in military expenditures: whereas in 1949 the military appropriations of the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] totaled $18 billion, in 1976 this sum reached $170 billion. Conscious of obstacles in the road to the cessation of the arms race, we believe at the same time in the possibility and feasibility of overcoming the resistance of disarmament opponents, as is shown by steps taken in the field of the curtailment of the arms race in recent times, especially in the period when the present process of improving the political climate has set in.\n13.\tIt was precisely in the period that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] came into force, that the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction was prohibited in outer space as well as oil the sea-bed and ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, and that the Convention on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons  was added to the operative international instruments.\n14.\tIt is worth emphasizing the importance for the consolidation of peace of the well-known agreements between the USSR and the United States of America on the prevention of nuclear war, on the limitation of strategic arms, as well as treaties on the limitation of underground nuclear tests and on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes.\n15.\tIt is quite obvious that, because of the@ extremely dangerous nature of nuclear weapons, the cessation of the nuclear arms race, the reduction of nuclear weapons and their subsequent elimination are top priorities among disarmament measures, and the sine qua non for these measures is the participation of all nuclear Powers in their implementation.\n16.\tA comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty has been an urgent necessity for a long time. The General Assembly of the United Nations has repeatedly spoken out in favor of the early and urgent solution of this problem. The treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests, the draft of which was submitted by the Soviet Union at the last session of the General Assembly,  could become a concrete solution of this important problem. The unwillingness of certain nuclear States to participate in negotiations on the conclusion of such a treaty cannot be regarded otherwise than a refusal to contribute to the cessation of the nuclear arms race*\n17.\tOf special significance among questions concerning the limitation of the arms race and disarmament is the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new weapons systems. We hope that the negotiations on this question within the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva with the participation of experts will, we hope, yield positive results in the near future and will lead to drafting an international document banning the development and manufacture of the most dangerous means of warfare.\n18.\tWe are happy to note the progress made in the drafting of the text of an international convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment for military purposes. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has succeeded in overcoming difficulties it had and in coming to agreement on the draft of this important document [see A/31/27, annex I]. The General Assembly has good grounds for approving the convention at this session and for appealing to all States to become parties to it.\n19.\tThe problem of the prohibition of chemical weapons has long been awaiting a solution, although there are favorable conditions for its settlement. Since 1972, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament had before it the draft of a corresponding convention submitted by the socialist countries. The understanding of 3 July 1974, between the USSR and the United States of America on a joint initiative concerning the prohibition, as a first step, of the most dangerous and lethal chemical means of warfare has not so far been implemented. We believe that the priority task of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament lies in stepping up its work in every way so as to achieve substantial progress in working out an agreement on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons.\n20.\tThe World Disarmament Conference has not yet been convened because of the opposition of a number of States, though it is quite evident that the problem of stopping the arms race and implementing substantial disarmament measures affects the interests of all countries and should therefore be considered and settled at the widest and most authoritative forum entrusted with corresponding powers.\n21.\tA new Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations has been submitted for consideration at the current thirty-first session of the General Assembly [A/31/243]. This proposal is an integral part of the implementation of the program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples, proclaimed by the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its objective, as L. I. Brezhnev pointed out, is \\\"to make the danger of war recede still further and to create favorable conditions for progress towards disarmament\\\". Apart from stressing the importance of the principle of the non-use of force embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties, the Soviet Union proposes that it should be made an effective law of present-day international life. The importance of such a treaty is enhanced by the fact that its participants must undertake to refrain from using all types of weapons, including nuclear weapons, for settling disputes among them, thus effectively preventing a thermonuclear war.\n22.\tThe conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations would make a constructive and effective contribution to the struggle of peoples aimed at saving mankind from the scourge of war. The matter in question is not of limited regional nature but is a global action of worldwide significance.\n23.\tOf course, the renunciation of the use of force in international relations in no way restricts the right of States to individual or collective self-defense against aggression and the elimination of its consequences, as provided for in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Similarly, in accordance with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], their right to fight for national freedom and independence with all available means remains in-violable. Therefore, all who reject the policy of aggression, who oppose the suppression of peoples' struggle for freedom and independence by force, cannot but support this proposal which is so important for the strengthening of international peace. The continuing arms race hinders the strengthening of international security, contributes to the creation of new military hotbeds, and delays the elimination of armed conflicts.\n24.\tThe explosive situation still exists in the Middle East, where the solution of the problem based on the well-known resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have long been undermined by Israel's persistence in her expansionist policy. Israel and the forces backing her are trying to sow discord among Arab States and to weaken the anti-imperialist front. There can be no real peace in this region while Israel continues the aggression, and while Palestinians are deprived of their homeland. The pernicious consequences of this situation are diverse, something which is demonstrated by the tragic developments in Lebanon. The situation in this region once again confirms the impossibility of any partial settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. The solution has to be provided for within a whole complex, and within the mechanism established especially for that purpose, namely, the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n25.\tThe interests of peace in the Mediterranean requires preserving the status of Cyprus as a unified, independent and sovereign non-aligned State, as well as an immediate and complete implementation of the decisions of the United Nations on Cyprus. A representative international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations would be the best forum for settling the Cyprus problem.\n26.\tWe demand the implementation of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its thirtieth session on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice in Korea into a durable peace and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea [resolution 3390 (XXX)].\n27.\tTo this end it is necessary to withdraw all foreign troops from the territory of South Korea, thus creating conditions for a peaceful and democratic reunification of the country, without any foreign interference.\n28.\tThe cause of freedom and independence in Africa consistently encounters the opposition of the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. The United Nations has repeatedly and decisively denounced the regimes of racial discrimination and apartheid, and it is only the political, economic and military support of these regimes by major Western Powers that for a certain time can help them escape complete collapse. One cannot but become apprehensive at the efforts, which have recently become so frequent, on the part of some protectors of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, to save the racist regimes from an inevitable defeat and to undermine the legitimate national liberation struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and the indigenous population of South Africa for freedom and independence by means of diversionary maneuvers. One may rest assured that the Governments and peoples of Africa will appraise \\\"the efforts\\\" of this kind at their true worth.\n29.\tThe oppressed peoples in southern Africa are demanding that independence be granted to them immediately. Any delay is an attempt on the part of the colonialists to retain their positions, and to find new forms of colonial oppression.\n30.\tWe are sure that the day is at hand when the genuine representatives of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa will join us in this hall.\n31.\tThe racism of Salisbury and the apartheid of South Africa are but a few examples of the fact that in those countries where exploitation and oppression exist, the violation of human rights is institutionalized into a State policy.\n32.\tThe Ukrainian SSR, guided by the immortal ideas of V. I. Lenin concerning the liberation of peoples from social and colonial oppression, proceeds from the fact that international co-operation in the field of human rights should be aimed primarily at the struggle against massive and brutal violations of human rights and freedoms, which are the results of the policy of colonialism, racism, apartheid and fascism.\n33.\tAll honorable people on earth must indignantly and decisively condemn the crimes against humanity committed by the bloody Fascist junta in Chile. The United Nations must forcefully demand the cessation of the flagrant violations of human rights and freedom in Chile, ensure the cessation of the cruel mistreatment of Chilean patriots and the immediate freeing of Luis Corvalan and of other democrats languishing in the junta's goals.\n34.\tThe struggle for peace, the elimination of hotbeds of international tension and the development of normal relations among States, as well as the liquidation of colonialism and of all manifestations of racial discrimination, are therefore the most important prerequisites for the observance of human rights and freedoms.\n35.\tIt is the straggle against the most gross violations of human rights in Chile, in South Africa and in the Arab lands occupied by Israel that constitutes a fundamental means of deepening the co-operation among States in the promotion of respect for, and observance of, human rights. The peoples of the world should do their utmost to provide for everyone, everywhere, an opportunity to live without poverty and unemployment, so that everyone can enjoy the right to work, education, freedom from exploitation, racial discrimination and oppression, as well as an opportunity to benefit from the scientific and technical revolution and progress.\n36.\tWe, in the Ukrainian SSR, where all the activities of the Communist Party and the State show concern for promoting well-being and the free comprehensive development of all the members of our society, fully appreciate and understand the efforts of those States which are always striving genuinely and consistently to ensure human rights and to participate in international cooperation in this field.\n37.\tHowever, we cannot but denounce the attempts of certain circles in Western countries to use the noble slogans about the protection of human rights to camouflage flagrant and continuous violations of these rights in their own countries and to slander socialism, to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, to undermine the national liberation movement of peoples and to discredit the policy of peaceful coexistence and detente.\n38.\tSuch a speculation on the problem of safeguarding human rights is utterly unacceptable and should be completely ruled cut in the United Nations.\n39.\tThe ongoing changes in political relations, which have been made possible because of the relaxation of international tensions, have also had a favorable impact on the whole complex of economic links, thus facilitating the search for more effective ways of tackling the most urgent problems of our time, that is the unconditional and final rejection of the methods of imperialist policy in inter-national economic relations.\n40.\tA direct consequence of these political changes is the growing concern of the United Nations for social and economic problems of the developing countries, which are experiencing serious hardships because of the continuation of the policy of neo-colonialism and because of the lingering crises of capitalist economies.\n41.\tThe progressive decisions taken at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] marked the beginning of the fundamental revision of the whole system, inherited from the past, of inequitable international economic relations, which perpetuate inequality and exploitation of the developing countries. It is interesting to note that these documents are in effect a kind of a vote of \\\"no confidence\\\" in the ability of capitalism to ensure the development of new States. The documents have reflected the growing disillusionment of the developing countries in capitalism as a system which thwarts their efforts to put an end to their dependent position and economic backwardness.\n42.\tToday in these countries, more than ever before, the problem of accelerated socio-economic progress is closely linked with the problem of choosing a course of development.\n43.\tIn this connection we cannot help noticing the attempts which have been multiplying more recently on the part of representatives of certain countries at international forums to publicize in every way the capitalist pattern of development and to prove that the difficulties of the \\\"third world\\\" can be overcome only through a \\\"market economy\\\". They talk about \\\"interdependence\\\" among the advanced capitalist States and developing countries, which is being peddled as \\\"a partnership\\\" and \\\"a meaningful dialog\\\" between them. We have recently heard similar talk in this conference hall, and, characteristically enough, in the speeches of those representatives whose countries are most sharply criticized for the existing neo-colonialist exploitation of the developing countries. The idea in those speeches is that the developing countries should seek to solve their problems by joining their efforts with those of private enterprises and international monopolies. The final goal of this so-called \\\"partnership\\\" is equally clear: to maintain the developing countries within the framework of world capitalist economy as \\\"junior partners\\\", but in fact as an object of exploitation, in order to use their resources to consolidate the world positions of capitalism in its struggle with socialism.\n44.\tIt is quite apparent that the ideological prescriptions of neo-colonialism are incompatible with the striving of the developing countries towards genuine independence, and use of these prescriptions would lead to nowhere but to the revival of colonial relations and thus would become an obstacle to social and economic advancement.\n45.\tRegarding the restructuring of international economic relations and the struggle for the relaxation of international tensions, disarmament and a lasting peace as an inseparable whole, we stand for the further promotion of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and respect for national sovereignty as a condition for the development of world economic ties and inter-State co-operation.\n46.\tA world built upon 'these principles would be indivisible. The creation of this world is an important prerequisite for the advancement of mankind; it ensures the right of every nation to choose its own destiny freely, sovereignly and without outside interference. The thirty- first session of the General Assembly should devote its efforts to the creation of such a world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a matter of some honor and satisfaction for me to represent for the first time the Government and the people of the Lao People's Democratic Republic at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly, whose mission is to maintain peace, freedom and justice throughout the world. This United Nations General Assembly is the focal point of the eyes and hopes of the peoples of the world.\n75.\tAbove all, on behalf of the Government and people of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, I should like to convey my respectful and sincere greetings to the new President of the General Assembly, Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe, who has just been unanimously elected-a tribute to his quality as representative of Sri Lanka, which has won world-wide repute by its hosting of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. Our delegation is convinced that, with his skill and intelligence and the co-operation of all Member countries, the thirty-first session of the General Assembly will be crowned with considerable success.\n76.\tI should like to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Gaston Thorn, the outgoing President, who fruitfully discharged his functions during the thirtieth session. I should also like to greet and congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has unflaggingly accomplished his mission and has ceaselessly lavished his efforts so as to find satisfactory solutions to certain world problems during the past year.\n77.\tI should also like to convey my greetings and to express my affectionate solidarity to all the representatives of all the Member States participating in this Assembly, in particular those of Seychelles, which has just been admitted as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations.\n78.\tAt the same time, I am surprised and extremely disappointed at not seeing seated among us at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly the representative of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. In point of fact, the candidacy of that country meets all the conditions set down for States to become Members of the United Nations, for Viet Nam has struggled not only for its own interests but also for those of mankind as a whole.\n79.\tBut, because of the unreasonable obstruction of the representative of the Government of the United States in the Security Council, the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which is a true and faithful friend of the movement which struggles for peace, independence, freedom and social progress- and it is for this reason that this country was formally accepted at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, where its representatives received a triumphant and solemn welcome-has been prevented from being seated among us here. At all events, I am convinced that, with the joint efforts of us all and with the solidarity of the non-aligned countries and of countries which love justice, peace and progress throughout the world, the right of this country to be represented here will undoubtedly be restored. Any maneuver designed to oppose its admission as a Member of the United Nations is tantamount to a gross flouting of the dignity and the honor of our great international Organization and damages the goodwill of the representatives of the various countries belonging to the great family of the peoples of the world.\n80.\tOn the other hand, certain countries which are waging aggressive war and undermining peace and independence, and which are therefore by no means eligible to participate in this General Assembly of the United Nations, have nevertheless been seated here. Whatever happens, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will withstand the test and gain even more sympathy and support from countries throughout the world.\n81.\tMy delegation would also like to denounce another equally regrettable fact which is due to the United States, namely, that the Security Council did not recommend to the General Assembly the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Angola, which also meets all the conditions laid down.\n82.\tWhat I just said leads my delegation to request the General Assembly of the United Nations promptly to re-establish the right of Viet Nam and Angola to be admitted to this world Organization.\n83.\tThis thirty-first session is opening at a time when the situation in the world has undergone an objective transformation extremely favorable to the movements which are struggling for peace, independence, freedom, democracy and social progress.\n84.\tThe world socialist system has more and more become a mainstay for the movements struggling for peace and the revolution of the peoples of the world. That is why the movements of the nations and the countries of the world against imperialism, colonialism \u2014both old and new- exploitation, apartheid and injustice in Asia, Africa and Latin America have been continually growing in scope and scoring ever increasing victories. In particular, the movement of the non-aligned countries has become a new force of solidarity and mutual assistance for the countries which have fallen victims to aggression and exploitation of the colonialists and neo-colonialists and constitutes an important factor determining the direction of new relations in the economic, political and cultural fields in today's world. On the basis of their specific interests and encouraged by the movements to which I have referred, the struggle being waged by the workers and other segments of the population in the capitalist and imperialist countries has also developed and been strengthened. These revolutionary waves have engendered a colossal force which is relentlessly attacking imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism and the forces of reaction throughout the world, thus forcing them gradually to fall back and creating Conditions favorable to the safeguard of peace, independence,, democracy and social progress in the world.\n85.\tOn the other hand, imperialism is day by day sinking into the generalized crisis which is going on from one stage to the next without having time to recover. The conflicting interests among countries are becoming daily more acute. Its global strategy has also undergone irrevocable change. In particular, the impressive victories won almost simultaneously by the people of IndoChina, the Lao, Vietnamese and Kampuchean peoples have convincingly confirmed the development and the invincibility of these revolutionary trends. They have also demonstrated the swift degeneration of imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism and the forces of reaction, the instruments of imperialism. Thus, we can confirm that the present world is one in which imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism will inevitably crumble, in which the national liberation movements and the peoples which are masters of their fate will undoubtedly be victorious. It is also a time when all nations are engaged in re-establishing and consolidating lasting peace, independence and freedom and a time when imperialism, which used to lay down the law, has come to an end and when no force will be able to reverse the course of history.\n86.\tAs everyone knows, Laos for a century was a foreign colony. In particular, in the last 30 years our Lao nation has had to face day by day a fierce and extremely destructive war of aggression on the part of the imperialists and has suffered losses never before known in its history. However, when the war of aggression was imposed upon it, the Lao people, like any other people which loves peace, independence and liberty in the world, was in duty bound to pursue the struggle to preserve its national existence. The 3-million strong Lao population rose as one under the capable leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and valiantly undertook a just struggle against the war of imperialist aggression. Despite the vicissitudes of this 30-year struggle, which involved tremendous sacrifices, the Lao people finally scored striking victories.\n87.\tThe Vientiane agreement of 21 February 1973  put an end to the destructive war of aggression of the American imperialists and returned peace to our country. The Lao people was at last reunited in a single national community and indescribably happy at seeing its beloved homeland rid itself of war and the colonial yoke and become independent and autonomous. Giving expression to the ardent aspirations of our multinational people, the National Congress of the representatives of the people was unanimous in abolishing once and for all the obsolete monarchic regime and establishing the Lao People's Democratic Republic on 2 December 1975, a date which was henceforth to become the glorious national day of our people and make our\ncountry a truly independent, unified and democratic State and our people the true master of our country.\n88.\tThis immense victory was scored because of the solidarity of the resolute struggle of our people, because of the proper line of the struggle for national well-being carried out by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, because of the aid and support of the socialist countries, the peace- and justice-loving peoples of the world, with their progressive organizations, and particularly because of the militant and close solidarity between the Lao, Vietnamese and Kampuchean peoples. In a word, these are the victories of the truth of the times-that is, that, however small and backward a nation may be, if it is able to become united and is determined to struggle under the single and true direction of an authentically revolutionary party and if it receives international assistance and support, it will overcome all enemies, surmount all the greatest difficulties and embark on the path towards a glorious future.\n89.\tWe consider that these victories won by our people are not to our credit alone; they are the common victories of the three peoples-the Lao, Vietnamese and Kampuchean peoples and the victories of the movements struggling to safeguard peace, independence, democracy and social progress throughout the world.\n90.\tOn this occasion I should like, on behalf of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Lao people, to express my sincere thanks and gratitude for the close co-operation and disinterested assistance of the fraternal Government and people of Viet Nam and the fraternal Government and people of Kampuchea. My sincere thanks and gratitude go also to the socialist countries, to the peace- and justice-loving countries and peoples, to international organizations and to friends throughout the world represented here, for their valuable moral and material assistance.\n91.\tThe creation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic constitutes a major victory of the present age. It marks the downfall of the neo-colonialist policy of the imperialists. Hence, from its very first appearance in the world the new regime has been exposed to many forms of sabotage on the part of imperialism. In less than one year, the imperialists have used Thai reactionaries to maintain a certain number of Lao reactioniaries expelled by the Lao people and give them clandestine assistance to infiltrate various parts of the country for the purpose of sowing disorder. What is worse, they have encouraged acts of provocation on the Lao-Thai frontier which are designed to serve as a pretext to bring about the unilateral closing of the frontier in order to create economic and financial difficulties for our landlocked country. However treacherous their maneuvers have been, they have been constantly and ignominiously thwarted by the Lao people, armed as they are with patriotism and the lofty feeling of being masters of their own destiny. At the present time, the multinational Lao people are, on the one hand, defending their country and, on the other, mobilizing all their physical and moral strength to promote production, improve both material and spiritual living conditions, and heal the deep wounds of war left by the imperialists and the reactionaries; they are mobilizing all their strength to eliminate the vestiges of the former rotten neo-colonialist regime-that is, to eliminate shortages, unemployment and inflation and to change the old wasteful way of life, based only on foreign aid, into a way of life that is self-sufficient and relies on their own strength.\n92.\tHowever, we are perfectly aware that we have many difficulties still to face in the future. The underdevelopment bequeathed to us by the former regime is still of great concern to us, but thanks to the correct political line, to the tradition of patriotism which has been brought to the highest level during 30 years of struggle, and to the support and assistance of the peoples of Viet Nam and Kampuchea, of the socialist countries, of the other friendly countries of the world and of the organizations in the United Nations system, all these difficulties will undoubtedly be overcome so that our country can be constantly defended and developed.\n93.\tWe are convinced that, however treacherous they may be, the imperialists and the reactionaries will in the final analysis be incapable of turning back the clock of Lao history.\n94.\tIn the international sphere, the Lao People's Democratic Republic is in favor of a foreign policy of independence, peace, friendship and non-alignment and would like to maintain and develop good relations and relations of sincere co-operation with all countries, without any discrimination as to their social and political systems, on the basis of respect for independence and sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the parties, and on the basis of equality and mutual interest. We are endeavoring to contribute to the activities of the United Nations and the other international organizations that are striving to strengthen peace and international security. Furthermore, we are co-operating with the non- aligned countries and all the forces pitted against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism and struggling for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress.\n95.\tWe reaffirm our faith in the principles of the United Nations Charter: namely, to build a new world of peace, national independence, justice, equality, democracy and prosperity for mankind. We denounce and protest firmly against any policy of interference and immoral aggression on the part of imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and apartheid.\n96.\tThis thirty-first session of the General Assembly has opened at a time when the international situation has been undergoing a positive and correct change, after the glorious victory of the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries, held in Colombo, which once again demonstrated the growth and increased strength of the non-aligned movement in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and neo\u00accolonialism, thereby giving a strong impetus to the movements struggling for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress.\n97.\tThe glorious, resounding victories won by the Lao, Vietnamese and Kampuchean peoples, by the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau and other peoples in Africa against the Portuguese colonial regime, together with all the victories won by the peoples of Asia and Latin America, mark the final downfall of colonialism. At the same time, we are still wedded to our resolute support for the struggle for independence and justice waged by the peoples of southern Africa, and particularly those of Namibia and Zimbabwe, against racial discrimination, a struggle that will be crowned by brilliant victories that will be harbingers of freedom, independence and true sovereignty for these peoples and will spell the end of apartheid.\n98.\tIn the international sphere, IndoChina is the most prominent region of the world because the victories of its peoples have proved to the world that a people that is determined to struggle for national independence and freedom and that has a proper political line and enjoys the assistance and support of friendly countries throughout the world is capable of vanquishing the imperialist aggressors, even the most powerful ones. This struggle of the Lao people has tellingly proved that truth.\n99.\tOur people expresses its warmest greetings to the heroic people of Viet Nam for its striking, historic victory in its struggle against the imperialist aggressors and for its complete liberation of its country, thus successfully completing the reunification of Viet Nam and establishing the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. We give our full and firm support to the admission of that country to the United Nations.\n100.\tWe warmly acclaim the striking victory of the people of Kampuchea in its struggle against the imperialist aggressors and sincerely congratulate that people on the creation of the State of Democratic Kampuchea.\n101.\tThose victories won by Viet Nam and Kampuchea all serve as considerable encouragements and good examples for the peoples struggling for freedom and national independence.\n102.\tWe energetically denounce all the acts of provocation and savage repression which have been perpetrated by the American imperialists and the puppets of Park Chung Hee against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and against the people of South Korea. We support the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea; that is why we call for the implementation of the General Assembly resolution on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n103.\tWe denounce the dictatorship in Chile and demand that Pinochet put an immediate end to acts of repression against Chilean patriots, and that political prisoners, particularly Mr. Luis Corvalan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chile, be freed. We also demand that the United States reinstate the right of ownership of the people of Panama over the Canal, and make freedom and democracy a practical reality within the Organization of American States.\n104.\tWe demand that expansionist Israel abide by United Nations resolutions by withdrawing from the Arab territories occupied ;n 1967 and ensure the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, independence and sovereignty.\n105.\tWe condemn the apartheid regime in South Africa, which is now savagely persecuting the African people, and we protest against the imperialists, who, in collusion with the apartheid South African regime, are seeking to delay the granting of autonomy to the peoples of South Africa.\n106.\tWe also strongly protest against the installation of the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean by the United States imperialists, because we wish to transform that region into a zone of genuine peace and security.\n107.\tMy country's policy towards the countries of South\u00acEast Asia is one of establishing good neighborly relations based on mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and mutual interests of those countries. As far as Thailand is concerned, we are endeavoring to maintain relations of good neighborliness, and we support the struggle of the Thai people to turn the Kingdom of Thailand into a peaceful, independent and neutral country. However, we are against the American imperialists, who, in collusion with Thai reactionaries, are maintaining their military bases in a new guise, thus threatening peace in that part of the world.\n108.\tWe are convinced that the victory of the peoples of Laos, Viet Nam and Kampuchea over the aggression by the imperialists, and the joint victories won by revolutionary movements throughout the world have wrought a change in the world situation, a change that will be of great benefit to the struggle for peace, independence, democracy and social progress. We believe that this movement has weakened and, in fact, paralyzed the capacity of the imperialist and reactionary forces to wage a war of aggression as they did in the past against other countries. That is why the struggle for peace and detente throughout the world is daily becoming more and more solidly founded and is creating favorable conditions for disarmament.\n109.\tWe note that a new international economic order which is both just and mutually advantageous to all countries is an objective necessity, one which would aid the various countries in the world to safeguard their independence and their right to be masters of their own destiny, both in the political and economic fields. This need is, at the same time, a prerequisite for good international co-operation.\n110.\tFinally, on behalf of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Lao people, I wish to convey my sincere thanks to the countries and international organizations that have given us constant support and assistance. I hope that they will continue to give us the same support and assistance in order to make it possible for us to heal the wounds which we suffered from the war in our country and to construct the base for our national economy.\n111.\tMy delegation wishes the thirty-first session of the General Assembly every success.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should like to extend most cordial congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. The unanimous confidence placed in you for presiding over our debates is warmly shared by the Romanian delegation and is fully justified by your long association with United Nations activities, and by your well-known qualities as a statesman and a diplomat that were brilliantly confirmed, during the complex negotiations for the democratization of the law of the sea over which you presided. To our esteem for you we add the bonds of friendship and co-operation so fortunately existing between Romania and your country, the Republic of Sri Lanka, in order to give full expression to our satisfaction with your presence at this high rostrum.\n100.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, the representative of a friendly nation, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the competence and effectiveness with which he directed the work of the thirtieth session.\n101.\tMay I also take this opportunity to renew to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the assurances of our high appreciation of his devotion to the cause of the United Nations and of his efforts to strengthen the United Nations' role in international life, efforts which we follow with keen interest and which we hope will be continued in the years to come.\n102.\tThe delegation of the Socialist Republic of Romania is participating in this session of the General Assembly firmly determined to contribute to the settlement of the issues on the agenda, to the successful conclusion of the debates and to the raising of United Nations activity up to the legitimate hopes placed by the peoples in this Organization. The touchstone for the success of our endeavors is to what degree we shall be able to meet by deeds the imperative of our days: the building of a new international economic and political order which, based on new and democratic principles steeped in equity and justice, can truly guarantee the economic and social advancement of all nations.\n103.\tThe ferment stirred in the world arena by the ideas and objectives of a new international order, of a better and more just world, comes from the great revolutionary social and national changes that have been occurring throughout the world, from the ever stronger assertion of peoples' determination to decide their own fate, to secure their free and independent development and to live together in a climate of peace, security and co-operation. An important part in bringing about those changes has been played by the socialist countries, by their achievements in economic and social development and by the influence of socialism upon mankind's entire historical evolution. At the same time, the course of international life is strongly influenced by the policy of the newly independent States, which have freed themselves from colonial domination and are asserting themselves more and more firmly as distinct, free and independent nations. The combativeness of the broad masses everywhere in the world for a renewed society and for a policy of peace and international co-operation is also a factor of particular importance in the changes that have occurred in the world.\n104.\tThose changes find expression in the unflinching determination of peoples to fight for the observance of their right to make decisions in their own country, to do away with the imperialist, colonialist and neocolonialist policy of domination and exploitation and to build new relations among States. We see this happening wherever we look on this earth. The historic victories won by the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos against foreign interference and internal reaction, the successes scored by the national liberation movements that have brought the colonial system to the edge of its final eradication, the actions taken by the developing countries with a view to becoming masters of their national wealth and to using it in their own interests all this is most telling evidence.\n105.\tA significant moment in the assertion of the peoples' right to free and independent development and of the participation of all States in the world political life, on an equal footing, was marked by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which took place in Colombo last August. Considering that the non-aligned movement is an especially important factor in international life, the Romanian people welcomed with great satisfaction the Conference's decision to invite Romania to participate in the activities of the non-aligned countries.\n106.\tAs a result of the changes and transformations that have occurred in the world, a process of detente and co-operation has begun to take shape in international life. But that process is still only beginning; it is still fragile and not irreversible. There are still forces capable of endangering international peace and security. It is therefore more necessary now than ever before that all States and peoples intensify their endeavors to put an end to the old policy based on relations of subordination among States and peoples, on relations of paternalism, and on the logic of force and arbitrariness in international life. It is that policy that has engendered numerous confrontations and conflicts, and has created a profoundly unfair international division of labor, which has caused the great gaps existing between the development levels of different States.\n107.\tThe fulfillment of the peoples' aspirations for freedom and independence is inconsistent with the maintenance of the old order. Nowadays it is becoming ever clearer that, as President Nicolae Ceausescu has said:\n.. the old domestic and international relations created by the capitalist regime and by imperialist policy no longer correspond to the present stage of development of society and no longer offer appropriate solutions to the complex issues confronting peoples and contemporary mankind as a whole.\\\"\n108.\tIn our view, to set up a new international order means to undertake an innovating process of ending the outdated relations of domination and of building a new series of democratic relations among all States based upon the principles of international law. This implies the establishment of new, universally valid rules of conduct in inter-State relations which should, by ruling out the old inequities, open vast prospects for peaceful and freely accepted co-operation among partners having equal rights. The substance of those rules is the observance, in relations among all States, of the principles of national sovereignty and independence, equal rights, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, mutual benefit and non-use of force or the threat of force. Those are the pillars on which\nnew inter-State relations can be built. Some try to apply obsolete political doctrines to the new realities that are emerging, to revive in theory and practice the old tendencies to deny the basic role of a nation and of national independence as essential factors in the present historical stage of economic and social progress and in the maintenance of international peace and security, but the peoples cannot and will not accept such attempts. On the other hand, the principles that I have just mentioned are receiving ever wider recognition as the only ones capable of ensuring co-operation and understanding among States and a lasting peace throughout the world. But it is still necessary to bridge the gap between their theoretical acknowledgment and their observance in practice.\n109.\tSocialist Romania has adopted those principles as the foundation of its relations with all States. This has been enshrined in my country's Constitution. Those principles represent the quintessence of our people's concept of the ethics that should govern international life. It is in this spirit that Romania has concluded treaties of friendship and co-operation, as well as joint declarations, at the level of Heads of State, with one third of the States Members of the United Nations. These documents are known to the General Assembly since almost all of them have been circulated as official documents of the United Nations. Thus an effective contribution has been made to the work of establishing new relations among States. At the present stage of international relations we think that those principles should be better defined and developed with the participation of all States and that their authority should be enhanced.\n110.\tA basic factor in the construction of the new international order is disarmament and, first and foremost, nuclear disarmament, which is the vital requirement of mankind's future.\n111.\tAfter years of lengthy discussions on disarmament within the United Nations as well as in other forums, the absence of tangible results in this field can be neither explained nor understood by the peoples. Without denying the contribution made by the few treaties concluded so far to the creation of a climate of understanding, we have to admit that they have by no means affected the bases of armaments. On the contrary, the reality is that during all those years the arms race, especially the nuclear one, has taken a dizzily rapid upward spiral extremely dangerous to the very existence of man on this planet and to all his achievements.\n112.\tThe arms race not only seriously endangers the peace and security of the world but also does immense harm to the cause of development. It is quite clear that armaments have harmful economic and social consequences because they contribute to inflation, create artificial barriers to the. transfer of technology and equipment and decrease the exchange of information and scientific knowledge.\n224\n113.\tAt the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the continuation of the arms race acts as a stimulating factor for the imperialist policy of force and diktat, of interference in the internal affairs of other peoples and of the perpetuation of hotbeds of tension in various regions. Can we afford to accept the idea that weapons, including nuclear ones, will be continually improved and piled up in arsenals that have already surpassed the level of super- saturation, just for the sake of stockpiling and of achieving hypothetical balances on which to base the peace and security of peoples?\n114.\tWe think that stopping the arms race is the highest responsibility and greatest obligation of Governments and politicians to their own peoples and to the cause of civilization and progress. As President Nicolae Ceaussscu emphasized:\n.. it would be an unforgiveable mistake to give the peoples the illusion that they can live quietly and safely while more and more new stockpiles of destructive weapons are accumulated at an extremely rapid pace in the world. We must openly show the reality of the situation to the peoples and take action before it is too late to adopt resolute measures for stopping the arms race.\\\"\n115.\tIn the view of the Romanian delegation it is time to go beyond routine action and inertia and to strengthen the role of the United Nations and, above all, the role of the General Assembly, which should include disarmament issues among its essential concerns and proceed to a meaningful discussion of them and to the adoption of effective measures.\n116.\tStarting from these considerations and desiring to contribute to getting the disarmament negotiations out of the present stalemate so as to make possible the adoption of measures that would finally lead to general and complete disarmament, the Romanian Government submitted to the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly an official document containing my country's position on the problems of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, and on the establishment of a lasting peace in the world.  In that document Romania proposed a set of measures concerning the following: the freezing and reduction of military budgets; the banning, gradual reduction and, in the long run, liquidation of nuclear armaments; the creation of nuclear-free zones of peace and co-operation; the adoption of partial and regional measures of disarmament and military disengagement; the conclusion of a treaty on general and complete disarmament; the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and of the General Assembly in the field of disarmament; the banning of war propaganda; and the mobilization of all forces of society to achieve disarmament.\n117.\tTaking into account the ever increasing urgency of the problem of disarmament, I should like to reaffirm the importance which Romania attaches to the measures proposed in the above-mentioned document and, at the same time, to stress once more the necessity that all States should intensify their efforts with a view to taking effective disarmament measures, particularly in the field of nuclear disarmament. It is necessary that public opinion be widely informed\u2014and here the United Nations can play a decisive role\u2014of the present situation in the field of armaments, of\nthe consequences of the arms race, and of the measures to be taken for disarmament, since these problems in the last analysis affect the existence of every individual, the broad masses and the peoples. It is on this force and on the conscience of peoples that we must rely in our activities concerning disarmament. We consider that an appropriate method of starting a powerful process of disarmament would be the convening of a special session of the General Assembly specially devoted to disarmament issues. Such a session would offer a propitious framework for the involvement and participation of all States on an equal footing in the discussion and solution of this problem which is crucial for the contemporary world.\n118.\tThe urgency of the adoption of concrete measures with regard to disarmament and military disengagement appears particularly evident in view of the present situation in Europe. It is here that we find the largest concentration of military forces and the most powerful arsenal, including nuclear weapons, ever known in history. It is also here that the two military blocs confront each other. In our opinion, the process of building peace and security in Europe as well as throughout the world cannot take on durability and substance until the problems of disarmament and, above all, of nuclear disarmament are tackled in substance and with the clear determination to reach a basic settlement.\n119.\tThat is why we stress the need for determined action aimed at rapid and concrete measures of military disengagement and disarmament, at the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of other States, at the dismantling of foreign military bases, as well as at the adoption of other similar steps, thus creating the necessary conditions for the simultaneous liquidation of the two military blocs-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. The necessity of concluding agreements providing for adequate guarantees that will effectively lead to the outlawing of the use or threat of force is becoming ever stronger. The peoples will thus become more confident that they are not going to be the victims of any foreign aggression or interference, whatever form or pretext it might take.\n120.\tIn this context the Romanian delegation wishes to draw attention to the fact that lately, along with the intensification of the nuclear arms race, actions are being taken to prevent the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by countries which, having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], have renounced the acquisition of these weapons. These actions demonstrate an unawareness of the provisions of the Treaty, which in article IV states that:\n\\\"Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non- nuclear-weapon States Parties to the Treaty ...\\\".\nThe measures and actions taken by a limited group of States in order to restrain and hinder the peaceful uses of atomic energy could undermine the very substance of the non-proliferation Treaty. It must be clear to everyone that the future of this Treaty is linked to respect for the right of non-nuclear-weapon States to have access, without discrimination, to the widest possible exchanges of equipment, materials and scientific and technical information with a view to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The future of the Treaty also depends just as much on the fulfilment of the obligations undertaken by the nuclear-weapon States to encourage and facilitate access to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by non-nuclear States.\n121.\tIn my Government's opinion, any approach failing to take these considerations into account, any limitations, restrictions or disregard of the right to the peaceful use of atomic energy, will encourage States to reconsider their position on this Treaty.\n122.\tEuropean security and the establishment of new relations of trust and co-operation among all the States of the continent can only be a joint enterprise and the responsibility of all the countries of Europe. That is why we consider the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, based on the equal rights of the participants, as a historic event in European political life.\n123.\tAlthough certain results have been achieved in the implementation of the Final Act adopted by the Conference, we have to admit that the hopes placed in the document signed at Helsinki by our peoples are still awaiting fulfilment. As we have pointed out, in Europe there are still unresolved complex and serious issues on whose settlement the peace, security, freedom and welfare of the peoples of the continent depend. We think that we should act with all the energy at our command in order to implement the documents of the Conference and to continue the multilateral process of achieving security and co-operation in Europe. Otherwise, the Final Act will remain a mere statement of good intentions such as Europe has already known in the course of time; and that would mean that no wisdom has been gained from the hard lessons European history has taught us more than once. Therefore, the meeting which is to take place in Belgrade in 1977 will have to give strong impetus to the execution of the measures and actions agreed upon in the Final Act and bring about new progress in the process of building up lasting security and co-operation among the participating countries. This will be highly beneficial for the cause of peace and co-operation of all peoples based on equality.\n124.\tWithin this process we attach particular importance to the establishment of new relations of co-operation and good-neighbourliness among the Balkan countries, with a view to transforming that zone, as well as other zones in Europe and in other continents, into a zone of peace and peaceful co-operation, which is part and parcel of European security.\n125.\tThe achievement of a new international order also requires determined endeavours for the liquidation of the sources of tension and animosity and for the extinction of hotbeds of conflict. Under present international circumstances, the attempts at settling these issues by force can only lead to new tension and conflict. That is why, in order to arrive at just settlements of disagreements among States, it is necessary to act in a spirit of high responsibility, through direct talks and negotiations among the parties concerned which should be based upon the observance of\nthe right to self-determination of each and every nation and on the observance of every people's independence. It is our firm belief that this is the only way to settle issues in the interest of each and every people and of the general cause of progress and peace.\n126.\tIn that spirit, we are of the opinion that there should be an intensification of the efforts to attain, in the shortest possible time, a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East. The essential components of an equitable solution which could bring about that peace are: Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967, the attainment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people\u2014including their right to have their own independent State\u2014and the guaranteeing of the independence and sovereignty of all the countries in the region.\n127.\tWe think that in Lebanon too peace can be restored only through negotiations. We declare ourselves to be in favour of the immediate cessation of fighting and the reaching of an understanding among the political and social forces in Lebanon that would ensure the integrity, unity and sovereignty of that State and would lead to the ruling out of any foreign interference in its internal affairs.\n128.\tIn Cyprus as well there is no other way for settling the situation except the political way, based on the maintenance of that State's independence and sovereignty and on the peaceful coexistence of the two communities. We place legitimate hope in the furthering of the dialogue between the two communities and in the role which such a dialogue might play as a means of restoring confidence among all the inhabitants of Cyprus.\n129.\tIn Korea the fragile armistice has to be replaced by a lasting peace. We think that the political initiatives and the constructive proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, if receptivity is shown towards them, could lead to that peace, to the fulfilment of the Korean people's vital aspirations to the peaceful, independent and democratic reunification of their homeland.\n130.\tIn the spirit of the aforementioned basic principles, Romania acts with perseverance, within the means at its disposal, to contribute to the extinction of all hotbeds of tension and to the settlement of all controversial issues by peaceful and political means.\n131.\tThe establishment of a new order in the world also requires the adoption of decisive measures aimed at securing the quick and final liberation of all peoples from any foreign oppression and the complete elimination of colonialism and its manifestations: racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid.\n132.\tIn that connexion, we actively support the struggle of the peoples in Namibia and Rhodesia, as well as in other Territories, to put an end to colonial domination. In the same spirit we firmly condemn also the bloody repressions engaged in by the racist regime in South Africa.\n226\n133.\tIn our view, firm measures should be taken, within the framework of the United Nations, to give effective support to the national liberation movements in these Territories, especially since the General Assembly has recognized those movements as the authentic represen-tatives of their peoples. At the same time, we think that the General Assembly should establish precise deadlines, as early as possible-one or two years\u2014during which the Powers still having colonial possessions or administering Territories which do not belong to them should create all the conditions necessary for the respective peoples to be able freely to exercise the right to decide (heir own destiny. The effective transfer of power or the recognition of the exercise of that right will have to be carried out, according to the circumstances, under the General Assembly's control or observation.\n134.\tWe deem it to be a duty of honour on the part of the United Nations and all States to take resolute action for the permanent liquidation of the colonialist policy and all forms of colonialism and domination, as well as for the rejection of any acts aimed at their revival.\n135.\tOn the economic plane, one of the foremost objectives of the new order is the promotion of the more rapid advancement of the under-developed countries, the elimination of under-development and the bridging of the great economic gaps among States. That is a sine qua non for real security and lasting peace throughout the world.\n136.\tOf decisive importance for the liquidation of under-development and the bridging of gaps are the efforts made by all peoples, the mobilization of their entire material and human potential for the development of forces of production. life itself and the experience of many peoples, including the Romanian people, bear witness to that fact. It is precisely in this way, by persevering work, by the pursuit of a policy of systematically allotting a large part of the national income to development, that the Romanian people have succeeded in scoring great achievements in economic and social development and in raising their living standard.\n137.\tAt the same time, international economic co-operation has an important part to play in assisting the endeavours of the developing countries to speed up their progress. The economically advanced countries that have exercised colonial domination have the moral duty now to make their contribution to the liquidation of under-development and to the narrowing of the gaps. If is also a great duty of honour for all countries to help accelerate the economic and social advancement of the under-developed States. The establishment of the new economic order designed to ensure the stability and harmonious development of the economy of the whole world is a common cause for all countries and peoples, and no one can avoid this imperative of history. This is an imperative necessity for the development of human society. Mankind can no longer advance in a situation where there are a small number of prosperous and rich countries and a large number of extremely poor countries.\n138.\tPoverty and wealth, increasingly polarized, cannot coexist indefinitely. Such a state of affairs will lead unavoidably to instability, to explosive situations and to conflicts leaving serious repercussions for international peace and security. It is in the interest of all nations, including the advanced States, that the developing countries should receive ever greater help in building up their own industries, developing their economies more rapidly, render\u00ac\ning their national resources more fully profitable, and participating actively, on terms of complete equality, in the exchange of material and spiritual values.\n139.\tAn outstanding and highly responsible role is to be played in this connexion by the United Nations and its agencies. We have a positive assessment of the actions taken so far towards the establishment of the new economic order. In this connexion, we emphasize the importance we attach to the work of the recent fourth session of UNCTAD, recently held in Nairobi, which highlighted the determination and concern of the developing countries to unite their efforts in order to achieve just and equitable solutions for international economic problems, in the spirit of the programme adopted in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a friendly country whose contribution to the formulation of the document is greatly appreciated. We deem it necessary that measures should be taken to ensure steadfast supervision of the implementation of the measures agreed upon. On the other hand, further and greater efforts should be made within the framework of the United Nations to finalize concrete programmes and determine means of practical action aimed at the attainment of the various objectives of the new economic order. We shall also have to envisage the most appropriate framework for the working out, with the participation of all States, of a unitary concept to guide the multilateral negotiations held to that end.\n140.\tWishing to contribute to the fulfilment of the requirements of the new international economic order, Romania, which is a socialist country and a member of the Group of 77, has both in the United Nations and in other international organizations presented a number of concrete proposals involving steps to be taken towards a gradual bridging of the great gaps between States, to the growth of international co-operation and to the establishment of new and fair relations between States. It is in the spirit of those proposals that we shall make an active contribution to the identification of the best ways and means of fulfilling the desired goals.\n141.\tThe establishment of a new international order, therefore, involves a large number of the aspects of international relations. It raises complex issues whose proper examination and settlement call for the co-operation and active contribution of all States on an equal footing. The natural framework for approaching and analyzing these questions is the United Nations, its organs and agencies.\n142.\tFor all these reasons, and as a matter of principle, an elementary requirement is the creation of appropriate conditions which would ensure the participation of all States in United Nations activities.\n143.\tIn this respect I should like to extend our greetings to the new Member of our Organization, the Republic of Seychelles, tc which we address a cordial welcome and assurances of our entire co-operation. We warmly support the lawful desire of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as soon as possible to take its rightful seat in the United Nations. The admission of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations would be an act of justice towards the VietNamese people, which has suffered greatly during its struggle for independence and national unity; it would also be in the interests of international peace and understanding, and it would be in the interests of the Organization itself. We also express our hope that the right of the People's Republic of Angola to become a Member of this Organization will soon be unanimously recognized.\n144.\tThe universality of this Organization, which we favour, also has a qualitative aspect. It is in the general interest that problems directly concerning all peoples, progress and peace should be tackled and discussed within the United Nations, where each has his say, and not outside the Organization. It is here, and only here, that a consensus can be reached for their fair and equitable solution, which must be our common goal.\n145.\tUndoubtedly it is necessary to improve the working style and methods of the Organization so as to make possible a quicker and more efficient examination of the issues before it. There is a need for improvement in the structure of the Organization, which should adequately reflect the great changes that have occurred in the world since the establishment of the United Nations, the growing role of the small and medium-sized countries and the developing and non-aligned countries which form the greatest part of the world and are directly interested in the fair settlement of international issues. Romania's proposals concerning the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in international life, submitted to the General Assembly in a document at the last session,  were conceived precisely in that spirit.\n146.\tWe are happy that, thanks to the initiative of the Romanian Government in 1972, we have been able to contribute to the initiation of a process meant to strength\u00acen the Organization. We believe that the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization has done useful work, but it is necessary for that Committee fully to carry out the mandate entrusted to it In our opinion, it should make great efforts-possibly through a more precise mandate-so that it might become a real laboratory in which generally acceptable solutions and measures aimed at raising United Nations activities to a higher level could be prepared.\n147.\tWe are confident that the need for the democratization of the United Nations taking due account of the changes that have occurred in the contemporary world will be understood by all. By reflecting those changes and the fundamental objectives of present-day international life, the United Nations Charter will in its entire contents have to inspire and direct the process involved in the establishment of truly democratic and fair relations among States, the process of setting up a new international economic and political order. By acting along those lines the United Nations will be able to make a more substantial and efficient contribution to the consolidation of the new direction taken in international relations and to the creation of a climate of detente, co-operation and under\u00acstanding among nations.\n148.\tThe United Nations has begun to have its own history. More than three decades have elapsed since its creation. But that is one more reason for us to ask ourselves\nover and over again unceasingly if we have done everything we should have done to justify the trust and the hope people have placed in this body. It is a forum in which we must not waste our time in sterile discussion but in which, on the contrary, we must focus our attention on analysing issues, on discovering the most appropriate solutions acceptable to all and on the means of putting into practice what has been decided upon here.\n149.\tThat question cannot be rhetorical. Our concrete activity should be its answer.\n150.\tThe Romanian delegation is confident that by combining our endeavours and by approaching the debates of this session in a highly responsible manner, we shall succeed in responding to the hopes of our peoples, the 4 billion human beings who wish to live in peace and co-operation.\n151.\tWe have to fulfil our duty towards them.\n152.\tWe have to do our utmost to build a better and fairer world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great joy that I have the honor of welcoming Mr. Amerasinghe, through you, Sir, as President of this thirty-first ordinary session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I offer him my most sincere congratulations on his brilliant election, and the delegation which is here with me joins me in paying him this well-deserved tribute. We are certain that this election is not only a token of the recognition by the Members of the United Nations of his experience and competence, which have been demonstrated so often at international meetings, but also a well-deserved tribute to his country, Sri Lanka, which plays a very important role in the search for solutions to the problems confronting the States Members of the United Nations.\n2.\tIndeed, his country only recently hosted the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, which dealt in an objective and realistic manner with the main problems which are of concern to the international community. That Conference of non- aligned countries made a number of highly pertinent suggestions [see A/31 /l97] designed to establish greater harmony in relations of international co-operation and to promote justice and peace.\n3.\tThis last session of the General Assembly has just completed its work under the leadership of Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, who with great skill and competence placed his rich experience of international affairs in the service of our Organization, His effective guidance of our discussions enabled us to engage in an open and frank dialog regarding the countless problems with which the international community is concerned and which call for a just and speedy solution. We are very grateful to him for this contribution to the cause of our international community.\n4.\tOur delegation wishes to associate itself with preceding speakers in paying a resounding tribute to the Secretary- General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We want to express to him the great satisfaction of our Government at the efforts which he is making in this high office and the important contribution which he has made towards the implementation of the resolutions of our international community.\n5.\tWe warmly welcome the admission of the new Member of our Organization, the Republic of Seychelles, and wish the people and Government of that country, with which our country hopes to co-operate in a wide variety of fields, a prosperous future.\n6.\tOur Assembly is meeting in the shadow of the demise of Chairman Mao Tsetung, that eminent and esteemed personality who played such a vital role in solving the major problems confronting mankind. The ideological contribution of Chairman Mao as an experienced and realistic theoretician, and his concrete contribution, as a militant, to the liberation of the Chinese people and other oppressed peoples, have made a deep impact on the course of history. The peoples of Africa are particularly grateful to Chairman Mao for the assistance which his country, the People's Republic of China, is giving them, either in consolidating their independence or in helping them to stand on their own feet.\n7.\tLast year, when the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe was admitted to membership in the United Nations, the delegation of my country had the honor of conveying to this international Assembly the gratitude of the people of Sao Tome and Principe for the support and assistance which this Organization gave us during our national liberation struggle. We have expressed our dedication to the Charter of the United Nations and the will of our people and Government to co-operate with all other peace-loving States, irrespective of their political and economic systems, in a wide variety of fields and on the basis of full equality and respect for national sovereignty. We are absolutely convinced of the interdependence which already exists between the various States on cur planet, and also of the need to create a new political and economic framework for our international community.\n8.\tWhile nationalism is certainly an indispensable means for peoples to achieve their liberation and to reaffirm their identity and at the same time enable them to become masters of their countries and of their natural resources, it \nmust on no account be a force barring the way to interdependence among nations and to bilateral or multilateral co-operation which is advantageous for all.\n9.\tNationalism should not exclude arrangements for much more fruitful co-operation at a regional or international level within the framework of the new economic and political international order. The independence which we achieved last year is only a means for our people to recuperate and to preserve its freedom. It is also an indispensable weapon which enables us to use our full potential in order to respond rapidly to the problems of hunger, sickness, illiteracy, unemployment, ignorance and the poverty of the masses of the people in general. We were exploited by a regime which was interested in seizing our resources with virtually no compensation in the form of training personnel or developing a socio-economic infrastructure, or supplying equipment. By forcing our country to follow an economic policy which was oriented only towards developing agricultural exports and by preventing It from developing the production of food which might have competed with that of the home country, the Portuguese colonial domination has left us a very negative heritage, namely malnutrition, the absence of institutions for health care, unemployment, obsolete economic equipment, amortized long ago, a total lack of any means of communication with the outside world, and the alienation of our natural resources. It should also be noted that during the colonial and Fascist period the development of the industrial sector was regarded as incompatible with the interests of the metropolitan country and therefore it was prohibited.\n10.\tIt is true that, when we attained independence last year, the Portuguese colonial regime which, none the less, lasted for over five centuries in our country, had not left us with a single port, any real airport, or any other means of transport to the outside world. Furthermore, our people were completely dispossessed of the most elementary means of production which could have enabled us somehow to meet our most vital needs.\n11.\tWe inherited a country where agriculture to this date is the main source of national income and then it became apparent that 80 per cent of the arable grounds belonged to a tiny minority of the population who were nationals of the former metropolitan, country and which represented less than 1 per cent of the total population.\n12.\tMoreover, having inherited an economic structure which was founded on the exclusive cultivation of exportable agricultural products at the expense of foodstuffs, we considered that we would not be able to embark upon an economic development program that would be capable of solving the acute problems, of the masses in, out country unless we developed our country economically in a way that would be more in conformity with the vital interests of our people.\n13.\tWe therefore began to carry out during the whole of last year a program of agrarian reform, the aim of which is to overcome the harmful economic structure we have inherited from colonial domination.\n14.\tThis program of agrarian reform began with the expropriation of 90 per cent of the arable land of our country which had belonged to absentee landlords. As regards the exploitation of this land we have brought about the election for each agricultural production unit of a management board consisting of representatives of the workers. This management board must take over the administrative, financial and economic administration of the agricultural unit under the guidance, and with the technical assistance, of the State in order to meet the collective needs of our population. We are beginning now to see some fruitful results from this reform, despite the difficulties which we still face as regards technical assistance and capital equipment.\n15.\tAt the external level we deem it indispensable to change the structure of economic international relations. The prices of the manufactured products we import continue to increase disproportionately to the movements in the prices of the raw materials we export. In our opinion it is not enough merely to take domestic measures in order to create the conditions necessary for our development.\n16.\tWe also note that the difficulties we are encountering in. changing our domestic economic structure and the system of international economic relations are being experienced almost as keenly by all the third-world countries which produce commodities. The same difficulties are to be found in practically all the countries of the third world, whether they have decided to base their development on the export of two or three raw materials, which enables them to import manufactured products; or whether they practice an economic policy of producing manufactured goods for the purpose of import substitution; or again whether they have staked their development on the production of manufactured goods for export. These general difficulties which are being encountered in almost all the countries of the third world, are of course attributable to the existing financial monetary and commercial structure which was imposed during the period of colonial domination in these countries. This economic structure is to a large extent the cause of the balance-of- payments deficits and the ever-increasing indebtedness of most of the third-world countries. Inflation, economic stagnation, and the recession in most developing countries are largely due to the structure inherited from colonialism and imperialism.\n17.\tAccording to the report of the fourth session of the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development [UNCTAD], during the quarter of a century extending from the end of the Second World War to the beginning of the 1970s the existing order brought to developing countries with a market economy a phenomenal expansion of the productive capacity of these countries,, of their real income and their levels of consumption. On the other hand, according to the report, during the same period the experience of the developing countries presents an alarming contrast. If we consider the 20 years which elapsed between 1952 and 1972 the total national product of the developed countries with a market economy has increased from $1,250 billion to approximately $3,070 billion at the prices of 1973 and the increase of $1,820 billion represented by itself around three and a half times the total accumulated gross national products of all the developing countries in 1972 which came to only $520 billion. The real income per capita showed an even. more striking contrast. In the developed countries with a market economy it moved from $2,000 per capita in 1952, estimated at the prices of 1973, to a figure close on $4,000 in 1972. In the developing countries, however, the real income was approximately $300 per capita in 1972, the increase being only $125 as compared with the figure of 1952. The increase of the real per capita income therefore during this period was 16 times greater in the developed countries with a market economy than it was in the developing countries. \n18.\tAnd yet it is quite clear that the struggle which is waged by the third-world countries to change both their domestic economic structures as well as the general structure of international economic relations is being met with resistance on the part of most industrialized countries in the West. With the exception of some industrialized countries which are prepared to make their contribution to satisfy the just claims of the third-world countries with regard to new financial, monetary and commercial relations, we see that there are also maneuvers that are being conducted by Western industrialized countries in order to conceal the true nature of the struggle which all of the third world has to wage in order to cope with the problems caused by the poverty of their populations. Just as the demands of the colonial peoples- for their just right to self-determination and independence were construed as a simple ideological conflict involving attempted infiltration by the Communist countries in order to establish a new form of domination, in the same manner efforts are being made to confuse international public opinion and to divide the countries of the third world by making it appear that their attempts to recuperate their natural resources and to recover control over their economic activities is only a subversive foreign Communist offensive.\n19.\tYet one forgets the positive role which the militant solidarity of the socialist countries played during the whole period of colonial domination and the role it still plays in fostering the real economic development of many developing countries.\n20.\tIf it is true that the vast majority of the peoples of Africa under foreign domination have, through their own efforts together with the militant solidarity of the peoples who love peace and justice, been successful in achieving political independence and beginning with determination their march towards finding the true path of co-operation with other States of the international community, it is none the less true that much remains to be done in southern Africa, where racist domination is still the most repressive and inhuman in the world. This situation is a flagrant violation of the most elementary principles of human rights and of the Charter. It is also a threat to the security of all the peoples of Africa and endangers world peace.\n21.\tIt is surprising to see that some countries which claim to be defenders of human rights and which condemn, in words, apartheid none the less have very close relationships with the racists Vorster and Smith, while at the same time they denounce their policies of racial discrimination.\n22.\tIndeed, these countries give very valuable assistance to the legal and racist regimes by co-operating with them, by giving them the economic, financial, technical and even diplomatic support they need to continue their Fascist domination over the peoples of southern Africa. There is no doubt that the regimes of Smith, Vorster and their henchmen would certainly not have lasted if they did not receive the barely concealed support of some Western Powers which have expanded their investments in South Africa and Rhodesia while at the same time supplying these regimes with powerful military means for barbarous repression of the African masses.\n23.\tDespite the condemnations voiced by almost all the countries of the world, the racist regimes of southern Africa continue to seek internal and external means to ensure their survival.\n24.\tIndeed, the alliance between Tel Aviv and Johannesburg, which is reinforced by the visit of the racist Vorster to Israel, has clearly shown the nature of these two racist and oppressive regimes which give each other mutual assistance against the Arab and African peoples.\n25.\tThe policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" is simply a legalization of apartheid. It is aimed at implementing the diabolical South African policy of perpetuating domination over the blacks by enclosing them in the most forsaken and disadvantaged regions in order to prolong indefinitely their exploitation of African labor.\n26.\tThe United Nations must therefore withhold recognition of the project of \\\"bantustanization\\\", the current model of which simply presents some black puppets as the leaders of Transkei.\n27.\tThe activities of the regimes of Johannesburg and Tel Aviv have not deceived the Arab and African countries, which have now reinforced their solidarity against these oppressive regimes. The tactics of the South African racists have also failed to deceive the black population of South Africa. The successive revolts in Soweto and elsewhere all over South Africa show very clearly that the people of that country have resolutely decided to sweep away the sordid regime instituted by the partisans of apartheid.\n28.\tWith regard to Zimbabwe, only the development of the armed struggle and other nationalist actions, helped by the active solidarity of the peoples who love peace and liberty, can force the rebellious Ian Smith and his followers to abandon Zimbabwe.\n29.\tIndeed, what positive role can the rebellious racist Smith and his followers play in an independent Zimbabwe?\n30.\tHow can Smith and his friends maintain that they want to discuss the constitutional regime to be established in Zimbabwe when for over 10 years they have flouted all of international law and themselves rebelled against Great Britain, which has responsibility for the Territory of Southern Rhodesia?\n31.\tThese racists should realize that, while Africa is a land of brotherhood and peace, it has no need of them to build its future. Africa is no longer the continent where the minorities can perpetuate through racism the privileges they acquired during the colonial period.\n32.\tWith regard to Namibia, we see that, despite the resolutions of the United Nations and of other international organizations, South Africa continues to maintain illegally its domination over this Territory. The purpose is to find puppets who will enable South Africa to ensure the continuation of the apartheid regime. The mandate to administer Namibia entrusted to South Africa by the United Nations has expired.\n33.\tSouth Africa must now withdraw from Namibia and we can ask the United Nations to take every conceivable measure in order to achieve speedy independence for Namibia.\n34.\tThe South African repression of the indigenous population of Namibia, the imprisonment and the massacres of the patriots of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], and the invasion of the People's Republic of Angola are facts which are so well known that we do not need to repeat them here.\n35.\tWe do appeal to this international Organization to support SWAPO as the only legitimate representative of the interests of the Namibian people.\n36.\tThe detachment of the island of Mayotte from the Comoros by France is a very dangerous precedent and is necessarily a matter of much concern. This act certainly casts a shadow on the relations of friendship and cooperation which France wishes to have and to maintain with the African States.\n37.\tWe take our places at the side of the Government of the Comoros in asking for the restoration of its territorial integrity, and we appeal to this international community to give positive support to the Republic of the Comoros to help it to regain its territorial integrity and national unity.\n38.\tThe right to self-determination and independence is a principle for which we have waged a long struggle, and we feel that no nation on this planet should be deprived of this right. We are very vigilant as regards legal maneuvers and subterfuges which can be used to frustrate such rights for we were victims of such action under Portuguese colonial domination. By a legal subterfuge, the Government in colonial times sought to deny our people its right to self-determination and independence.\n39.\tDespite the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]and the United Nations, some States continue to flout these rights, and this can only be prejudicial to relations among States and constitute the source of grave conflicts.\n40.\tMy Government believes that the peoples of East Timor and Western Sahara have been deprived of their right to self-determination. We reaffirm our full support for FRETILIN* and the Frente POLISARIO, which are struggling for the just implementation of the right to self- determination and liberation in East Timor and Western Sahara respectively.\n41.\tIt seems to us increasingly clear that the international community is moving towards greater awareness of the need for solidarity and co-operation in order to improve the standard of living of all the peoples of this planet than of the need for the creation of arsenals of highly sophisticated armaments which could easily lead to the destruction of mankind. Our community should move towards interdependence, leading to the creation of maritime zones of peace and peaceful co-operation rather than of militarized zones.\n42.\tIt is the will of the masses which are from year to year gaining their freedom from colonial and imperialist domination through their struggle and their sacrifices to preserve their full sovereignty and to pursue a policy of non- adherence to any military bloc.\n43.\tThe voices that call for international security through the destruction of armaments, particularly of nuclear weapon stockpiles, are as loud as those which proclaim the advent of a new political and economic international order.\n44.\tAnd yet we see that enormous sums are still being wasted in the making of weapons of destruction, whereas what is necessary is to deal with the urgent problems besetting the countries which have been reduced to indigence as a result of colonial and imperialist domination. We note with indignation that, while over 1 billion people in the third world languish in poverty, more than $300 billion yearly is spent on armaments.\n45.\tWe associate ourselves with the previous speakers who have expressed their countries' hope that the climate of security initiated in Europe with the signature of the Final Act of Helsinki on 1 August 1975 will extend to the rest of the world.\n46.\tWe believe that this security should not be confined to Europe but that it should include other continents as well.\n47.\tWe support the idea of an international conference on' disarmament. All States should participate in such a conference, which should establish a timetable for general and complete disarmament.\n48.\tThe maneuvers aimed at violating the territorial integrity, national unity, sovereignty and independence; of States can only foster insecurity at both the regional and international levels.\n49.\tThe partition of Korea, for instance, creates a situation that threatens peace and security in Asia and throughout the world. We reaffirm our full support for the policy of peaceful reunification of Korea, without any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of that country. All foreign forces should be withdrawn from the southern part of Korean territory and the Armistice Agreement should become a peace treaty. We urge the immediate implementation of the resolution which was adopted last year [resolution 3390 (XXX)].\n50.\tThe threats to the territorial integrity of Cyprus and the acts designed to thwart its policy of independence must necessarily cause insecurity in that region, and my Government firmly supports the policy of non-alignment and independence of the Government of Cyprus, as well as its policy of national unity and territorial integrity.\n51.\tNotwithstanding the principles of the United Nations Charter which govern the international community and which lay down rules for guiding international relations- namely, the sovereign equality of States, non-interference, the sovereignty of States over their natural resources and the economic activities engaged in within their territories certain States persist in trying to impose their will in order to perpetuate their system of economic and political exploitation.\n52.\tA striking example of the use of force in defiance of these principles which govern the international community is the attitude taken towards the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola. The object sought was to prevent these countries from setting up a political and economic system that would not only ensure their full sovereignty and non-alignment but would also enable them to respond more effectively to the development needs of their peoples, who had been the martyred victims of colonialism and imperialism. Our international Organization retains in its Charter certain provisions which in fact negate the principle of equality among States and which therefore institute discrimination among them. The vetoes cast in the Security Council to oppose the admission to the United Nations of Angola and Viet Nam, both recognized by a majority of the membership of this Organization, are examples of an abusive and unilateral use of the anachronistic right of veto. But the brave peoples of Angola and Viet Nam, who gave such examples of self-sacrifice and determination by trying to preserve the principle of independence and the right to choose the political system that suited them, will soon take their places in the United Nations because they fulfill all the conditions for membership. My Government urges that the Republic of Angola and Viet Nam be admitted to membership in the Organization without delay.\n53.\tIt is also our duty to support Panama in its just struggle to exercise full sovereignty over its own territory, as well as the efforts of Guyana and Jamaica in a framework of nationalism and independence to strengthen their sovereignty and to establish control over their natural resources and all other economic activities in their countries.\n54.\tWe express our solidarity with the Chilean patriots in their struggle for the restoration of respect for human rights in Chile, and we avail ourselves of this opportunity to ask the international community to exert every effort to achieve the liberation of the great patriot, Luis Corvalan.\n55.\tThe heroic struggles of the peoples of Kampuchea and Laos, whose victory we warmly welcome, show that, despite imperalist opposition, the peoples, will always triumph over all aggression and all threats which imperialism makes against them.\n56.\tI have just enumerated some of the problems which ate certainly of concern to the entire international community and which, in the view of my Government, require a just and immediate solution. These problems make it difficult for our whole international community to have fruitful and friendly relations which should be profitable to the future of the whole of mankind.\n57.\tWe are deeply convinced of the need for co-operation among the various peoples and States which make up the international community. Such co-operation certainly requires interdependence among States based on a spirit of justice.\n58.\tHowever, we do not believe that these problems wQl be solved by a miracle or by the passivity of the peoples. History is marching on and the peoples of all continents have affirmed their will to combat all forms of domination and exploitation and to create a new political and economic framework which would be more in conformity with nature and human destiny.\n59.\tWe recognize that the existence of the United Nations, where such a wide variety of countries are represented, marks an important stage in the search for ways and means of creating a political and economic framework which would make it possible to achieve the noble objectives of the Charter of our Organization and the implementation of the just and pertinent resolutions that derive from them.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend to the President the warm and sincere congratulations of the delegation of Benin on his election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of our Organization. His election is a tribute to him for his eminent talents as a well-informed diplomat and for his personal qualifications-qualities that we have already noted and admired in him during the difficult negotiations that he has been conducting among various groups of countries as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. His election is also a tribute to his country, Sri Lanka, which has just acted as host, with so much success, to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, and all the countries of the third world. I should like to express to him the deep satisfaction felt by the People's Republic of Benin at seeing him guiding our work this year. My delegation is convinced that under his wise and clear-sighted direction the work of the thirty-first session will be crowned with success.\n306.\tThe President succeeds Mr. Thorn, an outstanding statesman from Luxembourg who, in an exceptional and praiseworthy manner, guided the work of the thirtieth session. I should like to express here the deep satisfaction of my delegation as well as our great appreciation of the able way in which this experienced parliamentarian guided the work of the thirtieth session and found solutions to the very delicate problems with which we were faced.\n307.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express from this rostrum my Government's sincere appreciation of the effective, positive and sustained work accomplished by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the triumph of our noble humanitarian ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations to safeguard and preserve international peace and security.\n308.\tIn rapidly taking stock of the activities of our Secretary-General my delegation is firmly convinced that he could do even better and find for the acute problems of the moment reasonable, just and acceptable solutions for all parties were he to benefit from the confidence and disinterested co-operation of all and more particularly of the major Powers.\n309.\tThe People's Republic of Benin would finally like to extend a very warm welcome to the delegation of our brother State of Seychelles, which has just entered the United Nations. My delegation would like to assure the representatives of that country of its active solidarity and its brotherly, frank and militant co-operation.\n310.\tThe thirty-first session of the General Assembly of our Organization is initiating its work in an international situation which is still tense, uncertain and fraught with threats to the security of mankind. Indeed, despite the many recommendations and resolutions of our Organization, wars continue to rage in several parts of the world. Arms continue to cause destruction and irreparable suffering for the working populations of those areas, which aspire only to peace, freedom and justice.\n311.\tDespite unanimous condemnation by the inter-national community, vast populations of our earth continue against their will to be arbitrarily maintained in repugnant and intolerable slavery.\n312.\tDespite the many recommendations and resolutions of our Organization, dark clouds heavy with hatred continue to accumulate. dangerously between the developed countries and the countries of the third world. The gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries continues to widen, and yet UNCTAD and the many other conferences on development succeed each other without managing to promote a real policy of economic interdependence between the countries of the world.\n313.\tDespite all the wise and relevant resolutions of our Organization, the great Powers continue to spend fabulous sums to acquire the most perfect means of warfare available and to accumulate weapons of mass destruction, over-shadowing mankind with the threat of a nuclear cataclysm.\n314.\tSince its birth our Organization has been constantly concerned with the problem of decolonization and the liberation of peoples. In accordance with the very principles of its Charter, die United Nations could not fail to deal with a problem so crucial to contemporary humanity, one so repugnant to human conscience. Patiently surmounting all the subterfuges and obstacles placed in its path by those belonging to this odious group, our Organization has forged a complete philosophy for the liberation of peoples still colonized. Its main instrument is General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples. In addition, our Organization has always dealt seriously with all the problems of decolonization with which it has been seized and has made wise recommendations for their solution.\n315.\tThe painful problem of the decolonization of Viet Nam has been a subject of discussion in this hall for more than 30 years. Our Organization has adopted many resolutions recommending to the conscience of the nations of the world just solutions to put an end to the sufferings imposed upon that people. For more than a quarter-century the problem of the decolonization of Viet Nam was before this Assembly, and just and relevant resolutions were adopted in order to resolve it. But we are duty-bound bitterly to recognize that it was only through the sacrifice of its sons and daughters that Viet Nam managed to disentangle itself from the clutches of its colonizer and international imperialism. Only by accepting the gravest sacrifices that can be imposed upon a people was the people of Viet Nam able to regain its independence and freedom. Only through an armed victory was it able to grasp its freedom and independence.\n316.\tAnd yet the problem of Viet Nam remains on our agenda at this session. The problem of a free and independent Viet Nam is still before us because the Government of the United States of America vetoed the admission of that country as a full Member of our Organization. Thus the problem of Viet Nam is still with us, and my country, the People's Republic of Benin, wonders how the United States Government's attitude can be explained to the conscience of the world.\n317.\tMoreover, we must note with bitterness that, despite all the relevant recommendations and resolutions of our Assembly, it was only following a long and painful liberation struggle and an armed victory that the former Portuguese colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola and Mozambique seized their right to independence and freedom.\n318.\tAnd yet the problem of Angola remains on the agenda of this present session because the Government of the United States of America has vetoed the accession of this brother State as a Member of the United Nations. Here also the problem remains, and my country, the People's Republic of Benin, would like to know how we can explain this attitude of the United States Government to the conscience of mankind.\n319.\tToday, the problem of the decolonization of southern Africa is disturbing the world and filling the inter-national press. Suddenly the most ingenious initiatives have proliferated. Plans have been devised, and these are even more ingenious. But must we believe that these are deliberately willed and undertaken by the country in question to restore peace to this region in full ferment? The problem of the decolonization of the southern part of the African continent has been with the United Nations for almost 30 years. In connexion with the Namibian problem alone, the General Assembly has adopted 103 resolutions. The Security Council has adopted 16 resolutions, the International Court of Justice has given four advisory opinions and passed a Judgment. And yet the situation of Namibia appears to have changed somewhat thanks only to the ever increasing military pressure being exercised today by the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO.\n320.\tThe panic we are witnessing today in the imperialist circles of the capitalist West is nothing but a reflection of the impending collapse and the total and definitive eradication of their interests in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania, a collapse which patiently and courageously African martyrs have written with their blood on the walls of those ghettos which serve as their dwellings and in the countryside in which they live in slavery.\n321.\tAlso on our agenda we have the distressing problem of a Korea divided in two, of the Comoros severed from the island of Mayotte, of the Western Sahara, of Puerto Rico, of Palestine and of Cyprus. Similarly, we are confronted today with the problems of the decolonization of the territories of East Timor, of Papua New Guinea, the Southern Moluccas and Panama, which, although not on the agenda of this session, exist nevertheless.\n322.\tDespite the sessions of UNCTAD, despite the special sessions of the United Nations devoted to the problems of development, despite various international negotiations, the gap between the industrialized countries and the poor countries of the third world is still widening. Despite the adoption by our Organization of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], no marked progress has been achieved thus far in putting an end to the shameful system of exploitation and economic oppression, or to the unequal relations prevailing in international economic transactions. At the present moment, the exports of 12 main commodities, excluding petroleum, representing about 80 per cent of all the export earnings of the developing countries, earn the latter only approximately $US30 billion, whereas, through unequal trading relations, these same products, after minimal processing, are resold for more than $US 200 billion. The deficit in the balance of payments of developing countries only increases: from $US 12.2 billion in 1973 to $US 33.5 billion in 1974, and to more than $US 40 billion in 1975. According to estimates, this deficit will reach the impressive figure of $US 112 billion in 1980. The external debt of the countries of the third world, which was $US 100 billion in 1973, will be more than $US 200 billion at the end of 1976. Development assistance, as conceived by the international community within the context of the two international Development Decades, has not attained its target. The flow of financial resources to the developing countries has reached only some $20 billion out of the $57 billion provided for in 1975; whereas for the same period expenditure for arms reached the phenomenal figure o $300 billion. The food deficit of the third-world countries also continues to increase. This deficit is currently 20 million tons in food-grain products,, and it will reach 100 million tons in a few years. The absence of an equitable international monetary system continues to aggravate these economic difficulties which the developing countries are experiencing.\n323.\tThus all these problems, which are of capital importance for the third-world countries, are passed on from conference to conference, without the developed countries ever finding a really satisfactory and just solution to them. If at times certain partial solutions have been found, they have very often been much less the result of friendly and concerted concessions than that of Victories achieved by resolute struggle on the part of the third-world countries. And, in our view, there is no reason for surprise, because all these problems which we have just mentioned, and which continue to come before our Organization-most of them for almost 30 years-are, in point of fact, all connected and, in the view of my delegation, they all stem from a single, concerted and perfectly coherent plan of international imperialism.\n324.\tAll these problems, whether of a political nature like decolonization and attempts at colonial reconquest, or of an economic nature, like the constant impoverishment of the third-world countries and the lack of progress at development conferences, all, I say, are connected and can only be understood and appreciated if placed in their proper context.\n325.\tThe main obstacle obstinately obstructing a just solution to the numerous problems facing the international community today is nothing but the stubborn determination of the imperialist Powers to hold on to all the numerous and base advantages which they have usurped to the detriment of the peoples of the third world. Thus international imperialism, which has built its prosperity on the wanton and systematic depredation of the resources of the third world, will not agree today -and this is understandable- to the just claims of those countries for greater prosperity. How can the imperialist West today agree willingly to give up the super-profits which it makes in the direct exploitation, and without reciprocity, of the natural wealth and resources of the colonial Territories which it maintains in its grip?\n326.\tFlow can the imperialist West today agree willingly to give up the super-profits which it derives from unequal trading relations and consent to pay a fair and remunerative price for the raw materials which it takes from the countries of the third world for its industries?\n327.\tHow can the imperialist West today renounce the super-profits which it is making and agree willingly to sell at a fair and honest price its manufactured products to countries of the third world?\n328.\tHow, finally, can the imperialist West today willingly give up the super-profits which it makes in its financial dealings to the detriment of the countries of the third world?\n329.\tThe constant concern of imperialism to maintain an economic system which is devised entirely to satisfy its gluttonous appetites is today the basic reason for the lack of solution to the numerous problems which continue to be paraded before our Organization.\n330.\tWhat, furthermore, is the reason for the continual failure of all the wise and pertinent attempts of our Organization to resolve the problems of decolonization, if not the constant and permanent concern of Western imperialism to maintain under its direct or indirect control those vast Territories the raw materials of which are necessary for its industries and which are markets for its manufactured products, and to maintain bases from which it can exercise its direct or indirect control over the shipping routes which are absolutely essential for its trade?\n231. This is a true and honest picture of the situation in southern Africa, where Western imperialism has from the outset been bent on building in South Africa an unassailable base surrounded by puppet States in its pay, from which it can continue to maintain its domination over independent African States and the route around the Cape.\n332.\tThat is a true and honest picture of the situation in Palestine and in Cyprus, where international imperialism is attempting to create and establish bases in order to continue to exercise its control over the immense oil resources of that region and over the eastern Mediterranean.\n333.\tThat is a true and honest picture of the situation in divided Korea, where imperialism is attempting to create in the southern part of that territory a base from which to continue exercising its control over the countries of the region and the surrounding shipping routes.\n334.\tThat is a true and honest picture of the situation in Panama and in Puerto Rico, from which international imperialism wants to continue to monitor and control the independent States of the Caribbean, Latin America and the surrounding shipping routes.\n335.\tIt is also a true and honest picture of the inhuman repression which is being perpetrated against the forces of freedom in Chile, in Lebanon and in other countries of the third world.\n336.\tWhy are we powerlessly standing by and watching the failure of all international conferences on development and the continued deterioration of the international economic system? Quite simply because imperialist Powers obstinately refuse to make any concession on the numerous and base advantages which they have usurped to the detriment of the peoples of the third world. This is why sessions of UNCTAD succeed each other and make no progress. This is why the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, solemnly adopted by our Organization at its twenty-ninth session, has remained a dead letter. This is why the Paris Conference is marking time. Thus, while the economic situation of the countries of the third world continues to deteriorate dangerously, the major Powers of international capitalism are actively colluding to empty of their real content the scant advantages which the countries of the third world have managed to obtain through the surprise effect following the Fourth Conference of Non- Aligned Countries held at Algiers.\n337.\tBasing ourselves on these elements, we are obliged to recognize that the interests of the developing countries of the third world and those of international imperialism are diametrically opposed. It is, moreover, what is proved by the experience of the peoples of the third world who have not been able to obtain anything except by struggle. Thus, my delegation believes that it would be a dangerous illusion for the developing countries to await gifts from the imperialist countries for their freedom and economic progress.\n338.\tThis is why my country believes that it is absolutely crucial for the third-world countries to remain united and even better to continue to make untiring efforts to strengthen their unity and to wage a resolute and consistent struggle for the total eradication of the numerous humiliations and injustices of which they are the victim.\n339.\tMy delegation would like to address a solemn word of warning to the fraternal States of the third world which, knowingly or unknowingly, are playing the game of international imperialism, thus becoming a real danger to the liberation and emancipation of the peoples of the third world. The course of history shows that victory is on the side of just causes, on the side of those who fight for freedom and independence.\n340.\tMy delegation notes with great satisfaction the numerous victories which are being carried off by the peoples of the world in their struggle to free themselves completely, once and for all, from political oppression and economic exploitation.\n341.\tI should now like to regress somewhat and give the point of view of my delegation on certain problems whose specific nature and gravity merit their being given special mention. These problems are the following: the problem of the decolonization of the Western Sahara; the problem of the decolonization of East Timor; the problem of the decolonization of Papua New Guinea, and the problem of the decolonization of South Moluccas.\n342.\tAlthough these problems are not vitally different from those of the countries we have also mentioned, we nevertheless wish to make a special mention of these cases because the aggression perpetrated by imperialism against these States is of a much subtler nature than in the other cases, because it is through other States of the third world, some of which have only just acceded to full independence, that the peoples of Western Sahara, of East Timor, of Papua New Guinea and of South Moluccas have been treacherously deprived of their right to self-determination and independence.\n343.\tThese cases are, moreover, too well known by this Assembly to warrant any major exposition. The problem of Western Sahara is one of a people which is fighting and dying because it has been treacherously deprived of the most precious thing that exists for an individual and for a people-its freedom. The people of Western Sahara, at the end of a long and painful liberation war, have succeeded in putting an end to political domination and economic exploitation which was exercised over its territory by the reactionary Spanish regime. This courageous and historic action has been saluted by all peace- and justice-loving peoples of the world. Therefore, what was our surprise and our grief at seeing the Saharan territory invaded militarily and cynically divided up by two fraternal and neighboring States in contempt of all resolutions of international organizations and counter to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. Since then, the Saharwi people has been fighting with even greater vigor and determination, since this unholy act was perpetrated by two brother countries whose mission in history was to protect and help the young, independent State.\n344.\tThe problem of Western Sahara is not one of a border dispute among Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. The problem of Western Sahara is a problem of decolonization, and our Organization must treat it as such.\n345.\tAlso, the totally incomprehensible colonialist and expansionist policy of Indonesia has led the peoples of South Moluccas, of Papua New Guinea and if East Timor to take up arms to defend their right to self-determination and independence. My delegation would solemnly address a word of warning to these States of the third world against such regrettable and tragic historical errors. My delegation maintains that the problem of nationalities be resolved not by a policy of military annexation but in the context of their recognition of the right to self-determination and independence of these national minorities within larger communities where friendship, justice, harmony and co-operation prevail.\n346.\tThe time has come to conclude. Any watchful observer of international relations such as they are today cannot fail to feel sad and disheartened by so much waste and political short-sightedness. While our Organization and all peace- and justice-loving States of the world make praiseworthy efforts to bring just solutions to the grave problems which afflict the international community, problems which are not only shameful in the world of today but are also a constant threat to international peace and security, the advocates of the monopolistic, imperialist capitalism are obstinately bent on devising subtle plans to doom all these solutions to failure.\n347.\tThus and in spite of all the wise and pertinent resolutions of the United Nations and the efforts made by peace- and justice-loving nations, three fourths of all mankind have been reduced to the utmost destitution. Vast populations of the world continue to live in colonial and neocolonialist slavery quite simply because their territories have major resources or else are of strategic interest. Constant threats of \\\"destabilization\\\" hover over the countries of the third world. To some extent in all quarters of the world, a war is being waged and immense stockpiles of nuclear weapons are endangering humanity with total destruction.\n348.\tMore than 145 sovereign States are represented at this forum, where for more than 100 days their plenipotentiaries will review these urgent problems which threaten world peace.\n349.\tThe dearest wish of my country, the People's Republic of Benin, is that these discussions will make everyone face his responsibilities before history. The all-powerful imperialist West and its supporters should look at history, which is the cemetery of great empires, in order that they may act with the wisdom and clear-sightedness indispensable for the just solution of the grave problems of today.\n350.\tThe Countries seek independence; nations want liberation; and the peoples want revolution. We are ready for revolution. The fight continues.\n"

But, as I said before on another occasion, man is afraid to unlock the door to himself.\n3.\tMr. President, I am impelled to express for my country, my Government and for myself personally heartiest congratulations to you for being unanimously elected to this high office as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Records indicate beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are certainly a person of no mean attainment, as manifestly demonstrated by the unanimity of support which you have received. Your service and incalculable contribution to the United Nations are indelibly impressed upon the minds of the nations comprising this august body. This very high position to which you have been elected is but one more milestone in your distinguished career. Again, accept our heartiest and sincerest congratulations.\n4.\tMy delegation is satisfied that past sessions have met with varying degrees of success in easing world tensions in realizing that the disparities in economic condition between the more industrialized and opulent countries and the less industrialized and poorer countries have not undergone any significant change, and in recognizing that enormous sums are being spent on the development and production of military weapons and other destructive equipment, which greatly aggravates these and other world problems. We therefore feel very strongly that this session must aim essentially at greater and more significant and effective results. So often have we been justly accused of talking too much, and so, too, have we failed to implement important decisions taken and to convert the feeling of the General Assembly into positive action.\n5.\tAt this juncture, I feel that it is incumbent upon me to say that the illustrious Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who served as President of the last session of the General Assembly, has brilliantly provided the necessary leadership to this Organization, particularly during the various crises of the past year, and we wish to place on record our admiration and gratitude for his very distinguished services.\n6.\tWe, the people and Government of Grenada, wish to express our sincerest appreciation to our distinguished and beloved Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose untiring efforts, complete dedication and extraordinary diplomatic skill have been of immeasurable benefit not only to Members of the United Nations but even to many nations not yet within the ambit of our Organization. His leadership has contributed greatly to the furtherance of the ideals and purposes of this world body in the preservation of peace and in promoting the freedom, welfare and progress of all peoples. I think I am voicing the opinion of all who have come in contact with Mr. Waldheim in stating that there are few people in the world with such a distinguished background and with such eminence who remain so friendly, so affable and so very modest in his dealings with other people.\n7.\tThe United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted in resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960, and the pressures of the United Nations itself and of individual Members of this body seem to be bearing fruit, and the independence of Seychelles is, indeed, another forward step in the history of the United Nations and of those who have fought to establish the principle of and the declaration on decolonization. In this context, it is with a deep feeling of camaraderie that we join in welcoming Seychelles as a fully fledged Member of this Organization. Those of us who have traveled the same path from colonial servitude to freedom and self-determination, and, subsequently, have attained membership in the United Nations, look forward with pleasurable expectations to this new Member making a contribution to the yet continuing struggle to bring freedom and self-determination to the remaining peoples and Territories still in colonial bondage. We reaffirm, without any reservations whatever, our unswerving support for the principle of full membership within the United\u2003Nations for all countries, and so it is with respect and with humility that I appeal to all concerned to uphold that principle when the issues involving the peoples of the United Republic of Viet Nam and that of Korea shall again be presented. In fact, I feel very strongly that the United Nations is under the obligation to initiate the necessary positive action to bring these countries into this family of nations as soon as possible.\n8.\tWe wish to express our condolences to the People's Republic of China on the loss of its illustrious leader.\n9.\tIn my last address to the General Assembly at its thirtieth session,  I referred to the Bermuda triangle as but one example of the phenomena that continue to baffle man, and I appealed to the United Nations to establish a department or an agency devoted to psychic research. It is with humility that I state that this subject evoked consider-able interest, but, regrettably, no positive action has yet been taken. However, I am confident that the idea has not died and that some positive action will emanate from this world body, which, I am sure, will get the full support and co-operation of universities and scientific institutions which are in a smaller measure conducting some research and experiments in the area of psychic knowledge. I feel that it is obligatory on this world Organization to give impetus and direction to those already involved in that particular field and .to take positive steps in co-ordinating these efforts. We believe that the importance of psychic research lies not only in the purely scientific point of view, for in this area of human knowledge lie some of the answers to problems that have confronted mankind since time immemorial.\n10.\tIn the same way as this planet is the accepted inheritance of all humanity, knowledge is also to be shared for the benefit of all mankind, and, in this light, one wonders why the existence of unidentified flying objects, or \\\"flying saucers\\\", as they are sometimes called, continues to remain a secret to those in whose archives repose useful information and other data. While we appreciate that some countries consider this to be in the interest of military expedience, I now urge that a different view be taken because it is my firm conviction that the world is ready, willing and ripe to accept these phenomena relating to man and his existence on the planet earth and to the planet earth and life in outer space.\n11.\tI am submitting, with respect, that it is most-urgent and vitally important for the world to take a new look at the concept of human rights. It is my strong feeling that those who propounded the principles of the rights of humanity that culminated in die Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 must necessarily have had completely different ideas from those that seem to prevail in some quarters when one speaks of human rights today. Let me say here and now that human rights must not-I repeat, not be interpreted as a one-way street for evil individuals and small subversive groups whose aims and objectives are mainly and simply to disrupt the peace and harmony of society in their attempt to overthrow governments and establishments. In regard to their acts of violence, terrorism, vandalism, kidnapping and arson and other criminal acts and threats to the security of society there is always a conspicuously loud silence among individuals and organizations that spontaneously present themselves as advocates and representatives of all such terrorists, criminals, vandals and kidnappers when they come face to face with the law. These individuals and organizations, perhaps too many to mention, seem always to offer themselves as a counsel of solace, thereby abetting the activities of such offenders and giving them and others of their kind encouragement to commit similar crimes. When a Government or Governments take the necessary action to secure and ensure for the majority of their people the human right to enjoy peace of mind, I often wonder whether the organizations, groups and individuals that keep on shouting for human rights and trying to defame and vilify the character of good Governments ever thought of issuing warnings to those wicked individuals and groups before they actually commit their mischief. Human rights must work both ways. When a child is kidnapped, perhaps more than 99 per cent of the population is deprived of its human right to sleep in peace, not knowing whose child will be next. So it is that, when a building is burned or bombed or a man is shot or an aircraft is hijacked or some other acts of violence or vandalism are committed, automatically the human right to peace of mind is infringed or violated. It is in these cases that the shouters for human rights should shout, and not when the criminals come face to face with the law. Governments are not only justified in taking preventive measures for the safety and security of life, property and the welfare of all the people; they are obliged to do so. These are the thoughts on the concept of human rights I wish to leave with this General Assembly.\n12. Now, not totally removed from the subject of human rights is the subject of women's rights. It is obvious that the phrase \\\"human rights\\\" is generally confined to the rights of men and tends to exclude equal consideration for the rights of women. Certainly one cannot be so naive as not to recognize the fact that, in spite of all the fanfare, in spite of all the conferences, in spite of all the forums and seminars and in spite of the declaration of 1975 as International Women's Year, all culminating in a 10-year plan of action yes, in spite of all these one cannot be so naive but has to be realistic and face the fact that in actuality nothing has been done by the men controlling the powers that be to give the necessary impetus, the necessary co-operation and assistance. In fact the powers that be cannot lay claim to a single modicum of real action on their part designed or calculated to advance the cause of women or even to place them on the threshold of a good second-class partnership in the global community of humanity. In various parts of the world today women are still without their franchise and women are still debarred from holding certain positions in government, in institutions and in commercial enterprises. Yet, invariably, the few who have been given the opportunity to perform have done so with supreme excellence. It is with a feeling of emotion and deep sincerity that I appeal to those concerned to reduce the talking, the conferences, the seminars and the planning and go into positive action. Today the world calls for \\\"doers\\\" rather than the avalanche of mighty talkers that seem to impregnate the atmosphere with glorious promises-but only promises. Now on behalf of the women of the world I plead: put promises into action.\n13.\tAlthough the United Nations and many public and private organizations the world over have committed themselves to taking important steps towards the most urgently needed protection of the human environment, we all recognize that there is much that remains to be done for the safety and maintenance of our planet as a suitable habitat both for this generation and for posterity. There are, however, far too many elements that are destructive and harmful to our environment and particularly detrimental to human beings in the world. We are quite certain, however, that in many instances the creation of these factors that are damaging to our human environment is not motivated by malice, selfishness or lack of consideration for our neighbors, but could be rightly attributed to a lack of technological knowledge, to defective planning or to mistaken policies. It seems rather urgent and important to redirect our technological skill from the manufacture of destructive weapons and equipment to the elimination of pollution.\n14.\tWe are pleased to state that Grenada is absolutely free from any form of pollution. In spite of that, and because we are so aware of the dangers that can be caused by pollution, we have just created a department of environ-mental development within an already existing ministry. This is in keeping with our policy not to fall within the category of the avalanche of talkers I have referred to but to remain performers and doers and it is well to remember that, in spite of the size of our country, we have always put into action the thoughts and philosophies we express.\n15.\tOur role in the struggle for the equality of women was manifestly demonstrated when we caused the appointment of the first and only woman Governor in the Common-wealth seven years ago. Upon Grenada's entry into the United Nations we found it fitting to appoint Mrs. Marie- Josephine Mclntyre as our Permanent Representative. She also serves as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Washington, D.C., and graces the diplomatic corps of this country as one of the few women ambassadors. In Grenada, women serve at all levels of the service-for example, the Permanent Secretary to my Ministry, who heads the Department of Planning, Development and Training, and the many other beautiful Grenadian women who are holding exalted positions in the service of my country.\n16.\tWhile there was a lot of talking about the support of youth, we were the first in the Caribbean to establish a Ministry of Youth Development and Sports nine years ago. And so it is with justification and a feeling of pride that I take this opportunity to invite each and every one of you to visit our unspoiled and unpolluted land of beauty-the \\\"Isle of Spice\\\", the \\\"Gem of the West\\\"-at some time or other at your convenience, but especially during our annual Easter water parade. The official invitations will be sent to your Governments and peoples in due course.\n17.\tThe subject of the human environment cannot be complete without making some short observations on the quality of life of some of our brothers and sisters in various parts of the world, and particularly those who have passed under the rule of tyrannical colonial masters, and yet more especially those of us who have had the experience, not of living, but of existing under colonial economic cruelty.\n18.\tToday, as before, the word \\\"war\\\" seems to bear a specific connotation confining it to the conflict between nations fighting for power and territory. But there is a situation seldom spoken about within these walls: a \\\"war\\\" that is wicked, vicious and brutal; a war of economic cruelty. We in Grenada have experienced such a war for after more than two centuries of colonial rule Grenada emerged to self-determination without any economic assist-ance from the colonial Power that dictated our policies by buying our necessary commodities and by selling our primary products, thus controlling, in fact, all aspects of our lives.\n19.\tThe governors, administrators, chiefs of police and other high-ranking civil servants were imposed on us and paid from our local revenue. Today, even though there are agreements for token assistance, the' Powers have embarked upon a new strategy of delaying tactics, creating obstacles in the path of our development program with exquisite diplomatic skill, excuses and apologies.\n20.\tThere is also a milder form of economic aggression practiced by some of the more affluent countries making definite commitment to give economic and other forms of co-operation to those countries in dire need. In most cases the commitments for those economic and other forms of co-operation have never beer honored, and in some cases only insignificant tokens have been given. The damage done to the small developing nations of the third world under these circumstances by those aggressive acts of economic cruelty is causing incalculable hardship and obviously tends to foster frustration and bitterness against those affluent nations. It is bad enough not to offer bilateral assistance in special cases and circumstances, but it is far worse to make a commitment and not honor it.\n21.\tPlease allow me to crave the Assembly's indulgence by attempting to summarize the salient points to my contribution to the general debate of this thirty-first session. My first humble submission was to repeat the call for establishment of a department or agency devoted to psychic research; my second was to ask the Powers concerned to share with other Governments and peoples of our planet their information and other data on unidentified flying objects; my third was the presentation of my concept of human rights; in my fourth submission, I asked for less talk and more action on women's rights; my fifth was our submission on the preservation of the human environment; and my sixth was Grenada's thought on economic aggression, as waged by imperialist Powers, and the dishonoring of commitments made by some of the more affluent countries to smaller developing ones. And, finally, in my seventh submission, I am proposing that the time is ripe and that the peoples of the world are ready and willing to discuss the concept, the recognition, the acknowledgment and the acceptance of a universal God the same universal God we call Allah, Yahweh, Jehovah, Jah, Krishna, Shinto or any other name.\n22.\tI am not unaware, however, of the fact that this subject may offer some degree of controversy. I speak without fear of challenge that there is no subject throughout this planet that is of greater significance or greater importance or greater urgency than this subject, and I call upon the leaders of the world-political, philosophical, mystical, spiritual, doctrinal, theological and religious-to consider its importance, its significance and its urgency.\n23.\tLeaders are sometimes inclined to set aside subjects that are heavy or controversial for diverse reasons. We have accepted the inheritance of this planet as our natural habitat. I accept the fact that the world is divided into two main factions-those of us who accept and express the philosophy of a supreme being, universal in scope; the other faction being those who express the non-existence of any supreme being. Nevertheless, I say here and now with firm and irrevocable conviction that every rational being, every human being accepts, perhaps in varying degrees, within his inner consciousness the existence of a power greater than man. The differences are in concept and nothing else; and I repeat that there is absolutely no difference within man's consciousness except that of concept.\n24.\tThere are many philosophies and doctrines from which have emanated innumerable religions, but even within any particular doctrine and, to go further, within any particular religion, and in many cases to go even further within many homes supporting the same religion, there are differences in the concept of the supreme being. It is not my role here today to suggest that any doctrinal, religious, mystical, spiritual or any other groups for that matter should accept my concept. I am simply and \u2022 humbly submitting' that the time has long been ripe for leaders to consider this subject, unparalleled in importance and incomparable in scope, to get together with open minds and hearts in friendly discussions.\n25.\tWhile it is not my intention to try to superimpose my concept of God on the General Assembly, I am sure that it will not hurt if I further crave the Assembly's indulgence to state in brief that man has established limitations to the concept of the universal being in all forms and fashions. Some have given Him shapes and sizes; some have given Him nationalities and colors, in the same way that man has established time and its limitations and expansions, in the same manner that man has established an undue importance and, so to speak, superiority of the body of man over man himself, not realizing or perhaps forgetting that man's body is simply the habitat, the cloak, or the vehicle within which man actually dwells. God has no shape; God has no size; God has no color, no age, no nationality.\n26.\tI am sure that those who have had the experience of full consciousness outside that mundane habitat and those who have had perhaps a split second of ecstatic experience in the world of reality-for our planet is simply a world of illusion-whether by accident, prayers or meditation -would have no hesitation in accepting the fact that God has absolutely no limitations, for He is ever-present, all-seeing, all-knowing, all-wise, all-powerful, all-penetrating and ever-loving in nature. God permeates, pervades and occupies all things and all space in the universe. God himself is that universal order that holds and binds all things together; He is the source of all existence and the center of all creation; He is the source and center of all things; He is the source and center of all light, of all life, of all love, of all energy, of all spirit, of all minds and of all intelligence.\n27.\tDo the astronauts, when they are in outer space or when they traverse the surface of the moon, feel themselves outside the precincts of the God we worship on earth? The God we worship is certainly the God who is present in outer space, on the moon and all other planets, for He is God of the universe-the God of galaxies of worlds, and yet that God is also present in the minutes; entity conceivable by the human mind. In other words, God is everywhere: He is within and without, around and above, in us and all around us. God is filling this room with His loving presence.\n28.\tMan has made great advances in science and technology and so man can construct a building or a room that is completely light-proof, completely sound-proof, completely magnetism-proof and, by proper insulation, even completely electricity-proof, but man cannot make anything that is God-proof, for God is everywhere.\n29.\tIn conclusion, permit me to repeat that the whole idea behind the final subject which I have raised is simply to evoke some interest among the leaders of the world -political, philosophical, mystical, spiritual, theological, doctrinal and religious leaders-in the recognition, acknowledgment and acceptance of the universality of God, which is the only true assurance we have of effectively solving the problems of world tension and fostering a lasting world peace, and I thank God for providing me with the opportunity to do so.\n30.\tAnd now I engage the hearts and minds of all those present here in giving thanks to the same Supreme Being in the manner that Christ taught us to pray to that Supreme Being His Father and our Father, saying thus:\nOur Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,\nThy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread,\nAnd forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\nLead us out of temptation, Lord, and deliver us from all evil,\nFor Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever,\nAmen.\nSo may it be. Let God be praised.\n"

        "file_text": "Pressure of work forced Mr. Ismail Fahmy, head of the Egyptian delegation and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to stay in Cairo, and he has asked me to deliver this statement on his behalf.\n2.\tI have the pleasure to address this Assembly at its thirty-first session under the presidency of Mr. Amerasinghe. His unanimous election as President of this session signifies international regard for the great Asian continent and for Sri Lanka, a country with which we have close friendship. It is also an expression of the recognition and esteem in which he is held. The close ties of friendship and co-operation between our two countries and the pioneering role played by Mrs. Bandaranaike in leading her country and in contributing to efforts to render the non-aligned movement successful make it an added pleasure to congratulate him.\n3.\tI should like also to express our esteem to Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n4.\tI should like, too, to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his continuous and commendable efforts in carrying out the many and important responsibilities placed on his shoulders. Mr. Waldheim's record of activity and achievement, as well as the statements delivered by him in numerous forums, the latest of which were the African summit conference  and the non-aligned\nConference, reflect clearly the dynamism of the Secretary- General and his full commitment to our Organization's aims and its endeavors to build a new world -a world of justice, prosperity and peace. In commending his efforts, Egypt supports his re-election to a second term of office.\n5.\tIn the name of Egypt, I congratulate and welcome the Republic of Seychelles. We are confident that independent Seychelles will be a new asset, serving the cause of peace and justice in the world. While the admission of Seychelles to the United Nations may be said to mark a new step towards the universality of the Organization, we earnestly hope that this universality will be completed very soon by the admission of Angola, unified Viet Nam, Namibia, the free State of Palestine and Zimbabwe.\n6.\tBefore proceeding with the rest of my statement, I should like, on behalf of the People and Government of Egypt, to pay a tribute to the memory of Chairman Mao Tsetung, a great leader. The people and Government of Egypt have shared whole-heartedly the grief of the great Chinese people over the regrettable loss of Chairman Mao, who left his mark on the history of his country as he led it to progress. His constructive action for a better future for humanity and the establishment of a just peace in the world will always be remembered.\n7.\tThe world today is one of constant movement and change. The phenomenon of international detente symbolizes the change which has taken place in relations between the super-Powers, but the third-world countries and all peace-loving peoples are still striving resolutely to build a new world -a world which rejects all forms of domination, coercion, exploitation and discrimination.\n8.\tThe kind of world they hope to build is one in which a new international economic order can be realized, bringing about economic well-being for all, social justice for all and a just peace for all a world, as the Secretary-General explained in the introduction to his report to this session on the work of the Organization [A/31/l/Add.1], which respects the resolutions of the United Nations and international law -in short, a world that is governed by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.\n9.\tThe countries of the third world have defined their attitude towards the phenomenon of detente on more than one occasion, most recently at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. The Non-Aligned States welcomed the progress so far achieved in the relaxation of tension between the great Powers, but they emphasized that detente was still limited both in scope and geographical extent.\n10.\tWhen President Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat addressed the thirtieth session of the General Assembly on 29 October 1975, he had this to say:\n\\\"We in Egypt are for detente and welcome it, if it takes into account the interests of small States, their national destinies and the aspirations of their peoples. Detente cannot be what it means unless it is an interaction, from the bottom to the top.\\\"\n11.\tThe third-world countries have demonstrated their clear understanding of the importance of international detente between the two super-Powers and the developed countries have to demonstrate an understanding of the aspirations of the third world to see a new international community. The\\\" two super-Powers and the developed countries have to put their weight behind the causes of right and justice in the world, politically, economically and socially.\n12.\tWe live on one planet, sharing one and the same destiny-either peace for all or destruction for all. This is the real meaning which the peoples of the United Nations had in mind when they established our international Organization. This is the significance of our meeting here each year: to emphasize and reaffirm cur commitment to the principles and goals of the Charter of the United Nations and to review the positive and negative aspects of our activities for the purpose of adopting stands and resolutions that would ensure solutions to problems faced by our international community.\n13.\tWe have to bear in mind our great responsibility toward millions of people throughout the world, and maintain their confidence in our Organization's ability to realize their aspirations to live in conditions of just and durable peace. The extent to which we discharge this responsibility will determine the extent of change and movement in our international community a change that will take place either through peaceful and balanced means, or through violence.\n14.\tMany of the international problems which confront us are pressing and complicated. While some of these problems can wait, there are others which are more explosive and urgent. Procrastination in solving such problems would be tantamount to inviting a powder-keg to explode, thus threatening the peace and security of the world and the very existence of the United Nations, particularly as such problems affect the very principles and foundations on which the United Nations was established.\n15.\tWe cannot ask peoples in the last quarter of the twentieth century to be patient while their sovereignty is violated, while their territory is occupied, or while they are prevented from exercising their right to self-determination. We cannot ask peoples to accept the humiliation of apartheid and racial discrimination in all its forms, particularly since these peoples have given the international community several opportunities to redress the injustices inflicted upon them without avail. Serious action has to be undertaken by us now before it is too late.\n16.\tI have in mind the struggle of the Arab peoples and of the peoples of our African continent as an example of the struggle and sacrifices of many peoples in other parts of the world. The events in El-Khalil and Jerusalem in our Arab soil and the events in Soweto, South Africa, confirm anew the danger of thinking that our duty here ends with the adoption of resolutions supporting right and justice, without using all the means at the disposal of the United Nations and the international community for this purpose.\n17.\tWe all have the responsibility for consolidating by action the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and of taking steps to implement them, otherwise the law of the jungle and the rule of force would supersede the rule of the Charter and the rule of law.\n18.\tIt is our responsibility to continue the pressure on the forces that do not comply with the will of the international community until they do so.\n19.\tThe suppressed peoples of the world call on the United Nations to act for the peaceful solution of their problems before they are compelled to resort to other means approved by the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.\n20.\tAt the twenty-ninth and thirtieth sessions, the General Assembly adopted a number of historical resolutions emphasizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the necessity of enabling them to exercise these rights. Thus we find resolution 3236 (XXIX) stipulating that these rights include the right to self-determination without external interference and the right to national independence and sovereignty.\n21.\tIn its resolution 3376 (XXX) the General Assembly established the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to recommend a program of implementation designed to enable the Palestinian people to exercise the rights recognized in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). I should like to commend the members of the Committee and its Chairman, Mr. Fall of Senegal, who have shouldered their responsibility with integrity and courage within the mandate given by our august Assembly.\n22.\tIn fact the General Assembly by virtue of its various stands, the latest of which was the adoption of the two aforementioned resolutions, has confirmed the words which you heard here from President El-Sadat when he declared before the thirtieth session of the General Assembly:\nWe consider the cause of the Palestinian people to be the cause of every free people seeking peace, calling for justice and accepting the rule of law as arbiter between good and evil, right and wrong.\\\"\n23.\tThe participation of the Palestinian people, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], in the work of the United Nations and the acknowledgment of the principle of its participation in all efforts designed to achieve a just peace in the Middle East, has enabled this great people to continue its efforts, within the framework of international legitimacy, to secure and exercise the rights of which they have been illegally and unjustly deprived for more than 30 years. The Palestinian people, represented by the PLO, has demonstrated a sense of full responsibility in shouldering its share of the quest for a just peace based on respect for its legitimate rights and its right to establish an independent State on the West Bank and in Gaza.\n24.\tAs Mr. Fahmy stated before your Assembly at its twenty-ninth session:\n\\\"By virtue of their long history of dealing with situations and facing reality objectively without evasiveness, the Palestinian people are qualified to assume this task.\\\"\nHe also said in the same statement that the Palestinian people\n\\\"realize that the glorious War of 6 October, has opened up new horizons for the Arabs and has for the first time afforded an opportunity to reach a just and permanent peace in the area that would make it possible for its people to devote their attention to development and to the task of economic and social transformation which is needed to make their future secure\\\".5\n25.\tHence Egypt's firm position has been, and continues to be, one of support for and consolidation of the PLO as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Egypt calls upon the international community to take effective steps to support the Organization and enable the Palestinian people to recover its rights.\n26.\tThe report of the Committee [A/31/35] is before you. It is a matter of regret that the Security Council has been unable to adopt the Committee's recommendations on account of the use of the veto by a permanent member. It is our duty to shoulder our responsibility in accordance with the Charter and to do so with the utmost courage.\n27.\tThe recommendations put forward in the Committee's report reflect not only a clear and precise adherence to the General Assembly's resolution which established the Committee, but also a.realistic and moderate attitude with a view to enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its right self-determination within the framework of the United Nations resolutions.\n28.\tMy country's delegation supports the recommendations contained in the report of the Committee, taking into account the statement of the representative of the PLO -before the said Committee on 9 March 1976.\n29.\tWe urge you to adopt an effective and positive stand in support of the Palestinian people's struggle to exercise its right to self-determination.\n30.\tEgypt re-emphasizes its confidence in the ability of the Palestinian people to carry on their struggle under the leadership of the PLO. We again stress the necessity of the participation of the PLO on an equal footing with the other parties concerned in any efforts aimed at achieving a just and durable peace in the Middle East, including the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.\n31.\tIsrael must be made to understand that there will be no peace in the Middle East unless the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized and unless the occupied Arab territories are returned. Israel is deluding itself if it believes that time is in its favor and that it can convince some people that the Palestinians do not exist or that it is capable of containing or eliminating them. The events in El-Khalil and the West Bank, the innocent Palestinians' blood shed at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces, affirm to the people of the world the unflinching stand of the Palestinian people and their determination to return to their homeland, to enjoy independence and national sovereignty in Palestine. Recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is one of the principal touchstones to test Israel's seriousness when it claims that it desires to exist in peace among its neighbors.\n32.\tEgypt has been quite receptive to all serious attempts to seek a just and durable peace in the Middle East, for peace to us, as President El-Sadat declared before you at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, is \\\"a strategic objective\\\" and \\\"a genuine commitment.\\\"\n33.\tFrom this rostrum President El-Sadat called for the reconvening of the Geneva Conference, with the participation of the parties concerned, to deal with the Middle East problem in all its aspects and with the purpose of arriving at a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\n34.\tIn his reply to the Secretary-General's initiative of 1 April 1976, Mr. Fahmy referred to Egypt's positive attitude towards this initiative. The reply was communicated by the Secretary-General to all the parties concerned, including the representatives of the PLO. Allow me, Mr. President, to read out to the General Assembly some paragraphs from this reply:\n\\\"I take note of your intention to pursue the matter of resuming actively the negotiating process in the coming week. I concur with your view that this should be done at this stage through your contacts with the representatives of the parties at United Nations Headquarters.\n\\\"In this connexion, I note with appreciation your sending of the aforementioned note to the representative of the PLO, the representative of the Palestinian people. This constitutes a constructive step towards the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3375 (XXX), which provides for the participation of the PLO in all efforts and deliberations on the Middle East as well as for the undertaking of steps to secure the invitation of the\u2003PLO to participate in the work of the United Nations Peace Conference on the Middle East.\\\"\nThis is in accordance with the initiative taken by President El-Sadat in his statement of 29 October 1975 before the General Assembly.\n35.\tMr. Fahmy also added in his reply to the Secretary- General the following:\n\\\"Our position, in so far as the negotiating process is concerned, remains the same as reiterated by me to Mr. Guyer in the talks we had during his visit to Cairo on 1 March 1976, namely, that the reconvening of the United Nations Peace Conference on the Middle East is the only valid course of action which would guarantee the continuation and the preservation of the United Nations role to which we are strongly attached.\n\\\"I therefore appreciate the early resumption of consultations on the specific question of reconvening the United Nations Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned, namely, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the PLO, Israel, as well as the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\\\"The ultimate goal of such contacts as well as the enduing process would be the achievement of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East which would lead to a just and durable peace based an the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and self-determination. This necessitates the full implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions that provide for the total withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Arab territories occupied since June 1967, and the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people.\\\"\nThis is Egypt's stand, as communicated by Mr. Fahmy to the Secretary-General in April 1976.\n36.\tContrary to this stand, Israel has proved through its actions that it does not desire peace, that it is incapable of assuming the responsibilities it entails, that it remains Israel the aggressor fo quest of expansion at the expense of the neighbouring Arab States and the Palestinian people. How can we otherwise interpret its persistence in establishing settlement? in occupied Arab territories, including \\\"Sinai- more than 60 of them? How can we interpret its insistence on the annexation and judaization of Jerusalem? AM these actions are in violation of the resolutions unanimously adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly, and even Israel's friends consider them obstacles to peace, as demonstrated during the recent Security Council deliberations. But Israel does not even heed friends. It insists on creating a new fait accompli even without legitimate grounds to justify itself before the international community. Israel is determined to change the features of the occupied territories demographically and materially and to plunder their heritage and wealth, blatantly ignoring United Nations resolutions, values and all international conventions, foremost among which is the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.\n37.\tFrom this rostrum we cleanly and resolutely declare that Israel is held responsible for whatever changes it introduces in the occupied territories and that Egypt will demand just compensation for all the changes and acts of exploitation Israel has carried out therein. Egypt calls on all States not to participate in or be a party in any form whatsoever to Israel's attempts to exploit the natural wealth and resources of the occupied territories.\n38.\tThe continuation of the present situation in the area constitutes a danger to world peace, for the Arab peoples and States do not accept the continued Israeli occupation and the denial of the national rights of the Palestinian people. The world is at a race with time: either a just peace or total war of liberation to recover the rights provided for in the Charter and supported by the majority in the General Assembly.\n39.\tIsrael commits the biggest folly in thinking that its maneuvers and evasiveness will give it time to impose on the Arab world and on the international community an expansionist fait accompli. It would be better for it, in the interest of peace in the world, to face the realities in the aftermath of the glorious war of 6 October.\n40.\tThe international community realizes the seriousness of the explosive situation in the Middle East and its impact on world peace and security. It realizes that we are seeking peace, provided that it is just. We have given the international community opportunities to participate in the quest for peace and its realization. We welcomed and continue to welcome the role of the two super-Powers at the Geneva Conference; we welcomed the participation of Europe and the non-aligned States in the quest for a just peace. While this has been our attitude, Israel remains intransigent, resisting all efforts designed to ensure the return of all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This intransigence has led all peace-loving peoples to condemn the Israeli stand; the resolutions of the United Nations are a testimony to this. And so are those of other international forums, the latest of which was the Fifth Conference of non-aligned Countries, which condemned the continued Israeli aggression against Arab territories and the violation of the Palestinian people's rights.\n41.\tPrior to this, the- African summit conference convened in Mauritius had declared its full solidarity with the Arab peoples and the Palestinian people in their struggle to regain the occupied Arab territory and to enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination. In the light of this, you will perhaps agree with me that it has become imperative that the international community should get things moving immediately and that Member States of the world Organization have an obligation to press for a just solution and to foil, with all firmness, any procrastinating maneuvers.\n42.\tI want to reiterate here clearly Egypt's firm stand that there can be no peace in the Middle East without Israel's full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and without the Palestinian people's recovery of its legitimate rights, including its right to establish an independent Palestinian State.\n43.\tOur Arab nation is bleeding in Lebanon and President El-Sadat was the first to warn against the dangers of the continuation of this state of affairs. Before the situation deteriorated, he advised all parties to adopt a \\\"hands off Lebanon\\\" approach. I should like here to state Egypt's position on this question, which may be summarized in the following four points: first, the necessity of enforcing a cease-fire and of safeguarding Lebanon's sovereignty, independence, unity and Arabism; secondly, the necessity of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, at the same time the encouragement of all sincere and constructive initiatives conducive to putting an end to the bloodshed; thirdly, the imperative need maintained in the context of the general Arab commitment to the Palestinian people, their cause and the PLO; fourthly, support for the specific steps taken by the League of Arab States to deal with the Lebanese crisis, including its dispatch of Arab security forces to Lebanon and its continuing endeavors at conciliation envisaging a speedy settlement to the crisis.\n44.\tFrom this rostrum, Egypt conveys its admiration to all the struggling peoples of the world and reaffirms its solidarity with those peoples, foremost among whom are the peoples of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Palestine and our Arab people everywhere.\n45.\tMen, women and children in Soweto and throughout South Africa valorously faced the guns and brutality of the apartheid regime, rejecting vigorously the continuation of the criminal policy pursued by the racist minority Government, which denies them their rights as human beings, as owners of the land and as masters of their own destiny. Where it should have grasped the significance of the independence of Angola and Mozambique and the expulsion of its own delegation from the twenty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the racist minority Government of South Africa persisted in its apartheid practices and in terrorizing unarmed civilians. However, the bloody events in Soweto last August herald the inevitable defeat of the arrogant white ruling minority in Pretoria which will not last. This same white minority Government of South Africa, refusing to recognize and to implement the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on Namibia, has continued to occupy Namibia illegally since 1966. It has gone even further by using Namibia as a bridge-head for continued aggression against the neighboring peaceful State of Zambia and other front-line States in southern Africa.\n46.\tHistory has proved this: ultimate victory belongs to the people. Thus, the people of South Africa will triumph, the people of Namibia represented by the national movement, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], will triumph, and the people of Zimbabwe will triumph.\n47.\tOur role here is to bring this inevitable victory nearer for the sake of world peace. Our role here is to assure the peoples of southern Africa that we stand by them in word and deed. Our role is to reinforce the front-line States in southern Africa: Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Our role is to frustrate the theatrical maneuvers of the white minority Government of South Africa designed to perpetuate its occupation of Namibia through dealing with elements that do not represent the people of Namibia. Our role is to ensure that the United Nations and the parties concerned, particularly the Government of the United Kingdom, will discharge their full responsibilities so that the people of Zimbabwe will be able to exercise their right to self-determination. We should also tighten the international isolation of the South African regime and of the white racist minority regime in Zimbabwe until they comply with United Nations resolutions and the will of the international community.\n48.\tPeace and security in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region call for a just and speedy settlement of the Cyprus issue too, a settlement that would preserve for the non-aligned State of Cyprus its territorial integrity and independence, a settlement that would put an end to the suffering and the sacrifices of tens of thousands of Cypriots rendered homeless as a result of a war that imposed limitless tragedies on the fraternal people of Cyprus. We believe in the ability of the two communities, the Greek and the Turkish, to arrive at a formula that would ensure for Cyprus its independence and sovereignty. We do hope that the United Nations and you personally, Mr. President, will continue to work for the realization of a speedy, just and durable settlement of the situation in Cyprus without foreign intervention.\n49.\tOur Arab nation, in the great awakening after the October war, continues its international action on the basis of the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter in unison and in co-operation with all peace-loving peoples, with the non-aligned peoples and States, with the peoples of Africa, with the peoples of Asia, with the peoples and States of the Islamic Conference, and with those friendly peoples and Governments of Europe who have demonstrated an increased understanding of Arab rights and a desire to co-operate with them within the framework of the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n50.\tEgypt took pride in participating in the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries held in Colombo. We are convinced that the continued activity of the non-aligned States, a broadened membership of States adopting this policy and the success of the non-aligned movement's mission would consolidate the efforts of the United Nations to build a better international community.\n51.\tEgypt was one of the pioneer States in the non-aligned movement and it still refuses to be a sphere of influence for anyone. We in Egypt support the causes of right and justice and national liberation causes everywhere. To cite an example, I refer to our continuous endeavors in backing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, our support of the great Vietnamese people and our support of the just demands of the Korean people for unification and self-determination without foreign intervention, together with the necessity of the withdrawal of foreign forces from its territory.\n52.\tEgypt, which believes in the United Nations Charter, calls on all States to co-operate closely to ensure complete respect for our international Organization and strict compliance with its resolutions. It will continue to undertake with full commitment its pioneering and responsible role in the non-aligned movement, within the framework of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], the League of\nArab States, the Islamic Conference and the United Nations, co-operating with all peace-loving peoples of the world.\n53.\tI should like to pay a tribute here to the great Chinese people and its friendly Government for their backing and co-operation, particularly during those times when that was essential and vital.\n54.\tIn this same spirit we welcome all friendly European States which desire to co-operate with us on the basis of equality and mutual co-operation, hoping the Arab- European dialog would realize its goals.\n55.\tIt does not stand to reason that the world should still be beset with problems of poverty, hunger and disease in an age when man has ventured into space, reached the moon and landed craft on Mars on voyages that have cost the advanced countries billions of dollars. While science and technology have forged ahead beyond imagination, it has become clear that the vicious circle of backwardness is related to the present inequitable structure of the economic relations between the developed and developing countries and that the continued existence of the economic international status quo can only mean a further widening of the gap between the industrialized and the third-world countries. These are facts brought to focus by the midterm review and appraisal of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Hence the concern of the non-aligned States and the developing States in calling for the establishment of the new international economic order. They believe that their backwardness or their progress affects not only themselves, but also, in the same measure and in the same direction, the industrially advanced countries; this is a reflection of the reality of international interdependence in our world today. The consequences and results of this are also related to the stability and prosperity of the world in its entirety.\n56.\tThe resolutions and the measures adopted by the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries the resolutions and the measures it has adopted towards the implementation of the program of economic co-operation among them perhaps reflects clearly the determination of the third world to affirm the principle of collective self-reliance and to translate it into reality. It is this principle that the Colombo Conference has defined as supplementing, and not supplanting, international interdependence. Its objective is a more comprehensive and extensive co-operation to achieve the common goal of establishing the new international economic order that would ensure an appropriate standard of prosperity and human dignity for all mankind.\n57.\tThere is no doubt that the developing countries and peoples facing special situations which hamper their active engagement in the development process-such as being subjected to foreign aggression or to foreign occupation, racial oppression or discrimination,' or colonial domination, whether in the Middle East or Africa or elsewhere-merit special assistance from the United Nations and the international community. This is besides their right to full compensation tor the damages inflicted on them-a right that was reaffirmed anew by the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries in Colombo and the recent conference of developing countries in Mexico. In this connexion, I wish to commend the role of the United Nations Development Program and other institutions, as well as that of friendly States, in contributing to the reconstruction programs in the Suez Canal region.\n58.\tI should also like to underline the decisions of the two Conferences regarding the necessity of increasing assistance to the national liberation movements, to the newly independent countries and to those heroic African States whose economies have been adversely affected as a result of the joint struggle waged against the racial, regimes in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania.\n59.\tFurthermore, it is necessary to implement the resolutions of the Colombo Conference [A/31/197, annex IV], the ministerial conference of the developing countries at Manila,  and their recent conference at Mexico City regarding the adoption of effective measures by developed countries for the provision of debt relief to developing countries, including debt cancellation in specific cases as defined by these resolutions.\n60.\tThe resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly concerning the establishment of the new international economic order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J, and of the other specialized international conferences convened in this context to deal with problems relating to population, food, industrial development and human settlement have not resulted in any tangible progress in the implementation of this order. We became optimistic as we witnessed the serious dialog initiated in the seventh special session and expected this dialog to proceed to the phase of actual and constructive implementation when resumed at the Conference of International Economic Co-operation in Paris and at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], as well as at other international meetings. It is therefore with deep regret and bitterness that we find that those expectations have not materialized, despite the aggravation and urgency of the problems of the developing nations and despite the increasingly universal acceptance of the principles and objectives of the new international economic order.\n61.\tI should like to draw attention to the attempt at nuclear blackmail in the Middle East region and the danger which this entails. I refer here to reports emanating from Israel, and carried by some sections of the mass media in various parts of the world, about Israel's possession of nuclear weapons. What is uppermost in our minds is to prevent the introduction of nuclear weapons into the area and their proliferation in order to ward off the danger of nuclear war. It was with this end in view that Egypt joined Iran in an initiative at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  resulting in a resolution calling for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle\u2003East as an effective measure to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the area. That initiative met with unanimous and universal support.\n62.\tIt is pertinent here to ask, Why does Israel continuously and persistently refuse to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII) annex] and to accept an international safeguard system? This refusal is one more proof of Israel's lack of seriousness when it speaks of peace. Undoubtedly the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East signifies support of efforts aiming at the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, leading eventually to general and complete disarmament. It also implies a concern for world peace and security, considering the explosive situation in the area as a result of the Middle East question.\n63.\tEgypt has signed the non-proliferation Treaty and maintains its declared stand of ratifying it once Israel accedes to it.\n64.\tWe in Egypt have contributed positively and effectively to the efforts undertaken by our international Organization in the field of disarmament. We are aware, too, that co-operation of the nuclear Powers with the United Nations is essential for the success and fruition of United Nations efforts in this field. We call on the nuclear Powers to be responsive to the United Nations efforts and to co-operate fully with it, particularly in the following matters: the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament; the promotion of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and the prohibition of the production and use of incendiary weapons and weapons of mass destruction; nuclear disarmament and the achievement of general and complete disarmament.\n65.\tIn this connexion I would like to express Egypt's support of Sri Lanka's position concerning the importance and the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n66.\tEgypt will continue to support every international effort intended to achieve tangible progress in the field of disarmament on the basis of universal participation. Hence Egypt, as a non-aligned State, attaches great importance to the convening of a special session on disarmament. It will exert every effort to render this a fruitful session-one that would ensure the continuation and intensification of universal efforts towards a world of general and complete disarmament.\n67.\tCo-operation in solving international problems should cover the right of States to exercise their sovereignty over their natural resources. Egypt has played a constructive role in the negotiations on an international treaty regulating the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed resources and the setting up of a legal order that would ensure that all States would share on an equitable basis in this wealth that belongs to mankind as a whole, thus avoiding international competition. It is our earnest belief that this would be the right path to consolidating global peace and security.\n68.\tEgypt has actively worked with the Arab and African groups, and in full solidarity with the developing States of the Group of 77, to ensure the establishment of a legal order that would ensure a just distribution of these riches, and that would safeguard the sovereignty of the coastal States over their territorial waters, their jurisdiction over their exclusive economic zones, and their interests in the continental shelf. Recognition of such rights does not necessarily mean any curtailment of scientific research or interference with the better utilization of the deep sea-bed.\n69.\tEgypt has undertaken initiatives within the Arab group during the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea towards arriving at a formula reconciling various views and realizing all goals.\n70.\tEgypt emphasizes that it is essential that all representatives of national liberation movements recognized by the United Nations should participate as observers in the General Assembly of the international authority that would be entrusted with regulating the exploitation of water resources and that the peoples not as yet independent should share in the revenues from this exploitation.\n71.\tThe peoples of the world aspire to a life founded on human compassion, with ethical values and the rule of law as its mainstay. Consequently we have to continue working persistently towards building the world of the Charter, for the United Nations was established to stay, and both Governments and peoples need it.\n72.\tAllow me to recall the words with which President El-Sadat concluded his address before you at the thirtieth session:\n\\\"The world expects a lot from you at this historic, important juncture. The peoples have rising expectations of peace and prosperity at a time when the most severe challenges are multiplying and when problems are growing in complexity in an unprecedented manner. I am confident that, with our sincere and unswerving belief in a better future for humanity and our determination to work together for the attainment of our common goals, together we shall pass the test of peace and progress, thus paving the way towards a brighter era where future generations can enjoy comfort, security and hope.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to congratulate you on your election as President of this Assembly session. This has been a great year for you. You have already demonstrated your presidential capacity in five sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and at two of them this year. At the same time your country has been the host for a summit meeting of the non-aligned countries in Colombo.1 Your election as President not only ensures that this session will run with unusual punctuality and efficiency, but also reflects honor on Sri Lanka and on the Asian countries which showed their wisdom in selecting you for this high post.\n31.\tI offer my warm felicitations to our Secretary-General and his staff on their untiring efforts in the interests of all mankind.\n32.\tNew Zealand, as a fellow member of the Common-wealth, gives a special welcome to Seychelles as the newest Member of the United Nations. In accordance with the principle of universality, New Zealand will support the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam when it comes before this Assembly.\n33.\tThe General Assembly is the great key forum for the discussion of world issues, and the attendance of so many distinguished political figures at this session proves this.\n34.\tSome might think that New Zealand is not well placed to be much more than an onlooker in such a discussion. We are tucked away at the south end of the world. We are small; we are isolated; we are rather out of the way. But I assure you that any such assumption would be wrong. In spite of our geographical position, we are very much a part of the world. We depend for our livelihood, as much as any other country in the world, on our overseas trade.\n35.\tWhen things go wrong with other parts of the world, particularly in the economic sphere, we feel the effects and we feel them heavily and badly. As a result of the recent international recession our economic fortunes have suffered a significant downturn. We are still struggling to put things right, and I am not being pessimistic when I say that we still have a long way to go. Times are difficult for New Zealand. Unemployment has increased, and belts have had to be tightened. All this has inevitably placed strains on our society.\n36.\tBut although we are going through a lean time I have no apprehension about our future. This is because our society is fundamentally strong, and it is strong because it is fundamentally just.\n37.\tWe are multiracial society. We are British, we are Maori, we are Polynesian, we are Chinese, we are Danish, Yugoslav, Indian, Dutch and of many other nationalities. Some might see this cultural diversity as a liability or as a source of friction. We do not. It is a strength. We believe that our society is more mature, more accommodating and richer because we have learned and are still learning to get along together. I will not pretend that stresses do not occasionally arise. The movement in recent years of large numbers of our Maori people to the cities and the immigration of other Polynesians from the Pacific Islands have created problems of adjustment that did not formerly exist. The change from a traditional community life in comparatively isolated rural or island areas to a somewhat frustrating and perplexing one in what may seem to many to be an uncaring city is never easy.\n38.\tI would claim, however, that the change is perhaps easier to make in New Zealand than in many other places throughout the world, and I believe that is because we have a stronger egalitarian tradition and because we believe that human rights are not the preserve of any one group. Divisions of class, status or cultural background are of less significance than they are perhaps anywhere else in the world. I know that is a bold statement to make, but I believe it to be true. To put it into our colloquial terms, we believe in giving the other chap & \\\"fair go\\\", and it does not matter whether the other chap is a Maori, a Samoan, an Indian, a European, or whatever. We all share the same rights and the same responsibilities.\n39.\tAnd this approach is well reflected throughout our history. Representatives might be interested to know that our indigenous people, the Maori, were granted the democratic right of universal suffrage -the \\\"one man, one vote\\\" that we hear so much of today-in 1867: over a hundred years ago. At that time the rest of the New Zealand community still had to have property qualifications in order to vote. The most reliable test of racial harmony is often claimed to lie in the rate of intermarriage between different groups. In New Zealand the rate of intermarriage is so high that it has been estimated that within a generation or two every New Zealander of British or European stock will have at least one close relative of Maori or Polynesian extraction.\n40.\tAs New Zealanders, we have thus come to see clearly that our separate destiny as a nation lies in building upon the heritage of our two main cultures-that of the Polynesian and that of what we call the Pakeha, or European. What we are striving to do is to leave to our children and their children the inheritance of the best of what is to be found in the traditional values of our different cultures.\n41.\tThis has necessarily meant coming to terms with New Zealand's geographical position. As I mentioned earlier, we are located in the far South Pacific, and so New Zealanders of all races have developed a sense of belonging to the Pacific. It is not for us an area that we look on from a long distance and with detachment, as it will be looked on by most people of the world. It is our region.\n42.\tOur acceptance of this identify has been accelerated by the emergence of new island nations in our neighborhood, and when I talk of \\\"neighborhood\\\" it is pretty vast: I am talking of an area of 2,000 to 4,000 miles wide. It has been fostered, too, by the experience we have had in administering our former Territories, the Cook Islands and Niue. The United Nations was closely associated with the process by which those Territories came to self-government, and New Zealand assisted and welcomed that association.\n43.\tWe were pleased, earlier this year, that a Visiting Mission from the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was able to go to our remaining island Territory, which used to be called the Tokelau Islands, but is from now on to be known simply as Tokelau, to discuss its future. The Mission has since submitted its report [A/31/ 23/Rev.l, chap. XVII, annex]. We in New Zealand are giving most serious consideration to what the report has to say and, of course, particularly to its recommendations. Tokelau comprises an isolated, tiny and thinly settled group of islands. My Government will cp-operate fully with the United Nations in finding ways to meet the expressed wishes of the Tokelau people regarding their future.\n44.\tThe process of political change is at work, not only in New Zealand's corner of the Pacific, but in other parts as well. The South Pacific has sometimes been called a quiet backwater. I doubt that that has ever really been true, and certainly in my long experience the South Pacific has always been a busy place; there is always something going on and some changes taking place.\n45.\tYet I also believe it is true that the South Pacific is indeed entering upon a new era: new forms of political co-operation are evolving, notably the South Pacific Forum, in which the heads of government of the independent nations of the South Pacific meet at least once each year, with committees in between times. I had the very great privilege of presiding over the first Forum, which was held in New Zealand in 1971. There is a growing sense of collective interest evident in the work of that Forum. Perhaps the best example of this is the concerted approach its members have adopted towards those aspects of the negotiations on the law of the sea which have very great implications for all those who live in our region.\n46.\tNew leaders have emerged and are emerging. They have new ideas and they are determined to give expression to the expectations of their people. This is a good thing, something to be encouraged. Because of the kinship link New Zealand has with the Pacific people, we are that much more aware of their aspirations for advancement and their aspirations for higher living standards. We are also aware- keenly aware-of the expectations that New Zealand and Australia inspire because we are of the relatively more affluent members of the Pacific family.\n47.\tMy Government is committed to assisting the island countries of the Pacific, and this year a greater share than ever before of New Zealand's aid program is going into the South Pacific countries. A special effort is being made to promote employment opportunities in those countries. We will, however, continue to leave it to those countries themselves to decide their own priorities and the direction in which they wish to go in building towards self- sufficiency.\n48.\tWe are doing all that we can to help. We look also to the United Nations and the specialized agencies to continue their good work in our region. The United Nations Development Program [UNDP], we know, faces a grave resources problem. It has, however, made a valuable contribution to the South Pacific in recent years, and this is an opportunity for me to reinforce the previous representations that the New Zealand Government has made, that the UNDP should maintain its support for the important key projects it has been involved in in the region.\n49.\tThere has recently been a quickening of outside interest in this region. To the extent that it reflects a genuine concern to promote the well-being of the developing countries of the South Pacific, it will be welcome.\n50.\tHaving a special interest in the South Pacific does not mean that we take a parochial view of world economic problems. The same egalitarian tradition which I mentioned earlier, the same concern for the basic human rights, leads us to attach great urgency to early progress in restructuring the world's economic and trading system along more equitable lines. We share Secretary-General Waldheim's own blunt assessment when he said: \\\"A world economically divided could not and would not be politically stable.\\\"\n51.\tAs a country heavily dependent on the export of a narrow range of agricultural commodities, New Zealand knows at first hand the difficulties and uncertainties faced by developing countries whose economic progress is dependent upon a stable and remunerative trade in commodities, mainly primary commodities. I have mentioned our own problems arising from the international recession. But we realize fully that many developing countries were hit even harder than we were, and that for them export earnings have shrunk to a level at which their development efforts have been crippled. We believe that improved commodity training arrangements are an essential ingredient of any new international economic order worthy of that name.\n52.\tAgain, as a net importer of investment capital and technology, New Zealand has a special appreciation of the requirement for better and more equitable international arrangements in those two areas. My Government also believes that the daunting debt-servicing problems currently faced by the poorer developing countries demand immediate attention, and in the future the question of the terms of development assistance generally must receive continuing international consideration in a multilateral context.\n53.\tThere has been some progress since the encouraging conclusion of last year's seventh special session of the General Assembly. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris and other important meetings, both within and outside the United Nations system, have provided an important element of continuity in the global consultations. The number and the intensity of these meetings reflects a growing recognition of the interrelated nature of our problems and the urgency with which we must tackle them.\n54.\tThe fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] succeeded in establishing a framework and a time seals for consideration of the key question of the international commodity trade. It cleared the way, at least, for a more detailed analysis of the specific issues involved. These are welcome developments, although less progress was made in other key areas. But in the new climate, consideration of these issues will not be allowed to lapse; the debate is, fortunately, now a continuing one.\n55.\tInternational efforts are focused on many different problems-food production, human settlements, the commodities trade, the transfer of science and technology, the flow of development assistance and investment capital, and the restructuring of the United Nations system itself to make it more responsive to the current needs of the world community. In all these efforts New Zealand is committed to full and constructive participation.\n56.\tOne of this Organization's real achievements in its 30-year history has been in the elaboration of standards for basic human rights. We know, however, that despite those standards and despite all the efforts made by men of good will, people in many parts of the world are still being denied their basic human rights. We know, too, that nowhere is the denial as blatant as it is in the countries of southern Africa. The refusal of those who rule South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia to accept the principle of human equality has caused acute tensions and has brought the situation in the area to a critical stage. Watching the developments of the last few months, we in New Zealand, like people I know in other countries, have had the feeling that we may be seeing the beginning of a maelstrom of violence.\n57.\tFor Rhodesia, time is rapidly running out. Until recently the Smith regime seemed determined to make no concessions to the demand for early majority rule. It has seemed more and more likely that that objective would be achieved only by armed force, with much bloodshed. My Government is, therefore, very encouraged by the decision of Mr. Ian Smith and his colleagues, belated though it may be, to accept majority rule within two years. So the way is now open for negotiations on the detailed arrangements for the transfer of power, and we in New Zealand earnestly hope that, through British good offices, these can soon begin and that they will be successful.\n58.\tWhen the Security Council imposed mandatory sanctions on Rhodesia in 1968,  the Government of which I was then head immediately put them into effect in New Zealand. Since then, successive Governments have applied the sanctions consistently and rigorously. After Mozambique had announce d its decision to apply sanctions, and in view of the consequent loss to it, my Government agreed to contribute to the programs of assistance to that country launched by the Commonwealth Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Although New Zealand is not directly involved, we are prepared to play our part in any international effort to end the bloodshed and to help die people of Rhodesia to achieve a just multiracial society.\n59.\tNamibia, too, seems dangerously close to the brink of conflict. We in New Zealand believe that South Africa was wrong to go on occupying Namibia after its Mandate was withdrawn, and we have said so consistently. South Africa was even more wrong to try to impose its own policy of apartheid on the people of Namibia. We welcome South Africa's recent acceptance of the goal of independence for Namibia. But independence is meaningless unless it is genuinely based on self-determination. And the refusal of the South African Government to deal with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has created a justifiable and reasonable doubt in the minds of African and other countries whether the act of self-determination envisaged by that Government will be fully genuine.\n60.\tAs Namibia was once a League of Nations Mandate, this Organization has a special responsibility towards it: its responsibility is to see that all the people of Namibia are given the opportunity to decide freely for themselves what the future of their country should be. It is essential, therefore, that the United Nations should be given the opportunity and the means to supervise free elections in Namibia and to approve any new constitution for that country.\n61.\tMuch is at stake in Rhodesia and in Namibia, but in the longer term the greatest potential for disaster is in South Africa itself. I think this is obvious to all men. South Africa is not in any means the only country in the world where human rights are consistently violated, and we all know this. But it is the only country where racial discrimination is the basis of the whole social, economic and political system. Our own experience in New Zealand has taught us that racial harmony is essential to the well-being of a multiracial society. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr: MuldOon, said in a speech about a month ago:\n\\\"The New Zealand Government's attitude to apartheid is very clear: we believe it is wrong and we want to see it ended. It should now be plain even to South Africans that apartheid will not work. Based as it is on racial discrimination, it is an unjust and inhuman system. It can be maintained only by the ruthless use of force, and it cannot be maintained that way indefinitely.\\\"\n62.\tThe rioting that has been going on around South African cities for over three months now began as a spontaneous explosion of black anger. By ruthless repression, the South African authorities have managed to confine it largely to the black townships. They have not been able to stop it. The outside .world can see that they are in a blind alley. Only a fundamental change of direction can prevent an inevitable escalation of the hatred, violence and bloodshed.\n63.\tSetting up what are called \\\"homelands\\\", or \\\"bantustans\\\", for. the African people of South Africa will not solve the problem. The black and colored people of South Africa cannot accept being deprived of citizenship in their own country-the country of their birth and the country they have helped to develop. They must be accepted as citizens of South Africa, entitled to a fair share in South Africa's resources. We note that many countries including in particular Britain and the other members of the European Community, have made it clear that they are unable to extend recognition to the Transkei and other homelands as sovereign, independent States:\n64.\tNew Zealand's position is the same. Indeed, I recall that in 1971 New Zealand voted for the resolution adopted by the Assembly condemning the establishment of the bantustans [resolution 2775 E (XXVI)]. Then, as now, a National Party Government was in office in New Zealand. In 1975 New Zealand also supported the Assembly resolution calling upon Governments not to recognize any of the bantustans [resolution 3411D (XXX)]. That action was taken by a Labor Government, but it was in accordance with the policy that the previous Government had initiated. There is a consistent line of policy in New Zealand on this question.\n65.\tWe note with regret that, 31 years after the United Nations Charter was signed, threats to the peace continue to exist in many parts of the world: notably in the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East. Good sense has prevailed here, and we are not going to have another sterile confrontation over Korea at this session, but the fact remains that the border between North and South Korea remains in a state of continuous tension and that talks between the two Governments have reached an apparent stalemate. As a result, Korea remains divided and outside the United Nations.\n66.\tWe feel deeply for the people of Lebanon in the tragic situation in which they find themselves, a situation not of their own choice or of their own making. We are equally concerned at the lack of progress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem, despite the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and others. Again, it is the people of Cyprus who are the innocent victims. We can only join with others in saying that what is needed is simply the implementation of previous Assembly resolutions: the withdrawal of foreign troops, the repatriation of refugees and the resumption of negotiations between the two sides. New Zealand strongly supports this line of action.\n67.\tThis has been an active year in the field of international law-making, although it has not been as productive as most of us would have wished.\n68.\tNew Zealand attaches the greatest importance to the achievement of a new convention on the law of the sea. When you think of that vast area of ocean around us and around the Polynesian islands with which we are so closely associated, you will realize how keenly we are interested in this question. We have, therefore, shared the widespread sense of frustration at the lack of progress during the last session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea on the main issues which are delaying general agreement. We remain committed to the goal of a universally supported treaty on this vital subject. We believe that rapid progress towards this goal is now absolutely essential if the\nConference is not to lose the great chance it has to secure an equitable and stable regime for the world's oceans. In the absence of such progress, New Zealand, like many other States, will inevitably shorten its focus and concentrate on consultations and arrangements within its own region.\n69.\tI shall turn now to one aspect only of a subject which perhaps overrides all others in its global implications: the question of disarmament.\n70.\tThe aspect that has especially worried New Zealanders is the question of nuclear weapons testing and proliferation. We know that to put an end to the testing of nuclear weapons is not, in itself, a disarmament measure, but we believe that it is an important confidence-building step, an essential preliminary to nuclear disarmament.\n71.\tIt is a great relief to us in New Zealand that the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere in our part of the world has stopped during the past 12 months. We regret that it continues elsewhere. As recently as yesterday, we have had news of substantial radioactive fall-out right here on our doorstep from a nuclear explosion many thousands of miles away. What the safety level for such fall-out is no one can be sure, but it is obviously desirable that any increase in existing levels should be avoided.\n72.\tHowever, that in itself is not enough. Only a comprehensive test-ban treaty, ending weapons testing in all environments and not only in the atmosphere, can be counted as a genuine first step on the road towards nuclear disarmament. One of the main stumbling-blocks to the conclusion of such a treaty has been the question of on-site inspection. We think it is very encouraging that, in a document recently circulated [see A/311232], the Soviet Union has now indicated willingness to consider a com-promise on this issue. The language of the Soviet note is, however, not altogether clear. It is important, we feel, that on-site inspection should not depend entirely on the consent of the State in question.\n73.\tAnother stumbling-block in the way of a comprehensive test-ban agreement has been the unwillingness of certain nuclear Powers to take part in the negotiations. It is our hope that they will take heed cf the increasing concern of world public opinion about the ever increasing growth and proliferation of nuclear weapons and that they will adopt a more co-operative approach.\n74.\tIn this connexion, I stress the need for the utmost control over the exportation of sensitive nuclear facilities and I am thinking particularly of processing plants. Things are bad and dangerous enough now, but they could get very much worse, and even over the short period. The suppliers of nuclear fuel and material have a responsibility not only to themselves but also to the rest of the world to ensure that their commercial activities do not facilitate nuclear weapons proliferation. Profits will be of little value in a nuclear holocaust.\n75.\tI have touched on several aspects of what I might call a general human rights theme: I have discussed human rights in New Zealand, economic rights in the South Pacific and the developing world generally; I have discussed human rights in southern Africa, and, in relation to disarmament, what I might call the human right to survive. I should like to conclude by referring to one further aspect of the human rights theme, and that concerns the question of international terrorism. I agree absolutely with the comment of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his annual report to the Assembly on the work of the Organization that the time has come for a new and determined approach by the international community to this growing and worrying problem [see A/31/l/Add. l, sect. V]. No one can deny that the increasing frequency and scope of acts of terrorism pose a serious threat to the integrity of the whole human society as we know it. My Government therefore welcomes the initiative taken by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the elaboration of a convention on the taking of hostages and we hope that the Assembly will be prepared to examine it in a positive spirit [A/31/242].\n76.\tSurely it is not too much to hope that, when this Assembly ends, its work may be marked down as a positive contribution towards strengthening economic, social and political rights, especially of all poor and oppressed peoples everywhere, and to the freeing of all mankind from the fear of nuclear destruction.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first of all take this opportunity to convey to you and, through you, to all delegations assembled here, greetings from His Excellency Alhajji Field Marshal Mr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, BSD, MC, Life President of the Republic of Uganda, the Government and the entire people of Uganda and their best wishes for fruitful deliberations. Uganda attaches great importance to this Organization in the sincere conviction that it is here to serve the interests of mankind.\n2.\tAlso on behalf of my delegation I would congratulate Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe on his unanimous election to preside over this session. His high reputation and the impressive list of his diplomatic and administrative achievements are undoubtedly the best guarantee that he will carry out this assignment with competence and to the satisfaction of all Member States and especially to the pride of the non-aligned movement, of which his country is a member. My delegation assures him of its full support in the discharge of his duties.\n3.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Prime Minister Gaston Thorn, for the efficient manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the last session.\n4.\tOn this occasion too I should like to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his staff for their good work. Uganda greatly appreciates the work of Mr. Waldheim in promoting peace, justice and equality, particularly in the third world. His dedicated service to our Organization will remain on permanent record in the annals of the United Nations. We are particularly grateful for his services in the field of decolonization and in handling the problems of the racist minority regimes in southern Africa.\n5.\tIt is also my delegation's pleasure to congratulate the people of the new Republic of Seychelles on their attainment of independence. Uganda welcomes this newest State from Africa among the ranks of this world body. This demonstrates Africa's determination to cast off the last chains of colonialism and to establish a free and peaceful human society. It is now the duty of the United Nations to help this new State to preserve its political and economic independence and its territorial integrity.\n6.\tWhile welcoming the Republic of Seychelles, Uganda expresses the hope that during this session the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will take their rightful places in this Organization.\n7.\tMay I at this juncture record our sorrow at the passing away of Chairman Mao Tsetung and, through you, Mr. President, convey to the Government and people of China our condolences at the loss of their great and beloved leader.\n8.\tThe world community is still experiencing hot-beds of political tension. The United Nations has all along been preoccupied with finding long-term solutions to these problems with a view to achieving lasting world peace, justice and equality among all the nations of this globe.\n9.\tAt this very moment, as I speak to you, the grave situation prevailing in southern Africa has become more than ever before a threat to international peace and security.\n10.\tThis august Assembly has for many years both in its debates and in its resolutions condemned the illegal and racist minority regime in Rhodesia. The sanctions against rebel Ian Smith's regime have failed miserably because of the support of the Vorster regime and some Member States represented here in this Assembly.\n11.\tRecent developments in Zimbabwe and observations made in the present debate highlight the need for an immediate solution to the deadlock in Zimbabwe. Various proposals have been made in recent weeks ostensibly to solve the Rhodesian problem by peaceful means. Why, may we ask, should the people of Zimbabwe wait for another two or so years to have power transferred to them, when they have been fighting rebel Smith's illegal regime since 1965? The people of Zimbabwe have shed their blood for many years, particularly in the last 11 years, fighting for their independence. Uganda has given, and continues to \ngive, material and moral support to the liberation movements in Zimbabwe. Now that total liberation is within teach, any attempt to call on the liberation movements to lay down their arms should be strongly resisted. Accordingly, President Amin, speaking as one with the entire people of Uganda, has appealed to the liberation movements not to give up the armed struggle. The armed struggle must be intensified until racist Smith and Vorster are brought to their knees and total liberation is achieved.\n12.\tDespite numerous resolutions of the United Nations, under whose mandate Namibia falls, Fascist South Africa continues to occupy Namibia illegally. Besides occupying Namibia illegally, South Africa has extended its inhuman policy of apartheid to that Territory. South Africa is in the process of fragmenting Namibia and establishing pocket regimes under the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\". The bogus constitutional conference held recently in Namibia has been denounced by the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ, the authentic representatives of the people of Namibia, and we support them. South Africa has further militarized Namibia and turned it into a police State from which the racist regime stages attacks on other independent African States. We cannot condone these barbaric acts.\n13.\tThe people of Namibia, under the leadership of SWAPO, are waging a gallant struggle against the racist regime in South Africa. We appeal to all peace-loving nations to support their just cause until final victory is achieved. We in Uganda will continue to render every assistance to those heroic people.\n14.\tThis Assembly is fully aware that the principles underlying the system of apartheid are in sharp contradiction to the very principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet the racist regime of South Africa has committed, and still continues to commit, crimes against humanity, and there is no doubt that this regime remains a threat to international peace and security. When it is stripped of all propaganda and sentiments, we all know that the tyranny in South Africa, unequaled anywhere in the world, is maintained by deliberate racist legislation and carried out by a ruthless administration, secret service and police force.\n15.\tThe situation in South Africa is, more than ever before, a test which will enable us to assess the real practical value of this Organization. For our part, we have not hidden our hostility to the apartheid system and we make no apology for the fact that we want that racist regime and its policies dismantled.\n16.\tFor a long time we have heard some Members of this Organization speaking loudly against the policies of apartheid, and yet they arm South Africa and are even supplying nuclear reactors to that country to enable it to entrench its policies. These countries have attempted to enhance the credibility of Vorster, who now poses as a mediator and a co-sponsor of the so-called African solution to an African problem. The time has come for those who claim to be the friends of independent Africa to stand up and be counted. We believe that those who continue to arm South Africa with sophisticated and dangerous weapons cannot at the same time genuinely claim to be on our side. Current events in South Africa have shown that apartheid is collapsing, and the oppressed majority in South Africa are prepared to lay down their lives for the total liberation of their country. We join all peace-loving peoples in mourning the death of the hundreds of innocent men, women and children who lost their lives at the hands of a gang of racist terrorists. Let those who back Vorster be informed that the ship is sinking and it is time for them to make their choice.\n17.\tSince the establishment of the Zionist State of Israel, the Middle East situation has been a threat to international peace and security. Those who support Zionist Israel forget that the Palestinians have been made to suffer for the last 30 years. The Palestinians have now been driven into the desert, surviving on hand-outs and living in tents. In all this the Zionists and their allies have treated the Palestinians as if they were surplus human beings to be removed and dumped anywhere in the harshness of the desert.\n18.\tIt is true that had it not been aided militarily by powerful imperialist forces, Israel's ambitions would have been crushed by now. This Assembly should not be intimidated by those imperialist forces in condemning the Zionist atrocities committed in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. No solution in the Middle East will be lasting unless Israel withdraws from the occupied Arab territory, and the rights of the Palestinian people are fully recognized.\n19.\tAs regards the situation in Lebanon, we hope that the people of that troubled country will be able to find a quick, peaceful and lasting solution to existing conflicts in that country, so that the Arab people can focus their attention on their major objective in the Middle East.\n20.\tMy delegation is alarmed at the lack of progress in disarmament and the upward trend in the production, stockpiling and proliferation of armaments, particularly nuclear armaments. The vast resources which the world is devoting to the arms race should usefully be channeled towards the social and economic development of the developing countries. It is against this background that my delegation would like to endorse the proposal of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Colombo from 16 to 19 August 1976, to convene as soon as possible a special session of the General Assembly to discuss the question of disarmament.\n21.\tThe world has changed a lot since the Charter of the United Nations was drawn up more than 30 years ago. The membership of the Organization has since greatly increased, and so have its activities, especially in functional fields and in other burning international issues that have since confronted us. These drastic changes in the facts of international life make corresponding changes in the structure of the Organization imperative and require our urgent attention.\n22.\tThe negative vote system in the Security Council, for instance, has now, more than ever before, become distasteful to most members of this Assembly because it runs counter to the principle of equality of all States and gives to a few a privileged status, dwarfing the will of the majority. We have stated before that this Organization was founded on the fundamental principle of equality among nations, whether great or small, strong or weak, rich or \npoor. My delegation, therefore, urges that the veto system be replaced by a more democratic system in line with the requirements of law and justice.\n23.\tUganda has pursued and participated with keen interest in the proceedings of Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Although a land-locked country, Uganda shares an active interest in the peaceful exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed for the betterment of mankind. My Government is ready to support a just international convention for the effective exploitation of these resources.\n24.\tUganda feels that any convention on the law of the sea must adequately cove; the interests of all countries, including the land-locked countries. There are still many areas of disagreement, and the non-aligned countries have already made proposals on the right of free access to and from the sea. This and other issues, particularly regarding the sea-bed and its exploitation and the exclusive economic zone, have to be satisfactorily resolved before we can come to a convention acceptable to all. We shall not be intimidated by threats of unilateral action on the part of some Member States to conclude a convention which will not cover our interests. We hope that the remaining difficulties will be resolved at the sixth session, which will take place in 1977, taking into consideration the position of the Group of 77.\n25.\tRegarding the world economic situation, we are all familiar with the reasons and developments which led to the current international economic crisis. Although there are some prospects for improvement on the world economic scene, economic growth in the developing countries has generally been scanty and in certain cases there has been some negative growth. The most seriously affected countries have been the ones least able to withstand this crisis. Considering that 18 out of the 29 least developed countries are located in Africa, many of them being land-locked or situated in disaster areas, and that Africa also contains 28 of the 45 most seriously affected countries [see A/31121, annex IV), the African continent has been the most severely hit of all the regions of the world. In this respect, the continent deserves increased assistance from the international community.\n26.\tThe alarming disparity between the levels of development in the developed and developing countries has become a threat to world peace and security. Durable solutions must be found to the grave problems being generated by the present distribution of wealth in the world, the price relationship between raw materials and manufactured goods and discrimination in the world trade system as well as in the credit and monetary system. My Government considers the move towards the new international economic order as a logical response to the urgent need for greatly enhanced development prospects in the developing world.\n27.\tIn this respect, we reaffirm our support of the positions taken at various international Conferences, particularly at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ and the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.\n28.\tMy Government views with great concern the slowness with which some of the generally accepted programs of action for the international community are being implemented. It is particularly discouraging to note the lack of commitment on the part of the developed countries to implement those decisions of the General Assembly which laid down the foundation of the new international economic order. The efforts of the developing countries to bring about social and economic changes have been seriously hampered by various constraints, which, inter alia, have caused such efforts to fall short of the growth target of the Second United Nations Development Decade. The developed countries should accept and fulfill their obligations and commitments arising from the decisions and recommendations which laid down the foundations of the new international economic order. Furthermore, the developed countries should respond more positively to the proposals of the developing countries as contained in the Manila Declaration  adopted at the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, which was held from 26 January to 7 February 1976.\n29.\tMy delegation is deeply concerned at the lack of progress in the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation. After almost nine months of negotiations, the developed countries have not even responded, beyond general remarks, to the concrete proposals submitted by the Group of 19 developing countries taking part in the Conference. We expressed misgivings at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly about the Paris Conference, and the deadlock reached at the Conference seems to confirm our fears. We would, therefore, wish to propose that all future negotiations of this nature should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations.\n30.\tThe real issue now before us is whether or not we can come to terms with the political realities of an economically divided world and whether or not we can agree on the need to establish a viable economic system for the equitable distribution of the world's resources. This, then, is the stark reality before us. Mankind is now at the crossroads. We have either to turn towards the new international economic order or to choose to continue with the present inequitable system. My delegation is confident that the United Nations system is capable of arriving at an integrated multisectoral approach to the problems of economic and social development.\n31.\tIn this context, I should like to refer to the limited nature of the progress achieved test May at Nairobi during the fourth session of UNCTAD, and urge the developed countries which have not already done so to accept, among other things, the principle of indexation, to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as official development assistance to the developing countries in accordance with the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], to accept the cancellation or rescheduling of the developing countries' external debts and to implement the special measures in favor of the most \nseriously affected, least developed, land-locked and island developing countries.\n32.\tIn addition to the foregoing, very far-reaching economic decisions were taken at the recent Colombo Conference, and Uganda supported these decisions, which have already been presented to this Assembly by Mrs. Banda- ranaike, current Chairman of the non-aligned movement, in her address of 30 September last [th meeting]. They represent the joint aspirations of a big group of members of the world community. These decisions emphasize the importance of self-reliance. The non-aligned countries will together defend these aspirations, and the world community should take these countries' aspirations into consideration.\n33.\tMay I reiterate our firm conviction that, whatever measures the international community may take in favor of the developing countries, the economic development of each country in the third world remains the prime task of the State concerned. My Government is resolved that international and foreign financial and technical assistance can only complement national efforts in the field of development. In this connexion, Uganda has taken steps to effect institutional changes in our economy and the Government has established full sovereignty over Uganda's natural resources to ensure that the course of economic development is directed in the best interest of the people.\n34.\tfaking self-reliance as the basis of our economic policy, my Government is keen to develop closer co-operation among the developing countries. My delegation would like to urge those developing countries in a position to do so to increase their investments in developing countries rather than channeling them to developed countries. My Government is of the view that there is a vast potential for investment by developing countries in Africa as a whole and Uganda in particular.\n35.\tHaving actively participated in the fourth session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] and in the preparatory work for Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements and in the Conference itself, which was held at Vancouver from 31 May to 11 June 1976, my Government is satisfied with the progress that has been made so far by UNEP in playing its role in the stimulation of interest in environmental problems as well as promotion of international and national awareness and action aimed at combating problems of the environment and of human settlements. My delegation supports the Vancouver Declaration of Principles, the recommendations for national action and the programs tor international co-operation  and believes that their implementation would go a long way towards improving human settlement conditions in developing countries. My delegation, therefore, wishes to support initiatives aimed at trying to establish a new, independent body on human settlements to tackle the serious problems of human settlements afflicting the world today.\n36.\tBefore I conclude, let me briefly refer once again to the Israeli military aggression against Uganda on 4 July 1976. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica made malicious and unfounded allegations against Uganda on 27 September last [6th meeting], insinuating that my country was a party to the hijacking of the French airbus to Entebbe. It is shameful that a Minister from a developing country, namely, Costa Rica, should have turned himself into a spokesman for a racist, aggressive, Zionist country, listening to what the Foreign Minister of Costa Rica said, one wondered whether he was speaking as a representative of Costa Rica or as an honorary citizen of Israel. Who knows? What happened to Uganda could happen to Costa Rica. My delegation wishes him God's forgiveness.\n37.\tThe Israeli military aggression against my country was a criminal, premeditated and flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda. A debate was held on that aggression against my country in the Security Council last July.  I take this opportunity once again to reject categorically such malicious allegations and to stress that Uganda does not and will never support or condone terrorism and that no one should try to confuse a humanitarian act with an act of terrorism.\n38.\tThis Assembly and the whole world are fully aware of President Amin's efforts to save the lives of the hostages held by commandos of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in a hijacked French airbus. Permission for the hijacked airbus to land at Entebee airport was granted on purely humanitarian grounds and at the request of the French Government. The Uganda Government under the direct command of my President undertook every effort to give the most comfortable treatment to the hostages who, for the first time in the history of hijacking, were allowed to leave the aircraft. President Amin also persuaded the Palestinian commandos to release the hostages, and some were indeed released.\n39.\tThe President of Uganda has already received some messages of thanks from the hostages, including the Israelis, for the excellent efforts he deployed to secure their release and the comfortable treatment they received during their stay at Entebbe airport. In actual fact, Uganda fulfilled, to the best of its ability, its moral and humanitarian duty. Now, instead of being grateful to Uganda, the Israeli Government carried out a barbaric invasion into my country, under the pretext of rescuing the 'remaining hostages. During the raid Uganda suffered heavy human and material losses. Our people died at the hands of the Zionists, who had no respect for human life or for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent State Member of the United Nations. In any circumstances, the Israelis had no justification in attacking Uganda, which at that time was striving to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Israel has a reputation for disrupting efforts being undertaken for the establishment of peace and security. Uganda strongly condemns this wanton act of aggression.\n40.\tThe Organization of African Unity [OAU], at the thirteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held from 2 to 5 July at Port Louis, adopted a resolution strongly condemning the Zionist raid on Uganda and calling for payment of full compensation for both human and material losses which my country suffered \nduring the raid. A similar condemnation is contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the Colombo Conference. [See A/311197, annex I.].\tOur efforts to secure similar resolutions in the Security Council have been frustrated by the imperialist forces in the Council who are sympathizers with the Zionist regime in Israel. However, Uganda would like to register its gratitude to all the peace-loving countries which showed solidarity and sympathy during that trying period.\n42.\tRepresentatives will agree with me that the Israeli raid on Uganda defied all known principles of humanity enshrined in the United Nations Charter and was in direct violation of the Charter. Israel violated our sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect for which constitutes the basic principle for the maintenance of world peace and security, of which the United Nations is the chief custodian.\n43.\tDespite the Israeli aggression against Uganda, we have returned to Israel a jet plane that was loaned to us in 1971. Furthermore, the Uganda Government has appointed a commission of inquiry to look into the whole question of the Israeli invasion of Uganda, including the whereabouts of Mrs. Dora Bloch.\n44.\tFinally, we reiterate our faith in the United Nations and our willingness to co-operate with this world body in trying to find solutions to the many problems that face mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "204. Allow me through you Sir, to express to Mr. Amerasinghe our most sincere and warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are convinced that his outstanding qualities as a diplomat, well known to all, the wide experience he has acquired at the service of the international community and the historic commitment of his country to the defense of the principles of peace, international co-operation and independence of peoples are a certain guarantee of the full accomplishment of the lofty and honorable mission entrusted to him.\n205.\tIt is also with great respect that we pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the Prime Minister and Minister for. Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, whose intelligence, equilibrium and competence lived up to the expectations that we had placed in him last year at the time of his election.\n206.\tMay we also extend to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, our gratitude and our most sincere appreciation of the admirable work he has been carrying out in the faithful fulfillment of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and, in particular, in the framework of the struggle against colonialism, racism and apartheid in Africa.\n207.\tWe also wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to greet the representatives of the Republic of Seychelles and express to them our great satisfaction at seeing them occupy today their rightful place in this Assembly of free and sovereign nations.\n208.\tA year ago, at a historic moment for our country, that of our admission to this the highest international body, we had occasion to outline the general principles underlying our foreign policy.  We come here to reaffirm them because our experience in this short span of time as a sovereign State has proved the justice of those principles. They are fully in keeping with the legitimate interests of the Members of this Organization and the objective realities that we have inherited from colonialism and thus serve the sacred interests of our people.\n209.\tObjectively, we cannot fail to note the enormous progress that has been achieved along the path leading towards the realization of the specific objectives of the United Nations Charter.\n210.\tIn fact, self-determination and independence have become established principles of international law and the peoples of the whole world are moving irreversibly towards full emancipation and sovereignty.\n211.\tThe victory of the peoples of Indochina (Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea), the great march towards independence by the African peoples which dominated the decade of the 1960s, and the recent independence of the former Portuguese colonies, after a long and victorious political and armed struggle for national independence, are important milestones in the history of man's liberation.\n212.\tWe applaud in particular the great victory of the Vietnamese people, who achieved one of their fundamental objectives, namely the reunification of Viet Nam. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam conquered with heroism and tenacity a place of honor in our Organization. The liquidation of these bastions of colonialism and racism, apart from opening new prospects of peace, progress and social justice in the world, has served to catalyze again and decisively in Africa the general struggle against the vestiges of colonialism and the shameful realities of racism and apartheid.\n213.\tWe witness, without the slightest shadow of a doubt, a clear effort to establish concord and co-operation among nations, which in turn help to promote initiatives towards international detente.\n214.\tProof of this is the progress achieved in the negotiations on disarmament and the development of relations of co-operation among countries with different social systems which entail the relaxation of the climate of confrontation between blocs and ushers in to the benefit of the peoples an era of peaceful coexistence that replaces the bleak phase of the cold war.\n215.\tWe would be remiss if we were not to highlight the important contribution made by the enlargement and gradual consolidation of the non-aligned movement and OAU.\n216.\tWhile OAU, through its higher bodies, has seriously considered the crucial problems of Africa and has found an answer and solution to many of them, as borne out by the recent results obtained in Mauritius, the non-aligned movement inspired by similar principles and objectives but with a broader platform has carried out similar tasks at the third-world level. The last Conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka, adopted declarations and resolutions [see Af31/197] which bear out this assertion.\n217.\tWe can say that today, in its struggle for the Creative implementation of the principles enshrined in our Charter, the African group and the broader platform of the non-aligned countries in the United Nations represent a decisive factor in the establishment of a new policy among nations.\n218.\tOur State, as a fully fledged member of both OAU and the non-aligned group, firmly supports all the decisions taken and resolutions adopted by these two international organizations, which meet the aspirations of the peoples of the third world.\n219.\tHowever, our State, as an integral part of the international community, cannot fail to express its concern at the flagrant violations of fundamental human rights, at the attempts to perpetuate anachronistic colonialist, racist and apartheid regimes, at acts of aggression, interference and violation of the territorial integrity of sovereign States and at subversive maneuvers aimed at overthrowing legitimately constituted Governments which endanger international peace and security.\n220.\tThe accession to independence of the former Portuguese colonies and the assumption of power by the national liberation movements which led to the establishment of the People's Republic of Angola, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Cape Verde-all this is not only a victory for the peoples of Africa and peace-loving and progressive forces in the world, but it is also a significant victory for the United Nations, where the fate of these peoples had been debated over a period of 20 years.\n221.\tThe beneficial consequence for Africa of the independence of these countries escapes no attentive observer. The independence of these countries has substantially changed the relations of force in the struggle against colonialism and racism in southern Africa.\n222.\tOnce apartheid's protective belt, Portuguese colonialism, was destroyed, the minority regimes in southern Africa saw in these anti-colonialist, anti-racist republics of Angola and Mozambique their closest enemies. Despite the important contribution made by the struggle of these peoples to the cause of the United Nations, we still witness acts of unquantifiable aggression by the unlawful Rhodesian regime and the racist regime in South Africa against the young republics of Angola and Mozambique.\n223.\tThose peoples which, like the Angolan people, after long years of cruel and bloody fighting, at the expense of untold suffering and sacrifices, at long last broke the shackles of slavery, exploitation, poverty and ignorance, deserve the respect and solidarity of all the nations inspired by the principles of the United Nations. For this reason we believe it is the duty of all the Members of this Organization to support whole-heartedly the application for admission of the People's Republic of Angola, which fulfills all the requirements for membership of the United Nations.\n224.\tIn Rhodesia, in Namibia, in South Africa, we continue to witness the maneuvers of the racist and apartheid regimes which, in a desperate attempt to stem the tide of history, seek to perpetuate systems that the international community, irrespective of political system or ideology, regards as obsolete and inhuman.\n225.\tIn our view, the solutions proposed by OAU and supported by the non-aligned movement are valid. All these solutions unmask and condemn attempts to undermine the true liberation of those peoples. By way of flagrant example, we have the pseudo-independence of Transkei, which is no more than one racist maneuver to divide the people of South Africa.\n226.\tWe are convinced that the desperate challenge launched by the racist regime of South Africa against Africa and the peace-loving and progressive forces, and which is reflected in the recrudescence of massacres against the defenseless population, that have aroused a wave of indignation throughout the world, will only strengthen, we are sure, the determination of the heroic people of South Africa to carry their struggle to final victory.\n227.\tWe associate ourselves with all those who appeal to the common sense of the Powers which obstinately insist on aiding that regime by financing means and by supplying war materials, including materials capable of being used for weapons of mass destruction.\n228.\tIn the Comoros, although that country has acceded to independence and been admitted to full membership in OAU, the non-aligned movement and the United Nations, we still witness the flagrant violation of the principle of territorial integrity, namely, the occupation of Mayotte, which has always been an integral part of that former colony.\n229.\tWith reference to Western Sahara, although this is a clear case of decolonization similar to so many others that we have witnessed on the African continent, we note an attempt by the administering Power to evade its responsibilities by concluding agreements that violate the sacred principle of self-determination and independence, and that might ultimately lead to the disappearance of Western Sahara as an entity.\n230.\tIn our view, the people of Western Sahara, like any other colonized people, are entitled to self-determination and independence. We believe that the Frente POLISARIO, which embodies the legitimate aspirations of the Saharan people, has the inalienable right to seek out the ways and means that will lead to true emancipation.\n231.\tAnother tragic situation, which has existed for so many years, still prevails in the Middle East. We reaffirm here our unconditional support of the Palestinian people in their struggle for the recovery of their usurped lands, and of the Arab countries who see a part of their territory unlawfully occupied by foreign forces. We also believe that the satisfaction of the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people is the key to the solution of the serious problem that still exists in the Middle East and dangerously threatens international peace and security.\n232.\tAny manoeuvre or arrangement aimed at disregarding the claims of the martyred people of Palestine, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, will simply prolong indefinitely and aggravate the problem. Our own experience has taught us that massacres, such as those now taking place in Lebanon, will never break the will or determination of the people or destroy a just cause.\n233.\tBy way of confirmation of the threat that hangs over the small countries and of the desire nurtured by many to restore the law of the strongest, we have the case of East Timor-a classical example of a colony occupied by foriegn forces in flagrant violation, again, of the sacred principles of self-determination and independence.\n234.\tWe have come here today to reaffirm solemnly our support of every just cause, and in particular of all national liberation struggles, the purpose of which is to liberate man from all forms of subjection. May we also reaffirm our readiness to support every effort in favor of disarmament, in particular the neutralization of weapons of mass destruction, for the benefit of peaceful coexistence, concord among nations and the utilization of the conquests of science and technology for the well-being and progress of man.\n235.\tWe shall continue to adhere to the principles of non-alignment, which advocate independence of action and thinking; the practice of a policy which serves peoples; the constant upholding of equality and fraternity among nations; non-aggression and non-interference; the inviolability of territorial integrity; and the consistent implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence, which guarantees to all States the right to devote themselves to primary tasks so as to achieve their economic independence by establishing the bases for progress. Thus, we shall always be open to frank co-operation with all the peoples and Governments of the world on the basis of mutual advantage and non-interference in internal affairs.\n236.\tThis determination will be our modest contribution to the process of instituting a new and more just and equitable economic and social order so that together, in the service of our respective peoples, we may be able to face the disasters still afflicting many parts of the world: poverty, hunger, ignorance, and social, cultural, scientific and technological backwardness.\n237.\tIn referring to these disasters, and having defined the position of the Republic of Cape Verde on the fundamental problems that concern our Organization, allow me to draw the attention of this Assembly to the difficult, not to say dramatic, economic and social situation besetting the people of Cape Verde at the present time, to which we shall be referring in greater detail in due time in the Second Committee.\n238.\tThe Cape Verde archipelago, which is situated in the well-known desert zone of the Sahel and which conquered its national independence a little more than one year ago, inherited from its long colonial past a precarious economic and social situation characterized fundamentally by a total lack of productive infrastructure.\n239.\tPeriodically, our country, subject to the whims of the weather and to haphazard and scarce rainfall, must face long periods of devastating drought, which bring famine and unemployment and sow consternation among the population. During the last two centuries of colonial domination-or, rather, between 1744 and 1974-Cape Verde had over half a century of acute famine, which took a toll estimated at more than 200,000 lives.\n240.\tSince 1968, Cape Verde has had eight consecutive years of drought, aggravated by the mass return of immigrants-in particular, from Angola.\n\n241.\tAlthough subject to the uncertainties of the weather, agriculture has always been, the main productive sector of the Cape Verde economy and the one providing the largest amount of employment for the active population.\n242.\tAs for industry, it is in the artisan stage and thus very shaky, being limited essentially to the mining of salt, the extraction of pozzolana and the small-scale processing of a small number of foodstuffs, especially those derived from fishing. According to provisional estimates for 1973 prepared by a mission of the Economic Commission for Africa, the industrial sector accounts for barely 6.47 per cent of gross domestic product.\n243.\tAn analysis of foreign trade reveals the precariousness and degree of dependency of the Cape Verde economy. It shows a substantial deficit, which has been exacerbated between 1966 and 1974 by the prolonged drought, leading to a heavy increase in imports of agricultural produce and the stagnation, or even decline, of exports.\n244.\tThus, in 1974, exports covered only 3.3 per cent of imports. It may reasonably be supposed that this percentage is currently of the same order of magnitude.\n245.\tIt should, further, be pointed out that imports of food-stuffs account for approximately 55 per cent of total imports.,\n246.\tPer capita gross domestic product in 1973 was $US 127, according to the estimates of the Economic Commission for Africa. Today, this figure can reasonably be estimated to be substantially lower, because of the prolonged drought, the increase in population brought about by strong demographic pressure and, especially, the mass return of emigrants.\n247.\tAs for public finance, the regular budget for 1976 shows a deficit representing 45 per cent of total expenditures. The investment budget is almost non-existent.\n248.\tAs a result of this especially difficult economic situation, the social situation is characterized by chronic unemployment affecting a sizable segment of the active population. Of the active population employed in 1970, 57,000 persons were doing assistance work for the victims of the drought, financed by the colonial authorities which were concerned by the possible repercussions on world public opinion of the announcement of drought victims. This kind of work, which had no precise national development objective, was suppressed when Cape Verde achieved independence, with gradual reconversion to more useful work such as the construction of dykes to channel water, the construction of infrastructure and the stockpiling of food-stuffs. The source of financing having been removed, the Government is in fact having great difficulty in: implementing this policy. As a result, the present unemployment rate (jobless and underemployed) is much higher* and must amount to about 75 per cent of the active population.\n249.\tWith the prospect of a bad harvest as a result of insufficient rainfall for 1976, the number of unemployed will increase considerably.\n250.\tConfronted with this situation, the President of the Republic, Aristides Pereira, spoke on national radio asking the people to prepare themselves to face vigorously a new crisis situation. Noting that as at 15 September, rainfall was almost nil in all the islands, President Pereira confirmed that the harvest for this year would be almost totally lost.\n251.\tPresident Pereira, a few days prior to the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], observed that, in fighting for independence, the PAIGC had been aware of the difficulties that the people of Cape Verde would have to face, deriving from the inclement natural elements and the consequences of the virtually complete abandonment of the islands by the colonial Power.\n252.\tDespite this initial handicap, President Aristides Pereira expressed his conviction that the people which, through its Party, the PAIGC, had already accepted 20 years of sacrifice, would take up the challenge of nature and create a prosperous Cape Verde no longer at the mercy of rainfall.\n253.\tPresident Aristides Pereira concluded his address by launching an appeal to the entire people of Cape Verde- workers, technicians, civil servants, peasants, emigrants and Party activists to carry out the emergency measures to be taken by the Government, so as once again to show world public opinion their capacity to work and accept sacrifice, which are the necessary conditions for the mobilization of international solidarity -a solidarity which, it is fully confident, will assist the people of Cape Verde to surmount this difficult emergency situation, which calls for a rapid and effective response by this august Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "May I, first of all, congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the Presidency of this year's General Assembly session and greet you as the representative of a friendly country.\n2.\tI should also like to express my appreciation for the useful work done by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in tirelessly fulfilling the tasks of our Organization.\n3.\tPermit me also to welcome among us a new Member- the Republic of Seychelles. We wish all success to its people on their road to free, independent development.\n4.\tWe firmly believe that already in the course of the present session of the General Assembly the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will become a Member of the United Nations. The historic contribution of that country to the strengthening of peace and security in South-East Asia is generally recognized. This new State which plays an important role in the affairs of the Asian continent meets all requirements of the Charter for United Nations membership in our Organization.\n5.\tWe are also convinced that justice will finally prevail in the matter of the admission to membership in the United Nations of the People's Republic of Angola. The admission to our Organization of that State would be the logical Consequence of the crushing defeat of colonialism and of all forces endeavoring to nip in the bud the progressive development of that country.\n6.\tEach historical period is evaluated according to its contribution to the progress of mankind and the fulfillment of the aspirations of peoples to be free and equal and to live and develop in peace and security. We should, therefore, exert every effort also here in the United Nations to make this period in which we live one which will earn the gratitude of succeeding generations the more so, because it is precisely our own generation, which has the honors of the Second World War deeply etched in its memory, that has already left as the heritage of our era the tremendous contribution of 30 years without another world war, and that has succeeded in improving the international atmosphere.\n7.\tAfter all, we have heard from this rostrum during the general debate a number of facts and examples which prove convincingly that the move from tension always fraught with the danger of explosion to detente and wide co-operation is being gradually effected in spite of all the pitfalls. These facts show, too, that new progress has been made in that respect during the year that has elapsed since the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n8.\tThat is how the recent Fifteenth. Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia evaluated the development of the present international situation. On the basis of & profound analysis the Congress has laid down a further program for the peaceful construction of our country as well as the line to be followed in our foreign policy, the basis of which is Lenin's policy of peace. As a solid part of the socialist community, Czechoslovakia has fully and whole-heartedly supported the program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples formulated in such clear terms by the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We are proud that, in close and fraternal collaboration with the States members of the Warsaw Treaty, we are actively taking part in the transformation of present international relations into relations of lasting peace and fruitful co-operation.\n9.\tThe people of our country have a vital interest in the implementation of that policy. That has been clearly attested once again, by the current preparations for the elections to the Federal Assembly and other representative bodies of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The broad masses of our population have convincingly manifested their support of the policy of peace, friendship and progress.\n\n10.\tWe have already been living for more than three decades in peaceful conditions. The realistic possibility of lasting peace for mankind is taking shape in face of all difficulties and problems which had to be overcome. That is how the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Gustav Husak, characterized the present international situation when he spoke at the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party. In his evaluation is reflected the firm belief of our people in the victory of the great struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence In the world waged for many years already by the countries of the socialist community and all progressive forces.\n11.\tThe Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has been described as the triumph of common sense, has, in our opinion, become a historical milestone in that positive development. The year which has elapsed since its conclusion fully bears out that assessment. The political climate in Europe has considerably improved. A broad dialogue has developed among States of that continent primarily in the political field. Central Europe, in the past always a hotbed of tension and conflicts, has now become a zone of detente. The very fact that the highest representatives of that part of Europe have met for the first time in half a century needs no further comment. And also ever-increasing numbers of people in Europe are beginning to realize that the policy of international detente represents the reality of our times, that it is the only sensible alternative in our nuclear age and that even the most complicated problems can be settled by negotiations and not by confrontation.\n12.\tEntente is a matter of such paramount importance that it cannot be the target of irresponsible attacks-even under the pretext of pre-election campaigns-on the part of its opponents, the advocates of the cold war. Therefore, we cannot be indifferent to the fact that those attacks are not being resisted everywhere with sufficient firmness. The policy of international detente is not a one-sided issue. The Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, signed on 1 August 1975, must be further implemented by all participants to its whole extent, fully and consistently, in the spirit Of that purposefulness which prevailed throughout the Conference.\n13.\tAs far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, we on our part have consistently applied the Final Act and are resolved to contribute and to continue contributing in the future to the full implementation of its principles and provisions. This is precisely the approach of the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to this historic document.\n14.\tWe are aware that the implementation of the Final Act by all signatories is not a single action but a process which needs a certain time. We think, however, that the time is ripe for the solution of questions reaching beyond the framework of bilateral relations. One of the most important of them is the normalization of commercial, economic, scientific and technological relations at the level of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community. It also could significantly assist in the solution of questions of co-operation in the field of the human environment, transport and energy at all-European conferences, as proposed by the Soviet Union.\n15.\tThe success of this policy in Europe can be a prominent encouragement for the whole world to follow the same road.\n16.\tThe road to peace, mutual understanding and mutually beneficial co-operation among countries with different social systems is neither easy nor short. However, it is the only way corresponding to the interests of peoples of all countries and the progress of all mankind, as was stressed by the Conference of European Communist and Workers' Parties held this June in the capital of the German Democratic Republic, Berlin.\n17.\tAs I have already stated, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is interested in the further broadening of mutual relations with countries having different social systems.\n18.\tAs far as our immediate neighbours are concerned \u2014the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria- much has been attained in this direction even if a lot remains yet to be done. A significant step forward has been made in our relations with France. We have relations of fruitful co-operation with Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Iceland, Portugal, Greece, Norway, Great Britain and Turkey, and we are interested in further broadening those relations. We should also like to point to the favorable development of our relations with Italy and Canada.\n19.\tThe normalization of our relations with the United States of America remains an unsettled question. We expect that the Government of the United States of America will finally sign the agreement concerning the legal question of property rights, which was already initialed in 1974, and will thus open up the way to the normalization of relations and the development of mutually advantageous cooperation between our two States.\n20.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always consistently supported the struggle of the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America for political independence and economic and social progress. The contribution of those countries to the common struggle for peace and security of nations is becoming increasingly manifest day by day. The policy of non-alignment has become a dynamic factor of international development directed against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and the oppression of peoples.\n21.\tWe( welcome the results of the recent Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo, which we consider a significant 'event of international life. The non-aligned movement has gained political prestige on the international stage and has significantly contributed to further detente and the strengthening of the principles of peaceful coexistence in international relations.\n22.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic supports efforts directed at giving effect to the idea of collective security in Asia, which would lead to a further improvement of the international situation. The establishment of peace in Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea has contributed to the stabilization of the situation in South-East Asia and has positively influenced the just struggle of all progressive forces in the world.\n23.\tWe will continue to widen and deepen the mutually beneficial multilateral co-operation with the countries of the Asian continent interested in such cooperation.\n24.\tAs in the past, Czechoslovakia stands side by side with the nations of Africa in their struggle against the criminal\npolicy of the racist regimes of the Republic of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. We demand the immediate liberation of Namibia and the handing over of all power to the people of Zimbabwe in their country without the attachment of any conditions. We categorically demand an end to the policy of racism and apartheid in the Republic of South Africa, where Vorster's regime has recently turned to the mass slaughter of patriots fighting for freedom and basic human rights.\n25.\tCzechoslovakia maintains good relations with the majority of independent African and Arab countries. We are resolved to continue with the developing and broadening of these relations for mutual benefit.\n26.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue actively to support the endeavors of the Latin American countries for the strengthening of their independence, the advancement of their struggle against imperialism and the strengthening of the principle of peaceful co-operation in international relations.\n27.\tWe wish to stress once again that we fully support the valiant struggle of the Chilean people against the criminal military junta and demand freedom for Luis Corvalan and all Chilean patriots. Together with all progressive people, we are indignant at the junta's continuous disregard of the United Nations appeals and its unceasing campaign of terror against the democratic forces which it spreads even beyond the borders of Chile.\n28.\tThe positive development now taking place in the world would certainly be given further impetus if it proved possible to eliminate all existing hotbeds of war and tension.\n29.\tAt the present time our task is to end the protracted conflict in the Middle East. A political settlement of the conflict can be attained there only on the basis of the three interconnected principles: the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; the granting of the legitimate national demands of the Arab people of Palestine, including their inalienable right to establish their own State; international guarantees for the security of all States in the Middle East and their right to an independent existence and development. It is quite logical and fully confirmed by past developments that the over-all political settlement on the basis of those principles can be achieved only in the appropriate forum, namely, at the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, the work of which should be resumed with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n30.\tWe are deeply alarmed by the tragic events in - Lebanon. We believe that the situation .there should be resolved as soon as possible by peaceful means and by the Lebanese people themselves with the unconditional preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon.\n31.\tWe also fully support a just solution of the problem of Cyprus as called for by the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, namely, on the basis of a reasonable consideration of the interests and rights of both national communities and with complete respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and the policy of non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.\n32.\tWe support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve a peaceful unification of the country without any outside interference. The withdrawal of the foreign troops from South Korea is one of the cardinal tasks involved in ridding the Korean peninsula of the remnants of the cold war. The resolution on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, adopted by the last General Assembly [resolution 3390 B (XXX)], should be implemented.\n33.\tThe Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic wishes to do everything in its power to see to it that the process of detente be also extended into the military sphere.\n34.\tWe often hear that it is first necessary, by concrete steps, to create an atmosphere of trust among States. We are convinced that at this session of the General Assembly we have a great opportunity to do precisely that, thanks to the proposal for the adoption of a world treaty on She non-use of force in international relations submitted here on behalf of the Soviet Union by its Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko [A/31I243]. Czechoslovakia whole-heartedly supports that proposal, which is entirely in keeping with the needs and goals of our Organization. After all, this is a matter of giving effect to the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter, something; which would reduce the danger of the outbreak of new wars and promote a restructuring of international relations on a peaceful basis. Approval of this proposal by the international community would do much to strengthen trust among States and would without doubt also provide an incentive for further movement forwards in the field of disarmament.\n35.\tIndeed, military detente is necessary and must be brought to the level of political detente. We are actively attempting to see to it that nations are freed from the heavy burden of the arms race, which adversely affects their economic and social development. Countless hundreds of billions now being spent on armaments could well serve more noble purposes. We are striving for a curbing of the arms race, for reducing of accumulated stockpiles and for disarmament.\n36.\tRegarding general disarmament as a final goal that would turn such concepts as armaments, weapons and armies into anachronisms. Czechoslovakia is, at the same time, striving to achieve any partial progress which might be possible in the field of disarmament. Much has already been done in this regard. The results of the work of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament this year have given us good grounds for hoping that existing agreements on disarmament will be supplemented at the current session of the General Assembly by a convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment for military or other hostile purposes.\n37.\tThere is a proposal that has been before the Assembly for a number of years now which, if it were put into effect, would produce considerable progress in disarmament efforts. I refer to the World Disarmament Conference, which in the past has been favored by an overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. Indeed it is appropriate to ask, What are we waiting for? The results of such a conference on disarmament and accordingly on the strengthening of peace could have only beneficial results. Why not seize this opportunity? Specific steps should be taken to work out the agenda of the conference, and to come to agreement on its timing, and possibly, if this is considered advisable, a special session of the General Assembly might be convened as an interim stage in preparing for the conference.\n38.\tConsiderable progress in disarmament efforts would undoubtedly be made through the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. Talks on this subject have already been held by experts in Geneva. Can there be any doubt whatsoever about the advantages of the adoption of the proposal on the total prohibition of nuclear weapons tests everywhere and by everyone? The adoption of the proposal for the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests submitted by the socialist countries, one of the sponsors of which was the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic,  would certainly promote the adoption of measures for the reduction and ultimately the complete prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons. However, all the countries that possess nuclear weapons must show, without exception, that they are genuinely ready to join in this work. Nuclear disarmament is of such vast importance and is so urgent that it can be resolved only by common effort. We welcome the fact that an increasing number of States are acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII), annex]. In our view the Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States on 28 May 1976 strengthens hopes for the possibility of using nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes.\n39.\tFor many years now, within the United Nations, we have been trying to achieve the prohibition of chemical weapons. Czechoslovakia was a sponsor of the draft convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of such weapons submitted by the socialist countries at the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament as far back as 1972.2 We associate ourselves with the proposals of the Soviet Union to introduce the practice of systematic reduction of military expenditures and are ready at any time to participate in preparing a concrete agreement. We also attach great importance to the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world. In 1974, therefore, we actively supported the proposal of Finland for the study of that question.  Further negotiations on nuclear-free zones would help to open up prospects for the creation of such zones.\n40.\tTo be brief, there is a whole range of concrete proposals which must be put into effect and which we hope would lead, in the near future, to further agreements and measures on disarmament. If we wish to achieve our goals, we should not bury these problems in complicated procedural issues, in lengthy discussions on what, how, when and why we conduct negotiations, because as a result the main issue-the achievement of specific agreement-may be relegated to the background.\n41.\tSo-called global measures in the field of disarmament, which I have already mentioned, are now being supplemented by endeavors to reduce armed forces and armaments on the regional scale. I have in mind in particular the talks now proceeding in Vienna among representatives of 19 countries on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. We strongly desire the success of these talks and, as direct participants, are making every effort in this direction. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, like other countries signatories to the Warsaw Treaty, has supplied the Western countries with data and figures on the total strength of the armed forces deployed in the reduction zone. This realistic and constructive approach, however, should be forthcoming not only from the socialist countries but also from their Western partners. Only thus shall we witness the triumph, in Vienna, of the principle that reductions should not give one-sided military advantages to any one of the participating countries. It is only by this approach that we shall achieve agreement.\n42.\tThe Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Re-public is doing its utmost to contribute to implementing detente in practice also by deepening mutually beneficial co-operation between countries, regardless of their social systems or levels of economic development. We support the establishment of a new international economic order and the introduction of progressive changes directed at the speedy elimination of the heritage of colonialism in the developing countries. We are therefore striving for a just participation of all countries in the international division of labour among all countries, for the development of relations of equality among States and for the removal of obstacles in the way of such development. We favor the equal participation of all countries in the solution of important international economic questions. We fully support the right of every State freely to choose freely its economic and social system and to exercise sovereignty over its own natural and material resources. These are the principles upon which the ever broadening relations between the socialist States and the developing countries are being built.\n43.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, which is peace-fully building up its economy, is directly interested in the development of an international division of labour. We would like to see the expansion of trade, economic, scientific and technological relations with all countries which are ready to co-operate with us on the basis of equality among partners, non-intervention in internal affairs, mutual advantage and non-discrimination.\n44.\tIn our desire to live in lasting peace and develop peaceful endeavors, we place considerable hope in our Organization. As one of the founding Members of the United Nations, Czechoslovakia considers itself in duty bound to make a constructive contribution to the fulfillment of the Organization's noble mission. In the three decades of post-war development, the United Nations Charter has successfully stood the test of time as an international legal document of paramount importance and at the same time remains an important reminder of the lessons of the Second World War. We shall therefore continue to strive for the strengthening of the United Nations, for the enhancement of its effectiveness in the struggle for world peace and security, and for the development of co-operation and mutual understanding among nations on the basis of consistent and strict respect for the aims and principles of the Charter.\n45.\tIt is a principle of dialectics, which we take as our guide, that there is nothing and can be nothing that does not change: everything is in motion. The task of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly, then, is to do its utmost to ensure that this dialectic dynamism, in spite of all diversity and contradictions, develops in a direction beneficial to mankind: towards the strengthening of peace and international co-operation and towards mobilizing and harnessing the powers of all nations for their comprehensive development and well-being.\n"

Mr. Amerasinghe's reputation of skillful diplomat because he has raised in the house, his great qualities of mind and heart, his competence and perfect knowledge of the difficult problems which our modern world is confronted with, are a guarantee for us of the harmonious unfolding of our debates, and of the success of our undertaking.\n3.\tComing from Sri Lanka, a smiling and hospitable country situated in a continent with age-old virtues of tolerance, wisdom and equanimity, he will beyond any doubt, lead the work of the thirty-first session to a successful conclusion. My delegation is likewise pleased to see Mr. Amerasinghe acceding to the post of President of our session as he is one of the best sons of a country which has consistently and vigilantly set itself up as the primary defender of the interests of the third world. He may fully count upon the co-operation of my delegation in the fulfillment of the important tasks that have been entrusted to him.\n4.\tThe congratulations of the Togolese delegation are likewise addressed to the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, who with considerable mastery and competence was able to conduct also to a successful conclusion the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n5.\tLastly, it is with pleasure that I fulfill one of the primary duties that I have assigned to myself as new Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Togolese Republic, that of paying a tribute on behalf of the President of the Togolese Republic, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, of his Government and of his great party of the national union, the Rassemblement du peuple togolais, to our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the remarkable work he has accomplished at the head of our Organization. And we would wish warmly to congratulate him for the persistent action that he has consistently taken and for the brilliant successes that he has achieved in the particularly difficult and delicate circumstances in which he had to carry them out. An indefatigable messenger of peace, a courageous defender of the fundamental principles of our Charter and in particular of the essential principle of the right to self-determination, the Secretary-General has given a positive impetus and a realistic direction to the events of a world in transition. My Government considers that Mr. Kurt Waldheim is greatly deserving in the eyes of the international community as a whole, and more specifically in the eyes of the developing countries for his courageous decisions and his appropriate interventions.\n6.\tLastly, I would certainly be remiss if I did not hail, on behalf of my Government and the people of Togo, the memory of chairman Mao Tsetung, who had led, by his efforts and dignity, the great and noble people of China towards development and well-being.\n\n7.\tThe numerous and complex problems which trouble our world and which affect the future of each one of our States, bring out once again the common nature of the destiny of our peoples and their inexorable interdependence. Accordingly, it is the duty of all Governments to seek clear solutions to these problems which guarantee the legitimate interest of all concerned, and this is an essential condition for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n8.\tThe world of today is dominated by anguish and fear: is this not a truism? The very survival of the human species beet with its own contradictions is clearly at stake: is this not another evident truth? That there should exist a world-wide series of problems today standing before us in the full glare of their brutality and their despair: who would deny this?\n9.\tBut that suddenly, beyond the gropings and oblique pathways, false processes and uncertain actions, there should appear a strong and clear will with a definite sense of direction and grandeur which tries to achieve a complete and radical mastery of the problems that arise, is by no means evident, and mankind therefore continues to stumble along toward an uncertain future. It is for us, however, within the framework of our Organization, which has been so badly criticized but which is so necessary, to raise hope and to shatter fear. It is for us to act in order to prevent the perverse effects which are corroding our dichotomous world, which is bogged down in unprecedented crisis-a political crisis, an economic crisis, a moral crisis and a social crisis, all these calamities having been made possible because the cardinal principles of the United Nations Charter have been lost sight of. And yet hope must be maintained to be able to dominate the apparent anathema that the present society seems to be under, if indeed we wish by our thinking and actions to benefit mankind.\n10.\tIt was written that the world has been suffering from a cancer, and that cancer is man. This is an accurate statement in one sense, but man has this fundamental and comforting ambivalence that he is both the sickness and the remedy. And it is around him and by him that our problems will be solved and our anguish dispelled. It is -in this sense that I shall bring before you the views of the Togolese Government on the problems which are confronting our sorely tried mankind.\n11.\tMost of the critical situations that the present world is facing are at an impasse, and the recent rays of hope that have appeared here and there cannot make us overlook the extent of the anguish and the gravity of problems which arise. This applies to respect for human rights and decolonization.\n12.\tIn Namibia the illegal occupation by the racist minority regime of South Africa persists in spite of the frequently expressed censure of the international community, just as the perfidious intention to violate the national unity and territorial integrity of this country by Balkanizing it through the establishment of false national homelands continues. We can do no less than condemn firmly this policy of division and continuous occupation and call for its immediate cessation, with the transfer of powers to the Namibian people under the direction of the South West African People's Organization fSWAPOJ, the only authentic representative recognized by our Organization. The recent change noticed in this part of the world cannot make us overlook the fact that normally, at this, very moment, Namibia should have already gained its independence and all other rights of a sovereign State.\n13.\tRespect for man requires always, here as elsewhere, the primary duty that we insist upon the application of decisions taken earlier by our Organization.\n14.\tIn the Republic of South Africa the tragedy which was smoldering under the ashes for a long time has suddenly broken out into the open. By not meditating profoundly on the lessons of history, by not integrating in their conscience and in their acts the eloquent and flagrant facts involved, by attempting to ignore reality-the most elementary manifestation of which is that man is man regardless of the color of his skin-the white minority, stubbornly retrenched upon the odious principle of apartheid and its accursed off-shoot \\\"bantustanization\\\" which deceives no one, and scornful of general reprobation, has unleashed an irreversible process having incalculable consequences. The revolt of the students and pupils and the strikes of the workers of the ghettos-clear manifestations of opposition to the defiling policy of racial segregation are in turn repressed by bloody massacres, arbitrary arrests and summary sentences.\n15.\tAt a time when Mr. Vorster has embarked upon diplomatic negotiations on the future of Namibia and Zimbabwe, perhaps he should simply be reminded of the fact that the horror is on his own doorstep and that the liberation movements supported by the courageous people of Azaraia will vanquish, sooner or later, peacefully or otherwise, for the honor and the dignity of the black man, nay, of man!\n16.\tIn Zimbabwe, there is reason for hope. After years of stubborn struggle the populations and the liberation movements supported by peace-loving States, in particular those on the front line, to which deserved tribute must be paid, have driven the Ian Smith regime to its last line of defense. Today international diplomacy has taken up the question and seems to be trying to resolve a problem which was already half solved. For us there remains vigilance, a vigilance that must be maintained all the time, so that Africa should not be deprived of its victory, its very own victory. The liberation movements must maintain this unity, indeed their perseverance, so that tomorrow an independent and prosperous Zimbabwe may be built up in peace and concord.\n17.\tAn objective analysis of the problems which prevail in these three Territories leads us to affirm that the persistence in perversity that one sees there is encouraged by certain States Members of the United Nations which, as they place their selfish and immediate interests above their international obligations, are not applying the sanctions enacted by our Organization against the racist regimes of southern Africa. Indeed, as part of strengthened cooperation, these regimes have constantly received from these countries increased aid in the military, economic, commercial, financial, cultural and social fields. If it were not for this deliberately continued co-operation, the Republic of South Africa would have been unable to be in the first rank of the world's economic and military Powers, thereby becoming a perpetual threat to the front-line countries and to the African continent as a whole.\n18.\tThe international community is duty bound fully to assume its responsibilities in the face of this explosive situation. It has the duty to help to bring back detente and to restore peace and security to this part of the world. This, in particular, requires the unequivocal condemnation of the racist regimes of southern Africa, the effective application by all countries of the sanctions imposed upon those regimes, a strengthening of support and an increase in the aid to liberation movements. And here the Togolese delegation is pleased to hail warmly the courageous decision taken by the People's Republic of Mozambique to apply, unreservedly and at the cost of considerable sacrifices, the sanctions that have been imposed upon Rhodesia by our Organization.\n19.\tIn the case of the Territory of the Afars and the Issas we would invite the Administering Power to give unconditional and genuine independence to the people of this country which, like all others, is entitled to liberty, equality and fraternity.\n20.\tThe same holds true of the Comoros, where the national unity of this country must be respected by the return of the island of Mayotte to the original fold.\n21.\tIt is unfortunate to observe that in Western Sahara no progress has been recorded as far as the application of the principle of self-determination, solemnly adopted at our last session [resolution 3458A (XXX)], is concerned. Quite the contrary: the situation has become more serious as a result of serious misunderstandings. There is no need to say that the international community must thwart this threat to peace and to security in this subregion of the African continent.\n22.\tThe same impasse that we referred to earlier characterizes in the same way the crises that are taking place in other parts of the world. Here as elsewhere it is as a result of failing to apply the principles of equity, solidarity, and even political courage, however painful it may be, that we now have to go through difficulties and suffering.\n23.\tIn the Middle East it has become obvious to the international community that a just and lasting peace is possible only if it is founded upon the withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories and upon the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and, in particular, its right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State. As in the past my country will continue to give its total support to the Palestinian people in its long and heroic struggle. The same support likewise goes to the brother Arab countries which are sparing no effort to recover their occupied territories. We ask the international community once again to persevere in its efforts so that on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council, a just and equitable solution to the crisis should be found, as the sine qua non for the re-establishment of genuine peace in this region.\n24.\tThere is no need to cover one's face, throwing Noah's cloak over a situation which the Lebanese crisis barely covers. Under the ashes, deep below, trouble is brewing in the Middle East. We must have courage in order to tackle it and overcome it, for tomorrow it may be too late.\n25.\tIn Lebanon, indeed, a lethal civil war continues in the country, threatening the total extermination of a people which was formerly happy and prosperous. I should like to express here the great distress which my country feels before this devastating war, in which none of the factions in conflict has anything to gain.\n26.\tWe appeal to the belligerents to conclude an immediate cease-fire and to get together with a view to working out a solution which would take account of Lebanon's national unity, territorial integrity and independence.\n27.\tLebanon is suffering martyrdom in silence and virtually total helplessness, It is paying the price-and what price it is! -for the inability of the international community to perform radical surgery and to vanquish in justice.\n28.\tIn Cyprus we are witnessing an aggravation of the crisis which this country has been going through for a number of years as a result of outright foreign interference. Only the cessation of this unacceptable interference and a heightened awareness by the two Cypriot communities that they belong to the same nation will make it possible to open negotiations in accordance with resolutions 3219 (XXIX) of the General Assembly and 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) of the Security Council.\n29.\tLastly, my delegation cannot pass over in silence the disturbing problem of the divided Korean people and the increase in tension prevailing in this part of the world. In the opinion of my Government the resolution of the Korean tragedy resides in the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops stationed there under the United Nations Command and the substitution for the armistice cf a peace treaty between the parties concerned. It is only on this condition and at this price that it will be possible for the Korean people to succeed in achieving peaceful reunification in accordance with the North/South joint communique of 4 July 1972. \n30.\tInequity and injustice cannot be used as a foundation for a solid and durable political order. We have constantly stated this and we have been proclaiming it ceaselessly. It will therefore be desirable for these vices to be banished from our Organization itself, namely, the United Nations, where the process of decolonization, which has been started here and there must continue. To decolonize the United Nations is to bring about the suppression and the abolition, pure and simple, of the right of veto. The right of veto, understandable 30 years ago, today is perfectly unjustified and in practice disastrous. The use made of it by nations having it opens the way to all sorts of anomalies, the most evident and most recent of which is the blocking of the admission to the United Nations of the sister Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\n31.\tThe courageous and valiant People's Republic of Angola, victorious and triumphant, and heroic and gallant Viet Nam have deserved better from the international community than a blunt rejection. Who would deny this.\n32.\tThus in the field of pure politics we come up against our own contradictions, incapable of mastering the forces which, like Prometheus or the sorcerer's apprentice, we unleash by our actions or, sometimes, by our deliberate refused to act. And yet in the economic field great hopes have been engendered and great designs have been outlined.\nThe world has embarked upon a fundamental re-examination of its structures under the pressure of events and the brutal eloquence of facts. It has become clear to all that, as has been said, upon the urgent transformation of the world economic structure, upon the awareness of the countries, depends the progress and the liberation of the great under-developed world, through collaboration based on solidarity, justice and respect for human rights, whereas, otherwise, they will be drawn along upon the path of conflict, violence and suffering, precisely for the purpose of ensuring respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n33.\tThus, it is always man who is involved, here as. elsewhere-man and his inalienable rights and, above all, his primary freedom, that which frees him from poverty, famine and ignorance. But what has the international community done in this respect?\n34.\tSince the world has become aware of the dichotomy which prevails within it, the great gap which separates the rich North from the poor South and the dangers which may result from such a perilous situation, aggravated by an unprecedented economic crisis, the new international economic order has become a primary theme for reflection, if not an ardent stimulus to action.\n35.\tBorn, of the unprecedented crisis which has shaken the world economy over the past few years and the solution of which has not yet been found, it is to be feared that the new economic order might only be an illusion, an ephemera, which the restoration of the situation in the rich countries might doom to failure.\n36.\tIndeed, since the poor countries asked and obtained the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which in May of 1974 adopted a historic resolution on the establishment of a new international economic order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)J based upon equity, equality, sovereignty, interdependence and co-operation between all States and since the resolution of the seventh special session [resolution 3362(S-VII)J which developed the conclusions of the sixth special session and has given a context for the application of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], since then little progress has been made towards the search for and promotion of a new, because more just and fraternal, world.\n37.\tIf inflation is being gradually mastered in particular in the \\\"have\\\" countries, and if expansion is again possible there, the developing countries are still subjected to the rigors of an extremely difficult situation. The problems of balances of payments are as critical in this area as before. The deficit in this field and for developing countries in 1975 (more than $40 billion) would, according to certain estimates, rise to about $112 billion by 1980 if the present trends were to continue. This is a difficult situation on the economic plane and on the monetary plane. The reform of the international monetary system is to be revised or simply cast anew. The machinery adopted for the adjustment of the exchange rate is iniquitous and defective. The expected co-operation by the central banks to ensure the stability of the system has never operated properly. The interests of the poor countries are more than ever neglected. Proof of this is that the trust fund devised to ensure transfers of means of payment to the countries of the third world has its resources constantly decreased owing to the fluctuations in the price of gold as a result of the recent decisions of the International Monetary Fund. The trust fund-a futile successor of the mechanism linking special drawing rights and the resources for development requested by the poor countries-has not lasted long.\n38.\tIn the meantime the fifth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association, which was to reach $9 billion in the next period of three years, is very much behind while the capital of the World Bank is decreasing.\n39.\tTherefore, bilateral and multilateral aid is winding down, whereas the countries of the world and particularly the richest ones are devoting $300 billion on armaments.\n40.\tIt is in this context that we have to consider the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ held in Nairobi in May of this year. On that occasion the developing countries presented a clear and realistic program which they had agreed together at Manila.\n41.\tThe Togolese Government is firmly convinced that the integrated program for commodities as proposed by the Group of 77 at the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi, with as its central machinery the establishment of a common fund for the financing of buffer stocks, is the fundamental element of any solution to the problem of commodities. My Government supports without qualification the establishment of the common fund and is ready to contribute to it in accordance with the criteria that will be defined for this purpose.\n42.\tThe proposals decided by the poor countries at Nairobi also converged upon a point which has today become highly disquieting, that of the debt of the nations in the third world. The Togolese Government supports strongly the position of the developing countries regarding the cancellation of the public debt by the rich countries for the benefit of the least developed among the poor countries, and hopes that a moratorium will be studied in favor of the same countries with respect to the private debt.\n43.\tIn fact, at Nairobi the poor countries have clearly shown that they insisted in the name of their dignity as free men, that they were more in favor of justice and equity than in favor of charity or assistance, and these are the same goals which guide those among them who in our behalf are participating in the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which is called the North- South dialog. At a time when everything seems to be bogged down, the North-South dialog has brought about hope. May this hope materialize in a positive fashion, because wherever men of goodwill can help solve the problem of our times, dispel anguish and establish solidarity, boldness must be displayed in order that our humanity might be usefully served.\n44.\tBut who will fail to understand the impatience of our countries? We have awaited for a long time for solutions to our common problems; we have long hoped that human solidarity would be a reality. Today we no longer wait; we act and we shall act on our own aid for ourselves in order to establish a horizontal co-operation, a sort of southeast- southwest dialog centered upon self-reliance, both individual and collective, for the genuine independence of our States, namely economic independence. But we shall do this while remaining open to dialog, consultation and collaboration.\n45.\tIt is this faith which has constantly inspired the President of Togo General Gnassingbe Eyadema, the apostle of fraternal co-operation between peoples. It is also this faith which has guided the States of the subregion of western Africa and established the Economic Community of West African States, breaking through the linguistic barriers which were a legacy of colonialization. The Economic Community of West African States will tomorrow be the profound foundation of the harmonious development of the countries of this part of the African continent.\n46.\tMen are sometimes masters of their fate. Is this not comforting that we are not \\\"determined\\\" or \\\"predestined,\\\" that we have indeed the choice, even that to conform to this precept of a political man who thought he knew well and who said that there is no serious problem so serious that an absence of a solution cannot resolve it. But can we do nothing when the freedom of the peoples is at hand, a freedom which can no longer be fed on ephemeral hopes? Are we going to remain inactive when we have to remain faithful to the history of humanity, which is nothing but the continued passage from the state of necessity to the state of freedom and therefore of dignity?\n47.\tWe shall succeed, because man is involved and because a defeat \\\"caveant consules!\\\" would be catastrophic. We shall succeed because the stakes are fundamental, difficult but exalting. Is it not true that we are of the divine race and have the power to create? Therefore we can and shall hope.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me first of all to convey to you the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on your election as President of this General Assembly. We wish you every success in the discharge of your high office and assure you of our support and co-operation.\n54.\tTo our outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, we take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his energetic efforts in presiding over the last Assembly.\n55.\tWe should also like to take this opportunity to extend to the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles a very warm welcome to our Organization.\n56.\tAt the same time, we regret that our friendly neighbor, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has not yet been able to send a delegation to participate in the work of the General Assembly. The consistent view of our Government is that each application for membership should be decided strictly on its merits in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations. Since last year, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has clearly established itself as a reunified nation of national independence with a Government exercising effective control over the entire country. Clearly it is entitled as of right to be represented in the United Nations according to the principle of universality of this Organization and on the same basis as every other Member State. The delegation of Burma looks forward to welcoming soon the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam into our family of nations.\n57.\tLikewise, we very much regret that the People's Republic of Angola which has been accorded de jure recognition by more than two thirds of the States Members of the United Nations is still denied admission to our world Organization. This is contrary both to the spirit of the United Nations Charter and to the principle of universality.\n58.\tThe addition of each new Member implies the growth of this world forum in both strength and stature. It also implies the Organization's continuing validity and efficacy. Despite its short-comings and despite its apparent inability to make an impact on some of the most vital issues facing the world today, the United Nations remains a basic necessity of our times and the best hope of mankind.\n59.\tIn recent years, the tendency of the great Powers to have recourse to negotiations, dialog and contact in the search for political solutions to their differences has resulted in the relaxation of tensions among them and has been instrumental in giving a positive direction to their relations. The fact remains that this is chiefly a bilateral process based on mutual interest and security. It cannot be meaningful for other countries unless the same great Powers limit their involvement in the areas of the world where their competing interests tend to interpose.\n60.\tPeace and security are indivisible. It is important to stress here that in the closely linked world of today, peace and security cannot be confined only to a few Powers. It is our fervent hope that it will be equally possible for other parts of the world to benefit from the favorable trends in great Power relations, so as to achieve the greatest possible spread of peace and security.\n61.\tThe longstanding areas of crisis in southern Africa, the Middle East and the Korean peninsula, continue to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Over the past 30 years, the General Assembly has been preoccupied with many of the problems of these crisis areas. Yet there is no discernible prospect of fruitful advance towards their resolution. Today, the situation in these areas is marked by acute tensions. The issues have become more intense and complicated than ever as time and history overtake events.\n62.\tWe meet at a time of grave forebodings in southern Africa. Dark clouds of war hover menacingly as the people of the region mobilize for armed struggle to liquidate colonialism, racism and racial discrimination. The collective efforts of the United Nations to assure the peaceful fulfillment of the aspirations of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa have long been up against the solid wall of open defiance by the minority regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa.\n63.\tSouth Africa persists in its intransigence by continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia, as well as by its unabated policy of apartheid, in defiance of countless resolutions of the United Nations. In Zimbabwe, the situation has been escalating rapidly with the intensification of the armed struggle against minority oppression. There is now a belated recognition by the illegal regime of the principle of majority rule. The situation is, however, still extremely tenuous and would require greater efforts to ensure a transition from the threat of war to prospects of a peaceful solution.\n64.\tIf the minority regimes are to be induced to change their course, this can be accomplished only through united action on the part of the international community to dispel such illusions in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n65.\tSo long as the Korean problem eludes settlement, it will remain a source of world tension. Burma regards the joint North-South communique of 4 July 1972  as an act of statesmanship opening the door to dialog to facilitate conditions for a peaceful solution of the Korean problem. Given the spirit which moved Korean statesmen to agree on the three principles of the joint communique, may we be permitted to express the hope that they will overcome their present differences and prove equal to the commitment to seek national unity and the peaceful reunification of Korea. It is our view that the Korean people themselves should work out, without any outside interference, acceptable positions that could be adopted as a basis for eventual reunification. It also stands to reason that any process directed towards resolving the Korean problem must involve the active participation of both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.\n66.\tThe crisis in the Middle East continues to command world attention. The situation there has, in fact, become more confused and complex with recent happenings in Lebanon. The lack of a lasting and permanent homeland for the Palestinian people is the underlying cause of the problems of the Middle East. The basic prerequisite for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region is obvious: it is the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish their own State. It is also clear that the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all States in the region and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized borders cannot be ignored and must be respected.\n67.\tBurma is, in principle, opposed to any territorial acquisition by war. We consider the rectification of the problem of the Israeli occupation of Arab lands of 5 June 1967 to be of the utmost importance.\n68.\tAllow me to turn briefly to the region in which my country is situated. The end of the war in Kampuchea, Viet Nam and Laos last year was highly welcome in South-East Asia. It was a great relief to the region, which had not known peace and tranquility since the beginning of the Second World War. Now, after 30 long years of arduous struggle by its people, Viet Nam has emerged as a reunified nation. Kampuchea and Laos are also proud to stand once again as united independent nations.\n69.\tAs a result, the whole region is undergoing a process of far-reaching political, economic and social change and, of late, there have emerged trends towards establishing new relationships among the countries in the area. There is a growing awareness among these countries that they themselves have to play an increasing role in creating conditions under which peace and security can be maintained, and co-operation for economic and social advancement promoted. We view these positive factors as providing the countries of the region with an opportunity to work together for their common objectives of safeguarding national independence and promoting peace and social progress.\n70.\tLet me now turn to another area in which resolute and co-ordinated international action is urgently required. For over 30 years now, the world has been concerned with the problem of disarmament, but nations are engaged in rearmament. Indeed rearmament has been pursued so ruthlessly that, over the past decade alone, world military expenditures have more than doubled to the staggering annual rate of $US 300 billion at constant prices. What is perhaps even more alarming is that an end to this escalation of military spending is nowhere yet in sight. Along with military expenditures, military arsenals-particularly those of the major armed Powers are continuing to grow unchecked in size and in diversity. New and even deadlier weapons systems are being developed. Massive arms transfers are taking place on an unprecedented scale. In short, the uncontrolled arms race is threatening to become uncontrollable.\n71.\tTo quote the words of our Secretary-General \\\"in a world increasingly preoccupied with the problems of social justice, hunger, poverty, illiteracy, disease, development and an equitable sharing of resources\\\", in this situation, such continued diversion to armaments of creative human energies and productive resources on a colossal and ever- increasing scale is both tragic and intolerable while keeping the world in a constant state of insecurity and tension.\n72.\tMy delegation cannot fail to stress that the ominous implications of nuclear weapons continue to impinge upon our lives. No progress has been made in nuclear disarmament despite the priority assigned to it in negotiations for the goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. Nuclear testing continues. At the same time, ever newer and deadlier types of nuclear weapons and systems are being devised and produced. The number of nations possessing technological capability to produce nuclear explosives has increased and the possibility of its misuse is becoming a matter of grave concern.\n73.\tThe armaments race has thus become one of the greatest scourges of humanity, and failure to act wisely and effectively at this juncture in order to halt and reverse it is bound to confront the world with an unpleasant and irreversible reality.\n74.\tThat is why my delegation would urge the General Assembly to give due consideration to the call made by the\nrecent Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo, for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament as early as possible and not later than \\91S [see A/31/197, annex I, para. 139]. A special session will not only focus the attention of international public opinion on this age-old and pressing problem, but will also enable Governments to explore and devise ways and means whereby our common goal of universal disarmament can be pursued more methodically and with a greater sense of purpose and direction in the decades ahead than in decades past. My delegation is most gratified that our distinguished Secretary-General has lent his valuable support to the proposal of ' the non-aligned nations.\n75. We have often stated in the General Assembly that Burma strongly favors the governing of the oceans and their uses by generally acceptable and universally applicable rules of international law, elaborated through multilateral dialog and consensus. We have stated that if multilateral dialog should fail, or become unduly protracted, necessity would compel nations to resort to unilateral action in establishing national maritime zones along their coasts. This is precisely what is happening now in various parts of the world, including our own.\n76.\tAs some of my colleagues present here are probably aware, the Prime Minister of Burma in his report to the Pyithu Hluttaw (Parliament) on 10 March 1975, stated that arrangements were under way to establish Burma's exclusive economic, zone at 200 miles. Till now we have kept faith with the negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. However, faced with the prospect of even further protraction of those negotiations, we in Burma consider that the time has now arrived for us to judge what measures are needed to protect our national maritime interests and act accordingly. We must, however, hasten to add that the historic international effort to elaborate a new convention on the law of the sea has not been an exercise in futility. It can fairly be said that, as a result of the Third Conference, new legal concepts have already emerged as principles and rules of international maritime law which will provide a sound and viable basis for inter-State relations with respect to the sea.\n77.\tI would now like to say a few words on the state of the international economy. As the representatives present here are fully aware, one of the basic aims of the United Nations is to promote social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom and, towards this end, to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.\n78.\tTo what extent has this objective been achieved? Over the past three decades, numerous consultations have indeed been held both within and outside the United Nations with a view to resolving the economic problems facing the world today. As a result of these consultations, many important issues have been clarified and useful approaches to the solution of the problems involved have also been identified. The large number of resolutions adopted and recommendations made, particularly the recommendations contained in the International Development Strategy, testify to this.\npeoples. The reason for this state of affairs is that these resolutions and recommendations, like many resolutions on political issues, have largely remained unimplemented.\n80.\tIn recent years, the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the fourth session of UNCTAD, and the recently concluded Colombo Conference of non-aligned countries have highlighted the tasks ahead. It is imperative that the international community address itself urgently and resolutely to these tasks if any appreciable progress is to be made towards the achievement of the objective set out in the Charter of the United Nations.\n81.\tThe resolutions and decisions taken at various United Nations forums have not had the political impact we had hoped for. This should not, however; make us lose sight of the useful work the United Nations and its agencies are performing in the economic and social field. In this regard, we are glad to note that the activities that the regional commissions, the specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies have undertaken in support of the development effort of many developing countries have met with a considerable degree of success.\n82.\tObviously, we are in favor of increasing the effectiveness of this role of the United Nations. We therefore welcome the present attempt to restructure the United Nations and to make it a more effective instrument for economic development and international co-operation.\n83.\tI have so far dealt with the problem of economic development and social progress in the international context. This is because in our increasingly integrated world, the interdependence of the interests and well-being of developed and developing countries is a factor of growing significance.\n84. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that, although a favorable international setting can be conducive to promoting economic progress, the main effort for development must be made by the developing countries themselves. International assistance and co-operation can, at the same time, play a useful supplemental role in aiding such efforts. The assistance thus provided, at present and in the future, should be expanded and made more effective. This, we feel, is a responsibility which the developed countries should undertake in co-operation with the developing countries.\n85.\tThese are in general the reflections of the delegation of Burma ?n reviewing the world situation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Government of Australia warmly congratulates you upon your election to the presidency of this session of our Assembly. Your charm, your manifest international experience, your innovative skill and sage judgment, all combine to make you a welcome and popular holder of the highest office of what we all hope will be a constructive and fruitful session of the General Assembly.\n156.\tYour country and mine, Mr. President, have for long been associated in the Commonwealth-a concept and a structure which have much to contribute to this Organization.\n157.\tWe have welcomed to membership in the United Nations at this session another Commonwealth country, the Republic of Seychelles. This brings us closer to our goal of universality. Australia has been glad to see growing contact between the United Nations and the Commonwealth Secretariat; and we heartily endorse the proposal, which is being made to this Assembly, that the Commonwealth Secretariat should be given observer status [A/31/191].\n158.\tOur relationship with the United Nations is a relationship not only with its Members but with its staff. That staff, is led by our Secretary-General, and I should like today to express our appreciation for his outstanding service to the United Nations.\n159.\tThe Government of which I am a member came to office in December last year. This is our first opportunity to reaffirm in this meeting-place of nations the dedication of Australia to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and to their implementation. We remain resolved to contribute in every way we can to the work of this Organization.\n160.\tAs a new Government, naturally we have had to make our own assessment of the international scene, including the role of the United Nations. The international system has entered a period of profound change, and some of the key assumptions of recent decades no longer hold true. Some of the issues which have dominated events are now receding, while new ones are crowding on to the international agenda. Structures, as well as attitudes and values, are changing. The distinction between the political and the economic aspects of international politics is being rapidly narrowed. If these multiple changes are not to constitute a multiple crisis, they require a constructive, co-operative and imaginative response on the part of us all-a response which thinks in terms strategically and of decades, rather than tactically and in terms of instant solutions.\n161.\tThe Australian Government believes that the United Nations can and should play a key role in shaping this response. Its future importance will depend on how it meets this challenge. Because of this, we believe that now is a time when all of us could well consider how the Organization's great potential can be more fully realized. If we are to construct a new international order-and the magnitude of the changes confronting us suggests that nothing less is required-then a realistic reappraisal of the tasks and methods of the United Nations is surely timely in order to ensure that it makes the fullest contribution.\n162.\tIn this respect, we believe that one important requirement is that the General Assembly should shape concepts and establish priorities and principles which are relevant to its changing environment. Only then will it be able to concentrate its energies and resources where they are most needed and where they can be most effective. Unless we have a clear sense of which issues have priority and which issues can be realistically tackled with a hope of success, those energies and resources will be largely wasted.\n163.\tWe also believe that the United Nations will only make its full contribution at this critical time if its Members recognize that one of the principal sources of its strength lies in its moral authority. This in turn derives from the fact that it expresses -however imperfectly- some of the deepest, most fundamental aspirations of mankind.\n164.\tIt is this moral authority which constitutes the vital capital of the Organization and which gives it a purchase on events. Deprived of that authority it will become little more than an empty structure of institutional arrangements and procedures that governments can ignore with impunity. It is crucial, therefore, that it should not be deprived of that authority. Ultimately the. case against arbitrary, unrealistic or discriminatory action within the framework of the United Nations rests on this. It can be stated not in terms of duty or obligation, but of good sense and foresight. As Members of the United Nations, we have an interest in maintaining its moral authority and rejecting courses of action inconsistent with it, because otherwise we shall destroy the effectiveness of the very instrument in which we have declared our faith.\n165.\tLet me stress that none of these observations means that the Australian Government does not understand or sympathize with the desperate human problems and urgent needs which frequently underlie the actions of Members within this Assembly. On the contrary, it is precisely because we consider the solution of these problems to be so important, because we believe that far-reaching changes are required, and because we wish to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations role in that process of change, that we are concerned to make these points.\n166.\tIn the context of structural changes and the emergence of a new international order to which I have referred, primacy must be accorded to economic questions. The complex problems posed by global shortages of food and energy, the population explosion, the gap between rich and poor countries, inflation and the recession in world trade, are major sources of tension, They present the developed and developing worlds with a crucial challenge in international co-operation.\n167.\tI was forcibly impressed at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi by the growing anxiety of developing countries that greater progress should be made towards the realization of the new international economic order. My Government recognizes the aspirations of these countries. We shall contribute willingly to the building of a stable and just international structure and we shall work for changes in the world's economic system that are practicable and viable. We believe that a satisfactory new order can be evolved only if the path is planned and realistic. To this end we must all work together through consultation and co-operation. Developed countries should stand ready collectively to subordinate some short-term economic advantages to the overriding longer-term advantage of creating and maintaining a viable international order. Australia is ready to play its part in this process. An order in which poverty, hunger and disease on a massive scale threaten the peace of regions, cannot be endured.\n168.\tThe obligations which we are willing to assume complement the enormous efforts which developing countries themselves undertake. My Government has followed with interest the attempts by developing countries to stimulate greater economic and technical co-operation among themselves. This field has barely been touched. When tilled, it is bound to be productive. A good example is the effective work of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. \n169.\tAustralia agrees on the need for improvement in the conditions of world commodity trade and recognizes that a concerted effort is necessary for progress to be made in this area. The program of negotiations agreed to at the fourth session of UNCTAD represents a significant advance towards the resolution of the traditional problems which affect international trade in commodities of concern to developing countries. To ensure the success of these negotiations all countries must make a realistic assessment of what can be achieved before the end of 1978. Negotiated solutions must take account of all aspects of the trade and production of particular commodities, of the interests of both consumers and producers, and must be both comprehensive and equitable. Our approach to individual commodity arrangements must be flexible if we are to establish efficient mechanisms for the stabilization of commodity trade.\n170.\tThe Conference on International Economic Co-operation represents a major initiative in international relations which has Australia's strong support. Australia will continue to work - that Conference as well as else- where-towards the evolution, by co-operative means, of a sound basis for future international economic progress.\n171.\tAustralia, as a significant trading nation, has also emphasized the importance of the sound recovery of the world economy and the growth of world trade as important determinants in improving the economic and social prospects of developing countries.\n172.\tThe problem of food is a particularly vital one in a world whose population is increasing so rapidly. While there has been an improvement in food production, the situation for many developing countries remains insecure. It is unacceptable that chronic starvation and malnutrition should persist in a world which has the capacity to produce enough food. We have yet to devise machinery to ensure that each human being is adequately fed. Australia supports efforts which would lead to the establishment of an effective international system of food security.\n173.\tExternal assistance can be a valuable complement to the efforts of the developing countries to achieve self- sustaining economic growth. Australian aid is provided in response to requests from developing countries, in accordance with their priorities and within the limits of Australia's own financial and technical capacities. In the fiscal year 1976/1977 Australia's development assistance-which continues to be overwhelmingly in the form of grants, not loans-will total just under $US 500 million: an increase of 15 per cent over that of the past year. We shall, of course, continue and seek to extend this aid effort; but we shall do so fully recognizing that aid is ultimately no substitute for the structural changes which will in fact render aid largely unnecessary and that the best and most acceptable aid is that which eliminates the need for its own continuation.\n174.\tI turn now to the problems of southern Africa, on which the attention of the international community is centered as never before.\n175.\tThe United Nations has played a crucial role in keeping before us the plight of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and has reminded each of us of our obligation to work for an early end to minority rule.\n176.\tThe Australian Government regards the dramatic development in relation to Southern Rhodesia during the last week as most significant and hopeful. The likelihood of achieving majority rule quickly and without bloodshed is now real. On behalf of my Government, I congratulate the\n(many parties which have contributed to this break-through and hope that it' will receive the widest support in this Assembly. We can appreciate the reasons for the reservations and caution with which some approach these proposals for a peaceful settlement, but we sincerely hope that a concern for absolute certainty where, in the nature of things, certainty is not possible, will not result in a failure to grasp an opportunity which the United Nations has been seeking for so long and which even a few months ago seemed unattainable. It will be a tragedy if a demand for a perfect, fool-proof solution becomes the enemy of the best available one. We urge all parties to give these proposals every possible opportunity to work.\n177.\tAustralia views with concern the Republic of South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia. This concern has been demonstrated by our active participation in the work of the United Nations Council for Namibia. A constitutional settlement must be achieved peacefully and must involve SWAPO.\n178.\tWe have also watched with increasing concern events in South Africa itself over the past year. We deplore the racial violence in South Africa, which is the inevitable result of policies based on inequality between peoples. The system of apartheid and the exploitation of one race, by another are abhorrent to us. Ultimately the iniquity of apartheid must be seen and the policy abandoned. Unless there are genuine and urgent moves made to redress the well-founded black African grievances in South Africa, there can be little hope for the abatement of violence there,\n179.\tHowever, our concern for the assertion of the protection of fundamental human rights is not limited to the rights of those who live in southern Africa-though we recognize that their plight is perhaps the most urgent facing us at this moment. We see importance, too, in the more general reassertion of the cause of freedom of the individual and the elimination of the indignities which man still heaps upon man: torture, forced labor, discrimination and inequality, to mention but a few. When these are associated with racism the evil is compounded, but we should never forget that they are evil in themselves and must be condemned and opposed wherever they occur.\n180.\tTerrorism is a subject which involves fundamental issues of human rights. Regardless of the justification that its proponents advance for it, it remains a completely unacceptable form of political pressure. It is unacceptable because it is barbarous and haphazard. It undermines the general fabric of lawful and decent behavior. Those who pursue it deliberately and flagrantly violate the right to life, liberty and protection from injury of those who are made the innocent victims of their pressures. We condemn terrorism and will join in efforts to eliminate it. Nothing would be more certain to destroy that moral authority of which I have earlier spoken than a failure to do so. We can surely muster the will and the resources to deal with this repulsive crime. We welcome the initiative of the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany in bringing before the General Assembly a draft convention on the taking of hostages [see A/31/242].\n181.\tI turn now to peace keeping and disarmament, both matters of deep concern as change produces new strains and tensions within the international system. Despite the failures of our Organization to do all that is expected of it in the maintenance of peace and security, it has had real successes in its peace-keeping operations. These are supported at present by some 9,000 men in the five current operations. Australia has made a contribution to these activities.\n182.\tI have spoken of some of the successes of the United Nations, limited though they are, in peace-keeping. This leads to consideration of the wider goal of reduction or control of conventional and nuclear armaments. This is an urgent matter and, if success is not achieved soon, it may not be achieved at all. If we fail the prospects for a viable international order in the last quarter of this century will be bleak.\n183.\tThree central and fundamental areas where Australia looks and hopes for early progress are: first, the strengthening of measures to .prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons; secondly, the termination of nuclear-weapons testing in all environments; and, thirdly, further progress in strategic arms limitation agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n184.\tWe are concerned not only to see the trend towards universal acceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] maintained but also to ensure that all its provisions are carried out. Those nuclear-weapon Powers which are parties to the Treaty have obligations to reduce their arsenals. Other nuclear States must ratify the Treaty and accept the same obligations; and the international community as a whole must accept the application of adequate safeguards on the peaceful uses of nuclear materials in order to prevent their diversion to non-peaceful uses. Increased attention to safeguards and further multilateral efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime will receive our support.\n185.\tAustralia believes that nuclear-weapons testing in all environments should be terminated. Recognizing that this objective will be difficult to achieve, we welcome the study to be made, under the auspices of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, by a group of government experts to investigate international co-operative efforts for the detection and identification of nuclear explosions. We hope that these activities will help to establish a climate conducive to the negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\n186.\tAustralia considers that the limitation of existing nuclear arsenals depends essentially on continued progress in strategic arms limitation negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. We look to an early conclusion of an agreement at the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between those two countries and to further agreements placing restraints on nuclear armaments.\n187.\tOne of the principal activities of the United Nations family is the preparation of multilateral treaties. It is an integral part of the vital and dynamic role which inter-national organizations play today.\n188.\tThe importance of the legislative function is nowhere better evidenced than in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This is the largest single legislative project which the international community has ever undertaken. It is essential that it should not fail, especially as its implications for the restructuring of the international economic order are profound.\n189.\tMy Government is fully committed to the achievement of a just and equitable convention on the law of the sea. But, although we recognize the complexities of the issues involved, we were disappointed at the slow progress made at the recent fifth session of the Conference. We consider it essential that the negotiating momentum be maintained during the intersessional period so that delegations can come to the sixth session in New York in May next year with the feeling that agreement is within reach. My Government will play its part in the process of negotiations and consultations to find solutions to out-standing problems.\n190.\tA loss of will or lack of resolve now could put at risk the Herculean efforts of the last few years and usher in an era of uncertainty and difficulty, as nations may feel compelled to take unilateral action to preserve important economic interests. Success, on the other hand, will set an example and encourage a climate of optimism which will be of immense value in encouraging further co-operation in international legislation.\u2003\n191.\tThe difficulties which we are experiencing in the Conference on the Law of the Sea reflect a broader problem of which we ought to take note. Last year we suggested in the Sixth Committee during the debate on the report of the International Law Commission  that the time was ripe for the United Nations to review the process by which the international community legislates. The ways in which we approach multilateral treaty-making are varied, chancy, frequently experimental and often inefficient. They place great burdens upon the Governments of Member States; especially upon the developing countries, and it is open to question whether the community could not find more economical and efficient methods of drafting conventions.\n192.\tIn closing I return again to the theme I developed earlier. If I may restate it briefly, we believe that, in a world which is changing rapidly and profoundly and which must restructure its political and economic priorities and mechanisms to meet these changes, the United Nations has a crucial role to play. We believe that it will play that role effectively only if we its Members exhibit the moderation, the sense of priorities and the realism commensurate with the gravity of the problems. We recognize, of course, that the United Nations is essentially a political body and that it will act in political terms. Our concern is that in doing so it should show a sense of practicality and restraint which reflect an awareness both of the realities of the wider international scene and of its own character. If the United Nations fails in these respects, it will strengthen the forces of cynicism and pessimism and damage its own integrity and effectiveness. If it succeeds, it will immeasurably strengthen that moral authority which provides its unique character and which is the true source of its effectiveness.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a privilege for me, on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to congratulate you most warmly on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your eminent qualities, your long experience in the United Nations and the many important services which you have rendered to the Organization are well known.\n5.\tThe seventh special session of the General Assembly was a manifestation of goodwill and harmony leading to consensus through negotiations. It reaffirmed the unique potential of the United Nations for co-operation. Although the subsequent regular session of the General Assembly yielded positive results, it was overshadowed by a number of decisions which have contributed to a deterioration of the political climate in the General Assembly and also in some of the specialized agencies.\n6.\tI feel bound to sound a serious warning on the dangers which would threaten the United Nations if countries whose support is indispensable were to be alienated from the Organization. The strong and powerful countries could possibly tend to themselves, but the weaker and less privileged nations could not. The latter are most in need of the protection and support of a strong United Nations; they would have few other possibilities if an effective world organization were to founder. It is high time that all of us made an effort to stop these dangerous tendencies towards disintegration.\n7.\tBut what are the underlying causes of these tendencies? The Secretary-General pointed to one of them in the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization when he rightly underlined that the North- South relationship has virtually replaced East-West problems in the debates of the General Assembly [see A/31 fl/ Add.l, sect. II].\n8.\tThe North-South issue reflects the determination of the third world to overcome the injustices of the past and the persisting poverty and unequal distribution of wealth. This, indeed, is one of the main underlying causes of many of the tensions and controversies in the United Nations.\n9.\tWe may deplore some of the majority decisions of the thirtieth session, but condemning automatic majorities -will lead us nowhere unless we are prepared to attack the basic injustices which still prevail in the world. Collective self-reliance may create temporary substitutes for global solutions, but those substitutes will necessarily remain of a limited nature.\n10.\tThe Kingdom of the Netherlands continues to consider the United Nations to be an indispensable instrument for co-operation at the global level. But progress and a constructive approach to global problems are possible only if Member States move from confrontation to dialog and if decisions on fundamental political and economic issues are taken on the basis of a negotiated consensus. Strengthening the role of the United Nations depends on the strength and the sincerity of the political will of the Member States in understanding and respecting the interests and aspirations of others. It depends on their willingness to subordinate national ambitions and short-term interests to common interests and the common yearning for peace.\n11.\tThat requires- it must be repeated again and again- wider and easier recourse to the instruments of the Charter for the settlement of disputes, in particular the Security Council and the International Court of Justice.\n12.\tThe promotion of peace and security is a vital task of the United Nations, but developments in the past year give \nlittle reason for optimism. Satisfaction with the absence in recent months of armed conflict between States is overshadowed by the sharp awareness of internal violence in many countries and places in the world. I am thinking of the suffering of the people in Lebanon. I am thinking also of the victims of repression in Soweto and Capetown. The persistence of many sources of conflict as a result of the failure to solve the underlying issues of injustice implies that, unless the United Nations or the parties concerned succeed in defusing the perils, the risks of armed conflict between States will increase, with all the implications for world-wide peace and security.\n13.\tThe threat of local and regional causes of conflict is intensified by the continuing and excessive increase in armaments all over the world, conventional as well as nuclear. Our world would hardly survive a war in which nuclear weapons would be used, even on a limited scale. Absence of war under this deadly shadow cannot possibly be called peace. It is imperative to intensify our efforts to stop and to turn back this vicious spiral of the arms race.\n14.\tThe world is going to face critical choices in the remaining years of the 1970 s. Dissemination of nuclear technology, if uncontrolled, is fraught with danger. The risk of nuclear proliferation is increasing. The unabated arms race in conventional weapons is also a matter of deep concern. Unless vigorous action is taken now and unless we reset our priorities in the disarmament debate, it may soon be too late.\n15.\tI wish, first of all, to make a special appeal to the United States and the Soviet Union earnestly to seek the implementation of their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. Though I do not doubt their sincerity in striving for a successful outcome of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] and though I do not underestimate the complexity of the issues, I do consider the early conclusion of the second round of these Talks to be of the greatest importance. It would provide a badly needed stimulus for measures for world-wide nuclear arms control. Such measures are all the more urgently required in the light of the rapid spreading of nuclear knowledge and technology. This puts a severe strain on the fragile non-proliferation regime. The use of nuclear technology for military purposes must be prevented. The Netherlands Government has joined others in adopting a stringent policy on exports of nuclear materials, equipment and technology. But that is not enough. All countries will have to exercise restraint with regard to sensitive installations like those for enrichment and reprocessing. To ignore the risks to peace of enrichment or reprocessing installations in individual countries would be foolish. This cannot be a matter of national prestige. The efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency towards plutonium management on a regional basis must be vigorously pursued.\n16.\tIn accordance with its responsibility under the Charter, this General Assembly should act on the vital issue of nuclear proliferation. It should appeal to the United States and the Soviet Union to bring the SALT negotiations to a speedy conclusion. It should call again for a comprehensive test-ban treaty, which is long overdue, and should give further, strong impetus to the ongoing discussions on the control of peaceful nuclear energy and on peaceful nuclear explosions,\n17.\tWhile the danger of nuclear proliferation must be uppermost in our minds, the rapidly increasing sales of conventional weaponry is equally a matter of grave concern. Of all the problems of arms control, the trade in arms seems to be one of the most difficult to discuss in view of its implications for national sovereignty and security. However, it cannot be justified that, both in the highly industrialized countries and in many developing countries, scarce resources are diverted from the promotion of prosperity to the provision of arms for destruction beyond what is legitimately needed for their security and self- defense. It will require political courage and wisdom to tackle this problem. The export of conventional arms should be subjected to the necessary restraint. Consideration should be given to the possibility of measures to regulate and control the international arms trade. This would, of course, require a joint effort of exporting and importing countries. If a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament is convened, the issue of conventional arms and the arms trade should have a priority.\n18.\tDetente in Europe is an important policy objective of the Netherlands Government. The Final Act of Helsinki represented a step forward in that direction. While there remain important unsettled issues in East-West relations, particularly with regard to human rights and in the military field, nevertheless we seem to be moving slowly towards co-operation. The Netherlands Government, in preparing with its partners for the meeting in Belgrade, will actively seek more progress on implementation of all the interrelated sectors in the context of our over-all policy of peace, human freedom and economic co-operation.\n19.\tThree years ago I stressed in this Assembly that detente must take the interests of the third world into account. Today I am more than ever convinced that in our efforts to consolidate and intensify detente and co-operation between East and West we cannot turn away from the South. East and West are both responsible for securing a more rational and more equitable economic relationship between North and South.\n20.\tIn the search for a new international economic and social order, the seventh special session marked the beginning of a new constructive dialog between all industrialized and developing countries. While, on balance, the results so far achieved at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  and the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation have been limited, the necessity for this dialog to be continued on the basis of common interests is still there.\n21.\tOur commitments should extend beyond words and conferences and should be geared towards effective implementation of what was previously agreed upon. The\nNetherlands Government shares the concern and frustration of developing countries recently expressed at Colombo about the extent to which concrete results have been produced in these and in other international forums in implementing the resolutions adopted at the sixth and seventh special sessions. Of essential importance, therefore, is the mobilization of the political will of all parties. The Netherlands Government, for its part, wishes to reiterate its pledge to implement the decisions of the seventh special session and of the fourth session of UNCTAD.\n22.\tApart from the continuing dialog and negotiations in Paris, the first test case will be the forthcoming UNCTAD negotiations on the integrated program for commodities and the common fund. Other negotiations, such as those on multilateral trade, debt relief, monetary reform and the fifth replenishment of the International Development Association will equally require a political effort from all Members of this Organization. These are fundamental issues of equal opportunity and justice.. Failure to act and agree may have serious political implications. The appeal from Colombo should not remain unheeded.\n23.\tThe recent world employment Conference  and Habitat  have added wider dimensions to the development problem, in recognition of the fact that social justice, income distribution and meeting the basic needs of the people are fundamental to development. The results of these and other conferences must be integrated into a new strategy for a third development decade which should be more action-oriented and more binding on both developed and developing countries than the Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. We must use the remaining years of this Decade and take the first steps for such a new undertaking. I propose that this session set in motion the preparatory work.\n24.\tThe coherence and effectiveness of the United Nations system for development are essential conditions for a new economic relationship between North and South and for the effort to eradicate poverty. The Netherlands Government is concerned about the tendencies towards disintegration and the lack of cohesion in the systems. Vigorous efforts should be made to reverse these trends with major emphasis on strengthening the Economic and Social Council, the negotiating capacity of UNCTAD and the Secretariat.\n25.\tOne of the basic purposes of the Charter and of the obligations of Member States is the promotion and encouragement of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Large groups of people, organizations and action groups not only claim their own rights but, in a spirit of humanity and solidarity, also come out in favor of the human rights of others, both within and beyond national borders. Human rights are today a matter of international concern and preoccupation.\n26.\tHuman rights do not function in isolation. Violations of human rights are often the symptoms of deeper causes of injustice expressed through exploitation, discrimination, repression and intimidation. There are standards below which no society may fall without offending fundamental values. I am referring to such practices as wide-scale murder and imprisonment, torture and gross and systematic oppression of racial, religious, political or ethnic groups. The Declaration on torture adopted last year by the General Assembly is very explicit on this score, for it states that:\n\\\"Exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency may not be invoked as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\\" \n27.\tThe Netherlands Government and the Netherlands people are deeply concerned as the systematic and institutionalized practice of torture continues to be reported from various sources. The fact-finding groups of the Commission on Human Rights on southern Africa and Chile, for instance, have brought distressing information to our attention, revealing the role of security agencies which operate beyond judicial control and inflict upon human beings the most inhuman treatment and even death. Similar information from other regions and areas comes to our knowledge. I appeal to this world Organization, Member States and all national and international institutions to make energetic efforts to bring such practice of torture and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment to an end, wherever it occurs,\n28.\tThe United Nations has made a great contribution in proclaiming human-rights standards in terms of guarantees and aspirations, in terms of political freedoms and economic and social justice, in terms of individual and collective concerns. The question is how to transform these standards into a living reality in the international and national communities, how to move from enunciation to implementation and effective protection.\n29.\tImplementation of human rights should first and foremost have its effects at the grass-roots level, where people need adequate shelter, food, employment and also political rights, including the right to dissent and the right to freedom of religion or belief. They need their right to life, liberty and personal security. They need to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention. In sum, they are entitled, as article 28 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights puts it, to a social and international order in which their rights and freedoms can be fully realized. The full realization of civil and political rights is not possible without the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\n30.\tFrom its inception the United Nations was envisaged as an advocate for peoples and groups suffering from discrimination. In that light, actions undertaken at the international and national levels towards the emancipation of women deserve our full support. May I stress that such actions should not be limited to legal measures since equality in law is only a part of real and full equality. As a matter of priority, policies of information to change traditional attitudes, as well as measures of implementation aimed at bringing about changes in the still existing inequalities between men and women, are called for. In developing countries particular attention should, in my view, be given to measures to secure adequate educational opportunities for women. The promotion of such policies and measures should be a prominent part of the present United Nations Decade for Women, which was proclaimed under the theme \\\"Equality, development and peace\\\" [see resolution 3520 (XXX)].\n31.\tWhile the primary task for the promotion and protection of human rights rests within the national societies, the international community-and notably the United Nations has a complementary responsibility. The Netherlands has favored through the years the strengthening of the capacity of the United Nations to deal with general human rights problems and with concrete human rights situations in cases of a serious and urgent nature. We will continue to advocate the creation of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, or similar institutions and proper fact-finding devices. One of the fundamental and inherent problems of the United Nations is that its intergovernmental structure functions in many cases as a barrier for the voices of the oppressed to be heard and to be acted upon. For this reason, I support a stronger role for the non-governmental element in the United Nations so that more weight can be given to the opinions, the appeals and the petitions of non-governmental organizations, groups of people and individual persons.\n32.\tFinally, the General Assembly should take energetic steps for the speedy adoption of the draft declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief [see A/31/158].\n33.\tI should now like to address you as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community and as president of European political co-operation.\n34.\tIn today's world the European Community is a living political and economic reality. Our union has yet to be completed, but we are determined to unite. We naturally realize that the further unification of Europe-whose variety of culture has proved so vital and fruitful-will be a complex process, but we know that we have embarked upon a project of fundamental importance. The radical reorganization of one part of the world community of nations will have an effect-in my view, a beneficial one-on the whole of that community. The Europe we are building is one in which material welfare will rest upon social justice, a Europe which will be democratic and soon have its own freely elected parliament, a Europe which must be outward-looking to the whole world.\n35.\tAs it develops, our internal policy, based on steady growth, social justice and democracy, must also make its contribution to growth, justice and freedom elsewhere in the world, to a close and productive relationship with countries outside the Community and, in particular, with the developing countries.\n36.\tStructural changes in the world economy are a necessary condition for improvement of the social and economic situation of millions of people throughout the world. In view of its own economic, financial and technological strength and capabilities, the Community, which has already proved to be one of the most dynamic factors of the world economy, recognizes the need for increasingly coherent policies for development co-operation based on generally agreed objectives and policy measures. It is with this objective in mind that, for example, the Community applies and continues to improve its generalized system of preferences for developing countries.\n37.\tDuring the seventh special session the countries of the European Community showed their readiness unitedly to make a positive contribution towards the building of a more just and equitable international economic order. Today on behalf of the nine members I wish to reiterate that pledge and our will to carry out the commitments that we undertook at that special session. The negotiations that took place at the fourth session of UNCTAD, and those continuing at the Paris North-South dialog are ample proof that, while there seems enough common ground for real progress, wide divergencies of opinion remain on important issues. The members of the European Community, while following the path of conciliation and dialog, are determined to spare no effort to implement the pledges we gave last year in New York, and recently in Nairobi, and to make a success of the Paris dialog.\n38.\tLet me assure you, there will be no retraction of previous promises. On the contrary, the members of the Community, recognizing the interests of the world economy as a whole, remain committed to a structural improvement of the position of the developing countries in the world economy, taking particular account of the urgent problems of those countries most in need. It is in this spirit that we will approach the forthcoming negotiations and discussions which will take place in conformity with the relevant resolutions as adopted at the fourth session of UNCTAD. Moreover, the participating countries at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation are back at the negotiating table, and it is our sincere hope that all efforts will be made for a successful conclusion of the ministerial meeting in December. For its part, the European Community is determined to contribute to a concrete outcome of the Paris Conference. In Paris we speak with one voice; our joint participation reflects the increasing involvement of the European Community and its increasing weight in the North-South relationship.\n39.\tThe Community welcomes the entry into force in April of the Convention concluded between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group [ACP] and the European Economic Community [EEC] in Lome on 28 February 1975. The importance of this Convention-which relies upon a certain number of new ideas is without precedent in relations between developing and developed countries. It concerns more than half a billion human beings. Its objective is to establish and develop, in a spirit of friendship, economic relations between the Community of nine members and more than 50 developing countries. Furthermore, the importance of the Lom\u00e9 Convention rests upon the fact that all its members are placed within an \\\"equal partnership\\\" on a basis of complete equality between the partners. This implies a mutual responsibility. The Community, for its part, will most seriously and constructively consider the wishes of the ACP countries voiced at the first meeting of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers at which I had the honor to represent the Community.\n40.\tFinally, we welcome the increase in the number of participants in the Convention: Surinam, the Comoros and Seychelles have all deposited their acts of accession. Negotiations have begun with Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and with Papua New Guinea for their accession.\n41.\tThe nine members of the Community also attach particular importance to the United Nations. They have proved this so far by endeavoring to plan an active and constructive role, both individually and collectively. During the last few years, their co-operation has manifested itself repeatedly in this Assembly in common statements and declarations of vote and by their votes being cast on the basis of a common or at least a co-ordinated position. We shall continue to use our joint influence and weight for the purpose of strengthening the United Nations as the principal instrument for international security and co-operation.\n42.\tThe situation in southern Africa remains a matter of deep concern. In Rhodesia the acceptance of the Anglo-United States proposals by Mr. Smith's cabinet represents a significant step forward. The Community expresses the hope that this will indeed prove to be a turning-point in the history of Rhodesia. If all sides show good faith, with Africans and Europeans working together, the foundations could be laid for an independent Zimbabwe which will then take its rightful place among the family of nations.\n43.\tOn 23 February of this year, the Foreign Ministers of the nine members of the Community reaffirmed in a joint declaration their basic positions with regard to southern African issues. We condemn South Africa's policy of apartheid and we advocate the right to self-determination and independence of the peoples of Rhodesia and Namibia. We respect the independence of all African States and their right to define their national policies in complete sovereignty and without foreign interference. Our countries support actions by the Organization of African Unity promoting African co-operation. We are ready to co-operate with the African States and reject any action by whatever State aimed at establishing a zone of influence in Africa.\n44.\tUntil fundamental changes come about, there can be no peace in southern Africa. Therefore our countries welcome the present efforts to find peaceful solutions of the problems of the area. Our nine countries remain willing to contribute to these efforts.\n45.\tAs regards Namibia, the nine members of the Community stated in their message to the Secretary-General on Namibia Day that negotiations should take place with representatives of all political groups in that Territory, including the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], in order to pave the way for Namibia's independence in the near future. The United Nations should, in our view, focus its own contribution to the solution of the question of Namibia on the promotion of self-determination by the Namibian people in a manner both democratic and peaceful.\n46.\tOur Governments do not intend to recognize the Transkei on the occasion of its purported independence. False solutions to the problems of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa, such as the establishment of \\\"homelands\\\" or \\\"bantustans\\\" as at present pursued by the South African Government, promote, rather than diminish, racial discrimination. The popular upheaval and resistance to apartheid should have convinced the South African Government that apartheid has no future and constitutes an insupportable violation of human dignity. South Africa is a multiracial society in which all people, irrespective of their race or color, should have the right to live peacefully together on the basis of equality. Apartheid is in flagrant contradiction with this fundamental right and should be eliminated. As long as it is practiced, it will be resisted by those whose basic human rights are denied. Our nine Governments are unequivocal in their firm belief that justice and freedom for all people should prevail in South Africa.\n47.\tIn the Middle East, the tragic events in Lebanon have brought untold suffering to the inhabitants of that strife- torn country. The nine countries of the European Community deplore the tragic bloodshed which has claimed and continues to claim so many victims. On a number of occasions, members of the European Community have shown their concern over the situation in Lebanon and have expressed the hope that all involved will do everything possible to bring that conflict to an end.\n48.\tThe nine members of the Community are prepared to support all meaningful efforts of conciliation and welcome those which are in progress in the inter-Arab context. They underline their continuing commitment to the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon. I should like to assure President Sarkis, on his assumption of office as the new Head of State of Lebanon, of the goodwill of the members of the European Community in the fulfillment of the difficult tasks which lie ahead of him.\n49.\tWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the members of the European Community are convinced that negotiations based on a minimum of consensus among all the parties concerned are essential for the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. In this respect they reiterate their continuing firm attachment to resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council and to the principles which are the basis of their position and which I repeat: first, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; secondly, the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967; thirdly, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of every State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and fourthly, recognition that in the establishment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.\n50.\tI should like to emphasize that a solution of the conflict in the Middle East will be possible only if the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to give effective expression to its national identity is translated into fact. \n51.\tFor their part, the countries of the European Community are prepared to assist, to the best of their ability and to the extent desired by the parties, in the achievement of a settlement, and, as soon as the settlement is approved by all parties, to help in making it a reality. In this connexion, they would be prepared, as they have stated earlier, to consider participation in international guarantees for the implementation of a peace settlement.\n52.\tCyprus is a problem of deep concern to our nine countries. It involves three countries associated with the European Community. That is the reason why we have spared and will spare no effort to bring the parties concerned to the conference table and to advocate restraint to all sides. We are convinced that this problem can be solved solely through negotiations. Our basic position that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Cyprus should be maintained and safeguarded remains unchanged. We welcome and support the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his representative on Cyprus to assist the parties concerned in finding a solution of the conflict.\n53.\tThe nine members of the Community are aware that peace, detente and human freedom are indivisible and inseparable, in the world and in Europe. They acted together in negotiating the Final Act of Helsinki and are striving together for the implementation of that Act. It is too early to judge the follow-up of Helsinki. I wish to state, however, on behalf of our nine countries that if we are earnest in our quest for peace and security in Europe, the Final Act must be implemented in its entirety, in all its interrelated component parts. It is in that spirit and in good faith that we approach the meeting to be convened in Belgrade next year.\n54.\tOn behalf of the nine countries of the European Community I wish now to speak about a matter of deep concern to them: international terrorism and in particular the increasing frequency of acts of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives, particularly when such acts of violence take on international dimensions and can only be tackled effectively by international action. In this respect the taking of hostages constitutes one of the most heinous crimes against human life, liberty and the security of the person as guaranteed in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of political ends, regardless of motives, regardless of the identity or affiliation of its perpetrators. The member States of the European Community, as they have stated most recently in their declaration of 13 July 1976, regard this inhuman method of taking hostages as absolutely unacceptable and they condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\n55.\tWithout overlooking the fact that the solution of the issues underlying certain forms of international terrorism would undoubtedly contribute to the suppression of this evil, and without neglecting or impeding all the efforts being made to this effect, it nevertheless remains an illusion to assume that the problem of terrorism in its broad sense would be solved only by tackling any one underlying issue. Furthermore, there are serious indications that we are confronted with a growing danger of a world-wide network of professional criminal terrorism ready to strike at any moment against any State and its citizens. In this unsettled world, new burning issues of conflict are bound to arise time and again, but international actions to stamp out terrorism cannot wait.\n56.\tIt must by now be clear that no country, no people, no Government can hope to be spared from acts of terrorism, kidnapping and hijacking against its own citizens and interests, unless all countries agree on taking, individually and jointly, decisive action. None will be spared unless all take action. The failure to oppose insidious violence against the innocent, the defenseless and the unprotected is deeply regretted by our nine countries. We feel it is in the interest of all Governments to take resolute action. We feel it is in the interest of all Governments to co-operate in combating all acts of international terrorism. This Assembly must live up to its responsibilities in this respect and should initiate appropriate measures.\n57.\tIn their declaration of 13 July, the members of the European Community have given ample evidence of their willingness and determination to co-operate with other countries in setting up effective worldwide measures to eradicate and prevent international terrorism, kidnappings and hijackings. We consider effective measures against the taking of hostages a matter of special urgency, and I should like in this context to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that my colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, will submit an important and timely proposal on this issue. I invite this Assembly to give this proposal due consideration and to take positive action.\n58.\tIt is our sincere wish that this thirty-first Assembly session may produce results commensurate with the expectations cherished by all our peoples, all over the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I recently had occasion to express to the President of the General Assembly, Ambassador Amerasinghe, who was elected to the high office of President of this General Assembly, our sincerest congratulations. Today, on behalf of the Lebanese delegation, I wish to renew those congratulations along with our best wishes for his success.\n53.\tIn this general debate, many statements have been made about various aspects of international relation and problems. At present, my delegation is not in a position to make any worth-while contribution to the discussion of the items on this year's agenda. It is not that these items have become unimportant or irrelevant to us, but that our priority is, most understandably, the murderous and ravaging war that Lafflicted Lebanon and its people for the last 18 months o we expected to stand here and express our views on disarmament, when the unscrupulous flow of arms to Lebanon during the last few years has spread death and destruction in a hitherto peaceful and prospering country? Or to stand and speak of the strengthening of international security, when the peace and security of Lebanon have been shattered and this Organization is theorizing on how best to preserve peace and security in the world? Or should we discuss the question of how to enhance the role of the United Nations, when the scourge of war which it is supposed to prevent, according to the first consideration of the Charter, is decimating our people and turning a prosperous land into a shambles?\n54.\tShould we deal with the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and of safeguarding their independence and sovereignty at a time when our sovereignty has been torn to shreds and intervention in our affairs has become so flagrant? Are we to discourse on the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the small and the weak among its Members at a time when the faith of international public opinion in the United Nations ability to perform this primary duty has been shaken? Or are we expected to discuss the new international economic order and social development when the thriving economic life of Lebanon has come to a standstill?\n55.\tHow stark is the contrast between what we discuss here at the United Nations and the harsh realities that our people are enduring in Lebanon. I say this neither in a spirit of rancor towards, or disappointment with, the United Nations nor in an attempt to undermine its prestige. For one reason, we know that its capabilities are limited and, thus, so are our expectations of it. For another, we, as a founding Member State, so loyal to the United Nations and so consistent in the service and propagation of its ideals, cannot be a party, even in the darkest hours of our modern history, to the downgrading or castigating of an Organization that we want to be stronger, more efficient and more spontaneous in its response to the need to protect the security of its Members. I say this only to impress on the minds of delegations here that Lebanon's tragedy should be a warning-and indeed a stern one-that the security, nay the survival, of Member States cannot be viewed with lethargy and indifference. Furthermore, we believe that small States should draw the proper conclusion and realize that they must be ever more vigilant and effective in protecting their higher interests and national rights. They must principally rely on their national means to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. Alas, regional and international organizations have not yet reached the stage where they can provide these States with an adequate shield for their protection.\n56.\tHowever, the general debate has revealed to us the growing interest of friendly nations in the fate of our country and people, and we are deeply moved and appreciative of their outpouring of expressions of sympathy. We note with satisfaction their call for the restoration of stability and peace in Lebanon and for the preservation of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as of the unity of its people. President Elias Sarkis extends his appreciation for the references made to Lebanon and for the assurances given by some delegations that their Governments stand ready to assist him in his difficult task.\n57.\tSimilar calls and assurances have been made by our esteemed Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, on several occasions. We extend to him Lebanon's appreciation for the constant concern he has shown for the Lebanese people through their long and tragic ordeal. His many appeals and initiative? to end the bloodshed and destruction have been a testimony to his courage, statesmanship and deep interest in the welfare of a Member State. To him and through him we express the gratitude of the Lebanese people for the varied humanitarian assistance granted to them by many agencies in the United Nations family and for the initiative for the establishment of a special fund of $50 million for Lebanon under the leadership of the able Under-Secretary- General, Mr. Buffum. It is our hope that when peace reigns again in Lebanon, which we hope will be soon, it will be possible for the fund to operate speedily and efficiently in meeting the growing needs of the country, which will require a new assessment in the light of more recent developments.\n58.\tLebanon has been in the throes of unprecedented, cruel and tragic events for over 18 months. The world has been baffled by the intensity of the fighting, the passions it has aroused, the large number of casualties and the extent of the destruction. Much has been said and written about the original causes of the fighting and about the obstacles which have prevented a satisfactory settlement until now. In the maze of analyses and theories, a good deal of emphasis was wrongly placed on the internal character of the conflict, particularly in the first phase of events.\n59.\tLebanon is no different from other countries and naturally has its own political, economic and social problems. While this is not the forum to discuss our internal problems, we should like to stress from the outset that never were our internal problems of such magnitude as to generate so much violence, bloodshed and destruction. In themselves, these problems could have been resolved in the traditional spirit of conciliation, compromise and national concord which has always characterized the relationships between the various communities and parties in Lebanon. Mr. Kamel al-Assad, Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, recently stated: \\\"If there should be an inter-Lebanese conflict, it can only be solved through constitutionally established institutions. ' Lebanon has been a classic example of how various religious communities can live and prosper together in peace, harmony and freedom and within the framework of a democratic and progressive system of government. The vast majority of Lebanese realize that violence is not a means of improving or restructuring institutions, for it only begets destruction. The only sane and rational way is through dialog and consensus and according to the organic laws of the country.\n60.\tWhat, then, are the origins of the tragic and complex events that have disrupted Lebanese society for so many months? We believe that they are to be found in the web of Middle Eastern contradictions and complexities-that is, the establishment of Israel, the displacement of 'the Palestinians, the Arab-Israeli wars, the failures of the United Nations to implement its resolutions regarding the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab lands and the recognition and restoration of Palestinian rights, the Arab rivalries and the assaults perpetrated by Palestinians against the sovereignty of Lebanon and the security of its people. The unsettled conditions that resulted from these factors have maintained a state of tension and turbulence in the area, which was bound to affect directly a small country like Lebanon, lying at the cross-roads of Middle Eastern political currents and subject to their pressures.\n61.\tThis state of affairs was indeed accentuated by the presence of about 400,000 Palestinians in Lebanon, among whom the Palestine revolution had established deep roots. For years, friction between the Lebanese authorities and people, on the one hand, and the Palestinians, on the other, has intensified and resulted in a. steady deterioration of their relationship. That was: caused by constant Palestinian intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and intolerable encroachment on its sovereignty. By their very activities, Palestinian irregular and revolutionary forces aroused the apprehensions of the Lebanese population. In 1969 President Charles Helou called attention to the risks that might occur from the disrespect of Lebanese sovereignty by various Palestinian factions. Nevertheless, the situation continued to deteriorate and the fighting which erupted was finally contained when the crisis was resolved by the Cairo agreement. That agreement regulated the activities of the Palestinians in Lebanon.\n62.\tFurther conflicts occurred in May and June 1973 between the Lebanese authorities and the Palestinians, resulting in yet another agreement. At that time, President Suleiman Franjieh, while reiterating his support for the Palestinian cause, denounced the illegal occupation of parts of Lebanese territory by Palestinian elements, as well as the contradiction, in a country as small as Lebanon, between the logic of the Palestinian revolution and the logic of the State which wants to preserve its sovereignty.\n63.\tBut the Palestinians did not respect the accords that were concluded. And it pains me very much that I, after so many years' service to the Palestinian cause,and to the rights of the Palestinians, should stand at this rostrum to bring these hard facts to the attention of the international community. The Palestinians acted as if they were a \\\"State\\\" or \\\"States\\\" within the State of Lebanon and flagrantly defied the laws of the land and abused the hospitality of its people.\n64.\tFurthermore, after the events in Jordan of September 1970, the Palestinians introduced several units of their forces into Lebanon and transferred various commands of the resistance movement to Lebanon-without the approval of the Lebanese authorities and, sometimes, despite them. For years, they steadily increased the influx of arms into Lebanon arms of all calibers and from various sources. They transformed most -if not all- of the refugee camps into military bastions around our major cities, in the heart of our commercial and industrial centers, and in the vicinity of large civilian conglomerations. That was done even in remote areas having no connexion with the Palestinians' struggle to regain their rights and their homeland.\n65.\tMoreover, common-law criminals fleeing from Lebanese justice found shelter and protection in the camps, where the arm of Lebanese law could not reach them. Those camps in fact became centers for the training of mercenaries who were sent and financed by some other Arab States tinder the pretext of assisting the Palestinian resistance movement, but who, at their first call, found themselves fighting against the Lebanese authorities and people. Palestinian elements belonging to various splinter organizations resorted to kidnapping Lebanese and sometimes foreigners-holding them prisoners, questioning them, torturing them and even sometimes killing them. Those elements took the liberty of erecting check-points on our major highways and cross-roads, stopping traffic, checking the identity cards of passengers and hampering the normal life of our people. They committed all sorts of crimes in Lebanon and also escaped Lebanese justice in the protection of the camps. They smuggled goods into Lebanon and openly sold them.on our streets. They went so far as to demand \\\"protection\\\" money from, many individuals.and owners of buildings and factories situated in the vicinity of their camps.\n66.\tIt is difficult to enumerate all the illegal activities committed by those Palestinian elements-sometimes described as undisciplined and uncontrollable-which gave rise, in turn, to the dissatisfaction of the Lebanese Government and the resentment of its people, which charged an atmosphere already fraught with tension. That atmosphere became so explosive that it needed a mere spark to ignite it. A few incidents that occurred in the spring of 1975 provided that, srwrV\n67.\tThe friction between Palestinians and Lebanese could have been settled in a spirit of goodwill and brotherly co-operation, a spirit which had permeated their relations in the past. But it became apparent that the Palestinians had designs on becoming a major factor in the battle for political power in Lebanon. They openly allied themselves, and continue to do so to this very hour, with one group of Lebanese against another. Whatever grievances the Lebanese may have had among themselves or in their relationship with their Government, the Palestinians had neither the right nor the justification to become a party to any internal dispute whatever.\n68.\tWhy did the Palestinians risk all the gains we had achieved together for their cause? Why did they pursue a war in a country that had stood by them in all their years of exile and ordeal? Fifty thousand dead, 100,000 injured, 1 million Lebanese refugees in Syria, the Arab world, Europe and America; the dismantling of our administrative, economic, social and educational institutions and enter-prises-all that could not be justified by any objective of the Palestinian revolution, or by any principle of morality and brotherhood. So much human suffering and so much destruction were the result of the Palestinian participation in the fighting and their stubborn persistence in it. It is deplorable that those who have been the victims of a gross injustice are inflicting an injustice of such inhuman proportions on Lebanon and its people.\n69.\tIt is incomprehensible to the Lebanese why western Beirut and peaceful towns and villages in northern Lebanon, in the Beka'a valley, or in the heartland of the Lebanese mountains or Sidon, having no connexion with any aspect of the conflict, should be besieged, occupied and sometimes destroyed by Palestinian forces. Why have so many innocent civilians been killed in the name of \\\"liberation\\\" and \\\"revolution\\\"? And why should many public utilities and buildings be under Palestinian control? Has all that happened in order to prove what a leading Palestinian personality has said, that \\\"the road to Palestine cannot but pass through Aintoura, Aiyoun esSimaan, and must even reach Jounieh itself?\n70.\tIt is indeed sad for a Lebanese diplomat to stand before this Assembly and denounce the actions of the Palestinians in Lebanon. There is no need to remind delegations here that we have always been in the vanguard of ail endeavors to promote the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Lebanese diplomacy has devoted its major activities here and else-where to the defense of the Palestinian cause and of every Arab cause for the last 30 years. Every President and Government of Lebanon has spared no effort in that connexion. That was, and is, in keeping with our belief that an injustice was done to the Palestinians which must be rectified: in other words that they have the right to return to their homeland.\n71.\tThat was not the only service rendered to the Palestinians. About 100,000 of them came to Lebanon in 1948 after they were expelled from their homeland. Their number swelled to over 400,000 by 1975. Lebanon provided them with a refuge and with several opportunities. In our midst they have enjoyed all the freedoms enjoyed by the Lebanese-die freedom to assemble to organize, to express themselves openly, to disseminate information, to publicize and to contact the entire world through our .communications facilities. In the environment of Lebanon and of the Lebanese experience, the Palestinian concept of a free, democratic and secular State in Palestine was born. The best research centers on Palestinian affairs were, in fact, established in Lebanon, and the finest publications on the subject emanated from Beirut.\n72.\tBecause of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, southern Lebanon endured Israeli bombardments and assaults for seven years. One hundred thousand of its inhabitants fled and became refugees in their own country. They swelled the misery belts around our major cities, aggravating an already complex economic and social problem caused by the nearby presence of several Palestinian refugee camps and, mind you, that is in a small country of 2.5 million people.\n73.\tMany delegations have referred to the fact that the Lebanese crisis is a direct consequence of the Middle East conflict. We agree with that statement. We are convinced that, had a definitive solution been reached about the binate Palestinian/Middle East problem, the conflict in Lebanon would not have erupted. We respect the assessment of the Soviet Union regarding Lebanon in its proposal concerning a settlement in the Middle East and the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East in that respect.\n74.\tWe also welcome the statements made earlier in this debate by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger [11th meeting], and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gromyko [7th meeting], about the need to reconvene the Geneva Conference in search of a comprehensive solution to the problems of the Middle East. On our part, we should like to stress the urgency of such an action. I repeat on our part, we should like to stress the urgency of such an action. We have become one of the parties principally interested, for our future and the lives of our people are at stake. We have consistently advocated the necessity of dealing with all aspects of the Palestinian and Middle East problems. Whatever steps were taken in the past must now lead to an overall settlement. We cannot stress that urgently enough.\n75.\tThe changes resulting from the war of October 1973 and the subsequent efforts made to reach a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, whether through the Geneva Conference or through partial agreements, had a potentially explosive impact on Lebanon. The Palestinians and the Arab countries which favored or rejected those peaceful plans took advantage of the liberal and democratic system and life in Lebanon and clashed on Lebanese soil in order to advance their different political objectives.\n76.\tHowever, no matter how, where or when a comprehensive settlement is reached, it cannot delay the solution of our problem or affect our interests. Our position must be clearly understood. We want to restore peace and order to Lebanon as soon as possible and to re-establish our total authority and sovereignty over our land.\n77.\tI should like now to deal with another point which has created some concern in the past. It was feared that events taking place in Lebanon might lead to its partition.\nSometimes the fears were generated by talks about \\\"plans\\\" and \\\"plots\\\" undertaken on the international level to achieve partition. We have never known of any such scheme or approach having as its objective the partition of Lebanon made by anyone in or from Lebanon.\n78.\tDespite all the tragic events that have taken place, the Lebanese authorities and forces which persevered in the defense of legality and constitutional institutions have constantly proclaimed their determination to protect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon for the benefit of all its people without distinction, any fear or any accusation to the contrary notwithstanding.\n79.\tDespite the various positions taken in the present conflict on any other aspect of the crisis, there is one aspect on which all the Lebanese are united, namely, their total opposition to partition and their determination to preserve Lebanon's unity. That was strongly affirmed by President Sarkis the other day in his inaugural speech when he said: \\\"In my view, what is sacrosanct and inviolable is the sovereignty of Lebanon and the unity of its territory and its people.\\\"\n80.\tNow I should like to make a few remarks about peace-making efforts. We welcome some efforts deployed by some friendly States and by several truly sister Arab States, which can perceive that higher Arab interests could be better served in the spirit of Arab brotherhood, fairness and justice to all than through the abuse of Arab wealth for the funneling of arms, money and men for disruption and sedition in Lebanon.\n81.\tWe also welcome the efforts of the League of. Arab States, although timid in the beginning, to help restore peace and order. However, we should like to pay a special tribute to our closest sister Arab State, the Syrian Arab Republic. Our special relations are such, that anything which affects or afflicts Syria affects and afflicts Lebanon. The Syrian Government, under the wise and firm leadership of President Hafez Al-Assad, perceived the dangers inherent in the Lebanese crisis in all their dimensions and initiated several efforts to mediate the differences between Lebanese factions and to end the fighting between the Lebanese and the Palestinians.\n82.\tDie Syrian army was sent to Lebanon in a peace-making effort to separate the combatants and to help restore peace and order. It was resisted by the Palestinian forces and their allies, who called for the withdrawal of the Syrian forces as a condition for the cessation of hostilities and for their own withdrawal from the positions they occupied. The presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon is subject to Lebanese sovereignty and to Lebanese sovereignty alone. The Lebanese authorities, and they alone, can exercise the sovereign right to determine any position regarding that presence. The Palestinians have no such right and certainly cannot speak for Lebanon or determine what is best in its interests.\n83.\tPresident Al-Assad said that the Palestinians should not disregard the fact that Lebanon is not Palestine and that Beirut is the capital of Lebanon and not of Palestine. He added that Syria would accept a demand for the withdrawal of its troops from the Lebanese President, or\nPrime Minister, or Speaker of the Parliament, but not from the Palestinians. In this connexion I should like to bring to the Assembly's attention what President Elias Sarkis stated in his inaugural address on 23 September. He stated that the presence of the Syrian army in Lebanon must be considered within the framework of the special relation-ships that exist between Syria and Lebanon. He stated further:\n\\\"I am in a position to declare that the future of this presence and all that ensues from it depends on the Lebanese constitutional authorities, which must take on their responsibilities and decide their position in conformity with the higher interests of Lebanon and in the light of events.\\\"\n84.\tThis leads ms to some final conclusions and thoughts.\n85.\tFirst, we deeply regret the deterioration in relations between Palestinians and Lebanese. But, more than that regret, we in Lebanon are grieved and appalled at the number of casualties our people have suffered, at the extent of the destruction in the country and at the damage done to our way of Life and to our world image.\n86.\tSecondly, peace and confidence between the Lebanese and the Palestinians can be restored, and it must be restored. It is in their mutual interest to end the fighting speedily. The position of the Lebanese authorities and people is clear. Lebanon cannot and will not allow any encroachment on. its sovereignty. Any settlement of its dispute with the Palestinians must ensure the following: the dissociation of the Palestinians from the fighting in Lebanon; their withdrawal from all the military positions they are now holding; their respect for the sovereignty of Lebanon and its laws; their strict adherence to the accords concluded with them by Lebanese authorities; and their refraining from interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs.\n87.\tThirdly, while we welcome some Arab and non-Arab efforts to help us solve the crisis, we regret the activities of some Arabs that are heightening tensions in Lebanon.\n88.\tFourthly, we believe that the time has come to solve the problems of the Middle East by effecting the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab lands and by enabling the Palestinians to exercise their inalienable rights, which have already been recognized, among them the right to self-determination and to nationhood in their homeland of Palestine.\n89.\tFifthly, while we welcome diplomatic efforts through the Geno /a Conference or by others to find a comprehensive solution to the problems of the Middle East, we consider that any delay in achieving this objective should not impede the speedy restoration of peace to Lebanon or affect its interests.\n90.\tSixthly, while the Lebanese reject any thought of partition, their determination is to restore the freedom and unity of all the regions of the country, so that they can shape and determine their future together in a manner that will preserve their independence, sovereignty and fundamental liberties.\n91.\tThe question is often asked, Can Lebanon survive? Can Lebanon stand on its feet again and recover? My answer is an emphatic \\\"Yes\\\"\u2014and it will. Our people have faced adversity many times in the past. They have the capacity and virility to absorb the present calamity, hard as it may be. We have suffered great material losses; however, we cherish our freedom and the unity of the Lebanese people, regardless of sacrifice. We pray that those who have died did not die in vain. As our President, Mr. Sarkis, stated:\n\\\"If we rediscover the right path, that of reason, of love and of conscience, our sacrifices will not have been in vain and the Lebanese martyrs of today will have died so that Lebanon might live.\\\"\n92.\tThe Lebanese have cut stones from the mountains to build their homes, places of worship and schools. With these stones they built walls against the slopes of the mountains, backed them with earth, terraced them, planted trees on them and transformed Lebanon into the verdant fruit basket of the Middle East. Without any significant help from outside, our people developed a thriving economy, despite the lack of natural resources. They have made Lebanon one of the best centers for education, health, trade, tourism and communications in the Middle East. Those who have built in the past can rebuild in the future. With the grace of God, with the aid of all Lebanese at home and abroad, with the assistance of our sister Arab States, friendly nations and the United Nations family, Lebanon will rise and thrive again.\n93.\tLebanon will transform the legend of the phoenix into reality. Out of the flames and ashes a new Lebanon will be born-a Lebanon that is more united and freer, more resolute and stronger, more dedicated to the social and human progress of its people, to equality and justice among them, to amity and co-operation among nations, and to peace in the world.\n94.\tI am confident that the image of Lebanon as a land of peace, concord, love and conciliation will shine once again.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation, I would like to seize this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-first regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your dynamism and your dedication to the promotion of international understanding, as evidenced in your brilliant performance as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, reassures us that our deliberations during this session will be both meaningful and successful.\n111.\tWe also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the statesmanlike manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly.\n112.\tIn the view of my delegation, this Organization owes a debt of deep gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations and his perseverance in the great and difficult search for international peace and security.\n113.\tIt gives me great pleasure to welcome most warmly our newest Member, the sister State of Seychelles as it takes its rightful place among the community of nations. We congratulate its Government and people on their achievement of independence and look forward to its full and fruitful participation in the common endeavor to create a better future for all mankind. It is our sincere hope that in the case of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Security Council will squarely face its responsibilities and make appropriate recommendations to this Assembly which would enable those countries to take their rightful places among us in the not-too-distant future.\n114.\tA short while ago, the relentless hand of fate snatched from the international community one of its most dynamic and distinguished leaders. I refer to the late Mao Tsetung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the People's Republic of China. By his death, the People's Republic of China has been deprived of its founder and revered deader, and the rest of the world has lost the supreme proletarian of our time, whose primary concern was always for the freedom and dignity of oppressed peoples everywhere. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China as well as to the family of this monumental statesman. We feel sure that his life and work will continue to motivate the vast majority of humanity and serve as a continuing inspiration and hope to the underprivileged and oppressed masses.\n115.\tTen years ago, one of the greatest threats to world peace and security was tension between the super-Powers, which resulted in a senseless arms race and the grim possibility of nuclear holocaust. While this issue dominated the debates of the United Nations, other issues were relegated to the recesses of the deliberations of the world body, which thereby shelved the search for solutions to the economic, social and political problems of two thirds of mankind. Today these tensions have abated and the cold war has been replaced by the more humane and conciliatory concept of detente. With these developments, the focus of concern has visibly shifted to the relationship between the minority affluent North and the vast majority of the poverty-stricken South. These relationships go well beyond concern with simple economics and politics. They touch the vast majority of mankind struggling for freedom and survival, a struggle which has certainly been plagued by \\\"frustrations\\\" as the Secretary-General aptly mentioned in his report on the work of the Organization [AI31/1/ Add.l].\n116.\tWe are happy to note, however, that since the last session of the General Assembly the international scene has undergone some salutary changes, which are no doubt due to the efforts of the much misrepresented third world. This is clearly evident in the strides made in decolonization and in the increasing momentum being gained by our own initiatives to establish a new international economic order. At the same time, there has been a stubborn resistance to progress on the part of some forces inimical to our interests. This is manifested in the most bizarre and barbarous forms of oppression in southern Africa as well as in the insensitivity of developed countries to the needs of the third world.\n117.\tWe remain concerned over the lingering colonial problems complicated by racism in southern Africa. Our skepticism could easily be excused on the basis of recent experience. We vividly recall that a little over a year ago, Vorster's Government promised the world that in less than six months there would be the most dramatic changes in Namibia.\n118.\tA year has passed, and today what we are witnessing is intense repression and a desperate search for puppets who would willingly sell their birthright and put themselves at the service of international imperialism and South African apartheid. In the meantime the legitimate .demands of the recognized representatives of Namibia, SWAPO, remain unheeded by the Vorster regime.\n\n119.\tPerhaps South Africa has reasons for being so stubborn and impervious to reason. Facts have revealed that South Africa has decided to delay its withdrawal from Namibia as long as possible, in order to continue the exploitation, not only of the mineral resources of that country, but also of the services of the African population, a regular source of cheap labor. My Government's commitment to Namibia's right to self-determination and independence remains unchanged. We therefore condemn South Africa's illegal occupation of that Territory, and again call for her total and immediate withdrawal from Namibia.\n120.\tMy Government continues to recognize SWAPO as the only legitimate representative of the people of Namibia devoted to the cause of self-determination and independence for that Territory. The recent stipulation of 1978 as the independence date for the Territory is totally unacceptable, because it merely seeks to provide time for South Africa to consolidate its stranglehold on the Territory and intensify its aggression against SWAPO.\n121.\tIn South Africa itself, the rising wave of brutality and inhumanity makes gruesome reading. We recall with abhorrence the recent incidents at Soweto and surrounding areas, characterized by the murder of school children, whose rude awakening to their inhuman conditions under apartheid was their only crime. Naturally, the victims of these atrocities have embarked on violent demonstrations which will continue until they are treated with equality and human dignity. In these circumstances, the situation in South Africa has clearly become a threat to international peace and security, which can be defused only by the abandonment of apartheid. It is our duty in this Assembly to strongly condemn the policy with all its horrible manifestations, and to appeal to each and every Member State to use every possible means to end this inhuman policy.\n122.\tThe illegal Smith regime in Zimbabwe, a subject of numerous debates in this Assembly, has suddenly realized that it has been the victim of self-deception. Events have brought home to them the bitter truth that time is not on their side. The freedom of the black majority in Zimbabwe can no longer be negotiated.\n123.\tWe are not unaware of the last-minute efforts that are being made from various quarters to avoid further bloodshed. We wish to emphasize, however, that similar initiatives have been taken before by African leaders without success, because of the intransigence and insincerity of Smith and Vorster. Indeed, it is not inopportune to recall the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  and the Victoria Falls meeting sponsored by the great African leader, Mr. Kenneth Kaunda.\n124.\tGiven the circumstances surrounding the recent attempt at settlement of the problem of Zimbabwe and Namibia, we would like to express our sincere hope that no secret concessions have been made for which the people of Zimbabwe and Namibia might have to pay dearly in the long run.\n125.\tHaving thus stated our reservations, we would like to express our appreciation to the United States Government \nfor its peace efforts and hope that they will be crowded with lasting success, particularly in Namibia, for as far as Zimbabwe is concerned, we believe that victory is already in sight.. We also hope that whatever happens, the United Nations, as the true and impartial guardian of the peace and security of the world, would be intimately involved in the settlement of these problems.\n126.\tMeanwhile, as the liberation struggle continues, we must commend the courage of the Governments of Zambia and Mozambique, which, in solidarity with the liberation movements in Namibia and Zimbabwe, have closed their frontiers to all traffic with Rhodesia. The price which they are paying is enormous. In making these sacrifices, and in coping with the consequent problems of their altruistic decisions, the support which these frontier States deserve from us must be given unreservedly. To this end, my Government urges all Members of this Organization, singly and collectively, to give every possible assistance to the front-line States that are suffering economic hard shops as a result of sanctions imposed on their racist neighbors.\n127.\tThe Middle East continues to present a problem of grave dimensions. Israel continues to occupy Arab lands and, contemptuous of public outcry, is going ahead with its plans to build Jewish settlements on those lands. The continuing presence of Israel in the Arab territories it acquired by force, and its violation of the sacred rights of the Palestinian people must clearly be regarded as a grave threat to peace and security in that region. We advocate full compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as we feel sure that a lasting solution can only be found through compliance with the provisions of these resolutions.\n128.\tMy delegation is also concerned about the growing relations between Israel and South Africa, which suggests the insensitivity of Israel to the sufferings of people under the oppressive yoke of apartheid. We hope that this is not the case.\n129.\tWhile the war in Lebanon may have temporarily diverted attention from the real issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the situation in itself, in our view, is fraught with danger. The war is a tragic and pathetic ramification and side-effect of the Middle East question. Unless the parties concerned realize the urgency of a negotiated settlement, we are afraid there will be more Lebanons as a prelude to a general conflagration in which there will be no winners but only losers. We commend the Secretary-General's enormous efforts in trying to minimize the devastating effects of the civil war in Lebanon. My country is deeply committed to the difficult search for peace and security in every corner of the globe.\n130.\tMy delegation shares the concern of this world body for the return of peace to the Korean peninsula. Consistent with our policies of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence, we are prepared to support any practical proposals aimed at establishing lasting peace in a spirit of mutual co-operation. In particular, the exchanges advocated in the North/South joint communique of 4 July 1972 and endorsed by the United Nations in 1973 s should be reactivated, as it provides a basis for communication and the ironing out of existing differences. The existing tensions can also be greatly eased by the conclusion of a non- aggression pact involving all the parties concerned. If such a pact were to replace the existing Armistice Agreement, it would significantly help to obliterate the lingering memories of the Korean War. We therefore appeal to all the parties concerned, through dialog and accommodation, to create an atmosphere in which peace and eventual unification can be realized.\n131.\tOn the question of Cyprus, it is a matter of deep regret that one of the States Members of this Organization has, through the years, been experiencing various forms of interference which compromise its territorial integrity and independence. As a result of some of these outside influences, there has been a constant state of virtual belligerency. We therefore appeal to all concerned to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus by the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory. We are confident that, left to themselves, the people of Cyprus will be able to reconstruct a prosperous and peaceful future.\n132.\tSince the end of the Second World War, and more especially in view of the destructive potential of nuclear armaments, the problem of disarmament has assumed increasing urgency for mankind. For us in the third world in particular, this problem constitutes one of the central themes in our program, realizing as we do, that peace and stability are vital to the orderly pursuit of our development programs. We realize also that no section of humanity is immune to the effects of a nuclear holocaust, or even the effects of conventional warfare. Thus, disarmament is no longer merely an aspect of detente and big-Power accommodation, but a problem of universal dimensions requiring universal concerted action for its solution.\n133.\tMy Government therefore fully supports the proposal for the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be followed by a World Disarmament Conference, which will work out suitable arrangements to prohibit the use, threat of use, and manufacture of nuclear weapons, the destruction of existing stockpiles and the prohibition of all nuclear-weapons tests in all environments as well as the destruction of all chemical and bacteriological weapons.\n134.\tOver the years the United Nations has certainly had some successes. Admittedly, it also has its record of failures, and one wonders to what extent these failures are the direct result of deficiencies inherent in the Charter has been recognized. My Government's postion has been that, in view of the changes which have taken place in the international scene since the inception of the United Nations, the time has come to bring the Charter up to date and in line with new contemporary realities.\n\n135.\tWe note with appreciation the work already done in this regard by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and the proposals it has put forward for discussion. In particular, my Government wishes to see the voting system in the Security Council reviewed, with \nparticular attention being paid to the power of the veto, which has so often been used to the detriment of the interests of the third world.\n136.\tAgain we have witnessed United Nations institutions responsible for development assistance in the developing countries go from one financial or liquidity crisis to another. This is particularly the case with that nerve center of the United Nations development efforts in the third world -the United Nations Development Program- which early this year suffered from a severe liquidity crisis that has led to the dislocation of priority development programs in recipient countries like mine. The reasons for those crises are indeed obvious. Some are political; others are the result of what one would term \\\"technocratic irrationality'' found in some of the specialized agencies with their all-capable and all-knowledgeable technical programs, which are, however, applied through the so-called \\\"competent channels\\\"-i.e. interest groups which, left on their own, can do nothing but reproduce the conditions creating the very development problems they are supposed to solve.\n137.\tAnother important institutional obstacle in the United Nations system can be traced to the fundamentally officious position assumed by some United Nations bodies which, when in the field, find themselves playing counterpoint to national governments, marginalizing civil societies and giving non-governmental organizations an almost ritual treatment. We believe that this is wrong and that any international organization should be committed to struggling alongside the people of the developing countries; it should not act as a vehicle for defending models to be imposed on the nations of the third world.\n138.\tIn the circumstances, the need for restructuring the United Nations system, especially its economic and social sectors, is more urgent now than ever. Although we share the views of the Secretary-General that such restructuring is, and I quote, \\\"an infinitely complex subject\\\" [see A/3111/Add.l, sect.X], Sierra Leone is indeed proud to have been a part of this effort, for it is our conviction that the restructuring of the United Nations should begin by some kind of collective self-criticism. Such criticism should be founded on research and study of the variety of concrete experiences arising out of the new international economic order and the concept of interdependence.\n139.\tPermit me now to make a few comments on the economic situation in the international community. Al-though a few dramatic events have taken place recently which had a tendency to tilt the balance of international economic relations in favor of the third world, a lot still remains to be done through concerted efforts if the present economic maladjustments that plague our international community are to be rectified.\n140.\tMy delegation is concerned over the fact that the recent meeting of the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea did not make any remarkable progress. The developed countries, desirous of maintaining their traditional economic power, are anxious to obtain guarantees of unrestricted access to the mineral wealth of the sea-bed. The developing countries, on the other hand, apprehensive of economic monopolies and the systematic erosion of their interests, have consistently called for the exploitation and distribution of the resources of the sea-bed on the basis of equity, bearing in mind the present imbalance in the world economic structure. It is hoped that in the next session, there would be a greater effort towards compromise so that a draft treaty on the Law of the Sea would finally emerge.\n141.\tMeanwhile, Member States should exercise restraint and refrain from embarking on unilateral exploitation of the sea-bed before a final draft treaty is universally concluded.\n142.\tWith the beginning of the North-South dialog a year or so ago and the establishment of the new international economic order, it can be reasonably assumed that the era of recriminations and confrontation is passing and being replaced by interdependence and self-reliance. More important still is the widespread acceptance of the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States, in which the economic philosophy of the developing world is so eloquently articulated.\n143.\tAs a small country, Sierra Leone has contributed and continues to contribute to the translation of the new international economic order into reality by strengthening regional, subregional and interregional co-operation with countries whose present socio-economic structures are similar to its own. We are convinced that these efforts would, in the final analysis, make the new order a turning-point in the history of international relations and transform the entire economic structure of the world. For us, the new economic order holds the prospect of major progress towards the realization of the economic and social aspirations of the vast dispossessed majority of mankind. Until recently, these millions could not hope for anything but the perpetuation of the traditional relations of dependency Which locked them firmly in the selfish strangle hold of the industrial nations and their transnational corporations.\n144.\tBased on these convictions, the developing countries have deployed considerable efforts to translate the concepts and principles of the new economic order into reality: from the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Manila culminating in the declaration of Manila,  the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Colombo, the fourth session of UNGTAD in Nairobi to the Group of 77 s recent Conference on Economic Co-operation Among Developing Countries in Mexico City. The philosophy behind these efforts is clear and simple: it is that any meaningful advancement by the developing countries must start with the removal of the root-causes of under-development.\n145.\tNo one can ignore the overwhelming debt-servicing and balance-of-payments pressures that have crippled some of our economies over the last few years. In 1972 the debt of non-oil-producing countries was only $15 billion. In 1976 it has soared to $120 billion.\n146.\tThe real rate of growth of the poorest countries, which before the oil crisis was 2 per cent, is now minus 0.8 \nper cent when allowance is made for population growth of 2.8 per cent. Indeed, the shrinking quantum of resources being transferred from the developed to the developing countries has combined with these pressures and many others, with which we are all too familiar, to decelerate the pace of our development and the growth of our economies. The eradication of these ills is the noble task in which we have called upon the industrialized countries to participate. Unfortunately, the response which they have made to the appeals of the third world in forums like UNCTAD in Nairobi and the North-South dialog in Paris, gives little hope of success as some of the promises, agreements and compromises reached during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly are still to be honored.\n147.\tWe are told, of course, that if the international monetary system can be reformed in the right direction, many of these problems will automatically disappear and the First and Second United Nations Development Decades will suddenly become meaningful and productive.\n148.\tWe see our salvation, however, as the result of a many-sided effort involving individual endeavor, regional co-operation and global collaboration. We have pursued our individual and regional efforts .with some consistency and reasonable success. In the latter area in particular, the growing contribution of the Mano River Union to the mutual development of Liberia and Sierra Leone and the emergency of the Economic Community of West African States give ample evidence of this. It is at the global level that results appear most disappointing because of a lack of goodwill on the part of those who are in a position to contribute most significantly.\n149.\tThe developed countries emphasize the importance of foreign aid (particularly food), the transfer of technology, international private investment, increased agricultural and food production, enhanced trade opportunities and rapid industrial growth. But they are, with notable exceptions, reluctant to accept the 0.7 per cent aid target suggested for the Second Development Decade, and- they shy away from the question of debt moratoriums. All these are traditional prescriptions calculated and insisted upon in order to maintain the old system and to frustrate any meaningful change. They voice their opposition to the integrated program for commodities and the establishment of a common fund for buffer stocks, and consider any idea of the indexation of prices as \\\"absolute anathema\\\". Consequently, the interest of the developing countries and the much-talked-of principle of interdependence are coldly cast aside.\n150.\tWhat the developing countries are seeking is the protection of the purchasing power of export earnings, the negotiation of commodity agreements, the formulation of the general principles of a pricing policy for commodity exports, compensatory financing schemes and buffer-stock arrangements-in short, greater stability in commodity prices and rising incomes.\n151.\tThese demands of the developing countries are just and reasonable. But this notwithstanding, we find varied opposition from the consumer nations. One group of developed nations opposes international commodity agreements f.i bolster prices as \\\"a matter of principle\\\" and are willing to go only as far as stabilizing foreign-exchange earnings through compensatory financing schemes; a second group is only prepared and willing to enter joint commodity pacts designed to reduce price seesaws and to guarantee a floor price; still a third group is willing to enter such pacts only on the condition that a ceiling based on so-called natural market forces is also agreed upon at the outset.\n152.\tFor the developing countries, there is nothing more frustrating than these diversionary tactics.\n153.\tI hope it has been amply demonstrated that one year after the proclamation of the new international economic order, the aspirations of the peoples of the third world are still far from being realized. Instead, conscious efforts are being made by the industrialized world to turn back the hands of time. There is hardly any sign whatever that concrete results are likely to emerge from the new international economic order, and certainly the main proponents of the old order-the developed countries-are doing all in their power to maintain that order intact. If the United Nations is to continue to have meaning and relevance, the new international economic order would demand a reversal of this trend.\n154.\tIn conclusion, Mr. President, let me recall that in the interdependent world of today, all our destinies are inextricably intertwined. There is only one humanity and we must survive or sink together.\n"

        "file_text": "In speaking for the first time from this rostrum in my new. capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Italian Republic, I wish, on behalf of the Government of which I have the honor to be a part, to convey to Ambassador Amerasinghe warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. I also wish to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation which have been voiced for the effective and impartial work of his predecessor, Mr. Thorn.\n154.\tIt is, in our opinion, particularly significant that such an eminent international personality has been chosen to discharge the highest responsibilities of the thirty-first session of this Assembly, the representative of a country known and appreciated for its active and incisive work in the cause of the strengthening of peace and the development of world co-operation.\n155.\tThis year, the Republic of Sri Lanka has rightly occupied the center of world attention for the dignified and successful way it organized and acted as host for the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. My Government has followed carefully the work of that important meeting and has noted with great interest its conclusions,' which were so significantly recalled yesterday by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [11th meeting].\n156.\tIn recent years world history has evolved more and more according to a single pattern in which all States, the various economic systems, and the prospects of progress and peace for all peoples of the world are united in interdependence.\n157.\tItaly is convinced of the need, which was also stressed at the Colombo Conference, to achieve a new international economic order which will allow every nation to follow the path of development most appropriate to its own requirements and traditions and to enjoy a fair share of the world process of the production and distribution of goods. This objective will be attained only in an economic system in which the basic problems of raw materials, trade, the indebtedness of the developing countries and the transfer of technology have been solved.\n158.\tAn essential component of this new international economic order is the development of the emerging countries. Italy, within the framework of the European Community, but also in its own right, intends to continue making every possible effort to ensure progress in this direction.\n159.\tIn particular, we intend to continue giving our financial and political support to the initiatives taken by the United Nations in favor of development. We support those programs in the developing countries which are designed to promote the balanced development of the economy-that is, which not only promote the expansion of the industrial sector, but are also aimed at achieving a modern agricultural sector capable of ensuring self- sufficiency in food. Along these lines Italy has actively encouraged the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, has pledged a substantial contribution to its initial capital and has declared its readiness to act as host for the new agency.\n160.\tItaly, in agreement with the other countries of the European Community, will continue to make an active and concrete contribution to the establishment of an equitable and stable system of international economic relations, working in the various appropriate forums, and primarily in UNCTAD and other United Nations bodies, as well as in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n161.\tThe field of international economic relations is, in our opinion-and I want to stress this -one where the United Nations and its dependent bodies have an essential role to play, a role which we think should be strengthened, extended and deepened.\n162.\tThis spirit of open-mindedness and friendly co-operation with the developing countries has just been significantly reaffirmed by my Government on the occasion of the welcome visit to Rome of the Prime Minister of Angola, Mr. Lopo do Nascimento.\n163.\tA condition which is necessary-though not in itself sufficient-to bring about the desirable strengthening of the role of the United Nations in this as in other fields of its work is the universality of the United Nations. Further progress has been made also this year towards the achievement of this goal with the admission of a new Member, the Republic of Seychelles, to which the Italian Government wishes, through me, to convey its warmest greetings, hoping at the same time that other countries, whose aspirations are well known, will soon be able to join the Organization.\n164.\tUniversality and the constructive participation of all will allow the United Nations to fulfill the task which the international community expects of it: the safeguarding of international peace and security. We all feel the need for a greater participation of the Organization in the control and solution of the political, economic and military crises which arise and become chronic in various parts of the world around us. Only the United Nations, because of its universality, can represent and harmonize the aspirations and interests of all States and all peoples; only the United Nations system, which was originally established on the foundation of an ethical and legal system of civilized international coexistence and has grown in size and authority on that foundation, can achieve a peace not only based on the hard reality of the balance of power but also guaranteed by the certainty of law and by justice.\n165.\tWith these convictions, Italy intends to participate actively in the efforts now being made to bring about the strengthening of the United Nations and the increased rationalization of its machinery while at the same time, in a responsible manner, it will not disregard the need felt in certain respects for an updating of the Charter, including its terminology, so as to reflect changed realities.\n166.\tThis Assembly has already heard the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands [7th meeting]; the representative of the country now exercising the presidency of the European Community. I wish to recall everything that he has said in that capacity as the expression of the joint convictions of our nine European countries and also as the expression of our common feelings in the face of conflicts which involve-as in Lebanon-an intolerable burden of destruction and human suffering.\n167.\tThe Italian Government, Parliament and public opinion are deeply concerned at the tragic events which have brought mourning and ruin to a country to which Italy has been and remains linked by ancient ties of solidarity and friendship.\n168.\tIn Lebanon there has for too long continued a situation which is further undermining security in an already very troubled region and which involves obvious risks of repercussions on a larger scale which would be difficult to control. Also, in accord with the other countries of the European Community, we have done our utmost to encourage every initiative to secure a truce and to support all efforts to settle the crisis, particularly those undertaken by the League of Arab States. The process of the political settlement of this crisis can be started only if it is based on respect for the unity, integrity and independence of Lebanon, which, in our opinion, are essential for the establishment of a just and balanced peace in the Middle East.\n169.\tWe maintain that the United Nations must stimulate the efforts being made at the regional level and facilitate them as much as possible.\n170.\tWe wish to express our appreciation for the humanitarian work which the United Nations has been and is carrying out in Lebanon, particularly under the direction of Secretary-General Waldheim.\n171.\tItaly, too, is participating in the humanitarian work of assistance and relief to the stricken peoples, but it is clear that the conscience of the international community expects and desires a more determined initiative capable of bringing about a truce and the start of negotiations.\n172.\tNow that President Sarkis has assumed the office of head of State, I wish to confirm Italy's hope that the convergence of views necessary to achieve a truce and the beginning of a process of detente and peace may be built up, in a new climate, around his person.\n173.\tNotwithstanding the complexity of their origins, the tragic events in Lebanon are also linked to the failure to find a just and lasting solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In particular, the connexion between the general Middle East crisis and the Lebanese situation clearly reveals the crucial need to reach a just solution of the Palestinian problem. Without a definite prospect of finding such a solution, the spiral of mistrust and tension will only increase.\n174.\tWe must work urgently and with determination to promote a sincere acceptance of the negotiating option involving all the parties concerned and covering all the different aspects of the Arab-Israeli dispute.\n175.\tTo this end, Italy is convinced that the negotiating process must be aimed at a comprehensive peace settlement within the framework of the resolutions of the Security Council. This settlement should be sought through the application of the following principles: first, the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied in June 1967 and the cessation of all those measures which, by consolidating the fait accompli of the occupation, are aimed in a direction opposite to the desirable one; secondly, respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States of the region, including Israel, within secure, recognized and internationally guaranteed frontiers precisely in order to meet this need in a concrete way, Italy, together with its partners in the European Community, may at an appropriate stage put forward suggestions for an effective system of international guarantees-and thirdly, recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people, aiming at the establishment of their own State, national rights which must be translated into facts.\n176.\tThe events in Lebanon and the crisis in the Middle East are not the only sources of serious concern to be found in the eastern Mediterranean, a region of such vital importance for world peace. We continue, in fact, to be deeply preoccupied by the question of Cyprus because of the prolonged delay in the achievement of a negotiated settlement. Italy, in the context of the political co-operation of the member States of the European Community, is actively encouraging the good offices rendered for some time now in such an intelligent and constructive way by the Secretary-General, Kurt Waldheim, to whom I am glad to convey the deep-felt appreciation of the Italian Government. We earnestly hope that the talks between the two communities will be resumed as soon as possible and will rapidly bring about a just solution based on respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Cyprus.\n177.\tBecause of the traditional friendship which links us to both parties and because of the ties which unite us with them within the North Atlantic Alliance and through the 239\nEuropean Community, we are, also seriously concerned at the differences which have arisen between Greece and Turkey and at the events in the Aegean. Italy fully supports the invitation recently addressed to them by the Security Council in its resolution 395 (1976) to resume negotiations and to seek a friendly settlement to their dispute, and, together with its partners in the European Community, stands available to facilitate every possible move in that direction.\n178.\tThe most recent and dramatic developments in southern Africa involve not only the defense of peace and security but also the realization of the principles of freedom, equality and justice jn which the values of the international community and the Charter of the United Nations are based.\n179.\tThe people of Namibia, in spite of the resolutions of the United Nations, which is responsible for this Territory, have not yet been granted the opportunity to exercise their right to independence through a democratic process involving all the political forces of the country, including SWAPO, under the supervision of the United Nations.\n180.\tIn Rhodesia, the spiral of armed clashes runs the risk of leading to an armed conflict with neighboring countries and may be stopped only with the acceptance of a peaceful transition of Zimbabwe to a system based on majority rule.\n181.\tIn South Africa, events have confirmed the collapse of the policy of apartheid, so often condemned by the United Nations, while tension is increasing throughout the country and prospects of achieving a just reorganization of interracial relations appear more and more difficult.\n182.\tTogether with the other countries of the European Community, Italy has expressed its support for the liberation of southern Africa from colonialism and racism. Italy supports the initiatives undertaken in co-operation with the front-line African countries in the search for peaceful solutions through which the genuine aspirations of the peoples concerned will be realized.\n183.\tIn particular, Italy, together with the other countries of the European Community, has followed with favor and expectation the efforts being made by Secretary of State Kissinger and the African leaders. Accordingly, the Italian Government expresses its appreciation and support for the British Government's intention to convene a conference to lay out the ground for the creation of a provisional Government in Rhodesia.\n184.\tThe crises that I have mentioned are certainly the major causes of tension which today threaten international peace and security since the long war in Indochina was finally brought to an end.\n185.\tIn that region, a patient work of reconstruction is in progress and the Italian Government, mindful of the mourning and sacrifices that this conflict has entailed, shares the hope that a national reconciliation will allow all available energies to be channeled towards objectives of progress and civilization.\n186.\tThe recent incidents which have taken place in Korea and the tension prevailing there provide a clear confirmation of the urgent need for a resumption of the dialog and a normalization of relations between the two States of the peninsula.\n187.\tTo defend peace not only in those areas where it is today directly threatened but also iA regions where the presence of large military forces confronting each other is a constant source of concern, there is no other path but the progressive and balanced reduction of these forces. Italy intends to make its own active contribution to this goal in all appropriate international forums.\n188.\tWe are therefore taking part with conviction in the Vienna negotiations for the mutual and balanced reduction of the forces in central Europe, and we are looking forward with confidence and expectation to the steps which we hope the major nuclear Powers will take along the path traced out by the first agreements for the limitation of strategic weapons and by the subsequent understandings reached at Vladivostok.\n189.\tMoreover, we cannot conceal our disappointment at the limited progress so far achieved in the field of reductions of atomic weapons, in spite of the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. Everything, or nearly everything, still remains to be accomplished in this respect; and Italy, which has signed, ratified and implemented that Treaty and expects the other signatories to do the same, is fully aware of this situation.\n190.\tItaly is, furthermore, continuing to be actively engaged in Geneva in the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. This is still considered by us the main forum for disarmament negotiations, whether on nuclear or conventional weapons. Its work, however, I must stress, can go forward only to the extent that the States participating in it have a real desire to make progress. In this respect, we cannot refrain from emphasizing that the summer session of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has produced certain important new elements which could be further developed. We cite among others the new proposals for the prohibition of chemical weapons, the substantial and positive beginning which has been made by the seismic experts in their meetings on the control of nuclear explosions and the progress achieved with regard to environmental war, with the elaboration of a draft convention on that subject.\n191.\tIt is, however, not the intention of the Italian Government to confine its action to the negotiations within the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. It is indeed our intention to offer an active contribution to the achievement of concrete progress towards new operational agreements wherever possible. But disarmament is merely an element -at the same time, one of the causes and the effect of detente in East-West relations.\n192.\tCertainly, in accordance with the spirit and commitment of all the signatories of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on security and Co-operation in Europe, detente must continue to inspire East-West relations; but, if it is to be maintained and consolidated, detente must be given new dimensions and must be nurtured with more ambitious ideals. It is not enough merely to create better conditions for the development of substantial economic, commercial, technical and scientific links between the countries.of the two areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Detente must progressively and effectively remove the causes of conflict and confrontation -a confrontation which, anyhow, the European conscience has always considered a violent, painful and undesirable tearing apart of its own historical and cultural fabric.\n193.\tIn this spirit, and in anticipation of the conference to be held next year in Belgrade to review the status of the implementation of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, Italy insists on the balanced fulfillment of the Final Act in all its parts, particularly the part concerning the free circulation of individuals and ideas.\n194.\tI believe that what I have said gives a fair idea of the basic guidelines of Italy's foreign policy. It is a policy of dialog, open discussion and co-operation. But it is also a policy of principles based on respect for and affirmation of the rights of States and the fundamental freedoms of their citizens.\n195.\tInspired by those principles, we are operating not only in the broad framework of bilateral relations but also on a series of different levels which are none the less interdependent: the European Community, the Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations.\n196.\tIt is a policy whose general aspects are well known; its basic choices date back many years and on them there exists a full measure of agreement in our national Parliament, among our political forces and throughout our country.\n197.\tThe design of the European Union remains a fundamental political choice which we wish to confirm and develop. This process has now entered upon a new phase involving deeper commitment as a result of the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government of the nine members of the European Community to elect the European Parliament on the basis of universal and direct suffrage. We have thus created the pre-conditions for the more vigorous participation of our peoples in the pro-gramme for the unification of Europe of which they must be the protagonists.\n198.\tThe European Community is not, in our view, a political area sufficient unto itself and closed within itself. On the contrary, we conceive it as a new reality better suited to the needs of international co-operation and equilibrium, capable of enriching and improving the dialog with other regions and of making a more substantial and comprehensive contribution to the peace and progress of peoples.\n199.\tThis prospect does not undermine the full validity of our participation in the Atlantic Alliance. During the last 39 years the Atlantic Alliance has been a decisive factor for equilibrium and peace in Europe and has encouraged the gradual process of detente, which has led to the improvement of relations between East and West. We are convinced that the role of the Alliance is still essential for the maintenance of peace and for the preservation of a balance which will allow further possibilities of co-operation between peoples and between different regimes and institutional systems.\n'.00. With those neighboring countries which are not members of the European Community or of the Atlantic Alliance Italy maintains constructive relations of friendship and is seeking every opportunity for co-operation.\n201.\tWe maintain relations of friendship and co-operation with all the countries of the Mediterranean area, to which we are linked by historical, cultural and economic ties which date back centuries, and we wish to make these\nrelations even closer and more fruitful. \u00ab \u2022\n202.\tIn the same spirit and in full respect for the autonomy of others, Italy intends to develop co-operative relations on a basis of effective equality with all other countries, both near and far.\n203.\tAware of the objective limitations inherent in this national dimension of modern States, Italy confirms its full commitment to the United Nations, its firm determination to contribute to the work of the Organization in favor of peace, security and international co-operation, disarmament and detente, the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke, the abolition of racial discrimination, and economic and social development based on equilibrium and justice.\n204.\tConfronted with the seriousness of the phenomenon of terrorism and with the recent increase in some of its most heinous manifestations, Italy maintains that the United Nations is in duty bound to make a valid contribution to the solution of that problem also. We therefore regard as timely the proposal announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany for the elaboration within the United Nations of a draft convention against the taking of hostages [A/311242].\n205.\tWe attach particular importance to action in defense of human rights and human freedoms, and we hope that the Commission on Human Rights will be raised to the status of a constitutional organ of the United Nations with the parallel establishment of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Every possible increase in the responsibilities of the United Nations in that field will have our support and we shall continue in every forum to protest against and to condemn all violations of human freedom and dignity wherever they occur and whoever commits them-in Africa as in Latin America, in Asia as in Europe.\n206.\tIn this spirit and inspired by these principles, Italy is taking part in the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n207.\tThe agenda before us is vast and complex and comprises questions of great importance, for the peaceful and orderly development of international relations.\n208.\tIn the coming weeks we shall examine and discuss these questions in a constructive spirit and with the mutual respect which, I am certain, under the President's eminent guidance, will always characterize our debates.\n209.\tI can assure the President that my delegation and I will spare no effort to ensure that the results we shall achieve will enable the thirty-first session to be considered as an important stage in the life and work of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, to extend my delegation's congratulations to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-first session. We were pleased and satisfied at his election to this high office, knowing the efficiency, flexibility and devotion with which he pursues the noble objectives of the United Nations. It is also a recognition of the constructive role played by his country in the cause of justice, freedom and liberty in the world. An eloquent example was the success of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in his friendly country last summer . His presidency of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been, and will continue to be, an object of our admiration and appreciation. In addition, our country has been honored by a visit from Mr. Amerasinghe early this year, a visit which has promoted further the links of friendship and co-operation between our two countries.\n147.\tAllow me also, to extend, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere thanks to Mr. Amerasinghe's predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who ably and efficiently presided over the last session.\n148.\tThe Government of my country also wishes to express its deepest appreciation of the sincere efforts that have been, and are still being, exerted by Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of our Organization, to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and to, strengthen its role in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n149.\tMy delegation would like to extend its congratulations to the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to membership in our world Organization. We wish this country success in its new vocation, and we are fully prepared to co-operate with it in the interests of both our countries and for the sake of mankind at large.\n150.\tI should like also to join my colleagues who preceded me in expressing the earnest hope that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, as well as the People's Republic of Angola, will be admitted in the near future as Members of our Organization. We proceed in this context from our faith in the principle of the universality of the United Nations and the imperative need for it to be representative of all peoples and countries of the world, irrespective of their political or economic system.\n151.\tWe in the United Arab Emirates have received with sorrow and sadness the news of the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung. To the great people of China and their Government, we express our deepest condolences.\n152.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security is the most important objective for which the United Nations was established. In our statement to the General Assembly last year,  we pointed out that our Organization is facing grave problems and challenges; and we considered the continuation of these problems and challenges without a radical solution to be a matter endangering international security.\n153.\tThese problems and challenges still loom in the foreground at this thirty-first session. It may even be said that the continuation of these challenges without radical solutions has led to the eruption of new serious situations, as we see in the Middle East and Africa. Thus, we see that the arrogance of Israel and its non-compliance with United Nations resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian problem and the Middle East question have led to persistent and unceasing tension in that region.\n154.\tLikewise, the continuation of the white minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa has been conducive to the detonation of a war that may engulf the whole of Africa in a sea of blood-Africa, which most urgently needs peace and stability in order to rebuild itself and its economy after long, bleak decades of poverty and backwardness.\n155.\tWhile expressing our thanks and gratitude to the world community for adopting resolutions designed to ensure the right of peoples under alien domination to self-determination, the results of which are evidenced in the movement of the United Nations towards the realization of the universality of its membership and the steps that have been taken, and will be taken, to liberate the peoples of southern Africa from colonialism, foreign occupation and racial discrimination, we find ourselves overwhelmed with feelings of dismay and disappointment at the fact that the people of Palestine have not been allowed to join this great historical march.\n156.\tIn this respect, we are fully aware of the decisions taken by the United Nations in including the question of Palestine as a separate item in the agenda of the General Assembly  and in inviting the Palestine liberation Organization to participate in the deliberations of the General Assembly on that question [resolution 3210 (XXIX)]. \n157.\tWe also acknowledge the continued United Nations consideration of the Palestine question in substance and in some of its implications under four items included in the General Assembly's agenda.\n158.\tWe further express our thanks and gratitude to the United Nations for the resolutions, adopted under those and other items, which reaffirmed the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, to return to their land, and to exercise their national sovereignty, which condemned Israel for its inhuman practices against the Palestinian people, stressing the imperative need for its withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, and which condemned Zionism, the corner-stone of the Israeli entity, as a racist movement [resolution 3379 (XXX].\n159.\tThe value inherent in any resolution adopted by this international Organization is not confined to its human and moral implications, but includes also the steps that may be taken for its implementation.\n160.\tProceeding from this fact, it is our view that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session to form a Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [resolution 3376 (XXX)], and the recommendations of that Committee [see A/31 /35], which we support and uphold, could not lead to any desired good unless they were followed by positive and effective measures for their implementation.\n161.\tIn this connexion, we regret the attitude of some States towards those recommendations, when they were brought up for consideration of the Security Council. We further condemn Israel for its refusal to comply with those recommendations.\n162.\tWe had stated in the Security Council  that, despite our reservations on some of those recommendations, we considered them positive on the whole and an initial step towards the achievement of the principles and purposes of the Charter, inasmuch as the latter relate to the Palestinian people.\n163.\tWe may therefore expect the General Assembly to take effective measures at this session for the implementation of those recommendations.\n164.\tThe recent events that have demonstrated the development of full collaboration and co-ordination between the Governments of Israel and South Africa in the various political, military and economic fields, have upheld the- validity of our case in condemning Zionism, the basis of the existence of Israel, as racism. The unholy alliance and the co-operation between South Africa and Israel emanate from the very tenets on. which their respective regimes are. founded, tenets which discriminate among men, by. denying the rights of the original citizen to his own country, while bestowing those rights on aliens.\n165.\tWe are following with great interest the developments in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia. Our\nGovernment, since its accession to membership in the United Nations, has manifested its extreme concern at the seriousness of the continued white minority regimes in those African territories. We have strongly condemned the policy of apartheid practiced by the South African Government, because this policy constitutes a challenge of the most fundamental human ideals and rights and a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. Today, we notice with satisfaction the increasing isolation imposed by the international community on the two racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia, and the growing activities of the African liberation movements in their struggle to regain the dignity of their peoples and their sovereignty over their national soil.\n166.\tWe hope that all the efforts for-the attainment of a peaceful settlement of this grave situation, which poses a threat to Africa's security and integrity and could consequently endanger international peace and security, will be crowned with success. However, and in the absence of such settlement, we can only extend moral and material aid to the African liberation movements to enable them to achieve their noble objectives of liberation and independence.\n167.\tThe United Nations has made serious efforts to find a solution to the question of Cyprus, thanks to the endeavors of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in particular his personal efforts in this respect. We appreciate those efforts and request our Secretary-General not to halt his endeavors. The bitter fact, nevertheless, is that Cyrpus should still have to wait for a just solution of the problem, a solution that will take into consideration the interests of the Turkish and Greek communities and maintain the independence and territorial integrity of the island.\n168.\tThe United Arab Emirates has supported, since its inception, the United Nations resolution declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We further endorse all measures and steps designed to give- effect to this declaration and ensure that it is respected. We sincerely work for the consolidation of co-operation among the Gulf States, and we spare no effort for the realization of security and stability in our region. We have continuously called for the peaceful solution of any differences that may arise among States in our region without any foreign intervention. In this respect, we proceed from our belief in the need to keep the Gulf region far removed from super-Power rivalries.\n169.\tThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates has noted with regret that the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has failed to make any substantial .progress. In spite of the fact that there is some agreement on certain significant points in the law of the sea, such as the definition of the 12-mile limit of territorial waters; the sovereignty of the coastal State over its resources, the definition of the 200-nautical-mile economic, zone, the freedom of navigation through straits connecting two high seas, and rules to prevent marine pollution, the very important matter of the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond territorial waters as the common heritage of mankind is still subject to sharp differences, and no concrete progress has been made at the last session in this regard.\u2003\n170.\tThe United Arab Emirates attaches great importance to this matter, and earnestly hopes that the Conference will succeed at its next session in working out rules for the authority and for a just regime for the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed for the sake of mankind as a whole. We honestly believe that the attainment of a solution to this problem would be one of the greatest achievements of our Organization since its establishment.\n171.\tMuch as we may feel proud of the achievements made in the field of political liberation, we are still concerned at the lack of parallel progress in the economic domain. The third world continues to suffer from poverty and deprivation, and the deep gap between developed industrialized countries and developing countries continues to grow wider.\n172.\tWe are deeply concerned that there still exists strong resistance on the part of developed countries to the implementation of the resolutions on the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI)and 3202 (S-VI)], and to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session on the. Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. We are aware, moreover, that no significant progress has been achieved at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n558\n173.\tWe also regret the failure of the fourth session of UNCTAD to realize the aspirations of developing countries which were voiced in the Manila Declaration and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in its sixth and seventh special sessions.\n174.\tWe welcome the Economic Declaration and the Program of Action on Economic Co-operation, approved by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/31/197, annexes II and III], and we also consider that international recognition of the principles contained in the documents of that Conference provide a sound program on the global level, and constitute a worthy contribution to the efforts being made to realize justice in the new international economic relations.\n175.\tIt is also our view that the plan of the developing countries which produce raw materials and commodities in undertaking fresh initiatives based on the principles approved by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Lima in 1975, in the implementation of the Lima Program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity should receive encouragement. Here, reference should be made to the relevance of the Manila Declaration to the definition of the economic philosophy of the developing countries, which we further believe should serve as the basis for a new international economic order that requires the removal of exploitative methods from the fields of trade, industry, finance and technology.\n176.\tIn addition, we hold the view that economic co-operation among developing countries could ensure the establishment of the new international economic order, the Mexico Conference having examined the various necessary methods and alternative measures to realize the principle of self-reliance, which stems from self-confidence on the part of developing countries.\n177.\tMy country, a small, developing and newly independent nation, believes in the principles of non-alignment and peaceful co-operation among States. It has directed special attention to external aid, and has made generous contributions to alleviate the stress of economic difficulties which afflict developing countries as a direct consequence of the severe imbalance in the international economic structure and the monetary inflation which has been exported to those countries by the industrialized developed countries.\n178.\tIn the future, we will continue to offer our assistance within our limited resources as a developing country to other third-world countries.\n179.\tOur deep belief in the enlightened principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations will always motivate our actions and guide our participation in setting up a just international order based on equality between States and directed towards furthering the noble cause of human progress to new vast horizons ensuring goodness and plenty for all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "behalf of Chad on the occasion of your brilliant election to the presidency of the thirty-first regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. Those who thus have entrusted you with this challenging responsibility know that your abilities as a statesman and your far-reaching knowledge of the problems confronting the international community will enable you to guide our work with the necessary tact and authority, so that some of these urgent and grave problems, may find a felicitous and just solution in conformity with the principles of our Charter. I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, that you come from a third-world country, the Republic of Sri Lanka, whose contribution to the struggle of peoples for independence, freedom and dignity has been so clearly demonstrated. You are indeed the right man to stimulate the necessary efforts to find solutions capable of effectively ensuring justice, peace and security in the world, and I should like to pledge to you the whole-hearted co-operation of the delegation of Chad.\n2.\tI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, who skilfully and wisely fulfilled his mandate as President of the thirtieth session.\n3.\tMay I also express my country's best wishes to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, whose great abilities, devotion and persevering will to succeed have been strikingly apparent in the service of our Organization.\n4.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Chad I wish to greet the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles, whose presence\n' here is a source of satisfaction to us. However, we regret that Viet Nam and Angola, two independent countries, have not yet been admitted to membership in our Organization,\n5.\tChad has already conveyed to the great Chinese people and to its leaders the profound sorrow of our people, of our High Military Council and of our Government on the death of Mao Tsetung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, and my delegation would like to reiterate those sentiments here.\n6.\tEach year, at this time, we have the opportunity to meet in the General Assembly hall to reflect together on problems confronting our world in crisis. These problems are as numerous as they are complex, and generate points of tension in different parts of the world that the international community is concerned to eliminate in order to secure the maintenance of international peace and security. The greater the progress of science and technology, which are making gigantic strides for the welfare of mankind, the more conscience-stricken we are by poverty, ignorance, racial discrimination, expansionism, Zionism and so forth. Although the international community has achieved satisfactory results in recent years in the matter of co-operation, decolonization and detente, many disturbing situations unfortunately persist, and these we believe should be considered only by the United Nations. On this occasion I should like to reiterate my country's position on the burning questions of our day, which generate political instability in the world and constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n7.\tIn an address broadcast on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Second Republic of Chad, our Head of State, General Fllix Malloum Ngakoutou Bey-Ndi, the Chairman of the High Military Council and of the provisional Government, reaffirmed our devotion to the principles of conciliation, reconciliation, unity and good- neighborliness -principles which are constant elements in our domestic policy.\n8.\tWith regard to foreign affairs, the Head of State of Chad unequivocally reaffirmed our faith in the United Nations and our unwavering support for the principles of the non-aligned movement and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], whose object, like that of the United Nations, is the maintenance of international peace and security.\n9.\tThe questions of Rhodesia and Namibia have been discussed at such length in this Organization and elsewhere that it is unnecessary to recall the numerous violations of our decisions by those who stood to benefit by such violations. I shall therefore confine myself to indicating my Government's position on the latest developments.\nA/31/PV.23\n10.\tWe believe that all the initiatives that have now been taken, although belatedly, to bring Ian Smith and his henchmen to review their position should be considered \nrealistically, provided the United Kingdom gives a favorable reception to the appeal made by five African Heads of State for the urgent convening, outside Rhodesia, of a constitutional conference representing all Rhodesians. However, if such a conference is to be useful, we must see to it that it gives effect to the real and legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe, who have been forced, as we know, to take up arms. In the meantime the reactionaries should be given no chance to loosen the vice in which their regime is being squeezed, or to prepare favorable opportunities for the maneuvers of the imperialists, whose unchanging objective is to install, throughout Africa, retrograde Governments that they could easily manipulate. That is why the patriotic forces of Zimbabwe must continue their struggle.\n11.\tFor our part, we believe that all the measures we take must be directed to the following: first, the total elimination from the political scene of Ian Smith, his Government and the black Rhodesians who are gravely compromised with his regime; secondly, the establishment of a transitional Government composed of members of all the groups that have long been struggling for the genuine independence of Rhodesia, pending free elections, based on universal suffrage, with the participation of all the Rhodesian people; thirdly, the participation of all the freedom fighters, without exception, in any negotiations; and lastly, the immediate liberation of all political prisoners.\n12.\tIn Namibia, all efforts to find a solution have been contemptuously disregarded and frustrated by those who wish to perpetuate their domination over that country, which has vast natural resources. Here, as in Rhodesia, the people aspire only to freedom, justice and human dignity. To realize these aspirations it is essential to begin by ensuring their national unity and territorial integrity and to prevent the maneuvers of the apartheid regime, which seeks to create so-called national homelands, grotesquely called \\\"bantustans\\\". Moreover, the laws stemming from the so-called constitutional talks at Windhoek, which were held with the participation of dubious individuals whose allegiance to the Vorster regime gives them no moral authority to discuss the interests of the Namibian people, must be rejected. The South West Africa People's Organization, the only movement recognized by OAU because it is the authentic representative of that people, must take part in these negotiations if there is to be real peace in the region. Any attempted solution that did not take this aspect of the question into account could only lead to an intensification of the violence whose dimensions it would be difficult to gage.\n13.\tWe believe the time has come to carry out unhesitatingly the provisions of the Security Council resolutions on Namibia, in particular resolution 385 (1976), and to extend the necessary assistance to the Nambian people in their struggle for independence. If nothing is done, the freedom fighters will have no choice but to extend their guerrilla activities to all fronts until they achieve victory.\n14.\tIn South Africa a national movement has arisen which sufficiently demonstrates the resolve of the black masses to rid themselves of the inhuman and tyrannical apartheid system. Is it not shocking that, at a time when the international conscience is more than ever horrified by the murder of women, school children, and other innocent people perpetrated by the Vorster Government in Soweto and other townships in South Africa, the allies of this sinister personage continue shamelessly to use wretched excuses to sell war material to South Africa or to assist it to manufacture such material The judgment of the racists in power in Pretoria is clouded to such an extent that one of their spokesmen, the Minister of Police, had the unbelievable audacity to declare on 10 September last: \\\"There is a historic situation in South Africa where the white man is in a position of authority which he is not ready to give up.\\\"\n15.\tHowever, the erosion of this so-called authority will not be prevented either by criminal and gratuitous repres\u00acsion, or by the supply of increasingly sophisticated arms, which encourages increasing repression. The international community, which has declared the minority racist regime in South Africa illegal in its resolution 3411 (XXX) and declared the apartheid policy to be an international crime, must not be content with tolerating the situation prevailing in the zone. It must rather realize the grave threat which the apartheid regime poses to international peace and security in order to find appropriate measures which could effectively assist the population to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination. It should, moreover, demand the liberation of all the political prisoners, thousands of students, African opposition leaders opposing the apartheid regime and other political detainees under the laws on \\\"terrorism and the security of the State.\\\" As regards South Africa, we would be committing a grave error if we were gulled by the idea advanced by some that the independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia will cause apartheid to fall of its own weight like an overripe fruit.\n16.\tThe problems of concern to southern Africa are unfortunately to be found in other regions of Africa and the world where peoples are still subjected to imperialism, colonialism, racism and Zionism.\n17.\tIn this connexion, we cannot fail to mention the infringement of the sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros by the former colonial Power. Our attitude towards the dismemberment of that country, in total disregard of the aspirations of its people, has been clearly expressed from this rostrum last year.  I will not repeat it here; but I should like to stress unequivocally that my Government considers that the occupation of a part of the territory of a State constitutes, whatever the motivations may be, an extremely dangerous precedent. This behavior, which increasingly affects some States in violation of international law and the will of peoples, should be systematically rejected. It should lead us to be increasingly vigilant if we want to avoid the dismemberment in the near future of a State Member of this Organization by those who want to indulge in this game either by force of arms or by simple subversion where secessionist impulses are present.\n18.\tLet us now turn to the situation in the Middle East, where no solution has been found despite the numerous initiatives and resolutions adopted in this regard. There has been no satisfactory solution because these efforts have constantly come up against deliberate obstacles set up by those who think they stand to profit therefrom.\n19.\tThe prolonged sufferings of our Arab brothers, the origins of which are well-known, must be brought to an end through the attainment of a genuine and durable peace. The oft-repeated principles for a settlement are acceptable; hence, any other maneuver, however subtle, would only amount to a smoke-screen. A genuine and durable peace means, first and foremost, the immediate evacuation of Arab and African territories illegally occupied by Israel since 1967; secondly, the restoration to the Palestinians of all their inalienable rights; thirdly, international guarantees for all the States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries; fourthly, compensation to the Arab peoples, particularly the Arab people of Palestine, for damages due to Israeli aggression.\n20.\tLikewise, we feel profound sorrow at the Lebanese tragedy which stems directly from the Israeli-Arab conflict. The destruction of Lebanon only renders more evident the urgency and the need to find a global solution in this part of the world.\n21.\tThe small countries, more than the developed ones, need the United Nations to develop and to see their interests protected.\n22.\tIf the fundamental principles of our Organization are immutable, none the less the Charter contains some obsolete provisions. Proof of this is the right of veto, which is being abused by certain permanent members of the Security Council to protect their selfish interests. The Security Council, whose principal role is to safeguard international peace and security, should reflect the geographical composition of the international community. The area of international peace and security should not be the exclusive monopoly of the great Powers. The right of veto, to mention but one of the obsolete provisions of the Charter, is an anachronistic institution. We should correct certain errors harking back to a time that has been superseded to turn our Organization into an effective tool for co-operation among States for the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security.\n23.\tAs our Head of State has already had occasion to state to the Secretary-General on the occasion of his official visit to N'Djamena on 12 May 1976: \\\"We in Chad have great hopes in the future of this community\\\".\n24.\tThe independence acquired it great cost is being consolidated where foreign and sordid interests seek to question it. I should like therefore to renew the sincere greetings of Chad to the glorious people of socialist Viet Nam, of Laos and Kampuchea, whose striking victories over the forces of evil prove, if need be, that no foreign intervention can frustrate the desire of people to live freely as they wish. We sincerely wish that after having endured 30 years of ruthless and unjust wars these people might finally know peace in order to devote their entire energies to the reconstruction of their destroyed economy and to the rehabilitation of their social and cultural life, which has suffered such upheavals as a result of foreign intervention. Thus, they could fully contribute to our efforts here to improve the peaceful relations among nations and to establish justice in their relations.\n25.\tMy country, which prizes peace and justice, subscribes unreservedly to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the strict respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States.\n26.\tWe firmly oppose the use of force in international relations; this practice is only aimed at the small countries which do not have sufficient means to enjoy their legitimate right to self-defense. We support a convention on the non-use of force in relations among States.\n27.\tWe also sincerely believe that the extravagant territorial claims and the campaigns of subversion, aided and abetted by certain States, greatly increase the risk of international tension and constitute a serious threat to international peace and security. We welcome the efforts of the General Assembly, which adopted resolution 3496 (XXX) of 15 December 1975 aimed at convening in 1977 a conference of plenipotentiaries on the succession of States in the matter of treaties in order to draft a convention, one of whose essential provisions would be to guarantee existing frontiers among States.\n28.\tThese sacrosanct ideas of peace, justice and peaceful coexistence enshrined in the Charter are a guarantee for small countries, including mine.\n29.\tWhile colonialism is progressively crumbling, other insidious forms of domination, remote-controlled by imperialism, gradually emerge in order to disturb friendly and brotherly relations among States which have just acceded to independence. If we do not rapidly unmask these vicious maneuvers, peace in the entire world will be jeopardized. In this connexion, I should like to refer to questions increasingly raised in the minds of people concerning the relations of my country and some of its neighbors relations mentioned in an Associated Press release and reflected in some of the mass media, including The New York Times of 10 September 1976. In an article which can only be called extravagant, in mentioning some countries including Chad, The New York Times said, inter alia, that Chad apparently had sold off part of its territory to a neighboring State in return for substantial economic assistance, and no one had protested this.\n30.\tWe should wonder what the people in my country think of these reports. I would like to say that vast efforts have been undertaken by the new regime radically to change the mentality of the Chadian masses, who are now becoming increasingly aware of the just relations they should maintain with one another and with their neighbours, how they should handle internal or external subversion, and the vigilance and responsibilities they require in order to exercise full control over the exploitation of their natural resources, taking into account the backwardness and the obscurantism into which they have been deliberately plunged by colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism. Our country has been listed by the United Nations as one of the poorest countries on the planet-a land-locked country where internal communications become impracticable during each rainy season.\n31.\tWe should like to state that we are working to eliminate these difficulties, but it should be clearly understood once and for all that despite these factors, the Chadian people will never compromise on the vital questions of its independence, its sovereignty and the total integrity of its territory.\n32.\tI should like to state today, before world public opinion, that my country will never yield one inch of its territory to anyone.\n33.\tAs I have already stated at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo, nothing will weaken the idea that the Chadian people truly constitute a nation of all its children, including those who are now expatriates for various reasons, and nothing will detract us from the duty to defend it.'\n34.\tAs regards the Indian Ocean, I should like to reaffirm the positive vote of my delegation on resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971 and other resolutions declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. We should like to appeal to the great Powers and the main maritime users to conform to the relevant decisions of the United Nations.\n35.\tAs regards Cyprus, we should like to reaffirm our determination to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The solution of the Cyprus problem can only result from direct negotiations between the two communities -the Greek-Cypriots and the Turkish- Cypriots-without any foreign interference.\n36.\tAfter this brief political outline, I should like to deal briefly with economic questions.\n37.\tIn this connexion, I should like to point out with profound regret that we continue to live in a world of good intentions, where concrete actions and political will are often absent. Indeed, the meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [ UNCTAD] follow one another, the North-South Conference is marking time, and something which indeed bears repeating-the gap that separates the rich and the poor becomes wider and wider. The third world is left to draw the balance sheet of its poverty, all the more aggravated by the problem of foreign debt.\n38.\tThe alarming element of the present situation is that the developing countries, which represent 70 per cent of the world's population, have only 30 per cent of the world income.\n39.\tThe developed countries are aware of this state of affairs, but they remain indifferent or, at most, endorse it; but the increasing awareness of the international community cannot remain indulgent to such an attitude which, in plain words, is a deliberate act further to enrich the minority and to impoverish the majority, and to maintain it in a situation of poverty, disease, hunger and illiteracy.\n40.\tFaced with the urgent problems of raw materials and development, the sixth special session of the General Assembly adopted resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) relating to the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n41.\tDealing with these problems at its seventh special session, the General Ass\\;mbJy, through resolution 3362 (S-VII) requested the fourth session of UNCTAD to come to decisions on the improvement of market structures in the area of raw materials and commodities, including decisions relating to an integrated program and the implementation of the elements of this program.\n42.\tInternational action in favor of trade in commodities has not made general progress since the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n43.\tIt is not surprising that many of the provisions of this Strategy concern commodities, since these provide a large portion of the foreign exchange earnings of the great majority of developing countries.\n44.\tThus, turning more particularly to the community of poor nations, we believe that the dynamics of future development cannot be confined to \\\"bipolar\\\" relations between third-world countries and developed countries but should also be founded on the strengthening of economic co-operation among developing countries in order to translate into concrete action the notion of collective self-sufficiency. As the production capacity of our countries increases and as our own internal consumption is intensified, our countries should strengthen their over-all infrastructure by strengthening their ties in the commercial, financial and monetary fields as well as in the areas of production and investment. In future, these links could be expanded in order to encompass new types of distribution in all areas.\n45.\tIn this connexion, the Mexico Conference that has just completed its work, has laid the groundwork for horizontal co-operation more than ever necessary. It was successful in so far as there was unanimity in the adoption of measures concerning production, trade, infrastructure, services and, particularly, monetary and financial areas, the area of science, technology and technical co-operation.\n46.\tThe establishment of a new, international economic order as we see it would remain an insoluble problem if developed States persist in their egoism and fail to agree to fundamental changes in relations governing existing trade relationships.\n47.\tI should like to dwell for a minute on the Third United Nations Conference 011 the Law of the Sea whose work, Mr. President, you have been guiding for the past few years.\n48.\tThis important Conference, whose aims are the drafting and the conclusion of a convention which would lay down international maritime law, is deadlocked despite the increasing efforts that you, Mr. President, and the representatives of developing countries have unceasingly exerted. In the opinion of my delegation, the responsibility for the little progress achieved at the fifth session of that Conference devolves upon the maritime Powers, which deliberately delay the work of the Conference in order to exploit for their own profit the resources of the sea-bed. Their intention is to include in the future convention provisions which would further strengthen their position of hegemony.\n49.\tThe future convention should take into account the interests of all parties concerned, bearing in mind the new international economic order and the principles of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX]. Chad, which is a land-locked country, will support any initiative aimed at including in this convention provisions according preferential treatment to developing countries which are land-locked and geographically disadvantaged.\n50.\tI cannot close the economic part of my statement without dealing with its corollary, that of the foreign debt which, according to the conclusions of the Conference just held in Stockholm, grouping businessmen of 34 countries under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce, today amounts to $US 120 to 170 billion. Within the present international context, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the developing countries to repay this debt and the interest incurred unless their foreign exchange earnings are guaranteed. Consequently, it is essential to ensure to these countries effective guarantees that their products will sell at competitive prices on the world market.\n51.\tIt is therefore urgently necessary to convene an international conference on debt which could study the modalities and payments arrangements. Such a conference, in my view, would undoubtedly foster a better understanding of the real scope of this heavy burden and would prove to all the urgent need to establish a new international economic order enabling developing countries to discharge their obligations.\n52.\tIn conclusion, I should like to thank very sincerely on behalf of my delegation all members of the General Assembly for the confidence they have expressed to my country in appointing us one of the Vice-Presidents of the present session\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation to extend to you our most sincere congratulations on your unanimous and well deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your outstanding qualities of leadership and your immense experience in diplomacy are well known to all of us. We are confident that your undying and dedicated efforts as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of th\\\" Sea will prove beneficial to our deliberations. The thirty ^ session of the General Assembly is an auspicious occasion for the non-aligned movement: it is particularly gratifying to the Kingdom of Lesotho that the President of this session should be not only a distinguished and long-standing servant of the United Nations but also an outstanding representative of a non-aligned and Commonwealth country.\n2.\ti would also like to express my delegation's gratitude to your distinguished predecessor, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for the brilliant manner in which he discharged his functions as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tI also take pleasure in welcoming the Republic of Seychelles, whose membership in this Organization we were most happy to sponsor. The Seychelles is a country with which we have the most fraternal relations. We look forward to its contribution towards solving-critical problems facing small States Members of this Organization.\n4.\tWe deeply regret that, as a result of the objections of certain Member States, the two Republics of Angola and Viet Nam have not been accorded membership in the United Nations. In the interests of universality of membership of this Organization, we sincerely hope that these two Republics will be allowed to take their place among us in the very near future.\n5.\tIt is not a matter of surprise that the agenda of this Assembly contains so many pressing and urgent issues, for it is a feature of modern life that, at the same time as man scales the contours of outer space, on this planet he is creating problems of such profound dimensions that the very concept of progress has become of dubious value. The very elements that sustain life-the waters of the rivers and of the seas, the agricultural landscape of the world and the air we breathe -have all been desecrated by man's folly.\n6.\tThe march of humanity towards the twenty-first century is matched by a singular failure to solve the problem of man's peace with himself.\n7.\tIn the Middle East, the people of Palestine continue to remain hostages to a situation that threatens international peace. In 1974, this Assembly took a most profound decision on the question of Palestine [resolution 3236 (XXIX)]. The twenty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly finally recognized the injustice of treating the people of Palestine as refugees. By resolution 3236 (XXIX), the United Nations finally recognized the basic human rights of a people that has not known any homeland or any peace for well over 30 years. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is no substitute for the responsibility of the United Nations for resolving the question of the people of Palestine.\n8.\tMy Government accepts as a matter of fundamental principle the right of Israel to an existence. At the same time, my Government does not recognize the right of any nation in the Middle East to ail existence at the expense of other nations. We cannot accept the acquisition of territory of other States on the grounds of security. Neither can my Government accept changes in the economic, social or political topography of conquered territories under any pretext.\nA/31/PV.29\n9.\tIn Asia, the peace of South-East Asia is marred by the foot-note of the question of Korea. In 1973, this Assembly accepted a consensus  that North and South Korea should continue a dialog to resolve the outstanding problems between the two Koreas. Clearly, the consensus of 1973 is the most substantive basis for resolving the question of Korea, and I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to the two parties for the understanding which has been reached to remove this issue from the agenda of this session and for their readiness to continue their dialog.\n10.\tEconomic imbalance continues to frustrate the efforts of the developing Countries to improve the living conditions of their peoples. The new international economic order adopted by the United Nations in 11974 generated hope for millions of people of the developing world. And yet the impotence of the United Nations in translating that order into reality has meant more poverty, more helplessness and more bitterness for the third world. As the President of the WoHd Bank observed not so long ago, there are 1 billion people all over the world who live in poverty. As Mr. McNamiara said:\n\\\"Some 900 million of these individuals subsist on incomes of less than $75 a year in an environment of squalor, hunger and hopelessness. They are the absolute poor, living in situations so deprived as to be below any rational definition of human decency. Absolute poverty is a condition of life so limited by illiteracy, malnutrition, disease, high infant-mortality and low life-expectancy as to deny its victims the very potential of the genes with which they were born.\\\" \n11.\tThe ink is not yet dry on the new international economic order. The poor of the world are not asking for welfare. They are not asking for hand-outs but for an opportunity to help themselves. Millions of peoples of member countries of this Assembly are locked in the tight grip of the poverty of the rural hinterland of the world. Yet other millions are subjected to the grim poverty of the urban ghetto, the shanty town, the tin hovels, and the locations of South Africa and Rhodesia and Namibia. There is no country which is immune from the problems of the rural and the urban poor. And it does not take much imagination to recognize that unless we all concentrate our joint energies, our intellects, on solving this problem', the ghettos of the world will deal most destructively with the rich of the cities-just as the rural poor of the world will deal most savagely with the urban rich of the world.\n12.\tAt stake is the whole fabric of an orderly international society. The seams of this fabric are already too frayed- frayed by the selfishness of the rich in transferring capital and technology to the developing world on terms that outrage the dignity of the peoples of the third world.\n13.\tIn this connexion, my Government supports the plea made by the President of the World Bank that the developed countries speedily conclude negotiations-by March 1977-to make transitional financing available to avoid any break in the flow of resources from the International Development Agency, to the less developed countries like Lesotho.\n14.\tA peaceful international order is being threatened by the tendencies of certain coastal States to hold land-locked States hostage with regard to access to the sea and to the riches of the oceans.\n15.\tMy Government has actively participated in the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea because we believe that this historic' Conference should work out a just and equitable law for more than two thirds of our planet and its resources. We are rather disappointed, however, with the very slow progress that is being made at the Conference. We hope and trust that the next session will be fruitful and produce a universally accepted convention. Being more than a landlocked country, we are grateful that the convention is to embody and spell out the right of free access to and from the sea for land-locked States. We trust and hope that the coastal States will accept the right of land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States t<J participate on an equal basis with coastal States in the resources of the areas beyond the territorial waters of 12 nautical miles. As regards the resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, we expect the Conference to work out an economically viable regime which will produce tangible benefits for mankind. We should like to see the Conference adopt the principle that the sharing of the benefits of the area should be on the basis of need, with particular reference to the land-locked countries.\n16.\tOn this occasion, you will have to bear with me if I focus my remarks on southern Africa. Southern Africa has featured on the agenda of this Assembly for well over 25 years. It is an area that poses the most tragic consequences for the international community.\n17.\tMy country is not on the fringes of southern Africa; it is in the vortex. And thus the interests of my Government, of my people, are directly threatened by the situation in southern Africa. I speak of southern Africa not as an observer, not as a witness, but as one directly involved.\n18.\tSouthern Africa is an area rich in natural resources. It is an area that boasts of every mineral of use to man. It is an area that is so richly endowed in agricultural resources that it is criminal that children still die in southern Africa because of malnutrition. In its human resources, southern Africa is so rich in potential that it contains a promise for the world and for the development of the African continent.\n19.\tOf all the regions of the world, none has the wonderful opportunity that southern Africa has of demonstrating the common humanity of man irrespective of race, of religion and of sex. Yet the promise of southern Africa is today darkened by the cloud of racism. Southern Africa today does not offer the world an example of racial harmony. It offers, instead, racial bigotry and the promise of a racial holocaust. Southern Africa does not present to the world the common humanity of man, but its denial.\n20.\tIn South Africa, in Namibia, in Zimbabwe, the refusal of white minorities to recognize the basic right of the African majorities has been accorded the halo of a dogma, that of institutionalized racism, or apartheid.\n21.\tOf all the evils that man is capable of inflicting upon himself, there is none more evil than racism. The genius of science has put man on the threshold of an era that contains profound promises for humanity. And yet man still cannot change the color of his skin. Nor is it necessarily desirable that man should acquire that capability.\n22.\tThroughout man's history, man's quest for liberty has varied in its forms as tyranny has taken new forms and\nthreatened from new quarters. At times, the tyrant has been the church, and even today lives are still being lost because of religious intolerance. At times, the tyrant has been the feudal monarch. Today the tyrant is racial bigotry.\n23.\tFifteen years ago, men and women of Sharpeville fell under the bullets of a racist system.\n24.\tA few months ago, the children of Soweto faced the same guns.\n25.\tThe carnage in Soweto, in Langa and in other black townships of South Africa is the clearest testimony of the brutality of apartheid.\n26.\tThe graves of the black children of South Africa who died at the hands of the South African police will forever remain symbols of the mindlessness of racism.\n27.\tLast year the white leaders of South Africa asked the world for a grace period within which the world would see changes in South Africa. The gunfire of Soweto clearly indicates how far the white leaders of South Africa have gone in effecting changes. They have gone beyond the pale of common sense.\n28.\tIf today the African youth of South Africa is ready to take up arms, it is only because for too long its life has been blighted by the brutality of racism and the dignity and self-respect of its parentage denied by white minority rule.\n29.\tAs an African, I do not advocate violence as a solution to human problems, and yet violent struggle is often the only option left to oppressed peoples. It is an irony of our times that PAIGC;3 MFLA,  FRELIMO,  in their bitter struggle for the freedom of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique, created the very conditions that today allow the people of Portugal the right to free speech, the right of assembly and the right to participate in government.\n30.\tEven the white minorities of southern Africa will acquire basic freedoms from the sweat and sacrifices of the liberation movements of southern Africa. In this sense, the struggle of the youth of Zimbabwe, of Namibia and of South Africa has a most profound meaning. That struggle is fundamentally in the interests of the rule of law and basic morality.\n31.\tMy Government and the people of Lesotho do not claim any monopoly of wisdom about how the situation of southern Africa can be solved. On the contrary, we recognize that the people of Zimbabwe, the Government of the United Kingdom and the United Nations will have to solve the problem of Rhodesia.\n32.\tMy Government has noted the recent initiatives of Britain and the United States on Rhodesia. We have also taken note of the decision of the British Government, as the legal administering Power in Rhodesia, to convene a conference later this month. In the view of my Government, the agenda of that conference must concentrate on the transfer of constitutional power to the majority of the people of Zimbabwe.\n33.\tIt does not take too much insight to recognize that the success of the British/American initiatives is predicated on the successes scored by the liberation movement of Zimbabwe. The credit for ending the Smith rebellion belongs first and foremost to the people of Zimbabwe. It is to them that we owe appreciation for the efforts aimed at ending 11 years of Rhodesia's plight under the illegal Smith regime.\n34.\tThe liberation movement of Zimbabwe, the youth of Zimbabwe whose life was snuffed out by the Smith rebels, those who had to assume responsibility for the armed struggle against the Smith regime and its supporters these are the real heroes of the recent Rhodesian drama.\n35.\tAfter the bitter struggles that the people of Zimbabwe have waged, after suffering 11 years of Smith's rebellion, the people of Zimbabwe have a clear and undeniable right to basic freedoms and majority rule now, and not after two more years of compromises with those who for so long have been responsible for the denial of these, freedoms to them. No Government, except that of Zimbabwe, any longer possesses any moral authority to dictate the timing of the exercise of basic rights by the people of Zimbabwe. Nor should the Smith rebels feature in any considerations of financial assistance to Zimbabwe.\n36.\tBasic morality demands that the people of Zimbabwe, a people that has suffered so much and for so long, should be the recipients of any outside assistance to Zimbabwe. Now that victory is at hand, the people of Zimbabwe must be vigilant against foreign elements, which will inevitably attempt to sow confusion and undermine the stability, peace and independence of Zimbabwe.\n37.\tWith regard to Namibia, we recognize that the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the United Nations and the people of Namibia have a direct responsibility for terminating South Africa's illegal occupation of that Territory. SWAPO has already demonstrated its determination to resort to armed struggle to free Namibia from South African control. On the other hand, as an expression of the statesmanship of its leaders, SWAPO has indicated its willingness to participate in tripartite talks with the United Nations and the Government of South Africa about ending South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia.\n38.\tThe Government of South Africa has a clear duty to accept the offer of SWAPO. The solution to the problem of Namibia will not emanate from the discussions at the Tumhalle conference: it will only emerge from contacts with the authentic and legitimate leaders of the people of Namibia.\n39.\tMr. Vorster must recognize that political wisdom dictates that he speak to the leadership of SWAPO and not to pretenders to the leadership of the people of Namibia.\n40.\tIn recognition of the complexity of the problem my Government accepts, as a matter of fundamental reality and common sense, that the people of South Africa will themselves have to solve the problem of apartheid. And yet my Government has a most direct responsibility in the whole question of South Africa.\n41.\tThe first concern of my Government is that white minority rule and racism are so obviously evil that any man of goodwill and of basic morality must be outraged by them. Further, my Government has an undeniable right to safeguard the lives and welfare of the people of Lesotho. And racial war in southern Africa will impose extreme pressures on any Government to meet this duty.\n42.\tIn Sharpeville, 37 of the dead were citizens of Lesotho. Whenever the guns of apartheid open their lethal fire, among the targets are my countrymen.\n43.\tIn blatant disregard of international law and basic principles governing relations among States, even the very sovereignty of my country has been violated by agents of the South African Government. The police of South Africa have repeatedly and illegally entered my country and kidnapped South African refugees resident in Lesotho. In the darkness of the night they have carried out their nefarious activities. They have converted the common frontier between Lesotho and South Africa into a target area for shooting at citizens of Lesotho. They have created a climate in South Africa which has led even ordinary whites in that country to believe that citizens of Lesotho are a legitimate target of abuse and assault, a target with no rights, not even the right to life itself.\n44.\tI do not wish to go into the details of every incident that has been created by agents of the South African Government in its relations with Lesotho. At the same time, I have a clear duty to inform this Assembly that my Government has suffered repeated provocations created by the Government of South Africa.\n45.\tFor too long, my Government has opted for quiet diplomacy. For too long, we have hoped that those in charge in South Africa would realize that the activities of their agents could create a most dangerous situation in southern Africa. My Government now has come to recognize that these activities, unchecked, are calculated to frighten the people of Lesotho into submission and cow my Government into docility. In response to the provocations, my Government has made the strongest protests to the Government of South Africa.\n46.\tWe shall not be cowed. We shall not be frightened. We shall never accept any situation that attempts to diminish the independence and compromise the sovereignty of Lesotho.\n47.\tMy Government cannot in these circumstances remain indifferent to a situation that so directly affects its own citizens and their welfare. My Government adheres faithfully to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. But my Government cannot accept the right of any Government in southern Africa to create conditions that threaten the peace of southern Africa, not to precipitate a racial war for the sake of discredited notions of racial superiority.\n48.\tIn 1974, the people of Lesotho were accorded the rare honor of presenting a posthumous award by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to that great southern African leader and Nobel peace-prize winner, Chief Albert Luthuli. The people of Lesotho accepted the honor of conferring this award as a gesture of our peaceful intentions towards all the people of South Africa.\n49.\tMy Government has never denied the rights of the white minorities. But neither shall my country ever acquiesce in the denial of the basic rights of the African majorities of southern Africa.\n50.\tSix years ago, my Prime Minister, the Honorable Mr. Leabua Jonathan, proposed discussions between the white minorities and independent Africa on the basis of the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa.  That process of discussion is now continuing on the basis of the Dar es Salaam declaration on Southern Africa.  Africa, in its profound humanity, continues to offer the white minorities a chance-a last chance-to avert racial war. Time is no longer on the side of the unjust, but on the side of those striving for liberty. Today, a dialog between independent Africa and the white minorities is almost peripheral to the issue of a racial confrontation. I recognize that it was an act of political prudence for Mr. H. Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, to meet my Prime Minister in 1965. I fully appreciate the wisdom of Mr. Vorster, his successor, in continuing those meetings. No one can minimize the courage of Mr. Vorster in meeting President Kaunda and the leaders of Zimbabwe at Victoria Falls last February. And yet the bridges of dialog for peace, for justice and for basic rights are not going to be forged at Victoria Falls. Nor are they going to be forged between Pretoria and the capitals of independent Africa. The bridges for justice, for any meaningful dialog, must span Robben Island and Cape Town.\n51.\tTo the leaders of the white minorities I have a simple message: as politicians you have displayed a most adroit ability in arranging meetings with leaders of independent Africa. Your challenge has always been one of statesmanship. Unclasp southern Africa from the cold grip of racism. Muster the political will to free southern Africa from a racist constituency. Too much is at stake for all of us, for our descendants, for humanity, for domestic political considerations to dictate the outcome of our fate and the peace of southern Africa.\n52.\tLast week the people of Lesotho celebrated their tenth anniversary of independence from colonial rule. Independence for any country is a condition of great moment. But independence for a country that is an enclave in South Africa is much more. For the last 10 years, Lesotho has been an island of freedom in a sea of racism. We have Ken an island of refuge for victims of repression and apartheid. Even today, the children of Soweto are seeking political asylum in Lesotho.\n53.\tNo observer of southern Africa can miss the stark contrast between Lesotho and South Africa. Non-racialism\nin Lesotho is matched on the South African side of our frontiers by a system that creates refugees out of school-children. lite Basotho nation was forged in the crucible of warfare in southern Africa. The Basotho people consist of virtually every ethnic grouping in southern Africa. Thus, for us, it is a tradition-a customary duty - to receive refugees from persecution. And yet, recent events in South Africa threaten to stretch our capability to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of apartheid. In the circumstances, this Assembly has a clear obligation to assist my Government to continue to provide refuge to the hungry, the weary and the persecuted of South Africa.\n54.\tDespite our geographical position and the problems we have had, the first 10 years of our independence have witnessed significant economic progress for Lesotho. My Government has created over 20 new industries where there were none in 1966. The Kingdom of Lesotho is today no longer a hostage market to South African infant industries. Nor are we now any longer resigned to the role of source of cheap labor for South African industry.\n55.\tI must, however, candidly admit that the presence of over 4G per cent of our manpower in South Africa continues to be the most critical problem facing my country. The system of migratory labor is essentially unsatisfactory, in that it unsettles family life without conferring any cushioning benefits on migrant workers. My country is not alone in being confronted with this problem. Migratory labor into South Africa does, however, present problems involving the denial to migrant laborers of their very basic human rights.\n56.\tLesotho miners in South Africa are housed in com-pounds that insult their very manhood. Their families are not allowed to join them. In our times, when the rights of women have become almost universally acknowledged, the wives of our miners in South Africa are denied the very basic right of living with their husbands for periods ranging from nine months to two years. The miners are employed on contracts of such short duration that they do not provide for advancement because, on the expiry of every contract, the miners are treated as new recruits. Nor do the contracts allow for any pension schemes or other terminal benefits. Under South African laws, the miners are denied the very basic right of any worker to join labor unions for the purpose of bargaining for better terms of employment.\n57.\tIn the current circumstances, the options open to my Government are limited. With the assistance of the World Bank, we have been engaged in a serious examination of ways of reabsorbing this labor into the Lesotho economy. Clearly, for such an effort to be successful, my country would need a massive infusion of capital to raise the level of employment opportunities in Lesotho. In the short term, we are continuing to impress upon the main employers of our labor, including foreign investors in South Africa, the need to provide decent wages to our workers in conditions that respect their basic human rights.\n58.\tI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the United Nations the urgent need to convene a conference under the auspices of the Division of Human Rights of the United Nations to examine the whole question of migratory labor and to formulate general principles which will form the basis of a convention to safeguard the rights of migrant workers.\n59.\tFrom this platform I should also like to thank the United Nations system and States Members of the United Nations for the assistance that they have provided to my country and for the concern they have shown for consolidating our independence.\n60.\tIn the second decade of independence we shall continue to count on the support of the United Nations, for, if anything, the next 10 years promise to be the most difficult for us. The Government of South Africa has already made known its intention to encircle my country with bantustans. My Government has repeatedly condemned the system of bantustans and rejected the Balkanization of South Africa as a solution to the problem of apartheid. The policy of bantustans is so lacking in sincerity, so devoid of any rational justification and so patently racist in conception that it does not provide any basis for resolving the question of apartheid.\n61.\tThe policy of bantustans is bound to be short-lived, as it does not enjoy the support of the people of South Africa. Even some of the bantustan leaders have already made clear their opposition to it. It is a policy that has been formulated without any pretense of consultation with the people it most affects the majority of the African people of South Africa. And yet the Government of South Africa arrogantly persists in its implementation. That government has already made known its plans to grant independence to the Transkei. My Government will not acquiesce in any scheme that violates the territorial integrity of South Africa without the consent of the majority of the people of South Africa. To encircle my country with bantustans has no other objective than to complicate the already difficult position of my country.\n62.\tThose who are responsible for the creation of the bantustans will have to bear full responsibility for the difficulties that are bound to arise as a result of setting these bantustans on our borders and on territory that rightfully belongs to the Basotho nation.\n63.\tThe twentieth session of the General Assembly in considering the future of Lesotho in 1965 had before it a draft resolution which inter alia asked the Assembly to request the United Kingdom as the then administering Power over Basutoland to take \\\"immediate steps to return to the indigenous inhabitants all the land taken from them, whatever the form of or pretext for such alienation\\\".\n64.\tThe debate on this question at the twentieth session reflected the anxieties expressed by the people of Lesotho regarding parts of the territory of Lesotho that the former British colonial administration had wrongfully ceded to South Africa.\n65.\tIt had been the consistent view of the people of Lesotho that large tracts of land in the South African provinces of the Free State, Natal and Cape Province rightfully belonged to the Basotho nation. The people of Lesotho still demand the return of these lands.\n66.\tEven as the twentieth session of the General Assembly was seized with this question, the Government of South Africa was frantically attempting to real conclusions with the erstwhile colonial administration in Lesotho to formalize the cessation of these lands and present the Government of the independent Kingdom of Lesotho with an accomplished fact.\n67.\tIt is to the credit of the British Government in power in 1965 that it categorically refused to become implicated in these efforts to deny the people of Lesotho any voice in the finalization of the matter.\n68.\tIn their communication of 1965, the authorities of the Government of South Africa had pressed upon the British Government the need to settle all outstanding border issues between the Republic and Basutoland, and had gone further to propose the establishment of a joint boundary commission.\n69.\tIn 1968, the South African authorities again raised the question of the establishment of a joint boundary commission but reflecting the grand South African design to establish bantustans, the terms of reference proposed for the commission were now so restrictive as to empower the commission only to consider the demarcation and fencing of certain sectors of the boundary between the two countries where uncertainties exist regarding the actual ground location of the boundary.\n70.\tMy Government has exchanged official communications with the Government of South Africa and held talks at official level aimed at resolving the question of the lands of the Basotho.\n71.\tThe people of Lesotho are not interested in the location of fences and arbitrary boundaries but in substantive discussions on the return of their lands.\n72.\tMy Government does not harbor any irredentist designs on South Africa.\n73.\tMy Government accepted the view first put forth by South Africa in 1965 that all outstanding border questions should be settled by a judicial commission. This view is in conformity with our respect for law and the need not to add border questions to the already serious agenda on southern Africa.\n74.\tAt the same time, it behooves my Government to put this matter on the public record of the United Nations.\n75.\tIt is a measure of the difficulties that are bound to arise that the Government of South Africa has unilaterally terminated discussions with my Government on territories that the former colonial administration in Lesotho illegally ceded to South Africa.\n76.\tThe termination of these discussions has been accompanied by determined encroachments on the remaining Lesotho territory. Only last year, the authorities of South Africa started erecting a weather station on Lesotho territory.\n77.\tThe approaches by my Government to the South African authorities have elicited counter-claims by South Africa on the lands of Lesotho.\n78.\tIt has never been the policy of my Government to inflame the already tense situation of southern Africa. Thus, my Government will continue to insist that the South African authorities remove their settlements on our territory. Further, with the support of the international community system, we shall continue to demand that the authorities of South Africa reopen bilateral, talks with my Government about the lands that were illegally ceded to that country.\n79.\tTo those of my African brothers who have opted for support of the bantustan policy, I want to make this observation. Those who are actively destroying the territorial integrity of South Africa will one day have to answer to the majority of the people of South Africa for their actions. Neither shall the people of Lesotho forget those who are acquiescing in the occupation of Lesotho territory. Bantustan leaders must recognize a fundamental truth: dissent from bad policy is the test of leadership, the first obligation of patriotism and surest defense of freedom of the people of southern Africa.\n80.\tThe situation in southern Africa demands the urgent attention of the United Nations; as the situation in southern Africa poses a threat to international peace and security, the Security Council has a direct obligation to exercise its powers in terms of the Charter; the international community equally has the responsibility to free that region of Africa from the blight of racism and human deprivation; to free the people of southern Africa from the tragedy of war; and to assure the majority of the people of southern Africa the opportunity to seek the liberation of the human spirit.\n"

        "file_text": "I am grateful for this opportunity to convey to you from this rostrum the warm greetings of the Government and people of Fiji, and to assure you of our continuing commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n64.\tWe are especially pleased that, in its current deliberations, the General Assembly should be guided by the representative of a country which has contributed greatly to the promotion of international goodwill and understanding. Your own significant contribution to the negotiations on the law of the sea as President gives us confidence that your judgment and wisdom will ensure the success of this session.\n65.\tI should also like to express the deep appreciation of the Government and people Fiji to our distinguished Secretary-General, whom we had the pleasure of welcoming \nto our shores earlier this year, and also to the staff of all United Nations organizations and agencies.\n66.\tIt is now six years since I last had the privilege of addressing this Assembly. I thought, therefore, it might be of interest to Members to hear briefly how progress and developments appear since then to a representative of a small country far away in the Pacific.\n67.\tOne of the notable features of the period has been the growth of regional and other world-wide groupings. There has been the birth of new bodies like the partnership between the European Economic Community, and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, formalized by the Lome Convention.10 Another new body is the South Pacific Forum. This latter must be one of die few international meetings in the world where it is the established practice that the national leaders confer on their own, without advisers and teams of technical experts (though these are on hand if required). Both these groups seem to me to have made significant impact and to have achieved worth-while results. And I think the reason is that they include representatives of developed and developing nations, working together side by side, to determine policies which take account of the needs and aspirations of all. That is not to say that such policies can always be determined and agreed upon. There can be hard words and hard bargaining. There can be deadlock. But at least there is the continuing opportunity for dialog and for all to put forward their viewpoints.\n68.\tVery different seem to me the activities of some other groupings which confine their membership to those of like philosophies, politics and persuasions and like stages of development From such bodies we are apt to hear numbers of pronouncements on world problems and issues; and yet such declarations tend not to result in successful execution. I wonder if it is not because the very people who are expected to pay for the execution of the policies are either very much in the minority, or excluded altogether. Could it be that this is an example of what has been called the tyranny of the majority?\n69.\tIf, for example, we take a recent exposition of the principles of one of these bodies, we find that they can be very closely paralleled by texts from the Bible which call upon us to love our neighbor as ourselves; to do unto others as we would they would do unto us; and render no man evil for evil. And yet the same Bible has this to say about charity or love-what we call in Fijian \\\"loloma\\\" or\ncaring \\\"I may speak in tongues of men or of angels, but if I am without love I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal. I may dole out all I possess, but if I have no love I am none the better.\\\"\nAnd the same passage lists the qualities of caring-they are patience, kindness, envy of no one, humility, modesty, courtesy and unselfishness; reluctance to take offense;\nkeeping no score of wrongs. And above all-it has no ending. Could there be a better description of the relationship that could, and should exist between peoples and countries? For there are parallel examples of the tyranny of the minority also-both of specially favored nations and of commercial groupings who similarly go their own exclusive way, and similarly should consider how to bridge the gap.\n70.\tThe fuel crisis has shown us this most vividly. It has frustrated those of us in the third world who have interpreted development 23 industrialization. For all that has happened is that much of the wealth from oil has been transferred from the great multinational companies to the producers. In the jargon of the industry, the multinational companies were losing profits \\\"upstream\\\", from the oil producers, and therefore had to look for more profits \\\"downstream\\\", from refining, distributing and selling the petroleum products. So we now have a situation where it is to the benefit of both the oil producers and the distributors to maintain high price levels. The sufferers are the third world; and in general our only hope of progress is the development and exploitation of alternative sources of energy. To pursue this investigation we look to this great world body, and I appeal to it to treat this with the highest priority. But once again we have here our exclusive grouping forming their own cartel without consultation with, or regard for, the consumers.\n71.\tI talked earlier of the sort of relationship that was needed between peoples and countries. But how do we achieve this relationship? This brings me to my basic point that we cannot look for the achievement of concord and progress unless there is dialog and opportunity for the free expression of different viewpoints. And I stress dialog. For far too many meetings today consist of an endless series of individual addresses by delegation heads, prepared in advance, delivered whether relevant or repetitive, and in no way geared to generate the dialog and debate, question and answer, from which real solutions can emerge. The statements are prepared at least as much for national as international consumption, and careful arrangements are made for their release in home capitals to synchronize with their delivery. The pattern becomes so stereotyped that it is hard to escape. After all, what am I myself doing at this very moment? I have fallen into the very trap against which I am trying to sound a note of warning. I can only hope I may be forgiven on the grounds that I am trying to point another way, and that I do not propose to take up the time of representatives with my comments on individual international issues.\n72.\tI make one exception-and it is inescapable-southern Africa. I must frankly confess that, for a long time, we in the Pacific did not take much interest in the affairs of Africa. It was far away, contacts were few, and perhaps the administering Power was just as happy this should be so. So I think our real interest began after independence when we first attended meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Governments and met intimately with leaders of the distinction of President Nyerere, President Kaunda and others, who put the issues of Africa starkly and dramatically. And they are men of Christian background and Christian principles. Then there was, of course, our experience in this great forum itself. And most recently we\nfound ourselves locked in the most complicated negotiations with the European Economic Community alongside the African countries as well as the Caribbean. While the West Indian countries certainly made a notable contribution, and we like to think we may ourselves have played a role, from the outset it was the Africans who were the solid pacemakers. All these contacts have brought us much closer to the people of Africa and their burning issues. Apartheid is anathema to us. We completely support majority rule in Rhodesia. But we do not support violence in any form on either side; and situations look very different when you are not living close at hand in Africa and daily in contact with a situation. But we have a racial situation of our own which we are slowly solving together. No race is getting all it wants, particularly the extremists, but men of goodwill of all our races, creeds, cultures and languages are striving together and maintaining dialog. As so we are speaking from experience, and I am more than ever convinced that only from dialog can come real lasting peace in Africa. It is perhaps symbolic that in the two hundredth anniversary year cf its own independence, the United States should have joined with the United Kingdom and African leaders to try to help bring such independence in Africa through peaceful dialog.\n73.\tAnd on dialog, can it be that the misunderstandings between developed and developing countries are so very different from the between the various parties in industry? And can it be that, just as in that field the only satisfactory way to achieve fair shares and a harmonious atmosphere is by continuous dialog and give and take, so it is in the international sphere?\n74.\tPerhaps before going further I should stress that in trying to learn some lessons from collective bargaining, I am in no way saying that the developed-developing country relationship is one of superior to inferior. After all, I was among those in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries who objected to the word \\\"controller\\\" to describe the representative of the European Economic Community in the various countries where Community funds are channeled. He is now called \\\"delegate\\\", which almost by definition means a party to a discussion.\n75.\tIn industry there are a number of broad categories of management objectives. Businessmen want to preserve and strengthen their business; they want stable and business-like relationships with bargaining agents; they have broad social and economic goals, as well as their own personal advancement.\n76.\tNone of these are incompatible with reciprocal benefits to employees, provided that the latter's needs and aspirations are part of the whole decision-making process and that they have a positive role. It should be a matter of trying to find all the points of agreement and then identifying and trying to minimize points of difference. It is fortunately now generally recognized that there are substantial areas of decision where failure to consult would be not only unwise but fatal to an enterprise. Successful co-operation of this kind does not hit the. headlines, but it\n- is what produces enduring results.\n77.\tAll this is to stress dialog; it is the only way to reach solutions; and to exclude relevant parties from such\ndiscussions is equally foolish, whether it be a group of developed or developing countries or anyone else. Exclusion causes suspicion, which can harden into resentment and render consensus difficult, if not impossible. Even if agreement is reached, it may leave grudges smoldering away.\n78.\tBut when we come to have this dialog we have to know what we want and we have to know what to say. Other speakers more distinguished than myself will enlarge on the new international economic order. I am already on record as saying that perhaps our best first step is to build on existing associations such as the Lome Convention. In fact \\\"start small\\\".\n79.\tAfter all, \\\"small is beautiful\\\", as Professor Schumacher tells us when he pleads the pause for the transfer of intermediate technology and even techniques at a lower level. He says:\n\\\"... the best aid is intellectual aid-the gift of useful knowledge. It is better than material aid. After all, nothing becomes truly one's own except on the basis of some genuine effort to acquire it. Material gifts make people dependent, the gift of knowledge makes them free-provided it is the right kind of knowledge, of course.\\\"\n80.\tIt is not only a matter of knowing what we want. We must abo know what we do not want. And very often the most important and most difficult lesson we have to learn as aid-receiving countries is to say \\\"No\\\". After all, we cannot substitute dollars for dignity. If we do, we undermine the humanity of the giver as well as the taker.\n81.\tOne of the rather sad things is that, with all the advances in knowledge and techniques, we are in very real danger of losing knowledge which was available to our forefathers, and which was of great value. We are in danger of losing this knowledge simply because the holders of it are fast disappearing. But there is also an attitude of mind, among the less sophisticated members of our societies, which says that these are modern times, and we should not produce goods in such old-fashioned ways, when nowadays our young people are so well educated and advanced. The same applies to herbal and other remedies of a medical nature, and to traditional fishing and planting methods. The old Russian saying that the education of a child begins with his grandfather's education is equally true in the Pacific, where grandfathers preserve so much lore and knowledge that would be lost without their presence. At least we should have the opportunity of trying and judging, and not missing out by default, as it were. This requires active measures of preservation and encouragement.\n82.\tAnd finally, in closing, may I just leave with you one brief thought on one major difference I have noticed about aid giving in the Western world and in our own Pacific Island way. From the developed countries aid is given, largely in the form of charity, from a surplus after everything else has been looked after. Sacrifice is minimal and there is no implication of a gap left which at some stage will need to be replenished. In these circumstances it is hard, with the best intentions in the world-and these I do not deny-to establish complete identity with the recipient. \nAnd there is a tendency to think that the best aid that can be conferred is aid which will help the recipient to lead a life more like that of the donor.\n83.\tOur method of giving is rather one of sharing what we have, so that in due course there will be an opportunity for the receiver to aid his neighbor. A reciprocal nexus is established; there is close involvement; and at the end of the day, all can look at each other in the eye.\n84.\tI am one of those who believe that we all have something to give and I think this is more and more realized by the developed countries as well. This belief and the will to implement it will not obviate the need for all the detailed economic, social and cultural studies. But it could invest them with a meaning, a purpose, an urgency and above all an integration where all could play their part towards a better world for all.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Tanzania, I would like to join my colleagues who have spoken before me in congratulating Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election to the important office of President of the General Assembly. This session could not be in better hands, for few diplomats can match his qualifications for the task. The post he currently occupies as President of the singularly important Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, where his performance has already won the admiration of those who closely follow it, is only one of the demonstrations of his high qualities of leadership in such important meetings. We are particularly happy to see him, a distinguished son of Sri Lanka -a country with which we maintain very close relations and in whose capital we were recently privileged to attend the historic Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries-occupying this important post. I am therefore confident that this session of the Assembly shall, under his able guidance, be crowned with success.\n2.\tI wish also to express, on behalf of the Tanzania delegation, our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, for the successful manner in which he conducted the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.'\n3.\tMay I also take this opportunity to welcome warmly the delegation of Seychelles, which has just joined the United Nations after its independence the middle of this year. At this juncture, it is fitting to put on record our profound concern and regret at the continued obstacles being placed in the way of the membership of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, two peace-loving States whose admission to our\nOrganization should have been a matter of course. Nonetheless, it is the sincere hope of the Tanzania delegation that both these States will take their rightful places in our Organization before the end of this session.\n4.\tFor the last five years, this Organization has been privileged to have as its Secretary-General a dedicated, diligent and capable statesman in the person of Mr. Kurt Waldheim. He has been a pillar of strength for our Organization in its search for solutions to the many outstanding complex international problems. Through his painstaking efforts, both in public and in private diplomatic initiatives, he has made an immense contribution to the cause of world peace and justice. Certainly, those of us who come from Africa can bear witness to this by pointing out that not only has Mr. Waldheim shown concern at Africa's plight, but he has physically shared this plight with us by attending all sessions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ since he came into office. In expressing our highest appreciation of his role, we should.also like to reiterate our support for his continued outstanding services. There is no doubt these five years have been very trying years, when our Organization has faced some of its most serious challenges. Mr. Waldheim's performance during this period, in playing an imaginative and constructive role, whether in the quest for an equitable international economic order or in search of solutions to the many situations of conflict that bedevil our world, has enhanced the effectiveness and prestige of the United Nations.\n5.\tMankind boasts, and quite legitimately too, of posses-sing the superior power and capacity to influence and to transform not only his own behavior and life style but also his environment and the forces of nature, either to the enrichment of his life or to his own detriment. Today, man has gone far beyond the stage of simply toiling for his bread and shelter. Through modern science and technology, man can now multiply the varieties of crops and livestock so as to add more quality to his diet. Even buildings are constructed no longer simply to protect man from a hostile climate but also to provide man with surroundings of scenic beauty. Indeed, man's accomplishments in other fields, such as the fantastic machines and computers which can do almost anything and everything for him, the lightning speed of communication which he has achieved, the conquest of many scourges of disease, the astounding space technology and unfurling of space mysteries, and many, many others baffle and stun man's own imagination.\n6.\tUnfortunately, while this same man can take pride in these achievements, he is equally haunted by their inequitable distribution, for the stark truth is that the majority of mankind lives in abject poverty, and only a tiny percentage of humanity swims in luxury and glamor. Who in this space age will accept the notion that the amenities which technology has produced are, for the time being, available to only a small section of the world's population to enjoy, but not to the overwhelming majority? How can it be understood that this same man, who has demonstrated a fantastic imagination to conquer nature, cannot help going on enslaving and exploiting his brother? How can anyone seriously rationalize the utilization of billions of dollars for the acquisition of more sophisticated weapons of mass destruction, while abject squalor and misery continue to afflict the overwhelming percentage of the human race? How can we boast of being protectors of a free world, when so many live in servitude either as poor men in an independent country or both in poverty and under colonialism?\n7.\tThese are not only the increasingly critical and soul-searching questions of the masses of the world which we here represent today, but an exposure of the ironies of our time. The facts do not confirm that the situation that we are in is inevitable.\n8.\tI, for one, believe that, when in 1945 we decided to adopt the United Nations Charter, we were solemnly resolving to do away with injustice, inequality and human degradation. Yet, 30 years later, the same evils continue to haunt human society, returning the succeeding generations to whom we promised a safer and better future to the threshold of pre-world-war days.\n9.\tIt is probably true that the most repulsive forms of systematic human defilement have been liquidated, if we are talking only of slavery and of the slave trade by which a human being was openly regarded as a chattel to be sold, bought and owned, and to toil and serve literally as a beast of burden for the master-another human being; or if by these forms of defilement we mean only such practices as those of Nazism, a doctrine of genocide that brought a near holocaust to the world. Even then we can say that only if we mean thereby that these practices and their consequences were too obvious to the eye and too dramatic to our perception.\n10.\tColonialism and racism may not have set the whole world on fire. Yet, they are as dehumanizing to man as was slavery, the slave trade and Nazism, for they impose the same agonies on their victims. Indeed, they pose the same threat to international peace and security. The names and the methods may be different, but the mischief is the same and must be understood and regarded for what it is, for human degradation does not cease to be human degradation simply when it is called by different names. The facts do not change for the simple reason that they happen in a subtle form, nor does human degradation cease to be wicked and morally condemnable only because, through some timidity or otherwise, we choose not to, or hesitate to, view it in the way it deserves to be regarded.\n11.\tLet me now address myself to some of the specific areas of tension.\n12.\tThe Middle East remains an area of serious stress and strain. This continues to cast doubt on the seriousness of our purpose and the effectiveness of our Organization and its membership. There we are called upon to redress not only the dispossession of a people of their national rights, but also the forcible occupation by a State of the territories of other States. Our efforts in searching for a just and lasting solution leave a great deal to be desired. The longer we avoid tackling the problem at its root-cause, namely, the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people on the basis of the principles of the Charter, the more time we allow for further complications to develop.\n13.\tIn reaffirming Tanzania's support for, and solidarity with, the Palestinian people in their struggle, we take note with satisfaction of the growing consciousness among the international community of their cause, as evidenced by the increasing recognition accorded to their authentic representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization. At the same time, we reiterate our call for the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since June 1967. We consider these two elements, namely, the recognition of Palestinian national rights and the scrupulous observance of the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force, together with the right of all States in the region to an independent existence, as indispensable elements for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n14.\tThe continued conflict in Lebanon is also a source of great concern. It is our hope that that conflict will be speedily resolved and the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that country be ensured.\n15.\tIt is most regrettable that last year saw no progress towards a just solution of the problem of Cyprus, not with-standing the arduous efforts made by our Secretary- General. The threat to that island's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity has escalated rather than diminished. Inter-communal harmony and concord remain elusive. It is thus imperative that efforts be intensified to find a lasting solution of the conflict, thus ensuring the survival of, and respect for, the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus.\n16.\tWhile the ending of the war in IndoChina and the post-war reconstruction processes that have been taking place in Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea have ushered in a new and positive era in Asia, the situation in the Korean peninsula remains explosive. The international community has the right and obligation to do all within its power to promote justice and permanent peace in the area. That can be achieved only by the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command, thereby enabling the Korean people themselves to decide their destiny.\n17.\tComing nearer home, to Africa, I should like to point out my country's disappointment and concern at the continued occupation by France of the island of Mayotte. This is not only a serious violation of the United Nations Charter but also a vivid example of the unjust use of power.\nGeneral Assembly - Thirty-first Session - Plenary Meetings\n18.\tThis brings me to the question of decolonization in general and of southern Africa in particular. While I content myself by mentioning only in passing my country's appeal to the French Government to facilitate the independence of the so-called French Somaliland -Djibouti -and refrain from dwelling at length here on my country's concern over the unsatisfactory evolution of the decolonization processes in Western Sahara and East Timor, I feel in duty bound to dwell at length on the problems in southern Africa. I do so, not because the decolonization of those Territories is any less important, but because? of both my country's proximity to, and current involvement in, the issues of southern Africa, as well as because of the complexity of the situation there. I therefore feel that this august body is entitled to be left in no doubt of our stand in the matter.\n19.\tFew countries, if any, have experienced the most barbaric form of human degradation as those in southern Africa. And it is a very sad commentary on the effectiveness of our Organization, or, to be more precise, on the will and determination of its Members that, despite all the repeated warnings and pleas of free Africa, despite the proclaimed recognition by all of us of the twin evils of colonialism and racism, that scourge continues to afflict millions of our fellow men. Thus, if it is a truism to observe that the focus of world attention is now on southern Africa, it is an equal truism that the confrontation taking place there has, to no small extent, been encouraged by the failure of our Organization to take decisive and timely action owing to the obstacles placed by some of its membership. Therefore, as we review the interest now being focused on southern Africa, it is relevant that we recognize that, but for the attitude of indifference adopted by some of the Western Powers to the plight of the dominated and oppressed peoples, combined more often than not with a degree of collaboration with the very forces of racism and colonialism, the crisis in southern Africa could have been averted and thousands of lives spared.\n20.\tIt is important to make this point, first, because the struggle against colonialism and racism in southern Africa has now reached a crucial phase and thus demands decisive action by the international community. Such action is possible only by the collective will of us all. Unless those Powers which have in the past ignored our pleas and appeals now join us to create the necessary conditions for the triumph of freedom, justice and majority rule in southern Africa, and thus reduce the sufferings and sacrifices which, as they must now be aware, the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa are fully prepared to endure so as to regain their freedom and human dignity, that noble goal shall be reached only after untold suffering by innocent people. It is not helpful for those Powers to continue expressing verbal outrage while in practice condoning and, indeed, aiding the feces of evil as represented by the racist minority regime.\n21.\tThat reflection is necessary for another equally important reason. This Organization was created esseniisUy for the preservation of peace and security. It is therefore in duty bound to take appropriate measures not only to resolve outstanding conflicts but also to take such preventive measures as would avert potential crises.\n22.\tThe sad lesson of the southern African situation lies not only in the failure of the international community to take prompt action to halt a situation threatening inter-national peace and security but also in the deliberate refusal by those very Powers which obstructed meaningful action to understand and recognize the gravity of the situation.\n23. Fortunately, no one can accuse free Africa of failure to warn the international community of the growing crisis in southern Africa. African spokesmen at all levels, both in this Organization and in other forums, have repeatedly emphasized this point, even to the extent of being accused by some of our detractors and cynics of being obsessed by this problem. The warnings have been there; the appeals have been made. My own President, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, in his address to the commemorative session of the General Assembly, on 15 October 1970, marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization, devoted his entire speech almost exclusively to this problem. Explaining the struggle of the people of southern Africa, President Nyerere, inter alia, pointed out:\n\\\"No one can say that the peoples of these Territories did not try to secure change -even some movement towards justice- by peaceful means. They tried political organization, trade union organization and tribal welfare organization. They tried petitioning their rulers and international organizations; they tried peaceful public rallies; they tried the publicizing of their wrongs through the press of the world. Indeed, perhaps they tried too long, and thus enabled the forces of oppression to strengthen themselves too much, before they finally recognized the situation for what it was. For all their efforts were met with increased oppression and an increase in the sufferings imposed upon them. But the position is now obvious. Efforts to achieve peaceful change towards justice from within the States of southern Africa have failed, and failed miserably.\n\\\"As far as the peoples of southern Africa are concerned, therefore, the choice is now clear. They can acquiesce in their own humiliation and accept their position as third-class subjects of an alien ruling Power, or they can fight for their own manhood. They are now making that choice. And they are doing it for themselves. They are choosing future life at the cost of physical death and suffering for many.\n\\\"What free nation, or what free people, dares to tell the masses of South Africa, of Rhodesia, of Namibia and of the Portuguese colonies that they are wrong? Who is it that can tell these people that they should acquiesce in the daily humiliation of themselves and their children? Certainly the United Nations cannot do so. for this would be to deny the basic premise of human equality, and thus to deny the basis on which we meet here.\n\\\"No one who genuinely believes in human equality has the right to demand that the peoples of southern Africa should refrain from making war on racialism. But, if we used our strength in support of humanity, we could make their fighting unnecessary. For the United Nations -the nation States acting together- has the power to put such pressure on the States of southern Africa that change would have to come. It is a question of our will; it is a question of whether the preservation of peace by the removal of injustice is sufficiently important for us. If it is, we shall exert all pressures short of war. If it is not, then war will grow.\n\\\"Until now, we have not acted in support of our verbal condemnations of apartheid and colonialism. We have \ngiven the peoples of southern Africa no hope of change. So they have begun to take up arms in their own defense -in defense of their manhood and their right to a life which is more than brutal existence.\\\" \n24.\tIt is now six years since President Nyerere made that statement. In the course of that period important changes have taken place, thanks essentially to the armed struggle waged by the liberation movements in the area and actively supported by OAU and the friends of Africa all over the world. The last two years have particularly witnessed radical changes ushering in a new geopolitical situation in southern Africa by the extension of the frontiers of freedom through the liberation of Angola and Mozambique. Those victories by the freedom fighters have been scored in spite of the support which their oppressors continued to receive from some of their Western allies which clearly chose either completely to disregard or be indifferent to the many appeals made to them by free Africa.\n25.\tThe victories of the freedom fighters and free Africa have produced their own momentum. No longer has it been necessary to impress upon those cynical and doubtful few of Africa's determination to proceed at full speed ahead in supporting the liberation of the remaining parts of our continent. Yet, it is important to underscore that, even at the height of victory over Portuguese colonialism, Africa expressed its desire to obtain its objectives in southern Africa, if possible, through a negotiated settlement. Thus, active support was given to the Zimbabwe national liberation movement in its efforts to try once again to find a negotiated solution.\n26.\tThose efforts were fully endorsed by OAU, which, at the ninth extraordinary session of its Council of Ministers, held in Dar es Salaam in April 1975, adopted the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa, which was subsequently endorsed by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Kampala later that year. On Zimbabwe, the OAU position was succinctly put:\n\\\"The OAU's objective in Zimbabwe is independence on the basis of majority rule. This can be achieved either peacefully or by violent means. Either way, Africa will lend its total support to the freedom fighters led by their nationalist movement-the African National Council. As long as the objective of majority rule before independence is not compromised, the OAU would support all efforts made by the Zimbabwe nationalists to win independence by peaceful means.\\\"\n27.\tIt is a matter of record that those efforts of the Zimbabwe liberation movement, with the assistance of the front-line States and supported by OAU, were frustrated by the intransigence of the racist minority regime; hence, the historic decision to deescalate the talking and escalate the armed struggle.\n28.\tIt is common knowledge that, since the beginning of this year, the Zimbabwe freedom fighters have intensified in earnest their armed struggle for the liberation of their motherland. Thousands of young Zimbabweans have been and are involved in this struggle. Their heroic efforts, coupled with active African and international solidarity as exemplified by the courageous action of the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique to impose total sanctions against the regime, have brought about a new situation in that Territory: the forces of freedom are on the offensive while the racist regime has been put on the defensive. No one in his right mind could possibly entertain any doubt as to the inevitability of the victory of the freedom fighters.\n29.\tThe relevant question now is not whether there should be war or a peaceful solution, for the peaceful settlement being talking about is a misnomer when in fact the war is going on. What is at issue is whether this war should be prolonged in order to attain the objective or whether the impact of the general insurrection of the Zimbabweans has now brought some sense to the illegal racist authorities in Salisbury and thus paved the way for shortening the war through the realization of the objective of majority rule.\n30.\tIt is imperative properly to understand this back-ground in order to appraise the recent happenings in Zimbabwe correctly, for it would be idle to pretend that the momentum now generated towards a possible negotiated settlement would have been possible without the supreme sacrifices made by the freedom fighters and their unequivocal determination and commitment to pursue the armed struggle to final victory.\n31.\tThis, then, is the setting in which the recent initiative of the United States has to be viewed. In Lusaka, in April of this year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made an important statement on southern Africa. Viewed in the context of a policy and actions which could only be described at best as indifferent and at worst as totally negative in regard to the struggle for majority rule in southern Africa, that statement by the United States, if put into concrete action, would represent an important departure. Indeed, Tanzania has always believed that if the full weight of American power were placed against South Africa in support of freedom and justice, peace in southern Africa would come sooner rather than later.\n\n32.\tMy Government, which has consistently maintained that it is the policies and actions of some of the major Western Powers, including the United States, which have helped to sustain and strengthen the racist minority regimes, could not but hope for the implementation of such a policy, which would only place the United States in a position of abiding by the many decisions and resolutions of the United Nations concerning that question. In expressing such a hope, our interest has been, is, and will continue to be, freedom and justice for our brothers in southern Africa. And there is no doubt in our mind that if the United States and other major Western Powers were to alter their hitherto erroneous policy of giving support and comfort to the racist minority regimes in southern Africa, if they were instead genuinely to work in support of Africa's and the United Nations' objective in southern Africa- namely, an end to the twin evils of colonialism and racism-then there would be prospects for reducing the magnitude and dimensions of the war now raging there. If, on the other hand, experience of the development in southern Africa has not yet brought home the necessary lessons, then we can only lament the increased suffering and bloodshed which are inevitable since the war must and will go on. And for us in Tanzania, as indeed for the rest of Africa, our position is clear. My President put it succinctly in his address to the General Assembly in 1970, when he said:\n\\\"For Africa there is no choice. We have to support the freedom fighters. Theirs is merely a continuation of the freedom struggle which has already resulted in 41\\\" -now 47- \\\"African nations being represented in this General Assembly. The national freedom and human equality for which these people are fighting are not only the same rights which the rest of Africa claimed and won. They are also the only basis on which free States of Africa exist.\\\" \nClearly, therefore, the current efforts being made should be reviewed in this over-all framework of Africa's objectives.\n33.\tIn Zimbabwe, the objective has been and remains majority rule. Either the present warfare will be intensified until that objective has been achieved or a genuine negotiated settlement could now be obtained and the war thus shortened. In the light of the acceptance by the minority racist regime of majority rule as a condition of immediate independence, the'Presidents of the five front-line States have called upon the United Kingdom to convene a constitutional conference, outside Rhodesia, for the purpose of working out the modalities for the transfer of power. In this connexion, we take note of the agreement by the United Kingdom to convene such a conference.\n34.\tThe liberation movement with its fighters will certainly ensure that such negotiations will result in the attainment of the objective for which they have been fighting and for which cause many of their compatriots have laid down their lives. We can only stress that the time for tricks or maneuvers is long gone, for otherwise the struggle in all its dimensions will continue.\n35.\tOn Namibia, there is and there can be no room for confusion. This very Organization has determined and reiterated repeatedly that South Africa has no longer any Mandate over Namibia. The continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa is illegal and is in violation of the resolutions of the United Nations. South Africa's presence in that Territory is pure aggression against the Namibians and a provocation to all peace-loving nations and the United Nations. It is a military aggression. Like any other military aggression, it is a serious threat to international peace and security and must be viewed and dealt with as such. The Security Council has a clear responsibility to take the necessary measures under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter to remove that threat.\n36.\tSouth Africa clearly remains defiant of the United Nations. Furthermore, its policies and actions demonstrate that it prefers the path of confrontation: confrontation with the United Nations as well as continued confrontation with the African peoples of that Territory who, led by their authentic and legitimate representative-the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ-are determined to continue the fight for their liberation. This Organization has no option but to intensify its support of SWAPO. And for those who thought and may still think that South Africa could adopt a rational position on this question, the time has come for reflection. Either they join with the overwhelming majority of the Organization in taking collective action against those defiant and recalcitrant illegal usurpers or they obstruct such decisions and stand accused of aiding the oppressors of Namibians.\n37.\tIn South Africa itself, the moment of truth has come. The mass uprising, begun in Soweto and now a common phenomenon in many parts of South Africa, has totally shaken any myth that the apartheid minority regime of Pretoria could indefinitely hold on to the reins of rule by terror or could silence the oppressed people in South Africa. It has unequivocally cleared .any lingering doubts as to the intense and explosive repulsion felt by the African people at Nazi policies disguised as apartheid.\n38.\tWe lament the loss of life which takes place in the process. This, however, is the expected response from the agitated racist minority regime. But the blood of those martyrs, among whom many are schoolchildren, is the fuel of the revolution. The patience of the African people of South Africa has been exhausted. If the Vorster regime takes any longer to realize the doom and inevitability of its end, a fire storm will develop to consume every remnant of apartheid and racial bigotry in South Africa.\n39.\tThat the racist minority regime in South Africa is fast heading for a collapse is clearly indicated both within and without South Africa and is sensed even by the Pretoria regime itself. The colonial situations which provided a buffer to South Africa's frontiers are either gone or fast crumbling, leaving exposed and a target the hideout of that remnant of Nazism. Inside South Africa itself, there is panic and mounting insecurity for the racists because they know too well that there will be no peace and security except through the total liquidation of apartheid.\n40.\tIn the confrontation that is now unfolding in South Africa, the attitude of those who have found it prudent to co-operate and collaborate with that regime will face its severest test. For the stark truth is that South Africa is surviving and is able to defy this Organization because of the .support it is receiving from those countries that invest in and trade with South Africa. Besides, South Africa continues to receive military supplies from some Western countries. These actions are irreconcilable with their solemn pledge through the Charter. Those countries that give support to South Africa thus have a great responsibility. Will they, through their policies and actions, assist, or at least refrain from obstructing, the surging wave of human liberation, or will they choose to continue supporting, overtly or covertly, the apartheid regime and thus make themselves no less a target for wrath, indignation and outright opposition of the African people in South Africa and their supporters and allies both within and outside Africa?\n41.\tIt is our sincere hope that all of us will support the cause of the people of South Africa in action as we do in words. For what will finally help restore respect for our Organization, and, indeed, for its Member States, is not the beautiful rhetoric of solidarity with the oppressed people in\u2003South Africa that we have heard in this and other forums, but the concrete actions of our Governments. In this regard Tanzania hopes that all of us will commit ourselves before the end of this session not to recognize that Transkei or any other \\\"bantustan\\\" whose creation aims at the entrenchment and perpetuation of the apartheid system.\n42.\tFinally, but not least important, I should like to turn to the question of international economic relations. In fact, in my country we consider this problem to be equal in importance to the problem of political independence per se, if not more important. For our survival as independent nations will ultimately very much depend on our survival as independent economic entities. Economic justice therefore lies at the heart of our second phase of the liberation struggle, which must continue.\n\n43.\tThe demand of the overwhelming majority of the members of the international community is to establish a new and equitable international economic order. This demand reached its full expression at the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order were adopted [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202(S-VI)]. We, the developing countries, have expressed and demonstrated our willingness to enter into dialog with the developed countries to ensure that the new international economic order we seek to establish will be acceptable and beneficial to all members of the international community. Our willingness to negotiate was clearly demonstrated at the seventh special session of the. United Nations General Assembly and at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. The developing countries are displaying the same spirit in the negotiations going on at the Paris Conference on Inter-national Economic Co-operation and at other forums dealing with issues of development and international economic co-operation.\n44.\tHowever, the slow pace at which these negotiations are taking place both at the Paris Conference and elsewhere clearly reveals that the spirit being displayed by the developing countries is not being reciprocated by certain developed countries whose major preoccupation is to resist change and maintain the status quo with its concomitant inequities.\n45.\tYesterday morning [ 11th meeting/ the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and current Chairman of the non-aligned movement very ably and in very clear terms stated the areas of redress that we in the developing countries seek in the new international economic order. I do not intend to repeat that message here. However, there is one aspect to which I feel I should address myself. This is in the field of international monetary reform.\n46.\tFor many years now since this debate was started in the International Monetary Fund [IMF], the developing countries have made pleas for the linking of the creation of the special drawing rights to the transfer of resources to the poor countries. This has been and continues to be in order to supplement the efforts currently being undertaken by the other agencies, such as the International Development Association. Besides, such a link could easily be built into the compensatory program of IMF, thus facilitating the indexing of prices for primary commodities, a proposal which so far has fallen on deaf ears in the rich countries. By so doing, not only would we improve the exchange-earnings capacity of the primary-producing countries but, above all, by giving additional liquidity to the poor countries, whose sources of intermediate and capital goods are the rich industrialized nations, we would facilitate the expansion of demand for the manufactured products of the latter and hence help to mop up the excess productive capacity that is at present a problem facing some of these countries. In other words, the industrialized countries would more equitably earn these special drawing rights through trade and, therefore, be able to increase their production and employment. Besides, through the price compensatory mechanism, the primary producers would also be able to improve their export earnings, since they would be remunerated under more equitable conditions.\n47.\tMy country finds it very difficult to accept that to make such a demand is asking too much. On the contrary, the refusal of the industrialized countries to accept these proposals is aimed at maintaining the present unjust system of most unequal exchange. It is for this reason that Tanzania would advocate the total rejection of the second amendment of the IMF rules, which only accentuates our plight.\n48.\tWe in the developing countries are not looking for charity. We want equity. Our plea is thus aimed at changing the present unfair system of trade to one under which all of us will be paid fairly for our sweat.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I wish to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his election to his most highly respected post as President of the General Assembly. I know that there are heavy responsibilities ahead of him in the coming weeks. Our delegation has the utmost confidence in his capabilities, and I trust that under his able leadership this session will be a success.\n111.\tOn the occasion of Papua New Guinea's admission to this Organization in October of 1975, our Prime Minister, Mr. Somare, stated that our Government's first priority is the welfare of our own people. This is still valid today. We wish to advance in conditions of peace and security and \nrealize that to achieve this we must make our presence known in world affairs.\n112.\tWe are committed to the increasing interdependence of all Members of this family of nations and see this Organization and its subsidiary and affiliated organizations as the main hope for the third world. In this context we wish to welcome the new Members to the United Nations and in particular the Republic of Seychelles. It is also Papua New Guinea's hope that Viet Nam and Angola will be given favorable consideration on their application for membership.\n113.\tThis is the second time that Papua New Guinea has taken its place in this Assembly. We are proud to have come through our first year of independence. We are also proud that we came through it so well and that we are able to report to this world forum that we have maintained the impetus towards development and social justice set in motion before our independence. We have maintained and developed the trust which was handed to us by the Trusteeship Council.\n114.\tThe first year of the operation of Papua New Guinea's independent foreign policy has justified our faith in choosing what we call the \u201cuniversalist\u201d path.\n115.\t\u201cUniversalism\u201d as practiced by Papua New Guinea is not widely understood by our friends. It is often confused with \\\"non-alignment\\\", which it certainly resembles, but the two concepts differ in many important areas. \u201cUniversalism\u201d to Papua New Guinea means taking the middle path without veering to either side on questions relating to political ideologies, creeds or governmental systems. We see it as a balanced policy with which Papua New Guinea will make no enemies. But it does not mean just sitting on the fence. It is an active and positive policy. Papua New Guinea has recognized and entered into diplomatic relations with all the large Powers of the world on an equal basis. We are happy to have entered into diplomatic relations with countries having varied forms of governmental systems and geographical location. We have recognized and entered into relations with both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on an entirely even-handed basis.\n116.\tThe one area in which the Papua New Guinea Government does not intend to pursue universalism is in respect to regimes which pursue apartheid or racialist* policies which are unacceptable to us. The Papua New Guinea Government has not and will not recognize, or have any dealings whatever with, countries which practise these policies. We endorse the work of the decolonization Committee2 in seeking self-determination for all peoples in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n117.\tI have mentioned before that Papua New Guinea has recognized both the North Korean and South Korean Governments. We desire most earnestly, for the sake of the future security of the region in which we live, that these two Governments should commence a dialogue between\n \nthemselves which will result in a peaceful solution to the present uneasy situation. We would, further, wish to see both those Governments represented in the United Nations as equal sovereign States.\n118.\tPapua New Guinea .is geographically very near to the island of Timor, which has seen some most unfortunate incidents during the course of this year. As a close neighbor we have been most concerned by these incidents and have watched them closely. We advocated for Timor a period of decolonization under the United Nations. But Papua New Guinea is a very small and new actor on the world stage, and it was clear from the outset that there was not any way in which Papua New Guinea could influence the events on Timor in one way or another. Papua New Guinea therefore has not played any active role in . the settlement of the Timor situation. We hope, however, that the people of Timor will be assured their rights and freedoms as outlined in the United Nations Charter.\n119.\tPapua New Guinea has watched from afar the\nproblems of the Middle East. We wish to commend the work of the United Nations in moving towards a peaceful solution.\n120.\tI have already mentioned that the Government of Papua New Guinea considers its first priority to be the welfare of its own people at home. Papua New Guinea has only achieved a very low level of industrial development. Its export income is derived mainly from the sale of primary products. The nature of our economy is such that sharp changes in world market prices have very important implications for economic planning in our country. We know that we are not unique and that other countries are also experiencing the ill-effects of the current world recession. I feel confident in saying that the effects are felt more acutely by those of us in the third world who are heavily dependent on earnings from the sale of primary products. It is in this context that the Government of Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of the Secretary- General of UNCTAD to bring about a significant change in the existing world economic order.\n121.\tThe fourth session of UNCTAD, recently held in Nairobi, marks the opening of a new and vitally important chapter in relations between the economically advantaged and the economically disadvantaged countries. Proposals put forward have far-reaching implications for all third- world countries. Papua New Guinea, as an island developing country, applauds the special recognition given to the problems of least-developed, land-locked and island developing countries. We welcome and endorse resolution 96 (IV) adopted at Nairobi relating to the expansion and diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries, and resolution 93 (IV) on the integrated program for commodities.  However, caution needs to be voiced. We sincerely hope that time does not bear witness to the fact that file programs were too ambitious and as a result stalled under their own weight. \n122.\tAnother instance of international co-operation that is of particular concern to Papua New Guinea is the attempt now being made by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to grapple with the still unresolved questions that have been entrusted to it. We feel growing anxiety at the failure so far of the Conference to reach a conclusion. Papua New Guinea has been actively participating in that Conference, and remains fully committed to the goal of a generally accepted treaty.\n123.\tHowever we have noted that in the absence of a treaty it is inevitably the stronger nations that are able to take the initiative in developing State practice in this field. In these circumstances smaller nations like Papua New Guinea in protecting their interests have no alternative but to seek such security as may be found in regional arrangements. There is no question, however, that this is our second preference. It is a poorer alternative, both for ourselves and for mankind. No one can contemplate the possible failure of the Conference without being filled with despondency for the future of all who might be affected by the use of the oceans, which include all nations represented at this Assembly.\n124.\tFinally, I again reiterate my Government's commitment to the maintenance of peace throughout our region and the world. My Government is deeply committed to a nuclear-free zone in the Pacific and supports the other Pacific countries in calling for such a declaration. My Government commends the work of this Organization, its subsidiaries and affiliated organizations in upholding the principles as expounded in the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my country and on my own behalf I am extremely pleased to express the sincere congratulations of my delegation to Mr. Amerasinghe on his election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The outstanding work which he has done as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea assures us of wise, effective and expert leadership which will undoubtedly contribute to the success of our deliberations.\n277.\tMay I also pay a tribute to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for his remarkable work as the head of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n278.\tOn behalf of my Government and on my own behalf I should like specially to greet our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has served our Organization loyally and selflessly, with an honesty and dignity that have earned for him the gratitude of the entire world. His excellent understanding of the aspirations of mankind and his constant struggle for a lasting peace in the world, for the advancement of the peopled and for the strengthening of international security have established him as the most valuable official of the United Nations whose presence creates trust and confidence. We wish Mr. Waidheim all success for his future at the service of the international community.\n279.\tI should like, on behalf of the President of my country, His Excellency General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, to thank the Latin American group of States for having supported our candidacy for one of the vice- presidencies of the General Assembly. I should also like to thank all Member States who voted for us. As in the past, we shall give our full co-operation to the President of the General Assembly in discharging the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him.\n280.\tThis year we are welcoming the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles, the newest Member of the Organization and we hope that we will in future give full effect to the principle of universality. We must keep that principle in mind and not let ourselves be influenced by a country's form of government or the way in which it may conduct affairs falling essentially within its own jurisdiction.\n281.\tIn the statement which I made last year before the General Assembly,  I expressed the belief that we should not feel proud of the behaviour of the international society in the year which we were then considering. New developments, especially in the last few months-although they do not improve the general picture-make it possible for us to be cautiously optimistic when we look at the long-term situation.\n282.\tClearly there has been a relaxation of tensions among the great Powers, a greater recognition of their interdependence and in general the creation of more favourable conditions for the maintenance of a situation of peace between them.\n283.\tUnfortunately, as regards the developing countries, I must once again and with great emphasis say that the conditions for peace are becoming increasingly more precarious every day.\n284.\tIn Lebanon there has been re-emergence of internal problems, which we truly regret. It is painful to see a nation dismembering itself and heading for a very serious situation of conflict whose consequences are difficult to foresee. Lebanon's fate introduces new factors in the general Middle East situation to which we cannot be indifferent. We urge all Powers from outside that area to act as cautiously as possible in order to prevent any deterioration of the situation.\n285.\tWe do not share the simplistic views of those who feel that the worsening of the general situation in that part of the world is due only to the existence and acts of the State of Israel. We firmly believe that there exist in the Middle East factors totally unrelated to the Jewish- Palestinian problem and that it is rather the interference of elements which are extraneous to the problems of those peoples, their special characteristics, their way of acting and their beliefs that have actually brought about the present' situation. Various countries have suffered the consequences of this process of systematic agitation. For some their progress towards a higher level of economic and social development has been set back; realizing their mistake, such countries are taking the necessary action to make up for lost time and, abandoning the use of force, are seeking through negotiations to normalize their international relations. Others have had to go through cruel, internal struggles in order to restore their administrative and political unity, threatened by unnecessarily large penetration systematically stirred up by outside interests, forgetting that peace is the most certain and best way of achieving national integrity and progress for their peoples.\n286.\tIn our opinion solutions for that region cannot be found a priori We are all in favour of peace, but it is the parties that are directly involved that can find solutions, because it is the only way in which these solutions will truly be accepted by all sides and will have the lasting quality derived from agreement and accommodation among the parties. What we must do is to stimulate and promote negotiations, open and unbiased negotiations inspired only by the desire to achieve a peace in which there will be no victors and no vanquished.\n287.\tLast year I expressed our joy at the acceleration of the process of decolonization. We have witnessed the marvelous emergence of new nations in Africa through the accelerating process of liberation which a century and a half ago caused upheavals in the American continent. One by one the peoples of Africa, formerly languishing in a desperate colonial situation, have arisen to demand the inherent right of all peoples to self-determination and freedom and have emerged as independent States which today confirm the universal vocation of our Organization.\n288.\tHowever, the methods used to achieve freedom and to go from freedom to international co-operation and interdependence* differ greatly. In some States freedom was the offspring of bloody struggles in which arms asserted what the law denied. In those circumstances, the wounds will be slow to heal and the return to a reasonable mean from the extremist positions which inspired the struggle has to be slow and painful.\n289.\tIn those countries where freedom was achieved through the upheavals of revolution, it is there that we have seen most clearly the dangers of all forms of foreign intervention. The presence of those external factors prevents the new directions taken by the people who have been victims of the intervention from being determined by the will of its citizens and, through subterfuges or overt violations of the right to self-determination, the forces of intervention impose on new States from abroad a particular foreign ideological policy which does not always reflect the interests, concerns and true needs of the people they say they have helped to liberate.\n290.\tMy Government maintains the hope that the serious problem which has been confronted by all African nations in solidarity today can be resolved by means of negotiation, and that the international community will take all necessary measures in order to lay the foundations for a movement towards more just forms of political organization and towards higher levels of economic development.\n291.\tIn referring to the problems of Africa we do not intend to engage in pious expressions, of egalitarianism. We have never advocated a policy not in keeping with our own conduct. We do not claim to be, but rather we are and we act as, opponents of racism. Our Government has not only promulgated laws for the elimination of all traces of racism but has also granted, as an inherent human right, equality of opportunity for all sectors of the Nicaraguan population, whose various ethnic groups can hope to participate effectively and successfully in our foreign relations and in the economic and social development of our entire human potential.\n292.\tWe wish to leave no doubt of the fact that we disapprove of violence and that we believe that national and international dialogue have no substitutes as means to promote the rational advance of human institutions, and that all the peoples of the world without exception have the same right to exist with their own characteristics and identities.\n293.\tFor this reason we regret the fact that in matters of disarmament so little has been achieved so far. The arms race, which was formerly carried on only by the great Powers, is being continued more intensively by medium- sized and small countries, which divert to the manufacture or acquisition of armaments considerable human and economic resources which could be used to accelerate the economic and social development so urgently needed by our peoples. Furthermore, this new phase of the arms race continues to increase international tension and is a danger to international peace and security.\n294.\tOur laws embody the rejection by the people and the Government of Nicaragua of war and the use of force as an instrument of international policy, and, consistent with our Christian and democratic traditions, the only forces which we maintain in our country are those which are indispensable for the guarantee of good public order and the normal development of our institutions.\n295.\tIn international and national affairs our Government has recourse to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to negotiation and open dialogue without preconceptions as the normal tools of governmental action.\n296.\tOur military budget is extremely small and much of what is allocated to the armed forces is actually used to help our local communities to improve their development- infrastructures or to achieve higher educational and technical levels for members of the armed forces in civilian occupations and for the civilian population.\n297. What I have said applies in particular to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which increases every day. In Latin America we took the first step in the banning of these weapons, although one of the great nuclear Powers has not as yet signed and ratified the Optional Protocol II of the Tlatelolco Treaty, which would oblige it to respect our denuclearization. In view of recent events in that field we believe that the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be most firmly supported in order to ensure that atomic energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n298.\tIn the last four years the United Nations has placed greater emphasis on the search for the solution to international terrorism. This criminal form of political action has been a constant universal evil with sporadic but proliferating manifestations.\n299.\tFollowing an intensification of terrorism after the First World War attempts were made at establishing international limits applicable to the perpetrators of such crimes. At the International Conference for the Unification of Criminal Law in the 1920s and 1930s, attention was again paid to terrorism, leading to the revision of certain extradition treaties which defined as terrorist crimes those acts that could not be covered by the humanitarian principle of asylum.\n300.\tIn the first two decades of its life the United Nations attached relatively little importance to this problem. The work of the International Law Commission, particularly when it tried to define in its rules breaches of the peace and of the security of human beings in general for the war-crimes tribunal and judges, constituted the most serious attempt to codify applicable international law.\n301.\tThe culmination of the work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression; the Declaration of the Principles of International Law Regarding Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]; the adoption by the Organization of American States in 1971 of a convention for the prevention and punishment of acts of international terrorism;  the work of the International Civil Aviation Organization, with its Tokyo Conventions of 1963, the Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971; all these constitute the most meaningful efforts which have been made prior to the taking up of this item by our Organization at this stage. But these efforts have been frustrated, in fact ridiculed, by the refusal of some countries not to act as sanctuaries for those who -reasonably or not in terms of their objectives-resort to the crime of terrorism in order to underscore with innocent blood their so-called political demands.\n302.\tThe twenty-seventh session established a special committee of 35 members  including my country. That Committee submitted a report to the next session,  but since then no action has been taken in the matter. My Government believes that the need to take effective measures is growing daily more urgent. We cannot view with indifference the increasingly frequent sacrifice of innocent victims, whatever the cause or motivation, because nothing can justify or excuse it. Undoubtedly, the study of the underlying causes and subjective motivations of terrorist behaviour is of great importance, but such studies cannot serve as a pretext for postponing indefinitely the adoption of specific measures for the prevention of terrorist acts. Effective action should also be taken to prevent any State from giving any co-operation in the commission of acts of terrorism, and to ensure that if they are committed they do not go unpunished.\n303.\tI reaffirm here my Government's firm conviction that no effort should be spared in persuading all States that there must be no sacrosanct refuge or inviolable asylum, for political crimes, if we desire reason rather than recourse to crime to be the tool with which peoples forge their political institutions.\n304.\tThis is why my delegation listened sympathetically to the request by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany [1th meetingJ that the item \\\"Drafting of an international convention against the taking of hostages\\\" should be included in the agenda as an important and urgent question at this session. My delegation offers here and now its firm and faithful support for this proposal and will oppose any delaying tactics in regard to it.\n305.\tThe civilized coexistence of individuals, the tranquility of homes and the flourishing of communities is impossible without a reasonable minimum of peace and calm. As long as terrorism continues to be an effective tool for political ends, no nation will be sure of that essential minimum of peace and calm.\n306.\tWhatever its ideological banner, there can be no political or moral justification of terrorism, and we must use all our will and intelligence to ensure that those who take hostages or commit atrocities for the purpose of terrorizing whole peoples shall find refuge in no country and shall be subject to mandatory extradition or some- other form of legal proceedings which satisfies the international conscience that condemns them.\n307.\tA few days before this session of the Assembly opened the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea came to an end. Looking at the work done by the Conference so far we see that the original hope of achieving in a short time a complete solution of these problems has not been fulfilled. Particularly if we take into account the complexity and difficulty of these problems we must recognize the fact that much has been accomplished. So serious would be the consequences if no solutions were to be found, that all countries are interested in finding solutions and are sparing no effort for that purpose. We are confident that at its next session the Conference will be able to reconcile the opposing positions and formulate a more equitable set of principles for the law of the sea than those that have traditionally obtained.\n308.\tI should like to reiterate here that my Government will continue to maintain the most cordial relations with its neighbours and that it is unswervingly dedicated to the peaceful solution of any controversies that might arise as a result of the demarcation of its sea frontiers. I should like to make it clear that we claim the whole of our continental shelf in both oceans under concepts of sovereignty incorporated in our basic legislation and under the applicable rules of international law. This territorial integrity will be maintained in full, since this is the formal decision of the Government of Nicaragua.\n309.\tNicaragua is a country which strictly observes human rights. Thus it will support at this Assembly any initiative for their advancement at the world level. We understand the difficulties that exist in this respect, not least of which is that of reconciling such advancement with the principal of national sovereignty and resisting the temptation to apply it selectively only to countries whose ideologies differ from our own. We must note the proliferation of international organizations which, with the ostensible aim of promoting human rights, indulge in attacks on and denigration of the countries which for some reason do not share their thinking. Where human rights are concerned we think it essential to eliminate racial discrimination and the exaggerated economic imbalance which truly underlies de facto segregation. Although much progress has been made on these two problems, much still remains to be done to give human rights effect in all parts of the world.\n310.\tWe also believe it essential not to have a double standard for human rights. The sustained and full exercise of human rights finds its counterpart and can only be maintained when there is observance of the human duty to live in conformity with the law and to respect the rights of others.\n311.\tHuman rights are embodied in the Constitution and laws of my country, and even in states of extreme emergency their enforcement and protection have been the immutable concern of my Government. Being aware of national law and universal ethical norms, although we have not wavered in our unbiased application of the law to safeguard the right of all to live and flourish in peace, such application has not been more stringent than necessary, notwithstanding the political philosophy of raison d'etat.\n312.\tNicaragua attaches great importance to problems of development and international co-operation. Today the problems of economic and social development are the most pressing ones and they require urgent solution if we desire that the growing crisis should not continue to divide mankind into two castes with different levels of welfare, whose separation increases in step with the technological imbalance between the two sectors of mankind.\n313.\tIt is clear that the present international situation, unless subjected to realistic and just changes, will continue to be one of the most important factors influencing the unsatisfactory promotion at the world level of the development of our societies and of the opportunities for integrated development available to the individual.\n314.\tThe struggle for the realistic and just revision of that international economic and social order must be sustained, persistent and intelligent. We are aware of the close link between economics and politics, but we do not belong to any deterministic school and we firmly believe that confrontation is not the most satisfactory approach to the problem or the most practicable way of solving it.\n315.\tIn that spirit we participated in the Third Ministerial Meeting at Manila which approved the declaration and plan of action of the Group of 77. My Government believes that one of the main planks of the new international economic order is the strengthening and rationalization of individual national economic systems. These systems must be based on the philosophy and aspirations of each people and must aim at establishing the internal conditions needed to enable the citizens to participate equally in the benefits of their economic system and to adjust standards of living to the national capacity to generate wealth.\n316.\tWe share with the majority of the developing countries the conviction that international economic relations must undergo significant changes. We also believe that the solution to development problems does not depend only on the building of new international structures and the creation of new conditions within which international economic relations are planned and put into practice. We think that there are ways open in the present institutional situation and that they should be used.\n317.\tIt is significant that on the fringe of, or parallel with, the meetings of the economic bodies of the United Nations system, other meetings have been held which enable the more developed nations to draw up a strategy for action in the light of the demands of the developing countries. In some of those meetings developing countries whose economic development makes their interests more clearly identifiable with those of the developed countries have taken part.\n318.\tIt must be recognized that there exists a functional relationship between national Governments and the international structures which those Governments establish. All that we can expect from the international structures is the solutions that we actively seek. It is our own Governments that must determine the policies of the various international bodies, and we must be more sensitive than ever to the differences which have gradually entered what was once an international unity of thinking of the two main economic blocs in our Organization.\n319.\tI will not repeat here the appeals which the developing countries have made for equity in international economic relations: on questions of raw materials; on international finance; on the terms of trade; on the flow of capital, the levels of external debt and the currency and brain drain. The effectiveness and equity of the international order will not depend-it never has depended -on the statements we make, but on the action we take and on the collective influence we can bring to bear.\n320.\tWhen in this Assembly we consider the agreements reached at the meetings at Manila, Nairobi, Colombo, Rambouillet, Jamaica and Puerto Rico we should leave aside statements about our anxieties and concerns expressed in such past resolutions. Concrete plans have been put forward. The two main economic blocs have been specific. My Government expresses today through me its determination to participate fully in the objective study of those declarations and seek to harmonize its aspirations and thinking with all the other Member countries in all areas of international co-operation. Slowly and gradually we have been preparing for this clearly new international venture. We have laid the national legal foundations to enable us to promote and benefit from trade with other countries, including those having economic and political systems different from our own.\n321.\tIn economic matters Nicaragua places special emphasis on the development of its human resources, the true infrastructure for a national economy. In recent decades our Government has made notable progress in reducing total and functional illiteracy: it has increased the number and quality of its primary education institutions; diversified and increased the secondary and vocational education centres; maintained the autonomy of the universities and encouraged their growth and diversification. It is clear, however, that the quality of the education that we give has a direct relation to our access to the sources of technological development that will enable us not merely to import technology but to develop our own capacity to create it.\n322.\tWe intend to introduce a system for the planning of our economic and social development, giving increasing emphasis to those aspects of the development of our human resources, and we are convinced that frameworks for international co-operation and regional integration to which we can belong will not produce their maximum benefits for us unless we have the social infrastructure which such progress will make possible.\n323.\tWe have just attended the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries at Mexico City, which approved resolutions that will positively affect the lives of our peoples and ensure greater self-determination, self-sufficiency and group negotiating power. Among.the resolutions adopted mention should be made of one concerning the reform and improvement of the present systems of integration. My country has collaborated vigorously in the efforts of the five nations of the Central American isthmus to revitalize the Central American Common Market and convert it into the Central American Economic and Social Community. Moreover we welcome enthusiastically the call by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela for the establishment of the Latin American Economic System, which will present in united form the thinking of our region on economic matters at world meetings. Another important aspect of the Conference was the recognition that multinational enterprises of the developing countries should be set up. In this connexion, Nicaragua participates in the multinational fleet of the Caribbean (NAMUCAR)  and views with growing interest the strengthening of its relations with the countries of the Caribbean region.\n324.\tNicaragua has benefited from the assistance pro-grammes sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] and welcomes the fact that it is now able to overcome the economic problems which limited its activities in the past year. We wish to urge all those countries able to do so to support UNDP so that it may continue its work of building an international community in which all countries will enjoy a more acceptable and just standard of living. My Government reaffirms here its support for UNDP and urges its strengthening at the local level and thus-at the world level-the strengthening of its capacity to participate in the identification, evaluation and control of operational activities for development.\n325.\tMy Government views with great concern the problems arising from the constant pollution of the atmosphere, rivers and seas, and the diminution of the productive potential of agricultural land, which in turn diminishes the possibilities of survival of future generations. Accordingly, my Government supports the programmes of UNEP and is most ready to co-operate in the search for formulas and the implementation of measures to ensure the necessary conditions for the protection of the common heritage of mankind. Reaffirming our support for the UNEP programmes, it was with great pleasure that my Government observed World Environment Day celebrated by the United Nations on 5 June each year.\n326.\tEnvironmental pollution is a problem which must be solved at the world level by such means as the world environmental monitoring system. Regional co-ordination could produce especially fruitful results in such areas as training and education, the drafting of national laws on the environment and the management of natural resources at the regional level. To that end it seems to us necessary for UNEP to consider holding seminars in the developing countries for the discussion of environmental problems.\n327.\tBut what is more important is for the differences in levels of development to be taken into account. For that purpose it is essential that international rules and regulations for the protection of the environment should not be so rigid as to affect adversely the development efforts of the developing countries. As the President of Nicaragua, His Excellency General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, stated on World Environment Day:\n\\\"We seek in technology the means of harmonizing the paramount responsibility of safeguarding the environment without limiting the activities of peoples such as our own which have embarked on a process of growth for the social and economic welfare of each of our citizens.\\\"\n328.\tOur country is making efforts to improve its present situation and make a substantial improvement in the standard of living of its inhabitants, on the basis of the principle that improvement of our state of development depends mainly on our own efforts. From the international standpoint we recognize that co-operation among countries is an important and complementary factor, founded on an international development strategy. It has been shown that the present international order does not foster the advancement of our interests and accentuates the gap between our countries and the industrialized countries. Thus, in talking of an international development strategy suited to our needs, we must refer to the imperative need for this order to be changed so as to serve as the basis for more equitable relations among countries and co-operation for the common good.\n329.\tAccordingly, our country, like the other developing countries, supported the decision of the vast majority of the international community to establish a new international economic order based on the principles of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] and on the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S- VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and on the agreements reached at the seventh special session, without infringing the sovereign rights of all States to choose their own economic systems so as to provide the essential stimulus for capital and labour to work together for the good of the community.\n"

        "file_text": "Once again it is my signal honor and satisfaction to address this supreme forum where all nations present should overcome their differences, with their hands outstretched in concord and friendship. On behalf of the Government of El Salvador, of my delegation and on my own behalf I have the satisfaction to express to Mr. Amerasinghe our most effusive congratulations on his unanimous election to preside over this General Assembly at its thirty-first session. His distinguished and recognized merits constitute an effective guarantee that this world Assembly will bring to a successful conclusion the important tasks entrusted to it.\n99.\tI likewise wish to emphasize my appreciation to Mr. Gaston Thorn for his success in guiding this General Assembly during its thirtieth session.\n100.\tI give my warmest welcome on behalf of my country to the Republic of Seychelles on its entry into this Organization. Its .presence strengthens the United Nations system and is tangible proof that every day we are more forcefully achieving the objective of universality, that aspiration which, strengthened by the observance of the precepts of the Charter, the maintenance of world peace seeks.\n101.\tI shall now refer to matters which my delegation considers to be paramount and deserving of the attention of this Assembly. In recent years, my country has wished to state its views on these subjects and reveal its wish to bring forward facts which will be helpful to effective international co-operation in all its aspects.\n102.\tIn the first place, my Government would like to emphasize the gradual transformation it has observed in the political atmosphere as regards the new international economic order from a pragmatic standpoint.\n103.\tIn 1974, as a consequence of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, my country emphasized the need for political willingness, on the part of the industrialized countries, to alter the antiquated and unjust world structure in the economic sphere because at that time the positions of those countries were not precisely favorable to a prompt acceptance of such ideas. Now this underwent a positive change because of the excellent results of the seventh special session of the General Assembly in 1975, results which were obtained by consensus in an atmosphere of optimism and enthusiastic declarations of good intentions which led us to believe in the existence of vast possibilities for the new international economic order to become a reality. However, after another year went by, we observed with profound concern that, when it comes to dealing with concrete proposals to make such intentions a practical reality, obstacles crop up and the specter of the lack of political will reappears.\n104.\tThis is precisely what happened at the fourth session of UNCTAD in May of this year at Nairobi. At that gathering the hopes of the developing countries, as contained in the Manila Declaration and program of Action,  were largely centered on the operation of the integrated program for commodities and its consequent financial support, which was to be an effective instrument in the efforts of the poorer countries to attain higher stages of development. But the response of the industrialized countries to this proposal was discouraging for it deferred the adoption of decisions, thus deflecting a real commitment of support for this program, the purpose of which, as is known, is to obtain stable and remunerative prices for a series of commodities that affect the economies of the third world.\n105.\tEl Salvador would therefore draw the attention of Governments once again to the fact that pragmatic dealing in a system of co-operation based on equity, sovereign equality, and interdependence are of common interest to all States. Establishment of a system which would make it possible for the developing countries to attain a better standard of living will in fact be to the advantage of the industrialized countries themselves because of the benefits they would derive from an increase in trade relations. Within that context, emphasis is warranted on the need to redress the notorious disparities in national income by such measures as special treatment of financial surpluses, setting them up as credit programs for the benefit of the less developed countries. Such surpluses could be canalized, for example, through the common fund for the financing of international commodity stocks, the establishment of which was considered during the recently concluded session of UNCTAD.\n106.\tThe previously mentioned objective would be more easily attained if the obstacles to international trade were eliminated through promoting more effectively the schemes of generalized preferences, affording easier access of the developing countries to the markets of the industrialized Powers, and setting up adequate and timely assistance for the transfer of technology. At the same time there should be a study of the need for short-term application of the theory of complementarity of regions on the basis of a rational international division of labor and within a framework which would encourage the establishment or strengthening of schemes for regional and subregional integration.\n107.\tThis series of actions could be carried out within the UNCTAD forum if it were to become a strengthened and adjusted body, so that it would not only deliberate and negotiate but take action on international trade matters and related questions of economic development and cooperation. My Government firmly supports proposals to achieve this objective because they are part of the new international economic order.\n108.\tEl Salvador once again wants to emphasize the importance attached to the Latin American economic system (SELA] as the most appropriate mechanism established for the purposes of co-ordinating, consulting, analyzing and proposing solutions to the economic problems of the area, giving,,.impetus to co-operation systems and prompting multinational projects. SELA as the cement binding Latin American countries together will make it possible to adopt a sound negotiating position vis-a-vis developed countries on the continent and other areas of the world. It will also promote and facilitate progress towards Latin American integrationist objectives taking into account the special characteristics of the relatively less developed countries.\n109.\tAn outstanding event in the year 1976 was Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements which was held at Vancouver from 31 May to 11 June. The background for that gathering as is known dates back to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm in June 1972, where the urgency of viable formulas for solving the problems originated by the concentration of human beings in cities was made manifest, as well as the need for urgent solutions to environmental pollution and the worsening housing crisis. All of those led to the idea of holding a conference which would specifically consider these items and promote the dignity of man so that he could develop fully by being provided with a suitable environment,\n110.\tThe Government of El Salvador considers that the Conference largely attained the specific objective set for it toy serving as a practical means for an exchange of information about solutions to problems of human settlements and on measures against action detrimental to the environment as well, by formulating policies and programs for Governments and international organizations n accordance with the provisions of resolution 128 (XXVIII) of the General Assembly. In fact the final documents of the Conference, that is to say the Vancouver declaration on Human Settlements, 197612 and the programs for international cooperation and the 64 recommendations addressed to Governments constitute an instrument which opens up new horizons for conducting national and international actions with more vigor and effectiveness in respect to problems of habitat,\n111.\tThe Government of EI Salvador wishes to take this opportunity to reaffirm its support for the resolutions and recommendations of that Conference, in particular the Vancouver Declaration which was proposed by the Group of 77 since it constitutes a far-reaching step in die efforts of the international community to overcome burning problems, thus creating an atmosphere favorable to peace, harmonious coexistence and development.\n112.\tAt the institutional level the Conference recommended the establishment of a global intergovernmental body and an efficient United Nations secretariat for human settlements. In the opinion of my Government the efficiency of that secretariat will in large measure depend on its autonomy and availability of resources. Furthermore it should have a suitable location that will enable it to act with the necessary flexibility in co-operation with national and international institutions. In this respect I am pleased to state that El Salvador supports the wish of the Government of Mexico to be host to this body. The experience of my country in this field has made us more aware of the importance of intensifying international co-operation to seek solutions to the problems of human settlements. Recognizing that the resolutions of the Conference are timely, my Government endorses the report of the Secretary-General on Habitat [A/31/156] and we hope that the Assembly, when considering item 60 of its agenda, will take decisions which will immediately promote international action on this subject.\n113.\tIn the month of August last an event of great importance in world politics came to a successful conclusion. I am referring to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, at Colombo. The presence of 85 high-level delegations from five continents is in itself a fact which reveals the magnitude of the decisions adopted. The Colombo agreements will no doubt affect the international actions of the vast majority if not of all States, individually considered, because of the fact that interdependence is a sign of our times and the parameter in projecting international relations. The degree of cohesion and drive attained by the non-aligned movement is furthermore manifest in its forceful participation in this Assembly. The Government of El Salvador has noted with pleasure that the object of the movement is to obtain adequate formulate by consensus to resolve international situations of conflict. Its motive which contributes to the cause of world peace is praiseworthy.\n114.\tWe have previously stated that no one can reverse the decolonization process. Its final triumphs will be celebrated in a not-too-distant day throughout the world by the elimination of the very last bastions of colonial oppression. In this respect special mention should be made of the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia for their emancipation. Hence my Government supports as an appropriate measure the convening in 1977 of an international conference to mobilize world public opinion in support of these peoples as proposed by the Ad Hoc Group established by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [see A/31/23/Add.l, para. 17(33)]. This conference will be helpful in assisting these peoples, will mobilize world public opinion even more in their favor and will constitute a step forward towards the goal of complete decolonization.\n115.\tMy Government wishes emphatically to reiterate as major foreign policy guidelines its solidarity with the peoples of Africa for independence, for the abolition of racial discrimination and apartheid, and reiterates its rejection of minority racial governments. Although the historical process marks the extinction of racial discrimination it is to be regretted that there are Governments which are obstinately adhering to the opprobrious political system which they themselves have created, apartheid, and choose to oppose in vain the drive of civilization, thus prolonging sufferings and death. The United Nations must persist in its efforts to eradicate these encumbrances which delay the progress of mankind. For these reasons we have only praise for the diplomatic negotiations which are at present being carried out to that end.\n116.\tLast year this General Assembly adopted resolution 3432 (XXX) on the question of Belize. At that time El Salvador deplored the fact that the draft resolution sponsored, among others, by all the Central American States s was not accepted, since that was the document containing a formula for a balanced procedure, properly adapted to the legitimate interests of the parties directly concerned and respecting the rights of the population of Belize. Nevertheless we must look at things as they are at present and with a visionary spirit for the future. We must be fully aware that the territory and population of Belize are in the heart of Central America although looking toward the Caribbean. This particular area, formed by history and geography, instead of being a source of problems, frictions and conflicts, should be the link uniting the historical trends and cultures, making of Belize a centre for harmony and co-operation. We must therefore strive to find within the text of the resolution the basis for genuine negotiations without predetermined replies and acceptable to all the parties.\n117.\tDaily experience proves that resolutions adopted without the concurrence of the will of the countries concerned have no other meaning than counsel given by third parties, and therefore lack any possibility of being applied. This observation, deriving from the realities of the contemporary world, should be a fact to be taken into account in the solution of this problem. Hence, my country as an integral part of Central America, in solidarity with the claims of Guatemala, hopes that the negotiated solution will emerge as proof of the intelligence and goodwill of those who govern the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Guatemala, so that Belize may fulfill the function of an integrating bridge not only in Central America but also between that region and the Caribbean.\n118.\tEl Salvador wishes through me to place on record once again its firm support for the cause of Panama, that is, its obtaining the exercise of complete sovereignty over its main economic geographical resource, the inter-oceanic canal. On the shoulders of the Central American republic weighs the onerous burden of a treaty signed in 1903 which ignored its inalienable rights. I am referring among other things to the inclusion of the perpetuity clause for the administration of the zone in favor of a dominant member, the United States of America. The clock of history is marking the hour when' Panama must be compensated for its injured interests. Indeed the present world has expressed its rejection of colonial enclaves and is therefore in favor of the praiseworthy effort of Panama to satisfy the legitimate claim to eliminate any clause which is counter to sovereignty over its entire territory.\n119.\tWhen the Security Council met in Panama in 1973 it was expected, as a result of the deliberations and broad support received by that country, that within a reasonable time negotiations with the United States Government would lead to the conclusion of an honorable agreement. Nevertheless, a standstill occurred. This year we have observed how a political electoral campaign we are all familiar with has unfavorably affected the negotiating process, causing a delay along the way to agreement. Declarations made have been viewed as a cloud which looms threateningly even over existing good relations in the hemisphere. El Salvador, as a country in solidarity with Panama, still hopes that the fresh winds of good sense will blow in the direction indicated by time and equity, so that shortly the treaty will be reviewed in terms which answer to the just aspirations of the Panamanian people.\n120.\tI now wish to refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the fifth session  ? of which has just concluded in this city. A sixth session is scheduled for 1977 and it is expected that the seventh will be held in 1978. It will probably be the lengthiest conference of the century. Despite the time and efforts it has demanded and the progress achieved on a good number of critical questions the results are still uncertain because nobody knows definitely whether, within the coming years, there will be a generally accepted convention to regulate the use of the sea.\n121.\tIn contrast to previous sessions, each of which was characterized by a tangible product, namely, the text reflecting the main trends, produced at the second session at Caracas,  the single negotiating text of the third session at Geneva  and the revised single negotiating text of the fourth session in New York,  all that was achieved on 17 September last was the setting of the date, venue and duration of the sixth session, that is to say, the minimum indispensable to keep the conference alive.\n122.\tA handful of highly conflicting questions is holding back progress in the Conference. In the Second and Third Committees there are subjects on which it is not possible to agree, but on other questions which were once as controversial as access to and from the sea for the land-locked countries the participants are nearing consensus. The radical conflict on the nature of the economic zone as part of the high seas or as a zone sui generis has much that is highly legalistic and that could be settled by giving ever more consideration to the rules governing use and exploitation, as a result of which the dangers envisaged by the maritime Powers in the establishment of a zone sui generis would disappear. The entire development of the law of the sea in the last years points of necessity in a single direction, namely, towards the economic zone as a third zone between the high seas and the traditional territorial sea with its own legal regime.\n123.\tOther issues are still outstanding and strongly disputed, particularly the outer limits of the continental shelf, the rights of land-locked States in the economic zones of neighboring States and the rules on scientific research in the economic zone. It is nevertheless difficult to imagine that these issues could prevent adoption of the convention on the law of the sea. On the contrary, positions are totally and absolutely polarized as regards the regime for exploration and exploitation of the international zone of the sea-bed which is dealt with by the First Committee. Owing to basic philosophical positions, the confrontation of groups on this subject threatens to disrupt the Conference, even though at the abstract level it is conceivable to reconcile the interests of the countries having technology with those of the countries which advocate inclusion in the convention of the principle of the common heritage of mankind which the General Assembly approved by an overwhelming majority in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)].\n124.\tPositions which might be described, respectively, as single-minded and dualistic conflict as to the regime for the international zone of the sea-bed. The dualistic position, which is commonly identified as the parallel action, subject to objective rules, of a multinational enterprise controlled by the international community and of private companies, was the subject of discussion during the fifth session of the Conference, which produced certain general ideas, advanced to find a way out of the dead-lock through an indication of readiness to endow the multinational enterprise with capital and technology, so that it could operate with the same opportunities as private companies. It would be worth while considering how the scheme for these equal opportunities is conceived, so as to decide with a knowledge of the facts on the acceptability of these proposals. The interesting general proposal would have to be complemented with details so as to be the subject of scrupulous analysis. What should in no case be done is to take an a priori position on the basis of prejudice.\n125.\tWe call on the participants in the Conference to adopt a really constructive attitude in regard to this vital and decisive issue, requesting some to specify more closely the financing operation and how the enterprise would be endowed with technology, and requesting others to with hold judgment and decision until we know the details of the proposal, so that they may put forward their criticisms, compromises or acceptance on that basis. They should abandon totally the attitude of rejecting the whole because some parts are inadequate and rather divide the whole into parts so that each could be subjected to scrutiny, accommodation and redrafting. If a constructive approach to this problem is lacking at the sixth session, the Conference might fail and, to conceal failure, decide on suspension for a few years. It is the keenest wish of my delegation that, to avoid this unwanted result, we strive to make considerable progress at the forthcoming session.\n126.\tLastly, in reiterating the respect of El Salvador for the objective of universality to which our Organization aspires, we express our hope that in the not-too-distant future it will be joined by States which for some reason or another have not been able to be with us during this session.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, while highly appreciating your chairmanship of this meeting, I wish to express, through you, to the President, the congratulations of my Government on his election to the presidency of this \nGeneral Assembly. We recognize in him the skilled and experienced representative of- Asia and a nation that recently acted as the host for the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries in Colombo-one of the major international events preceding this General Assembly. We are confident that under his leadership the General Assembly will discharge its responsibilities in an efficient manner.\n33.\tWe have gathered at this session at a time which is challenging but also promising. It is true that no major war is being waged in the world today. This in itself is of tremendous value. On the other hand, our world is still menaced by serious war-like situations. If not contained, these situations could result in armed conflicts with disastrous international repercussions. Furthermore, injustices inherent in the existing economic and social world order contain the seeds of future conflicts. Therefore, they, too, must be eliminated through conciliation and co-operation. In the view of my Government the basic problem both in the national as well as in the international sphere is how to ensure that necessary changes are reached in a peaceful and orderly manner. Indeed, the demand of today is constructive change. The United Nations provides us with an indispensable tool to meet this challenging problem. It can only be solved with as universal participation as possible of the nations of the increasingly interdependent world. Finland welcomes the Republic of Seychelles as a new Member of the United Nations. It is our hope that the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will also be admitted to the Organization.\n34.\tThe process of decolonization is one of the truly great changes generated by the United Nations. Its final fulfillment is not far ahead. However, the prevailing situation in southern Africa causes us deep concern. The Foreign Ministers of the five Nordic countries at their recent meeting had an extensive discussion on the situation in southern Africa. At the meeting we agreed on a set of guidelines for our policy in these problems. Of course, the whole world is now focusing on this area, where the last remnants of the colonial era still resist the rightful demands of the peoples under oppression. The wind of change in Africa is again blowing strong. The important question to everybody now is whether this change will be achieved peacefully or only through bloodshed and violence.\n35.\tIt is still our sincere, hope that the white minority in Southern Rhodesia will listen to the calls of the African people and the international community so that majority rule can be established in Zimbabwe. The white population in Rhodesia must recognize the inevitable and proceed rapidly towards a negotiated and peaceful solution for an independent Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, all the Members of the United Nations must strictly implement the sanctions adopted by the Security Council.\n36.\tSouth Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia. The international community and especially the United Nations have assumed special responsibility for the achievement of self-determination and independence for Namibia. The South African regime must heed the demands of the Security Council and the General Assembly calling for immediate South African withdrawal and free elections under United Nations supervision and control. The proposals of the so-called constitutional conference in Windhoek in the words of the United Nations Council for Namibia-did not even approach any of the requirements for genuine self-determination and independence laid down by the United Nations. Failure to comply with the decisions of the Security Council would be a serious mistake.\n37.\tIn South Africa itself the system of institutionalized discrimination against the black majority through the policy of apartheid has caused suffering and provoked determined resistance in Soweto and other locations. The Finnish Government must express its strongest disapproval and abhorrence of the violence and brutality shown by the South African authorities. The United Nations must strengthen its policy of sanctions against the Govemn ent of South Africa. As an immediate measure by the international community my Government would welcome a decision by the Security Council on a compulsory arms embargo against South Africa as proposed by the Nordic Foreign Ministers. Finland for its own part has already many years ago banned arms exports to South Africa.\n38.\tThe active participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and of the African countries is in our opinion of decisive importance in the search for just and lasting solutions to the problems in southern Africa. We therefore welcome the recent initiatives that have been taken and hope that they will be pursued and lead to results.\n39.\tThe peace-making process in the Middle East and in Cyprus has come to a standstill notwithstanding strenuous bilateral and multilateral efforts to reach negotiated settlements. It is our sincere hope that the parties in both cases will resume their efforts towards a peaceful solution on the basis of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council. The Finnish Government has followed with great concern and deep sympathy the protracted human suffering in the Middle East and in Cyprus. It is our fervent hope that, while the search for peaceful solutions is going on, all the parties concerned respect and facilitate efforts of humanitarian aid to the suffering civilian population.\n40.\tIn the search for a peaceful solution my Government continues to give its full support to the United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East and in Cyprus. In this context, I cannot but draw the serious attention of the Member States to one important aspect of the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations i.e. their financing. The growing deficit in the budget of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus is causing great concern to my Government, which is contributing troops to the peace force. The troop contributors have too long shouldered a disproportionate share of the expenses involved and face the prospect of increased burdens if contributions from other Governments are not initiated and augmented. Taking into account the joint responsibility of the Members of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, we strongly feel that there is an obligation of all Member States to participate in financing of the peace-keeping activities agreed to by the United Nations. \n41.\tAnother central problem in peace-keeping is the lack of progress in political negotiations, to which I referred earlier. Conditions created by peace-keeping for peacemaking should be fully utilized by the parties. Otherwise these stalemates if continued for too long-can frustrate not only the troop contributors but the whole purpose of peace-keeping. I believe, therefore, that the international community should give high priority to the strengthening of the effectiveness of its mechanisms for peace.\n42.\tAs a representative of Finland, the host country for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, I feel bound to review the development of the situation after the signature of the Final Act of the Conference just more, than a year ago. Some reserves were expressed on the importance of the Final Act and voices of doubt can still be heard, but I think it is fair to say that the over-all assessment is clearly positive.\n43.\tThus the Final Act of Helsinki is a political codification of the rules of inter-State conduct between the participating countries. Certain new forms of political, economic and humanitarian co-operation have emerged. The spirit of the Final Act of Helsinki reflects perfectly and, indeed, conforms to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. This underlines the non-isolating character of the European Conference. As a whole the implementation of the provisions of the document is well on its way, and, in good faith, the Governments have shown a great responsibility in doing this. Political, economic and social co-operation on a regional level can only enhance global detente and dialog, which are the main concern of this world Organization.\n44.\tFinland attaches a great importance to the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Belgrade in June next year and is doing its best to contribute to its success. I am happy to mention in this context the important role of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations in implementing the Final Act and paving the way to the follow-up conference. We hope that the Conference of Belgrade will play its part in promoting international understanding and co-operation on a regional level, which would also extend its benefits to global endeavors.\n45.\tMy Government has long considered disarmament an integral part of detente, and genuine progress in arms control and in disarmament negotiations an essential factor in underpinning the continuing process of relaxation of international tensions. To our mind it would have been reasonable to expect that the impressive gains scored in this respect particularly on the European continent could have been translated into tangible results in the field of disarmament. But to our profound regret this has failed to materialize, at least in the two most crucial sets of negotiations: the SALT negotiations [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] and the Vienna talks. In saying this I must add that my Government is fully aware of the complexity of the issues involved, of the persistent efforts devoted to their solution and of file intrinsic value of these negotiating processes in the context of lessening of tensions.\n46.\tAgainst this background it is more encouraging to note that after a hiatus of four years, the major organ for multilateral disarmament negotiations, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, has succeeded in producing the draft of another multilateral arms control agreement for the consideration of this General Assembly. The draft convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques [AI31/27, annex I], while limited in scope and substance, nevertheless does have the merit of outlawing the use of a potential weapon of mass destruction of incalculable consequences. As such it deserves, in the opinion of the Finnish Government, the endorsement of this General Assembly. Besides its value as an arms limitation measure, it serves the purpose of reviving the momentum of negotiation and agreement, which the international community has grown to expect from its oldest and most experienced multilateral negotiating forum in the field of disarmament.\n47.\tThough my Government will have an opportunity to propound more fully its views on the manifold disarmament items in the course of the disarmament debate in the First Committee, I hope it will not be amiss for me to say a few words from this rostrum to illustrate the effort that the Finnish Government is devoting to this common task of the United Nations. Because of our awareness of the organic union between political detente and disarmament, the Finnish Government has already for some years tried to increase its contribution to disarmament efforts in a practical way both in terms of manpower and money. Obviously our resources remain limited and we have therefore concentrated our efforts on a few selected projects concerning the control of chemical weapons, the study on nuclear-weapon-free zones and the strengthening of nuclear safeguards in the context of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex). The response to our initiatives so far has been most satisfactory, and this cannot but encourage us to continue to pursue the objectives they are designed to achieve.\n48.\tIn the changing and more just world which we are working for, respect for human rights assumes special significance. We are all too painfully aware of the violations of human rights that are continuously brought to our attention. My Government wants to give its full support to the United Nations in its efforts to combat affronts to human dignity. The wide basis for this work has been defined in the Charter and in the International Covenants on Human Rights which have now entered into force. We hope that the Covenants will prove effective in our common fight for human rights and human dignity. This can only happen if they are ratified by the largest possible number of Member States.\n49.\tIt is increasingly evident that we are in the midst of a profound change in the world economy. Our aims have been firmly set in the decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly-a revision and readjustment of the entire economic system which has evolved since industrialization began more than 200 years ago. Although concrete results so far are relatively modest, the United Nations system has nevertheless embarked upon this task with the goal of reaching viable solutions based on negotiation between equals instead of on unilateral decisions.\u2003\n50.\tDuring the next 12 to 18 months the concept of negotiated solutions to major international economic problems will again be put to trial. I am referring primarily to the series of negotiations on commodity questions which is about to begin under the auspices of UNCTAD and to the conference to establish a common fund for buffer-stock financing.\n51.\tFinland gave its support to the integrated program for commodities and to the concept of a common fund at the fourth session of UNCTAD. We look forward to a period when discussions on international economic relations and development at last move from generalities to specifics. Important as the commodity problems are in this context, the question of the debt burden of developing countries is equally in the forefront and deserves urgent attention with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution.\n52.\tThe recent Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo-which my Government was honored to attend as an invited guest was an important step in the ongoing discussions on international co-operation for economic development. Finland has repeatedly expressed its support of the concept of collective self-reliance, which was strongly endorsed in the economic deliberations of the Colombo Conference. Cooperation among developing countries in the economic field deserves the support of the entire international community. My Government tends to view such co-operation as a complementary part of a future world economic order rather than an alternative to a truly global set of solutions based on the principle of interdependence of all nations. We therefore also welcome the readiness shown in Colombo to pursue the negotiations between North and South.\n53.\tMy Government has also observed with interest the negotiations in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris. In spite of the difficulties which the Paris Conference has encountered my Government hopes that the negotiations will regain their momentum and thus contribute to the work carried on within the United Nations system. While it is certainly to the advantage of all States that substantive progress should be reached in the work of that Conference, it is nevertheless obvious that in the final analysis only the United Nations can give the results of the Conference the global validity which they need to be translated into action.\n \nInternational Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)f has served the international community well and the principles contained therein are still valid. In particular, it takes adequate account of the need of balance between social and economic development. In addition to strengthening and elaborating the concept of the new international economic order, the new strategy should reflect important ideas evolved after the adoption of the present Strategy in the series of global socio-economic conferences held or forthcoming during this decade. The results of these conferences should be woven into a single texture which would be an essential part of our approach to the problems of the 1980s. Thereby we would achieve the integrated approach to development problems which Finland has always considered to be of fundamental importance. Only by devoting our attention both to social and economic issues can we achieve our final goal genuine development, social justice and progress based not on confrontation but on co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "In the name of God the merciful and compassionate.\n70.\tMr, President, allow me from the outset of my statement to extend to you, in the name of the delegation of Saudi Arabia, our sincere congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the General Assembly during its thirty-first session. There is no doubt that your election, Mr. President, is indeed an expression of esteem of your person and your attributes of experience, ability and wisdom in both the political and administrative fields. At the same time, your election signifies appreciation of your great country, Sri Lanka, which has always supported the ideals of the United Nations, and was the host State last August to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. This is why we are optimistic that the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will conclude its work with success. I should also like to thank your predecessor, the Prime- Minister of Luxembourg, for having successfully presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n71.\tI am also pleased, Mr. President, to welcome, in the name of my country, the newest Member State, namely, the Republic of Seychelles, to our Organization.\n72.\tThe chairmen of the delegations that preceded me have taken stock of the achievements of the United Nations during the course of last year and I see, in consequence, no reason to reiterate what has been stated in that regard.\n73.\tThe United Nations has reached its thirty-first year; and since its inception and until today, some important achievements have been realized in both the economic and social fields. Moreover, some success has been attained by various specialized agencies. No doubt, any progress achieved by those agencies is considered a success for the United Nations itself, bearing in mind that any success we ourselves achieve depends in the first instance on constructive co-operation amongst Member States.\n74.\tWere we to appraise the past and present of the United Nations, we would find that what I have related as achievements do not fulfill our aspirations either in the economic or the political fields. But this should not lead us to slip into the wilderness of despair, and consequently, be unable to eradicate poverty, sickness and hunger in a world whose masses look up to us to act and to build, and to spread benefits.\n75.\tA review of our modest achievements last year in the economic field, and in the light of the problems placed on our agenda this session, is a cause for disappointment and does not call for optimism in the search for a new and balanced international economic order that may bring equity to all people and help them to enjoy prosperity and stability. No doubt the hopes of the developing countries in this respect depend first and foremost on co-operation between themselves and their sincere desire to improve their conditions and, secondly, on the co-operation of the industrial countries that have the material, technical and scientific means to contribute generously to vital plans in order to build a better world.\n76.\tThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, itself a developing country, bases its economy on Islamic concepts which respect individual ownership and economic freedom within the framework of social patronage and equal opportunity. These Islamic principles are reflected clearly in Saudi Arabia's economic policies in the international field; thus it supports the free enterprise system and refuses exploitation and compulsion in all their forms, and is therefore working diligently for a new international economic order which may bring about more equity and respect for the rights of both the developing and developed countries respectively, within a framework of understanding and cooperation.\n77.\tIt was on these concepts that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, together with its oil-exporting sister States, undertook to struggle against the intentional depression of oil prices. At the same time and in solidarity with the developing countries, Saudi Arabia supported the principle of understanding and negotiation to solve problems and to search for a just equilibrium on which to base the prices of raw materials and industrial goods, as well as the cost of the transfer of technology, in a spirit of constructive negotiations that were manifest during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly in 1974 and 1975. It also endeavored to make sure that a spirit of cooperation existed during the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation between developing and developed countries and at the fourth session of UNCTAD held recently in Nairobi.\n78.\tThe eagerness of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to co-operate in international economic relations motivates it to support economic development in developing countries as part of its Islamic beliefs, for such development will pave the way for establishing a dynamic and balanced relationship between economic development and political stability in the developing countries in particular, and in the world at large in general, because economic development lends political stability, which serves the dual purpose of our Charter, namely, peace and security.\n79.\tThe mutual dynamic relationship between economic development and political stability make it imperative that we work in co-operation, so as to provide political security for developing countries, which is an essential factor for their economic development.\n80.\tThis factor seems unattainable at present in view of the international struggle, although we were full of hope in regard to the declared policy of detente between the super-Powers.\n81.\tThis world of ours, which faces the challenges of backwardness, development and the desire to eradicate the roots of poverty, must enjoy the kind of detente whose effects may be felt by small States in order to protect their political stability and independence, thus indirectly, but more effectively, contributing to economic development on a global level.\n82.\tIn this context, the third-world countries welcomed detente between the super-Powers not only as a means of lessening political tension between those Powers but also as a means for finding appropriate grounds for fruitful co-operation between all countries, big and small alike.\n83.\tWe regret that we were not able to take the opportunity that presented itself for wider co-operation among States in the utilization of the resources of the sea-bed, and that the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held in New York a few weeks ago, did not reach, in this connexion, any international agreement. Hence, we hope that the sixth session, which will convene next spring, will achieve effective and acceptable results.\n84.\tThe Seventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers discussed the question of apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa and the continued abhorrent practice of racism in the Republic of South Africa, Rhodesia, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n85.\tIn conformity with the tenets of Islam and its lofty ideals, which do not discriminate among human beings on the basis of color or any other basis and recognize the equality and the dignity and freedom of the human person, it was only natural that the Islamic Conference should adopt a resolution condemning apartheid, racial discrimination and similar ideologies and practices [see A/311237, annex I, resolution 3/7-P].\n86.\tMy country welcomes the resolutions adopted by the United Nations against those racist regimes that have no regard for human morality and urges Member States to work for the implementation of these resolutions, which will indeed be a victory for mankind and his dignity, and for freedom in those parts of the world as well as everywhere.\n87.\tFor our part, we appreciate the praiseworthy efforts undertaken recently by both the United States and the United Kingdom in this respect; and we wish that these laudable efforts will be crowned with success for the benefit of the African continent.\n88.\tIt is natural that Islamic communities everywhere strive for and believe in equality and love between man and his fellow man, refusing the principles that call for discrimination in all its forms. That is why these communities look forward to obtaining their full rights under conditions of equality, justice, equal opportunity and human values that may allow them to raise their standards of living, to improve their conditions and to adhere to their principles so as to enjoy true human brotherhood.\n89.\tThe United Nations was founded to guarantee the safety of mankind from the scourge of war, and to maintain international peace and security.\n90.\tSince 1947, Israel has striven to destroy this basic principle of the United Nations in the region of the Middle East, which has not known peace or security. Israel was founded in the region of the Middle East through aggression against Palestine and the Palestinian people in the absence of any reaction on the part of world opinion. For 28 years our Organization has been trying to find a solution for the Palestinian problem but to no avail, the reason being that our discussion of the problem has concentrated solely on finding a solution to the Palestinian problem as the problem of refugees rather than one of a people and a country.\n91.\tWhen things became clear, we realized that the shortest way to correct matters is the road that brings justice and restores the rights of the indigenous people of Palestine.\n92.\tThe question is not that of Palestinian refugees; it is rather of the Palestinian people with a land, with property, with rights equal to those of other peoples.\n93.\tOur comprehension of this fact had a positive effect in putting matters on the right track; and consequently the General Assembly in November 1974 adopted resolutions recognized by the international community represented in this august Assembly.\n94.\tThese resolutions recognized the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights to their homeland, their property and their self-determination and have given the right to their legal representatives to represent the Palestinian people in the United Nations and other international organizations.\n95.\tIf we intend to have peace on a permanent basis, such peace must emanate from the region; it could not be permanent if it is not based on justice which recognizes the rights of the Palestinian people.\n96.\tAny peace based on force and aggression and on fait accompli is an imaginary peace that is bound to totter and disappear.\n97.\tThe intransigence of Israel, and its ceaseless efforts to obstruct all peace initiatives in order to gain time for achieving its purposes and design?, can only lead to more tension and to further complications of the question, and may lead to an exacerbation of the already explosive situation in the region.\n98.\tWhat is patently clear is that all the present problems and the crisis besetting the Middle East are in the final analysis a side-effect of the Palestine question. And, here, may I cite the sad events in Lebanon which are a direct result of this question.\n99.\tFurthermore, the wars and political and military conflicts witnessed by the region during the last 28 years and the occupation by Israel of Arab territories in the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai, Golan and other areas, is only the effect of not finding a solution to the original question and putting an end to the Israeli aggression in the region.\n100.\tThe continued Israeli occupation of these territories is an example -if indeed an example is sought-of its expansionist intentions, and its challenge to Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, as well as its total disregard for world public.opinion and international law.\n101.\tIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories is the sine qua non, because occupation runs contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and is the antithesis of peace and security in th? region and in the world.\n102.\tIsraeli withdrawal is imperative as a first step on the road to solving the original question on whose resolution depends the future of peace in the region.\n103.\tWhen Saudi Arabia, together with the majority of the international community, calls for withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, it puts in the forefront the Holy City of Jerusalem and other Islamic Holy Places in Palestine.\n104.\tIt is evMent that the attainment of peace in the Middle East region makes it imperative to find a solution to the main question, nameJy the Palestine question, by recognizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination in their own homeland and on their own soil. This requires more serious and urgent efforts so as to avoid the dangers inherent in procrastination.\n105.\tPerhaps i do not need to stress the fact that any solution to & given problem will not be successful without the participation of the main party to the conflict. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the sole representative of the Palestinian people, should be a party in any negotiations or dialog that may be required to reach an equitable solution which may bring permanent peace to the area. It becomes of no consequence whether the solution is reached in Geneva or elsewhere. The place is of no importance. The. important thing is the time factor, on whose utilization depends the future of peace and tranquility in the region and in the world.\n106.\tIt is, therefore, important that the international community should control the Israeli entity, whose position has been characterized by openly challenging justice, stability, security and peace.\n107.\tHow sad it is that man, who was able to ascend to the moon and who is now in a position to use inter-planetary space vehicles, is unable to exercise sufficient self-control in order to put an end to conflict raging between himself and his fellow man.\n108.\tAnd how gratifying it would be for each one of us to look forward to a world in which freedom reigns, crowned by dignity, supported in a realm of justice and brotherhood full of love and goodwill.\n109.\tWe pray God Almighty to guide us all to the path of righteousness.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in addressing this central United Nations forum as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru, I am pleased to express my Government's satisfaction at your election as President .of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. Your brilliant professional career in a particularly difficult period for multilateral diplomacy, as well as the perseverance and distinction of your actions in favor of the fundamental interests of the third world and of peace, bode well for a fruitful session, during which I offer you the best efforts of the delegation which I lead.\n106.\tAt the same time, I should like to place on record the gratitude of the Government of Peru for the important and clear-sighted actions which have characterized the term of office of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, a period which has seen our Organization reach near universality in its membership and in which serious problems have been faced, problems rooted in a profound alteration of the structure of international relations.\n107.\tLast year, when the United Nations had been in existence for three decades, attempts were made to assess its historical role. We then participated in the expression of a multiplicity of viewpoints and a rich diversity in emphasis as well as in the assertion of criticism. We thus witnessed how, by expressing our aspirations and pointing out the obstacles to them, we could reach a positive conclusion- of cautious optimism about the international role of the United Nations.\n108.\tIn reaffirming Peru's support for this world Organization, I wish on this occasion to add a word of encouragement regarding our sincere concern about the future responsibility of the United Nations, specially in relation to the need for a change in the political will of the nations of the world in the direction of future collective action for peace.\n109.\tToday we have fresh in our minds the struggle of peoples which have won their liberation and unity with their blood. Today when the passing away of one of the great leaders of mankind, Chairman Mao Tsetung, provides us with the serenity and the perspective to draw up a precise balance-sheet of the evolution of the world; today when the vain arrogance of racist regimes is being shaken by the attacks of oppressed peoples and the pressure of the universal conscience, the time has come to ask ourselves with humility and above all with realism whether the time has not come to change an archaic and short-sighted mentality which refuses to perceive not only what is inevitable but also the advantages and benefits of the great historical change of our times.\n110.\tOn this occasion Peru reiterates its most genuine desire to participate loyally in the process of true understanding and co-operation and to maintain, within the necessary framework of the review and reform of the unjust structures which still prevail, the most open and fruitful relations with all the peoples of the earth so as to work together in that common task of ensuring for small as well as large, for poor as well as rich, that freedom and justice which today more clearly than ever are an irreplaceable and urgent requirement in the cause of maintaining peace and security, a cause to which this Organization is essentially and fundamentally committed.\n111.\tIt will avail us nothing at this stage for each side to endeavor to reiterate that: in the economic field we have no wish for confrontation. That confrontation which we do not wish to avow but which holds the industrial, commercial and financial world in suspense and which is at the root of the international economic crisis which we are unable to overcome-constitutes the most tangible proof of the interdependence which the new correlation of economic forces, and hence of political, military and strategic power, has brought to light in its full dramatic dimensions. We live in a world so interdependent that the mere rumor of the rise in the price of a single commodity is capable of shaking the foundations of the great industrial Powers, which in turn anticipate the possible repercussions of other adjustments in different sectors of the production of strategic natural resources.\n112.\tIn the process of seeking genuine world understanding which we advocate, we commit our most sincere and positive efforts without reservation, as befits the independent, tranquil and constructive nature of our revolution, which is nationalist, humanist and inspired by the principles of Christianity, respectful of liberty and human rights, committed only to the supreme and abiding interests of its people and to solidarity with other peoples which struggle for the same ideals; ours is a revolution which is not identified with any imported model and which stubbornly defends its conceptual autonomy and its ideological independence; it is a revolution, finally, which on the international level expresses itself through a foreign policy proudly independent and sovereign, deeply Latin American, third-world, non-aligned and avowedly universal.\n113.\tIt appears impossible to calculate the true importance of the contours defining the international context of the past few years. But it is symptomatic that the resulting configuration coincides, in its evolution and nature, with the essence of the work of this forum, with the political function of the United Nations. It shows the appropriateness of shaping this world institution for the future and not the strength of the great Powers, or to foreign policy as a game of influence or a means of coercion.\n114.\tIn line with that reasoning it Is relevant to sketch out certain central aspects of tile agreements of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries at Colombo, so brilliantly presided over by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Bandaranaike, who has today so clearly explained the agreements arrived at which confirm the common views on the present nature of international relations. The precise reaffirmation of the fundamental principles of non-alignment, through an independent foreign policy, which is the dynamic essence of the movement, means that it is on the basis of free determination, independence and peaceful coexistence principles originally put forward by a small but important group of Latin American, Asian and African countries that the catalytic nucleus of developing countries in the recent phase of international relations is being built today.\n115.\tI do not believe that I err in underscoring that the Colombo Conference will project above all a legitimate vocation for horizontal co-operation, a profound trend towards collective self-sufficiency, no longer of the members of the non-aligned group alone, but of the third world in its entirety. This paramount task of our countries will play a preponderant role in the future structuring of international relations.\n116.\tAgainst that background there are three concrete concepts that could be included within the framework of our debates at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The first concept refers to the pressing task of making universal the process of detente set into motion by the super-Powers. But if detente were extended to the third world without first eliminating residual conflicts, that not only would be unrealistic but also could become a cause for growing competition and general risk, instead of a prelude to peace.\n117.\tNeedless to say, the elimination of the sources of tension to which I am referring is not a simple matter. Essentially it involves a historical cycle of adjustment and readjustment of the structure of international relations which are complicated by a state of dependence that is more acute than ever today and subordinates the economic aspirations of the countries of the third world to the so-called priority demands of the established global order. The political essence of the North-South economic confrontation, the polarization of the opposing interests of the developed and under-developed world in respect of the resources of the earth, their distribution and control, condition any final settlement and constitute the second concept to which I have referred.\n118.\tThe third task of this Assembly would thus be the positive projection of the aforementioned definitions- that is to say, the reformulation of the process of detente at the global level and the new political framework of the North-South economic confrontation.\n119.\tThe provisional or preventive character of solutions recently applied to critical questions in international relations is a total departure from the type of approach which we are suggesting and which is rooted in the imperative need to bring into effect a world order based on the complementary nature of the process of effective democratization of international relations and the new international economic order.\n120.\tThe absence of the third world from effective decision-making has produced partial, incomplete emergency measures, particularly in the painful conflicts in the Middle East, Cyprus and South Africa: In each of these cases the absent factor is precisely the indispensable element for a complete solution. I am referring to the lack of consultation of the wishes of oppressed nations.\n121.\tI believe that it is difficult to harmonize the wills of the developed world and the emerging world in terms of the reformulation of the future political context unless the will to dominate that has been manifest in the political and economic relations between nations for centuries is set aside in advance. A policy which allows institutions so repudiated as apartheid, which attempts to disguise the crudest racism beneath a paternalism which is as repressive as it is counter-productive, can only be the fruit of a distorted view of human values, which we, too, repudiate. It is on the basis of that judgment that our support for the liberation of southern Africa and our constant and definitive rejection of racist practices is derived.\n122.\tMy country supports the efforts recently made in the search for a peaceful solution in southern Africa, efforts in which, under the auspices of great African statesmen -who feel in their flesh and blood that there is an imperative need to find a solution to this tragic situation-we are pleased to note that distinguished European personalities and the United States Secretary of State personally are participating. Like everyone present here, we hope that these efforts will soon prove fruitful. I must add that in our view no solution can be definitive unless it takes into account the rights of oppressed majorities -that is to say, unless it contributes to the attainment of the legitimate aspirations of African peoples, aspirations which Peru has the honor to defend.\n123.\tThe Economic Declaration of the Colombo Conference [A/31/197, annex II] sets forth a program for mutual co-operation which represents a step forward in the efforts to enabling developing countries to attain well- being.\n124.\tThe recovery of basic resources, the just pricing of those resources, and the constant and level-headed defense of our economic activity require co-operation among developing countries, not only in respect of raw materials but also in order to lay the groundwork for their just participation in the monetary and financial design of the future world economic system.\n125.\tThe shift in the balance-of-payments problem of the bulk of the third world, the alarming indebtedness, unemployment and recession in our economies are now added to the grave problems facing many independent regimes in the under-developed world. While that is occurring, we have witnessed the truncated dialog that took place at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi, as well as the impasse which arose as the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris.\n\n126.\tIn a word, we realize that, side by side with an experiment in horizontal co-operation, ambitious in its dimensions, an economic crisis of enormous and unforeseeable effects persists, one against which there is no wish to apply structural solutions capable of mobilizing the vast resources of our peoples.\n127.\tAgainst this background, at its test session the Third United Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea has achieved little that was fruitful in tangible terms. In part this can be attributed to the fact that it was convened prematurely, when political circumstances were hardly propitious for negotiations. The problems facing the Conference are very difficult, especially as regards the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction, an area which happens to provide an opportunity for the concrete application of the principles of the new international economic order. For this purpose, however, it is indispensable that the developed countries approach the question of the sea in that context so that we can progress and reach an agreement at an early date.\n128.\tIn putting forward general guidelines for international action emanating from a conception based on honesty and equity of treatment, I must confess that precisely for this reason the Government of my country finds it difficult to understand recent interpretations by various sectors which distort the essence of our political process and therefore jeopardize the exercise of responsible international opinion. I say this because I find these simplistic interpretations of Peruvian reality particularly inexplicable at the very time when my Government is setting out to implement a policy which lays down the pragmatic character of its actions on the basis of continuous consultation and dialog, consultation which only at the national level can give us a true measure of the actions we are taking. I say \\\"at the national level\\\" because, the measures we adopt being Peruvian measures for a strictly Peruvian problem, certain distorted interpretations in the international arena can hardly be helpful.\n129.\tI believe it is the unwavering duty of the Government of Peru to analyze and evaluate the trajectory and methodology which has been applied for eight years in an atmosphere of peace and profound human tolerance and has been aimed at achieving revolutionary objectives which remain unalterable.\n130.\tIf that analysis and evaluation, which are the clearest expressions of the humanist meaning of our revolution, are interpreted otherwise, they will be of little help for the pragmatism we seek at this phase of the Peruvian revolution coinciding with the development needs of our country in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.\n131.\tI am convinced that world public opinion will find it possible to grant my country, which is imbued with a deep sense of responsibility and solidarity, an objective appraisal and more just treatment, particularly when, as is now the case in other countries, we are suffering a grave economic crisis the overcoming of which requires serious internal sacrifices and the broadest possible international co-operation.\n132.\tLatin America has not only contributed to the strengthening of self-determination and non-intervention as basic principles of international relations; when it faced obstacles to the consolidation of its republican personality, it confronted incessant threats from the centers of power to the juridical rationale of its incipient nationalism. Through this long experience of national struggle and affirmation Latin American countries have been able to combine their varied internal and diplomatic resources. They have made key changes in internal power relationships. They have produced models for development of different types and have assumed a cultural mix which identifies us with our particular nature within the context of the third world.\n133.\tIn this long process of national formation in Latin America we see a liberating dynamism which is presented with the very first moments of national identity. It started three years ago, and at that time a dynamic current of social reform was unleashed, a current which has already achieved marked influence. I have in mind the gradual control and management of natural resources, the systematic defense of sovereignty over those resources, the preparation and adjustment of our different development processes to a preferential concern for social justice.\n134.\tExternally, the Latin American republics have impressed a creative sense upon the process of their national formation. We have promoted this since the very beginning of our republican era 150 years ago. We have laid the foundations for a single nationality through the ideals of liberty and unity which inspired our liberators.\n135.\tThis very year we are celebrating the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama, an early diplomatic event sponsored by Peru in which the vocation of Latin America for unity was manifested, and we established a precedent for a world conclave. It seems just and timely, therefore, that Latin America and the brother countries of the third world should turn their eyes to Panama and offer it their solidarity and support in its efforts to gain sovereign control of the Canal Zone, an anachronistic vestige and an obstacle to an understanding between the collective personality of Latin America and of North America.\n136.\tIn the present circumstances Peru thought it essential to stress its efforts to meet the desire for unity in Latin America and institutional models through which those purposes can best and more concretely be fulfilled.\n137.\tThe fulfillment of both conditions has so far made possible the vitality and vigor of the Andean Group and, in a wider context, the promising establishment of the Latin American Economic System, to which, as in the case of the Congress of Panama 150 years ago, Peru gave its full support, as it would in regard to all effective efforts at integration in Latin America.\n138.\tNevertheless, the mere existence of these institutional arrangements does not in itself guarantee fulfillment of the aims which constitute their raison d'etre, as the destiny of the regional organizations will ultimately depend upon the unshakable will of their Governments and their commitment to one of the earliest ideals of Latin America integration.\n\n139.\tIn the case of Peru, the historical commitment to the cause of integration, from its closest and most intimate sphere, the Andean context, determines an obligation, to enrich it permanently through joint action with our neighbors, who share the Bolivarisn ideal of integration and the depth and wealth of aims on which the Cartagena Agreement  was founded.\n140.\tLatin America's historical participation in international affairs has led it to make a particularly constant contribution to the treatment of key United Nations issues. I am referring to, among others, the economic issues, the regime of the oceans and the disarmament and denuclearization formula, tasks within which Latin American thinking has played and continues to play a major role.\n141.\tThe notion of dependency as a conditioning factor of under-development leads us to a widely operative language in international economic forums and constitutes the very same structural link which Latin American countries have been defining in explaining the present economic crisis. Secondly, the legal system of three Latin American countries on the Pacific defending their sovereignty over the sea up to a 200-mile limit has become a substantial element of any solution to the problem of the law of the sea. Lastly, from the denuclearization of Latin America, established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco,  to the proliferation of zones of peace, Latin America is one in steadfast safeguard and defense against the nuclear threat of the Powers.\n142.\tThe international commitment of the Revolutionary Government of Peru is, in the present phase, identified with the renovating, profoundly Latin American conception of the international status quo. The independent foreign policy of Peru, which has earned it notable solidarity and support, is based on a deep respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of peoples, as well as on the conviction that, parallel with the development of our own nationalities a personality is shaping itself of which all the many Latin American nations partake. That awareness of, and hope for, our common historical destiny arises from our own experience, at times frustrating but always rich, that leads us to favor unity, intercommunication and world peace, to which Peru has lent, and will continue to lend, its unwavering support within the framework of its solidarity with the third world in the constant quest for a better, more just future.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany is pleased that this thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations meets under the chairmanship of a man who belongs to one of the leading nations of the group of non-aligned countries. He has acquired the highest personal respect among our nations both in his capacity as spokesman of his country at the United Nations and as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, one of the most important conferences of our time.\n60.\tI combine my congratulations for the new President with my thanks to the outgoing President, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Thorn, who gave exemplary and balanced guidance to the work of our Assembly and whose country and personality symbolize the best traditions of a Europe that stands for peace and justice.\n61.\tI am furthermore pleased to welcome the Republic of Seychelles to our midst. With the admission of this one hundred and forty-fifth Member, the United Nations has taken a further step towards universality.\n62.\tThis General Assembly of the United Nations, like the previous one, must continue to promote the idea of co-operation between all States of the world. Co-operation means combining all our efforts in the search for peaceful solutions to the problems that make it so difficult for the peoples of this globe to live peacefully together. Let us not forget that at the end of this century the world will have twice as many people to feed and twice as many jobs to find.\n63.\tIn the year that has passed since the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, it has been possible to lead the world economy out of the deepest recession since 1930, but the world is still far away from lasting, stable growth and continuing acceleration. In the past year international peace has been maintained, but the conflicts in the Middle East, in Cyprus and elsewhere continue to smolder, and in southern Africa the task is to avoid a racial war. At the same time, new forms of illegal force, such as the seizing of hostages, have been developing into a world-wide plague. Whereas old conflicts basically remain unresolved and new ones are already pushing their way to the surface, the potential of destructive weapons in all parts of the world is growing and so is the capability of manufacturing nuclear weapons.\n64.\tThe year 1975 brought no progress towards accomplishing so urgent a task as reducing military expenditure. On the contrary, we are faced with the threat of another build-up in the arms race.\n65.\tThis year the International Covenants on Human Rights entered into force, but in many parts of the world the individual is still denied the most elementary human rights: his right to life and to personal safety, his right to equality without regard to race, his right to move freely, his right to free expression, and his basic economic and social rights.\n66.\tIn a world threatened in this way it is our duty to create durable foundations for peace and co-operation. The one needs the other: we cannot achieve peace without the will to co-operate beyond frontiers, and co-operation will remain ineffectual without peace. Thus the future of this planet really does depend on whether we achieve a break-through to that co-operation.\n67.\tAwareness of this began to dawn following the crises of recent years, and this gives us good reason to be hopeful. It is significant that the Conference of non-aligned States in Colombo and, similarly, the Conference of the Group of 77 in Mexico  have so unequivocally supplemented the principle of national sovereignty and independence by the principle of international co-operation \\\"as the basis of a secure world order\\\". My Government has made this view the guideline for its action in international relations.\n68.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany will therefore continue at this session, as at previous ones, to pursue a policy aimed at safeguarding peace and securing international co-operation. The foundations and objectives of our policy remain unchanged: European union; our firmly rooted position within the Atlantic Alliance, which ensures the balance of power and is thus the prerequisite for peace in Europe; the policy of detente towards the States of Eastern Europe, and partnership and an equitable reconciliation of interests with the third world.\n69.\tThe members of the European Community have made encouraging progress towards creating stable structures for co-operation in a spirit of solidarity. For centuries the history of Western Europe was a series of wars. Even in this century it has been the source of two world wars. Today, however, the people in the European Community see their future as a common future-so thoroughly has the situation changed within the span of a single generation. Outside Europe this may not seem an earth-shaking event, but all, I am sure, should be able to judge from it what can be achieved through goodwill in relations between peoples.\n70.\tThe members of the Community have set themselves the task of together putting into practice the great historic concept of freedom and human dignity. We adhere to the aim of European union. Yet the Community is not inward-looking. It is not a closed community whose responsibility stops at its own front door. It actively supports efforts towards peace and justice and towards a world economy that is open for trade and investment. It is the biggest trading partner in the world. And it is, in particular, a partner of the third world: as the most important source of investment capital and technology, as the most important trading partner, and as a pioneer in the creation of equal, balanced relations between industrialized and developing countries.\n71.\tThe previous speaker, the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, who spoke on behalf of the nine member States of the European Community, has been able to show how far our common aims extend in foreign policy as well.\n72.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the North Atlantic Alliance. It understands that alliance and its role in it as a contribution to the safeguarding of peace in our region. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] is a pact for peace, and it is in line with that understanding of its role that it renders an active contribution of its own to detente. This alliance testifies to the close and manifold ties existing between Western Europe, the United States and Canada.\n73.\tOn the basis of the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance, a policy of realistic detente towards the East became possible for Western Europe, That policy starts from the following consideration: if we cannot remove the ideological division and the basic differences between political and social systems in Europe, then it is all the more urgent to resolve conflicts by negotiation or at least to mitigate them and to discover areas where co-operation between East and West is possible, to the mutual advantage of both and for the benefit of the peoples of both sides.\n74.\tThe policy pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany in concluding treaties with the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic, Czechoslovakia and the other members of the Warsaw Pact serves this very aim. We attach special importance to the further development of the relationship between the two German States on the basis of treaty arrangements. The policy of detente pursued by the Federal Government is a long-term policy and it consistently continues the policy initiated by Willy Brandt and Walter Scheel.\n75.\tThe nations of Europe, the United States and Canada held the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. They laid down principles for peaceful relations and agreed on a whole series of specific arrangements. Among other tilings, these arrangements are intended to foster economic and scientific co-operation, regulate humanitarian questions and facilitate contacts between people in East and West and the exchange of ideas and information; in the military field, they are intended to build up confidence.\n76.\tAll those arrangements must now be put into practice. The more co-operation across the ideological barrier becomes possible and the less energy is wasted in sterile confrontation, the more will the nations of Europe be able to contribute to an equitable reconciliation of interests between the industrialized countries and countries of the third world.\n77.\tThis year, too, we have resolutely pursued our treaty policy. The agreements concluded with the Polish People's Republic have removed burdens of the past and opened up hopeful prospects for relations between the two countries. The relaxation of tension in Europe brought about since 1970 would not have been possible without an improvement of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR. Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union will also in future be of particular importance for the process of detente. For this reason, great significance attaches to the visit of Mr. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the Federal Republic of Germany which is planned to take place in the course of this year.\n78.\tNo nation can be more interested in co-operation across the frontiers of different systems than the German people which is compelled to live in two States. Through Germany runs the frontier which divides Europe. Our negotiations with the German Democratic Republic have also been, and will continue to be, concerned with easing conditions for the people and with further developing co-operation. To pursue a policy of detente in a divided country and for a divided country is a great and, at the same time, a difficult task; but we Germans know that there is no acceptable alternative.\n79.\tA great deal has been made possible by negotiations between the two German States; much has been achieved in the way of practical improvements; it has been possible to alleviate human suffering; human contacts between Germans have become increasingly possible. But all objectives have not been attained-far from it. As before, the aim of our policy is to overcome the painful consequences of the division of Germany by patient negotiation.\n80.\tThe Federal Government is not resigned to the reality of a frontier where only recently shots were still fired from the other side. This must at last be stopped. The Federal Government will not tire in its efforts to achieve this too by means of its policy of detente.\n81.\tIn the heart of Germany also lies the city which for better or worse, has been a touchstone of detente- Berlin The Federal Government will not relax its efforts to promote the viability of West Berlin. For Berlin, the strict observance and full application of the Quadripartite Agreement of 3 September 1971 is of essential importance. The Federal Government will, as before, ensure that West Berlin continues to be included in international co-operation. The more we succeed in this the less will be the danger of the city's again becoming a source of international crises.\n82.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany, whose foreign policy has been a policy of and for peace from the very first day of its existence, will unflinchingly continue its policy of detente and thus contribute to the safeguarding of peace. It remains its political objective to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination. For us, history has not yet passed its final verdict on the division of the German nation.\n83.\tIt will be of decisive importance for the progress of detente whether the current negotiations on the second SALT agreement and on the balanced reduction of ground forces in central Europe prove successful. For nothing could constitute a greater threat to detente than another arms race.\n84.\tThe Federal Government will make special efforts in talks with the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries concerned, to get the stagnant expert discussions on mutual and balanced force reduction in Vienna going again. This was announced by Chancellor Schmidt last week.\n85.\tPeace itself and efforts to safeguard it by means of more stable structures are jeopardized by unrelenting efforts in nearly all parts of the world to build up arms strengths. Exports of conventional weapons in particular have increased rapidly.\n86.\tThe monstrous waste of scarce resources in the industrialized countries as in the developing countries works to the detriment of the people.\n87.\tWe must not give up hope because of the disappointing results in the field of arms control and disarmament so far. In the process of detente efforts must be redoubled to halt the arms race and, both world-wide and regionally, to translate into reality effective measures of arms control and arms limitation.\n88.\tBalanced and controlled disarmament remains one of the most urgent tasks. But it is high time words were followed by deeds. The world needs plough and workbench more urgently than rifle and missile.\n89.\tIn Europe, within the framework of the negotiations in Vienna, the Federal Government will continue to seek the establishment of an equal and hence stable relationship of power in central Europe.\n90.\tThe Federal Government welcomes the request made by the non-aligned States in Colombo calling for a special session of the General Assembly to deal with questions of world-wide disarmament [see A/31/197, annex IV, resolution 12] and is ready to play a constructive part in it.\n91.\tBut we still live in a heavily armed world. All the more urgent, therefore, is the one principal task of international politics: to ward off dangers for peace in time, and that means resolving conflicts without war.\n92.\tConsequently, we look with anxiety towards a region whose unresolved problems are a constant threat to world peace: the Middle East. The guidelines for a solution to the Middle East conflict were mapped out long ago. They are based on resolutions of the Security Council, complemented by a large consensus of international opinion that the national rights of the Palestinian people must also be taken into consideration. Thus, at the 1974 session of the General Assembly,  the Federal Republic of Germany stated that a peace settlement, apart from providing for the termination of the territorial occupation, should make allowance for the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish a State authority, and for Israel's right to live within secure and recognized boundaries.\n93.\tIt is not a question of keeping on repeating the principles governing a solution; it is a question of putting them into practice. The Federal Republic of Germany, together with its partners in the European Community, has a vital interest in a peaceful solution to the conflict in its neighboring region to the south, and today it is more than ever convinced that a solution is possible.\n94.\tOur special interest in this region also finds expression in the Euro-Arab dialog. No one can today speak of the Middle East problem without including the tragic developments in the Lebanon. Efforts have been of no avail to stop hostilities that have taken a heavy toll of human life and are destroying a country in which the seed of violence has sprung up. We appeal to all concerned to stop the terrible bloodshed.\n95.\tA second source of danger for international relations has developed in southern Africa. It is impossible to imagine the consequences which a racial war embracing the whole region would have. All countries in that region are aware of this. The Federal Republic of Germany has, therefore, not abandoned hope of a peaceful solution being achieved.\n96.\tBut it knows that only where no one attempts to hold up a historically necessary change can we expect peaceful developments, can we feel that peace is secure.\n97.\tEveryone must realize, also in southern Africa, that racism and colonialism no longer have a place in this world. The sands have run out.\n98.\tSouthern Africa, too, must determine its own destiny. There is only one way to attain this: blacks and whites must develop some form of co-operation based on equality, which will prove a sound foundation also in the future;\nthere must be majority rule, but at the same time safeguards must be provided for the rights of the minority.\n99.\tIn Rhodesia, as we hope, the first and decisive step in this direction has now been taken. This could well be the beginning of an era of people of all races in southern Africa living peacefully together.\n100.\tRecent developments confirm in an impressive manner the correctness of the position we have always taken: that only the renunciation of force prevents the catastrophe of a racial war which would otherwise be unavoidable. The urgently required changes in southern Africa can be brought about only by peaceful means and by negotiation. A turn of events is foreshadowed for which all concerned deserve thanks and appreciation the Secretary of State of the United States, the British Government, and those African statesmen who are working with perseverance for a peaceful solution of this pressing problem.\n101.\tAs regards the Namibia problem, we reaffirm the demands: that the rule of South Africa should end and the earliest possible date for independence be fixed in a binding manner; that the competence of the United Nations to lead the former Mandated Territory to independence should be recognized; and that in exercising the right of self-determination under the supervision of the United Nations all political groups in the country should participate in the preparations for independence.\n102.\tOnly the speedy fulfillment of all these demands will prevent any further aggravation of the situation. The Federal Government will assist a free Namibia as far as possible in building up its economy.\n103.\tWe appeal to the Government of the Republic of South Africa to give up the policy of apartheid and not to oppose necessary reforms any longer. Only those who are prepared to carry out the necessary changes can preserve the heritage of the past.\n104.\tWe support the appeal of President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia to the white population in southern Africa to join with the other parts of Africa in creating a new society which is not based on color. Only then will it be possible for a new society of black and white Africans with equal rights to master together the great task of developing the continent.\n105.\tThe efforts made by the community of nations to control the use of force must now also include the new illegal forms of force which in recent years have come to be a problem assuming more and more menacing proportions.\n106.\tThe most widespread of these new forms of violence, and one of the most murderous, is the taking of hostages. The growing number of acts involving the taking of hostages has spotlighted the extent of the threat, None of the 500 million passengers traveling on airliners every year can be sure not to be among the next victims.\n107.\tActs involving the taking of hostages are not the problem of just one State or another or of any group of States; they are a problem concerning us all. The United Nations bears a special responsibility. The Secretary-\nGeneral in his annual report on the work of the Organization rightly pointed that out [see A/31 (1 (Add. 1, sect. VI}.\n108.\tWhat is at stake is the protection of human beings, the sovereignty of States, the safety of international traffic and an international order free from violence. The taking of hostages is a particularly cruel act of violence which indiscriminately claims or threatens the lives of helpless people, of women and children. For this reason, the Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibits this act as a means of warfare.\n109.\tIt is an act offending the dignity, safety and fundamental rights of the individual person, that is, basic values the protection of which is proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex].\n110.\tThose taking hostages attempt to blackmail sovereign States and to confront them with the unbearable choice of either yielding to their demands or risking the lives of the hostages taken. Acts involving the taking of hostages are a threat to international relations. The efforts made by all States to settle international conflicts peacefully and also the endeavors of this world Organization to make peace more secure are placed in jeopardy by criminal acts of violence committed by a few.\n111.\tInternational conferences and diplomatic exchanges are thus threatened. In exploiting the particular vulnerability of aeroplanes, the taking of hostages above all imperils international air traffic,\n112.\tOur peoples expect the United Nations to exhaust all possibilities of checking this method of using brute force. We must face up to this danger which affects us all and initiate an objective discussion on possible steps. After the bitter experiences of recent months, the Governments of all countries should unite in condemning the act of taking hostages as a particularly abhorrent crime and in introducing world-wide measures against it.\n113.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany deems it necessary that the United Nations should draft a convention banning the taking of hostages internationally and making sure that the perpetrators are either extradited or brought before a court in the country in which they have been seized. We are convinced that it should be possible soon to arrive at such a convention within the framework of the United Nations. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will therefore request that an item on international action against the taking of hostages be included in the agenda of this General Assembly as an important and urgent matter.\n114.\tGeneral acceptance of and respect for human rights is an inalienable element of any order of peace and worldwide co-operation.\n115.\tThis is one of the noblest aims of the United Nations. The concept of human rights has played a decisive role in the emergence of the United Nations. The year 1976 is a historic year for human rights and for the United Nations. It is the year in which the international covenants on human rights-the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights- have entered into force. Both Covenants guide our action. The Federal Republic of Germany orients its policy towards the developing countries in keeping with demands embodied in the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n116.\tWe advocate in the strongest possible terms respect for basic human rights not only in Germany but all over the world. Our policy serves the individual human being; only the realization of his rights and his dignity lends ultimate meaning and purpose to all our efforts to ensure political and economic co-operation. And this includes the right of all men to live under conditions which are really consistent with human dignity.\n117.\tThe year 1976, with its important events in the field of human rights, now confronts us with the task of translating into reality the principles of law which we have worked out. In this new phase too the United Nations must remain the champion of human rights. An institution should therefore be established which should ensure comprehensive and world-wide protection of human rights. What we need is an independent, international authority making objective judgments in order to ensure that human rights are safeguarded in all parts of the world. Such an authority would not be directed against anybody; it would be there for somebody, namely, the individual human being and his rights.\n118.\tThe phase of codifying human rights was long and difficult; it lasted 30 years. The implementing phase will perhaps be even more difficult, but this should not lead us to believe that we can take that much time again.\n119.\tMuch patient negotiating will be necessary. Our aim must be to guarantee the application of human rights throughout the world by means of an institution which would prevent the question of human rights from being abused for political purposes.\n120.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is aware that this is a difficult task. But it is convinced that the aim of establishing an international court for human rights can be attained. Its belief is strengthened by its experience with the protective system of the European Convention on Human Rights,  which has proved its value for more than two decades and which will not lose anything of its importance should the United Nations establish an institution along its lines.\n121.\tI have already pointed out that it is also the application of human rights that makes it incumbent on us to reduce the economic gap between the rich and poor countries. The difference in prosperity between North and South is a threat to peace and stability throughout the world. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany notes with great satisfaction that the will for co-operation which is the prerequisite to any effective action in this field has grown in all parts of the world and is today actually unchallenged.\n122.\tThe seventh special session of the General Assembly last year, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris, the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi and also the Conference of the non-aligned States in Colombo have confirmed this principle.\n123.\tIt is a positive sign that such complicated problems as those of raw materials and energy and the reorganization of the law of the sea are negotiated at international conferences. But now it is essential to achieve rapid and concrete results. Solemn declarations of intent are not enough to feed the people in the poorest countries. A hard year lies behind us. In 1975, the year of the nadir of recession, the national products of the free-market industrialized countries fell and, although the developing countries' national products continued to rise, their growth rate declined and, in many developing countries, dropped below the growth rate of the population.\n124.\tThe gap between industrialized and developing countries decreased for the first time, but it decreased because the world as a whole became poorer. The world all of a sudden became aware of the magnitude of the threat. We had to realize that development as such can be accelerated only within an international economy which, as a whole, is expanding. It was this experience that increased the awareness of the need for co-operation and made 1975 the year of a common departure.\n125.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany realizes without any illusions that up to now we have come only a short way together, but even along this short distance we certainly have scored results.\n126.\tFirst, in 1975 there was a sharp rise in the flow of capital into the developing countries. The countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development increased their official and private capital transfers to the unprecedented amount of $39 billion, which is an increase of 40 per cent. This means that for the first time ever the target of the capital transfer amounting to 1 per cent of gross national product was reached. The Federal Republic of Germany exceeded that target by having attained 1.18 per cent. At the same time, there was an increase in the capital influx from the States, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC].\n127.\tSecondly, progress was made in the efforts to stabilize the developing countries' export earnings. The International Monetary Fund considerably widened the possibilities of taking up compensatory credits in the event of a decline in export earnings. The European Community in the Lom\u00e9 Convention set up the world's first stabilizing system for commodity exports from developing countries.\n128.\tThird, progress was also made in the opening of markets to third-world exports. The multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva have made this objective a focal subject for talks. This year, too, the European Community plans to increase essentially the possibilities for tariff-free imports of industrial goods from developing countries. In 1975 the Federal Republic of Germany increased its imports of manufactures from developing countries by one quarter and that in a year of heavy recession.\n129.\tFourth, and finally, to promote the development of agriculture in the third world it was decided to set up a fund which will make available considerable funds to increase agricultural production.\n130.\tTo speed up the development of the third world is the common task of all countries. It requires that the developing countries themselves concentrate their strength and efforts on the development goal. It also requires that they assist one another. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore appreciates it that the Colombo Conference strongly emphasized the idea of collective self-help.\n131.\tAlready now the oil-producing countries substantially contribute to the transfer of resources to developing countries in want of capital. At the latest conference of OPEC they also showed their readiness to share in the responsibility for the world economy as a whole.\n132.\tBut the largest external contribution to development undoubtedly has to come from the industrialized countries. In the past, the free-market industrialized countries have already been a motor of third-world development. The power of that motor must grow even stronger. The integration of the countries with a centrally-controlled economy into the world economic system -an integration which has begun in recent years -now opens up the possibility that those countries, too, will finally become a motor of development. That possibility should, however, be pursued. Trade between free-market industrialized countries and centrally-planned industrialized countries has almost quadrupled during the past four years. It is necessary now to increase trade between centrally-planned industrialized countries and developing countries with similar speed.\n133.\tThe potential is enormous. Whereas free-market industrialized countries absorb three quarters of the developing countries' exports, the share of the centrally-planned industrialized countries in these exports is no more than 4 per cent.\n134.\tWhen we look ahead, the question is, What can we and what must we do together now in order to promote the equitable reconciliation of interests between industrialized and developing countries?\n135.\tFirst, in the four commissions of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation-on energy, commodities, finance and development - we must quickly find concrete solutions to the problems defined in the initial phase of the Conference.\n136.\tSecond, at the meetings and conferences on commodity problems decided on by the fourth session of UNCTAD we must achieve rapid and appropriate results.\n137.\tThird, we would like to see all industrialized countries, whatever their economic system, make greater efforts with regard to the transfer of capital and technology to developing countries. The developing countries, for their part, should create the prerequisites for these efforts to be successful.\n138.\tFourth, we regard the intensified industrialization of the developing countries as an urgent requirement. We therefore participate in all efforts contributing to that goal and are prepared to open our markets still further. We are aware of the adjustment problems entailed for our own economy and shall be prepared for this.\n139.\tFifth, the solution of the problem of indebtedness becomes an ever-more pressing requirement. Like other countries, the Federal Republic of Germany gives the solution of that problem priority attention. In the spirit which has imbued the Federal Republic of Germany in rendering its financial assistance and in continuing to render such assistance, it will, together with other donor countries, use its full energies to help solve the problem of indebtedness. We do this because we have full confidence in the future of the developing countries and their peoples.\n140.\tThe success of our endeavors to build a co-operative world will be decisively influenced by the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, We have declared the sea the common heritage of mankind. It is now essential to translate this principle into reality, and that means establishing a legal system governing the seas which will take into account the interests of all States in a well-balanced manner. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will actively participate in the work on these problems because it is convinced that the problems of die developing countries are the problems of the industrialized countries as well. That is a new piece of knowledge which all of our citizens do not yet find it easy to accept. In our countries many people still have to learn that their own destiny is connected with that of all others.\n141.\tIn all industrialized countries a great deal of information and education is still necessary to make it understood that the North-South dialog is concerned not with the giving and taking of alms, but with our common future.\n142.\tThe Secretary-General in the introduction to his report to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization correctly defined the role of the United Nations when he characterized our time as a period of transition in which we must overcome the antagonism between the principle of national sovereignty and the regulatory principles governing an interdependent world. Only co-operation can help us steer this development in such a way that it will benefit mankind as a whole,\n143.\tIn this co-operation a central role falls to the United Nations as the only world-embracing organization, a role which no one else and nothing else can play. According to the mandate of the Charter, our Organization is to be the center in which the nations of the world will harmonize their actions to attain the common objectives of peace and progress. Let us at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly fulfill this mandate which the Charter gives us. Let us continue to work on the great task of building a world to conform to the vision of our Charter: a world of peace, a world of economic and social progress, and a world in which the freedom and dignity of man are a reality.\n144.\tMy country is today more convinced than ever that in creating the United Nations mankind endowed itself with a great opportunity. We understand only too well the impatience of many who are waiting for their most elementary rights to come true. Nor do we underrate the difficulties which the United Nations is having in trying to close the big gap between demands and reality. We do not close our eyes to the obstacles besetting the road to an equitable and peaceful world-wide order. Only the spirit of co-operation on a basis of partnership can help us to go forward. Let us therefore use the opportunity we have.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a matter of great good fortune that the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly are being presided over by Mr. Amerasinghe, who represents his country, SriLanka, with singular authority. His outstanding human and intellectual qualities, as well as his brilliant performance at international conferences, have earned him the respect of the world community. We are delighted at being presided over by a distinguished personality from\nAsia, a continent whose ancient cultures have bequeathed us a legacy of wisdom and spiritual serenity, so necessary at a time like ours when mankind is drawing near the disasters it has been approaching-even calling into question the survival of the species because of the ever more marked imbalance between material progress and the slow progress of the spiritual values which bind men together in every great civilization.\n\n133.\tWe are pleased also to take note of the admission of the Republic of Seychelles as a State Member of this Organization.\n134.\tSince the last session of the United Nations General Assembly there has been no change in the negative image of this Organization in the press and other communications media of the great Powers. What these media organizations have failed to mention, however, is that while there have been an increasing number of confrontations in inter-national forums, such confrontations have not been exclusively a mark of United Nations conferences. Internal tensions in the world community have become more acute in many critical areas because of the absence of serious efforts to create a more balanced international order or because these efforts, when they have been made, have not enjoyed effective support from nations that are primarily responsible for maintaining peace. International institutions, like national institutions, have only a limited capacity for establishing coexistence when applied to human groups or State entities between which there persist unresolved causes of discord.\n135.\tSome people think that the United Nations enjoyed a golden age in its first few decades but that in recent years the Organization has entered into a period of inevitable decadence attributable to the influence exercised on it by new countries which until recently were only allowed scant participation in international affairs. That idea stems from a conception of world politics in which it was assumed, with unfounded optimism, that power relations and., economic relations, as they existed in the world before-the war, were satisfactory and that all that was needed was to remove the threat of totalitarian regimes for the existing civilization and international order to fulfill the aspirations of the peoples. It was assumed that the democratic machinery which in the victorious nations had determined the nature of the States and the distribution of wealth would result in beneficial effects for the entire international community.\n\n136.\tBut that was not the case. What some nostalgically considered to be the golden age of this Organization was in fact a time when relations of dependence and unequal distribution of wealth in the world were not properly examined; nor was there any serious insistence on the fulfillment of promises made during the difficult years of the war with regard to a new order. It was a time when the Organization served to strengthen alliances and blocs among countries, which led to the tense atmosphere of the cold war and to ferocious localized wars in various parts of the planet. At that time the press and other communications\\\" media in the great Powers were unstinting in their praise of those who had conceived an organization which was so superior-so they said-to the League of Nations of Geneva. \nAt that time, no objections were raised in the budget departments of those Powers to the prompt payment of their assessments.\n137.\tBut that situation could not last. The legacy of inequality was like a millstone fastened to the established order and could hardly be institutionalized with the help of the United Nations. The massive economic and social transformations in the past few years have been and are reflected in bitter confrontations in world forums, but this cannot be attributed exclusively to the immaturity of young nations nor to their limited familiarity with the machinery of compromise, which for centuries had been the pride of nations that have designed institutional systems to facilitate and create broad domestic consensus on their fundamental problems.\n138.\tIf controversy in international organizations, in which for years the great Powers were the leading protagonists, has increasingly come to be replaced by radical antagonisms, with such unexpected and of course discomforting guests as the new developing nations, this is a result of the fact that the advanced countries of the world were determined to preserve the excessive advantages they enjoyed under the established order, even though the premises which had served as. the basis for that order since its very origins had disappeared; and these origins did not go so far back as to constitute the kind of legal precedent to which so much value is attached in systems of law based on tradition rather than written norms.\n139.\tIn the past, the construction of an international order was the result of the efforts of statesmen to achieve a relative balance between the ambitions find interests of the great Powers of the time. The duration of that order was subject to the maintenance of this balance by the exclusion of new Powers or outsiders that might disturb it.\n140.\tIn this contemporary world there has been an unsuccessful attempt to revive the old models of international order based exclusively upon the agreement of the great Powers. The failure of such efforts results from the impact caused by the concerted action of weak and traditionally poor countries whose participation is now essential if we want to invest the international order with the legitimacy that comes fro.m longevity and stability. Today the world is undergoing a crisis created by the vacuum that has in turn been created by the absence of a consensus expressing the aspirations of the international community as a whole.\n141.\tIt is therefore understandable that it was only recently that some statesmen of foresight in nations which bear some responsibility for the maintenance of peace initiated a slight change of course in the foreign policies of their countries. Those who acted in this way knew that peace and concord, cannot be decreed, nor imposed solely by power, but result from a delicate balance which can be achieved only when aspirations which genuinely reflect the aims and variety of interests of an era form part of the international order. This fruitful endeavor, which has been the achievement of great leaders of history whose names are indelibly printed on long periods of peace, is not an easy one to consummate. Furthermore, those who attempt it as a rule have to cope with the opposition of their fellow citizens, who often fail to understand the need to make concessions or to renounce the use and abuse of the advantages and prerogatives of power and wealth.\n142.\tOur era is not exceptional in terms of the recurrence of a phenomenon, familiar because it has appeared with similar characteristics in other periods of profound crisis. Hence the statesmen of the great Powers who have made an effort to approach with sympathy the possibility of building a world order which will not mean putting new labels on old inequalities have been the object of furious opposition in their own countries. The ancient Chinese saying, uttered as a curse, might well have been spoken against them: \\\"May you live in an interesting age.\\\"\n143.\tThe growing indifference of .affluent societies to world problems reflects the desire of increasingly broad sectors of their populations to enjoy their prosperity to the utmost while attaching ever less importance to international problems. That indifference has significantly influenced those societies to strive to reduce the attributes of executive or administrative offices whose orientation in foreign as well as domestic policies they view as an impediment to unlimited enjoyment by their citizens and voters of the good life, which the abundant resources and technology of their countries permit.\n144.\tIt would be wrong not to recognize this development if we remember that it is the broadening of the executive powers of administration which for some decades now has enabled affluent societies to fight the domestic concentration of wealth and to impose mechanisms for its more equitable distribution. What can the world and the underdeveloped countries expect in the future if, in their dialog with the highly industrialized nations, they will not be dealing with the type of Governments which, because they were able to do so, imposed some discipline on the major private powers in their economies, on their monopolies, their labor and trade-union organizations and their transnational communication empires, but will instead be dealing with internally weakened Governments, Governments therefore fearful of those power groups? The latter, as though in a post-industrial state of feudalism, will gradually fill the vacuum left by an administration devoid of strength, devoid of the capacity to take decisions, which is essential to reduce the inequalities which exist and are becoming greater in the international community. This new international isolationism, masquerading as democratic or moral concern, and the institutionalization of the weakening of governmental authority in affluent nations are not a happy augury for the future. They would appear to be an attempt to preserve in the world an anonymous imperial power fragmented into private pressure groups free of the burden of responsibility which all power entails.\n145.\tThe fact that this is happening arises from the belief still prevailing in affluent societies that their prosperity and well-being are exclusively the result of the intelligence and superiority of their peoples. And because of that belief they refuse to analyze the extent to which the prosperity and extravagance so characteristic of their economic organization have depended and still depend on an income distribution governed by a world market that is influenced by power mechanisms or by monopolistic systems on an international level which have enabled them to retain the \nsurpluses generated by the marketing of the products of developing countries at low prices.\n146.\tIt is not compatible with the aspiration to create more stable conditions in the world for the major consumer countries to respond to the well intentioned attempts of developing countries to reach agreements between producers and consumers of raw materials with indifference or hostility and then for them to feel that there is aggression against them and to proclaim that the world economy is in danger when producers of raw materials join forces to defend their incomes.\n147.\tOne of the beneficial effects of the rise in oil prices, which in affluent societies is known as the energy crisis, was to bring out into the open the very high degree to which the standard of living of affluent societies is linked to the low prices of the export products of the developing countries. This experience has already unleashed a chain reaction and will inevitably lead to a search for new patterns of balance in the economic relations of the world.\n148.\tWe are not unaware that among the great Powers the idea is gaining ground that it has become unjustifiable to maintain the level of foreign-aid funds of the past few decades for developing peoples. Nor 'ire we unaware that it is thought that such funds could be better used for transforming the suburbs of their cities; for the education of their young or their war veterans; for medical and hospital services for their citizens; for increasing unemployment benefits; for improving police forces; for the treatment of delinquents or drug addicts; for protecting their parks; for adequately equipping their libraries or museums and for maintaining a level of conspicuous consumption which does not correspond with man's spontaneous needs but is promoted by a vast advertising community which is frantically attempting to create artificial needs, thus encouraging the squandering of the scarce resources of this planet.\n\n149.\tIt is not for us, of course, to challenge the right of affluent societies to allocate their surplus funds for the improvement of the quality of life of their citizens and to encourage unnecessary consumption rather than to co-operate in lessening the alarming economic inequalities which exist on a world-wide scale. But it is our hope that, similarly, without any show of surprise, it will be recognized that we enjoy an identical right to organize ourselves in order to defend the proper remuneration for our exports so that income therefrom will permit us to remedy the consequences of backwardness, make the subhuman life in our suburbs more bearable, prevent the deterioration of our environment, lower the illiteracy rates of our populations, close the gap between the rural and the urban populations, create medical and hospital services in order to eradicate diseases caused by malnutrition and endemic sickness, provide jobs for the unemployed, and protect ourselves from the Mafias which finance the traffic in drugs from the territories of the great Powers and with that traffic export to us all the home-grown means of corruption. And, on the subject of international trade, we also trust that they will not invoke the so-called comparative advantages when seeking to ensure a market for the highly effective products of the industrialized nations, while regressing, at the same time, to the crudest protectionism when it comes to safeguarding the interests of their economic enterprises which, because they are inefficient or obsolete, cannot compete with exports from developing countries.\n150.\tEvents of the last decades indicate that there cannot be an indefinite postponement of 3 new international division of labor more in keeping with realities of the day. This new division must be organized in such a way that the developed nations, which have a complex and highly sophisticated technology, take some steps towards opening their markets not only to raw materials or tropical products but also to the manufactured products of those countries which have already embarked upon the initial stages of industrialization. This will contribute to increasing and balancing world trade and will strengthen a more equitable and desirable type of economic relations between the north and south on our planet. The nature of these relations and the adjustments it will be necessary to make in their traditional standards will be the major theme of inter-national policy in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n151.\tThis vast transformation will imply concessions and responsibilities on both sides; it will require prudence and wisdom on the part of the leaders of the affluent nations and the peoples in the process of modernization. Just as it would be reprehensible for great nations to abuse their power so as to impose solutions which are inordinately in their favor such abuses would tarnish their image and lessen their options to defend peacefully their legitimate interests-so it would be, and is, equally reprehensible to follow the undesirable practice of debating political items, the natural forum for which is this Assembly, at conferences of the specialized agencies, to the grave detriment of the services which the United Nations renders, and should render, to Member states. The same criticism can be applied to acts of violence and terrorism which jeopardize the lives of innocent third persons and are frequently carried out in the name of the right of peoples to fight for their independence. Terrorism invites the repudiation of world opinion and brings about a loss of prestige for the cause which those who use terrorism as a political weapon claim to defend. This is already happening. A formula for co-operation between Governments and the United Nations must be found so as to seek out and punish those who perpetrate acts of violence and piracy, and who, by means of terror, threaten the fundamental freedoms of human beings for the purpose of demanding of States that they violate their own laws.\n\n152.\tThere is likewise an urgent need for a specific legal definition of outer space and of geostationary space communications, because recent experience and foreseeable developments within the next few years have brought to light glaring gaps and omissions in the conventions in force on the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. These conventions fail to take into account, for example, the use of outer space for profit; and nothing at all is said about the legal and physically immutable existence of the segments of the synchronic geostationary orbit which generate rights by reason of being permanently situated within the territorial airspace of several equatorial countries Members of the United Nations. Such is the case of Colombia, which lies between 70 and 75 degrees west of Greenwich. \n\n153.\tMy country does not object to free orbital and communications transit as required for the devices en-visaged in and authorized by the International Telecommunications Convention, as long as those devices traverse the territorial airspace in a gravitational flight from a practicable height. But we make a clear exception in the case of devices which it might be intended to establish as fixtures on the segment of our own synchronic geostationary orbit.\n154.\tAs Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, I am pleased to state to you my confidence that the deliberations of this Assembly will result in effective progress in the difficult task of arriving at compromises which will not mistakenly underrate the legitimate hopes of the pauperized masses of the world, on whose discontent no lasting international order can be built. The concessions essential to a consolidation of the legitimacy of a new world order must be granted, to a large extent, by the nations in which wealth has been accumulated through the ages, and not by peoples whose resources have been ill rewarded for centuries, with the result that prosperity and well-being have been concentrated in limited areas of our planet.\n155.\tAs representative of my country in a forum that has gained such prestige from the learned words of so many eminent personalities, I am bound to express the hope of my fellow citizens that the antagonisms which today seriously divide the international community will find peaceful solutions in channels constituted by the norms of law which give form to the Charter of the United Nations. Let us at any rate remember that we are not living in an age of calm when historical time passes with soothing evenness; in our day, time flows like those large tropical rivers whose currents become impetuous and devastating as they approach the cataract.\n"

        "file_text": "Chile's first words in this thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations are to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly.\n173.\tWe welcome the new Member of the United Nations, the Republic of Seychelles, a country with which Chile has just established diplomatic relations,\n174.\tOnce again we express the hope that within this Organization, the appropriate machinery may be found to satisfy the just aspirations for peace, security, freedom and well-being which mankind demands with ever-increasing \nurgency. For a considerable time the eyes of the world will be on this General Assembly. The world is right in asking the Organization for an encouraging response that will make it possible to dispel tension or, at least, for indications that serious efforts are being made to find such a response. If the dialog we are initiating is to be positive, it requires, first of all, that we be true to ourselves and to the mandate conferred upon us by our peoples. It also requires respect for the personality, dignity, independence and ways of thinking of each Member State, without distinction either in deed or in thought for the greater or lesser ability they may have to influence world affairs.\n175.\tCriticism of the United Nations is frequently heard, and there are those who openly suggest to their Governments that they cut down on their participation or that they simply withdraw from it for the reasons I have just outlined. We share in the criticism but we flatly reject the idea that the remedy for the shortcomings of our Organization is to deprive it of the very co-operation it now needs more than ever. Chile has always rendered and will continue to render its fullest collaboration to the United Nations and to each and every one of its subsidiary bodies.\n176.\tDespite the injustice of so many words and resolutions, we have shown in the delicate and important matter of human rights that our intention to co-operate is sound and permanent. In this connexion, I wish to remind this audience that last year my Government took the initiative of proposing the establishment of the essential legal norms necessary for a sovereign country to co-operate with the investigative bodies of the United Nations. These norms must acknowledge, on the one hand, the terms of reference of the mandate of the international organizations, and on the other, the need to respect the inherent rights of the sovereign State. We are not prepared to see all the rights to which we are entitled as a free State Member of this Organization diminished or misjudged. We believe that when any country is treated in a discriminatory manner, its dignity and its intrinsic quality as a sovereign State are jeopardized since the principle of juridical equality of States is not being respected.\n177.\tSince the end of the Second World War, we have gone through, successively, periods of cold war and peaceful coexistence and, today, are going through what is known as a time of detente. Chile, like other nations, has had to develop its relationships with the international community under the aforementioned circumstances. We fully agree with those who acknowledge the success of detente in maintaining international peace by avoiding the use of nuclear force which would lead to collective suicide. Detente has made the threat of a world war very remote, but at the same time it has been noted that, in practice, one of the great Powers has not respected the essential principle of detente; on the contrary, this Power has used and intends to continue using the results of detente as a means of furthering its expansionist policies. With its habitual immorality, the Soviet Union does not hesitate to brand as enemies of peace all those who denounce its attitudes or try to curb its continued imperialistic and political expansionism and its aim of world domination. As Alexander\nSolzhenitsyn said during a television interview in Great Britain:\n\\\"Detente is necessary but with hands open; proof must be given that the hands do not hold stones. But your associates, those with whom you pursue a policy of detente, do have stones in their hands, stones so heavy that they could kill you with a single blow. Detente then becomes self-delusion. It is as simple as that.\\\"\n178.\tWe repeat from this podium that even though it is true that global confrontation has been rendered remote, such an absence of conflict is applicable only in connexion with the prevention of a world war. Soviet communism still practices expansionist aggression, aided by its ideological penetration, and seeks to gain geo-strategic positions everywhere in the world where good faith or the weakness of free countries have permitted or tolerated it. Even though Soviet penetration takes on a variety of forms to adapt itself to the different political and geographical situations, it does have one common characteristic everywhere: first of all, it uses any doctrine, opinion or attitude expressing the belief that the present Christian, western society is sinking into fatal or inexorable decadence. By every means available, it attacks religion, the family, free political systems and the virtues that have made possible the development of civilization. On the pretext of defending social justice and equality, it sets itself up as an alternative to an unfair and imperfect world. To achieve its purposes, it spares no effort to create, often successfully, a feeling that there is no danger, by dint of repeating that its intentions are honest. Thus, it strives to convince others that it will fully respect liberal democracies and the foundations of the nationality of the countries where it offers itself as an alternative.\n179.\tWe have had very painful experience in that connexion, and Chile will never forget that Chilean communism, subservient to Soviet communism, disguised itself in democratic trappings and even went so far as to accept and promulgate an Act of constitutional guarantees-a commitment which its leaders subsequently publicly declared had been only a stratagem to enable them to come to power and which they never honored nor ever intended to honor.\n180.\tIn its efforts to come to power in free countries, Soviet communism establishes as a fundamental principle the class struggle, and through it makes hate its most powerful weapon for its work inside the countries. It tries to prevent and undermine the prestige of any attempted action aimed at solidarity among the various sectors that constitute the national whole, so as to keep them from uniting and to prepare the stage for the later development of violence, subversion, terrorism and armed aggression. While countries strive to achieve a certain degree of stability so that they can tackle their own problems, Soviet communism continues to seek the internal disruption of nations by encouraging any and all extremist association.\n181.\tIn his recent annual message to the country the President of the Republic of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet, stated that communism, in its efforts to control countries from within, uses two tactics simultaneously:\n\\\"On the one hand it infiltrates centers that are vital to free societies such as universities and intellectual circles, mass communication media, unions, trade unions, international organizations and even, as we have seen in Chile, church circles. On the other hand, it promotes disorder in all its forms: material disorder through street demonstrations; economic disorder with demagogic and inflationary pressures; social disorder, with permanent strikes; moral disorder by promoting the use of drugs, pornography and the destruction of the family; and spiritual disorder, with systematic class hatreds. Finally, in an aberrant synthesis, terrorism appears and becomes rife, a terrorism which seems to have returned civilized nations to more primitive times of human history.\\\"\n182.\tThe final stage of the Soviet strategy is open intervention through the sending of weapons and even men for the purpose of attaining by force the success denied to the stages I described. We strongly denounce the failure of Soviet communism to abide by the principle of non-intervention; that failure is a threat to peace among nations and the major enemy of permanent and fruitful detente. This violation has become manifest, as we have pointed out, not only through open intervention but also and much more frequently by helping to create critical conditions as a result of support in the form of both ideology and arms given to terrorist and extremist groups. This contemporary form of intervention in the internal policy of most of the countries of the world must be cogently condemned by the international community.\n183.\tWe state this because we continue to be the victims of the Soviet Union's intervention in our own national political life. Indeed, their radio broadcasting stations continue to broadcast daily and for many hours, on 45 different frequencies and in the Spanish language, programs intended to bring about internal subversion and the overthrow of the Chilean Government. If, to the intervention which we have just described and frequently denounced in the United Nations, we add the fact that we have found and continue to find thousands of arms manufactured in the Soviet Union in the hands of Chilean terrorist organizations, then we have the full picture of an obviously illegitimate and undeniable intervention. Solzhenitsyn in anguished words has said:\n\\\"My words of caution, the .words of caution of others, the very serious warnings addressed by Sakharov directly from the Soviet Union, all continue to go unheeded. Most of them fall on deaf ears, the ears of those who do not wish to hear them. I did once nurture the hope that life's experiences could be transmitted from one nation to another as from one person to another. I now begin to doubt this. Perhaps each of us is fated to live each experience by himself, if he is to understand.\\\"\n184.\tChile feels duty-bound to denounce the rapid advance of violence and terrorism in many areas of the world. It is harrowing to see how terrorists continue to kidnap and kill, sometimes with complete impunity and even the plaudits of some sectors. It is even more dismaying to note, when the decision has been taken to punish their criminal acts, the emergence of pseudo-humanitarian associations and front organizations for Soviet communism, groups which never give a thought to the innocent victims of terrorism. Their action hampers the formulation of the criteria needed if this scourge is to be eradicated in our time. Abstract condemnations of terrorism and violence are generally accepted without difficulty; but the creation of legal mechanisms to prevent, sanction and uproot them is postponed, as are the mechanisms to help their thousands of victims. It would seem we are living in a time of paradoxes, when the attention of the majority is drawn to the rights of criminals, and oblivion, all too often and suspiciously, is the fate reserved for the irreparable damage to thousands of victims who get not so much as one word of consolation.\n185.\tWe concur with other States Members of this Organization on the urgent need to create, during this session, adequate and timely systems aimed at preventing terrorism and violence, to punish those who are intellectually or materially responsible for their actions and to set up our exemplary system to discourage all future efforts in that area. Consequently, the Chilean delegation will co-sponsor a draft resolution to be submitted by the Federal Republic of Germany, calling for international action against the taking of hostages, a heinous and inhuman practice which we condemn, irrespective of the ends it may pursue.\n186.\tChile, confronted with the political phenomena we have described, wishes to restate its firm intention to build a democracy in keeping with its historical tradition and the libertarian spirit of its people; but it wishes also to give the institutions it will create the legal means to ensure their protection and reinforcement. To those who impatiently ask when Chile will fully restore its traditional democratic patterns, we ask that they remember ancient and modern history. More than 23 centuries ago, Socrates observed that governmental systems ran in cycles: absolute monarchy or one-man rule is followed by oligarchy, or the rule by the few, which in turn opens the way for democracy or rule by the many; that, with the passage of time, can deteriorate and degenerate into demagogy or tyranny of the masses, which leads to chaos. If the nation can conserve its latent energy, an authoritarian government must necessarily emerge to reorganize the State, after which the cycle starts all over again. Is it not true that in modern history European nations have followed the pattern of the Socrates cycle? In the face of new threats and infiltrations, democracies must renew themselves to survive.\n187.\tIn Chile, a stable republic was organized in 1831 and lasted 140 years, until in 1970 Marxist demagogy took over and in less than three years ruined the country. The present Government has restored order and the economy and is now enacting chapters of the new Constitution based on the purest democratic ideals, but including provisions which will act as built-in safeguards to avert any relapse into demagogic chaos. For this purpose it has included in the provisions of article 11 of the Act on Constitutional Rights and Duties the following:\n\\\"Any act committed by a person or group of persons for the purpose of disseminating doctrines which attack the family, which advocate violence or a conception of society based on class struggle, or which run counter to the legally established regime or the integrity or functioning of the law, is illegal and contrary to the institutional life of the Republic.\\\"\n188.\tThe President of the Republic, when enacting the new constitutional laws on 11 September of this year, took special care to point out the meaning of this new international framework, for it is of special importance to the courts of justice which must interpret the law. He said:\n\\\"Chile gives itself the structure of a democracy with the participation of the community and endowed with the mechanisms to guarantee its protection and reinforcement. The constitutional ratification of these concepts simplifies the understanding of national security and development as elements that make up the common well-being and are, in the final analysis, subordinated to it.\\\"\nThen, lest there be any doubt concerning the political structure we are building in Chile, the President added:\n\\\"The very existence of the State, as well as its development and growth within the framework of a humanistic philosophy rooted in Christianity, must always be understood as being at the service of each and every one of the human beings making up the nation.\\\"\nTo put an end once and for all to the equivocal interpretations that the word \\\"nationalism\\\" might lend itself to, and to prevent deviations absolutely alien to our traditions and culture, the President gave a solemn warning in his annual message on the state of the country, saying:\n\\\"As for those who, on the pretext of giving the Government their support, use the term \\\"nationalism\\\" to favor styles or doctrines of. an unmistakably Fascist stamp, they must know that this Government categorically rejects them and disowns them.\\\"\n189.\tThe Government of Chile has given clear examples of its decidedly pacifist vocation in its relations with other countries and in its national affairs. In foreign relations, one of its main objectives is to strengthen its present links of close friendship with bordering countries, while at the same time endeavoring to create better economic and political ties with all Latin American countries with which we have strong and centuries-old moral, ideological, political and economic features in common.\n190.\tClear evidence of the conciliatory and collaborative attitude of Chile is the resumption of diplomatic relations with Bolivia after a 12-year suspension, and the fact that we have initiated negotiations on mutually agreed and public bases with this sister nation, with a view to finding a permanent solution to the problem posed by Bolivia's wish to have a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean.\n191.\tThe Chilean Government offered its country as the venue for the sixth session, held last June, of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, which is a regional organization of utmost importance to the hemisphere. It gives us special satisfaction to have seen that Assembly achieve positive results in important matters such as the general, not selective, analysis of respect for human rights in all the States in the hemisphere, and the acknowledgment of a priority which must be given to inter-American co-operation for development. That Assembly welcomed and analyzed the joint statement of the Governments of Panama and the United States of America concerning the future of the interoceanic canal; we are happy to see that progress has been made in this matter, for such a waterway is important to maritime traffic, especially for countries on the south-west coast of the American continent.\n192.\tWe take special pleasure in stressing the very high level of sincerity and cordiality of the debates held at that session, and the very ample coverage given to them by all the communications media in Chile mainly, but also abroad. The opinion of distinguished representatives and statesmen of a number of Latin American countries, who had participated in the work of the Assembly I have spoken of, confirmed that the artificial image of my country created abroad in no way coincides with the realities of its internal affairs. May I stress here that the warm and sometimes massive welcome given by the Chilean people to such distinguished visitors without exception only confirms the deep ties of brotherhood existing between the peoples of the Americas.\n193.\tIn domestic political matters, Chile's pacifist vocation is evidenced in the search for national reconciliation in its generous policy of giving freedom to detainees and the granting of pardons. All these policies are devoted to the final purpose of creating an atmosphere of harmony and national unity which will, for all time if possible, banish hate and violence from the country.\n194.\tIn institutional matters, a committee of distinguished jurists and university professors from every democratic school of thought is drawing up, in absolute freedom, the bases for a new institutional framework. This work is now reflected in the drafting of the Constitutional Acts, The first one created the Council of State whose members are men representing all walks of Chilean life, including academics, workers and youth, This Council of State is headed by an ex-President of the Republic, Jorge Alessandri; this fact, and the personal prestige of the members, gives a moral backing to the act that goes well beyond the text that created it and is a genuine manifestation of national feeling. On 11 September of this year, Constitutional Acts 2, 3 and 4 were enacted. They all relate to the essential foundations of Chilean institutions, constitutional rights and duties and emergency powers. They are all the result of a thorough and detailed study that has taken account of existing legislation, international agreements, the Chilean experience and the opinions of our specialized sectors in their respective fields. Of the many provisions, which in a modern and forward-looking way guarantee respect for human rights and the foundations of our State, I wish to single out only the recognition, at the constitutional level, of equal rights for men and women; the official proclamation of the family as the nucleus of society; the acknowledgment of the legal existence and autonomy of intermediate bodies between the individual and the State in accordance with the principle of \\\"subsidiariness\\\".\n195.\tThe Government of Chile understands that its first duty lies in the quest for a constant balance between economic development and social progress, for the former is no more than a means to obtain the latter. Consequently! this year it will budget approximately $1 billion worth of direct social expenditures. The President of the Republic has emphasized that plans for food, health, low-income housing, basic and pre-basic education are the main items towards which the redistribution of social assistance is directed, in conformity with the moral principle that the action of a State should defend the weakest and the neglected, and that this action is the most valuable work of national integration a government may undertake.\n196.\tThe same humanitarian inspiration guiding Chile in its domestic problems presides over its view of the many problems of human beings in our time.\n197.\tThe Soviet attitude at the world level, denounced by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Andrei Amalrik and Lieutenant Viktor Belenko, makes it difficult for the bodies of the international community to concern themselves, devoting the necessary time, priorities and peace of mind, with the real and pressing problems of mankind such as food shortages, depletion of natural resources, the injustices in the international economic system, living conditions on our planet, the promise of the world's seas and so many others. These are the true problems besetting modem man and the challenges that must be met by an organized international community.\n198.\tWe cannot fail to note this paralyzing and disorienting effect of Soviet communism, its lack of respect for the rights and duties enshrined in the Charter and, especially, its repeated violations of the principle of non-intervention in all continents, all of which have created a series of problems that prevent mankind from meeting its vital needs and have forced it to postpone the adoption of measures to solve these problems. The question of detente cannot be mentioned unless ideological detente is mentioned at the same time.\n199.\tAs we said at the beginning of our address, the human being continues to seek, and expects from this General Assembly real progress towards peace, security, freedom and well-being. Chile here declares its unfailing commitment to fight for these objectives in its internal life and lend its co-operation to the work of our Organization for the same noble ideals.\n"

        "file_text": "41.\t The delegation of Democratic Kampuchea is pleased to be able to convey to Mr. Amerasinghe its warm congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The responsibility placed in him is a warm tribute to his country, Sri Lanka, for its unswerving policy of independence, peace and non-alignment and, through Sri Lanka, which at present has the chairmanship of the group of non-aligned countries, it also constitutes a warm tribute to the whole movement and the principles of non-alignment. We are convinced that under Mr, Amerasinghe's presidency our work will be highly successful.\n42.\tWe also wish to extend our warm congratulations to Mr. Gaston Thorn, President of the thirtieth session of our General Assembly, upon his success in his important office.\n43.\tWe are happy to be able to extend to the Republic of Seychelles our sincere congratulations and a warm welcome to our Organization.\n44.\tWe very much regret the fact that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has so far not been allowed to participate in our work, despite the fact that it fulfills all the conditions laid down in the United Nations Charter. The United States of America has decided once again to abuse the veto without any good reason. This is a display of contempt for the will of all peoples who love peace and justice and it is also an act of defiance of the international community. We repeat once again here our firm support for the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in our international Organization. We should also like to express once again our support for the admission of the People's Republic of Angola, whose absence among us we deplore.\n45.\tThe thirty-first session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when all the peoples of the world, particularly the peoples of the non-aligned countries and the third world, are waging everywhere a triumphant struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, zionism and all forms of interference, aggression, expansion and foreign exploitation for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the right to be masters of their own destiny and for the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equality. The success of the recent Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Colombo has confirmed this intensive movement of the peoples' struggle for freedom, dignity and social progress, a struggle waged at all levels -political, military, diplomatic, economic and organizational.\n46.\tWe live in a world which is undergoing rapid and widespread change. Over the last three decades, the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, exploited and depressed for centuries, have woken up and become aware of their own strength and, taking arms, have committed themselves to arduous struggle, complex and full of sacrifice, in order to free themselves from the iniquitous system of old and new colonialism and to rid themselves of all the shackles of domination and foreign exploitation. By their valiant efforts they have won their freedom, their independence and their dignity, and have recovered the right to determine their own destinies. These victories have by stages shaken the very foundations of the colonial and neo-colonial system. They have opened up to the whole of mankind the path of total liberation everywhere. The determination to enjoy national independence has finally triumphed. No power in the world can overcome the determination of the peoples to recover their freedom, their dignity and their national identity.\n47.\tFrom the ruins of colonialism have emerged scores of new independent States which have undertaken with determination to struggle, protect and consolidate their political and economic independence, their sovereignty and their territorial integrity against all acts of domination, exploitation, interference and aggression by the rich major Powers. They have mobilized all their potential, their capacity, in order to be able to enjoy their inalienable right to dispose of their own national resources and to build a new society in consonance with the aspirations of their people and in accordance with the specific conditions of their nations. Marked by the same vicissitudes of the same colonial past and joined by common aspirations and interests, these independent States of the third world, with one accord, reject out-moded international relations based on inequality and dependence. They are calling vigorously for the establishment of new relations between peoples and nations, more in keeping with the significant changes which have occurred in the world and based upon the principles of mutual respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, mutual advantage, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, and the right of every people to conduct its own affairs.\n48.\tThese are the principles of the non-aligned movement. That movement, born of the stubborn refusal to embrace the policy of blocs and the imperative need for the newly independent States to preserve and strengthen their dearly bought freedom and sovereignty against the ambitions, the greed and the expansionist designs of the rich major Powers, has once again demonstrated its vitality and dynamism at the Colombo Conference. Together with all the other forces of the third world and the peace-loving and justice-loving forces throughout the world, that movement has become a current of unprecedented size and power which is shaking the very foundations of a world which is undergoing wholesale change. The principles of non-alignment, imbued as they are with justice and equality, express the deep aspirations and the determination of the third world countries which include almost three quarters of the population of our planet and constitute the majority of member States in our international community. Thanks to the persistent efforts of the non-aligned movement, these principles have now come to be accepted by the rest of the world.\n49.\tThe cohesiveness of the non-aligned countries, based upon these principles and upon the clear-cut objectives of their struggle, their determined actions, based upon the solidarity of the third world countries forming the Group of 77, constitute a powerful force. In recent years,, the non-aligned movement has taken some important initiatives for a more just and realistic concept of relations among peoples and nations. The convening of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was done at the suggestion of the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka in September 1970. The struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order was started by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Algiers in September 1973, which took the initiative of asking the United Nations to convene the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly. The Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 at Manila, the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi and, more recently, the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries at Mexico City, demonstrate the dynamism and solidarity of the Group of 77 in its efforts to bring about a new international economic order.\n50.\tThe voice of the non-aligned countries and the third world has thus become a voice which the world community must heed in all its debates and in its search for solutions to international problems. The emergence of many third world independent States, the energy and vitality of the non- aligned movement, have changed the face of the world, which no longer resembles that which had been wrought by the rich major Powers at the time when the United Nations was founded, a time when international relations of domination and dependence were still unquestioned.\n51.\tThe people of Kampuchea have not held aloof from the upheavals in the world. They have participated actively, along with all other peoples, in the common struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, in order to free themselves from all forms of domination, oppression and exploitation. They have never accepted the yoke of the colonialist and neo-colonialist system, a yoke imposed upon them for more than a century and against which, from the very beginning, they waged a long, difficult, stubborn and complicated struggle in all respects, be it political, military or diplomatic, winning successive victories until they achieved total victory over the way of aggression of American imperialism, on 17 April 1975. For the nation and people of Kampuchea, this glorious victory had far-reaching historical consequences because it marked their total and final liberation from imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and all other forms of domination and exploitation. Our nation in its entirety recovered its soul and its identity. Our people recovered their dignity and henceforth are keeping firmly in their own hands their own destiny in total independence and sovereignty.\n52.\tOn 17 April 1975 we witnessed the victory of the unswerving solidarity of the non-aligned countries and peoples in the third world with the struggle of the people of Kampuchea, as well as the solidarity of all peoples in the world who love peace and justice, including the people of the United States, its young people and progressive, peace-loving political leaders. It was the victory of the policy of independence, peace and non-alignment against the policy of domination, oppression, exploitation, intervention and aggression.\n53.\tIn order to win this historic victory, our nation and people had to make immense sacrifices. More than a million inhabitants were killed or wounded, or about 13 per cent of the total population. The economy was ruined. The means of production were in large part destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of oxen and buffaloes so necessary for agricultural work were killed. Factories, plantations, fields, rice paddies, forests were destroyed to a proportion of from 70 to 80 per cent. From 60 to 80 per cent of the lines of communication were destroyed: bridges, roads, railways, ports and so on. Hundreds of villages and urban centers were razed to the ground and struck off the map,\n54.\tOur nation and people made all these grave sacrifices for love of country, for the liberation of the country and their own liberation, for their honor and national dignity, democracy, peace and territorial integrity, and also for the sake of solidarity with the peoples of the world, the national liberation and democratic movements, and for peace in the world.\n55.\tIt is for the same reasons that immediately after liberation our people throughout the country engaged in a vast and intensive revolutionary mass movement to perform two fundamental tasks: the defense and building of the country.\n56.\tSince liberation, we have successfully defended and consolidated the gains of the revolution. There is security throughout our territory; however, our own experience and that of other revolutions in the world have taught us that after their defeat, the American imperialists, lackeys and other reactionary forces continue relentlessly to oppose our country, our people and our revolution. Since it is impossible, if not difficult, for them to attack us openly from the outside they are striving to rally the rump of the forces of perfidy in order to carry out actions of subversion, provocation, division and undermining inside our country, and also to intervene in our internal affairs. Thanks to our continuous revolutionary vigilance and tight unity, our nation, our people and our army have inflicted upon them some severe defeats but, guided by their aggressiveness and blinded by their vaulting ambition, the American imperialists, their lackeys and other reactionary forces are unwilling to learn the lessons of their defeats, and persist in pursuing their criminal activities. There can be no doubt that our people and revolutionary armed forces will inflict upon them, in all independence and sovereignty, further new and ignominious defeats.\n57.\tAfter the war we resolved the problems raised by economic rehabilitation in the agricultural, cottage industry, industrial and social fields as and when they arose. In particular we have solved once and for all the problem of food. The people have no need to worry about famine. We are continuing to solve our problems successfully so that we may build an independent economy, without which true political independence cannot exist.\n58.\tIn this new stage of their struggle our people are continuing to hold firmly to the same political line which led them to the historic victory of 17 April 1975. This is the line of independence, sovereignty and self-reliance. We are continuing with enthusiasm and in. national unity to display the creative spirit, determination and revolutionary vigilance.\n59.\tMany friendly peoples and countries have given us their support and encouragement in pursuing this course. They have given us support and assistance which have helped us to strengthen our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to tighten the links of friendship and solidarity between our peoples and countries. We are happy to be able once again to express here to all these friendly countries and peoples the profound gratitude of our people and Government.\n60.\tOur people have always wished to live in peace and liberty, within the frontiers of their country, so as to build a society in keeping with their profound aspirations. Although they have been the victims of aggression, domination and subjugation for so many centuries and although a large area of their national territory was amputated, our people have no feeling of contempt or hostility or any ambitious designs of intervention, aggression or expansion with regard to any people or any country. In its external relations, Democratic Kampuchea is continuing to pursue a policy of independence, peace, neutrality and non-alignment. This is a strategic choice, not subject to fluctuations of the hour, because it is in keeping with the aspirations of our people, their culture, their history and the geographic situation of our country. Itself a non-aligned country, Democratic Kampuchea respects and scrupulously applies the principles of non-alignment which are themselves in keeping with the fundamental principles laid down in the United Nations Charter. It is not a member of any alliance or any regional association. It opposes the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory and all forms of intervention and interference in its internal affairs. It is the duty of our people to defend with determination their independence, national sovereignty, their territorial integrity and their inalienable right to determine their own destiny for which they have fought so hard and made so many sacrifices. At the same time Democratic Kampuchea is continuing to mobilize its efforts to establish and maintain with its neighbors, and indeed with all other countries in the world, close relations of friendship based upon strict mutual respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the principle of equality and mutual advantage. Democratic Kampuchea never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. It scrupulously respects the sovereign right of every country to decide itself on its own business without any foreign intervention.\n61.\tTo all the movements of the peoples struggling for independence, freedom, democracy and social progress against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism and all other forms of domination and foreign exploitation, Democratic Kampuchea will continue, as it has in the past, to demonstrate active solidarity and firm support.\n62.\tThe irresistible momentum of the emancipatory movement of the oppressed nations and peoples is alarming imperialism and all the forces of domination and foreign exploitation, which are multiplying their activities to strengthen their last bastions, to preserve their privileges and to suppress the aspirations of the peoples to freedom, justice and social progress.\n63.\tFirst, Korea remains divided and has been so for more than 30 years, because the United States is persisting in pursuing its policy of \\\"two Koreas\\\" and its domination of the southern part of Korea. In defiance of the joint North-South statement of 4 July 1972 and resolution 3390 B (XXX), the United States has strengthened its occupation forces in South Korea and has sent large quantities of modern arms, including nuclear weapons, to that country. It has drawn up plans for attacking and occupying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the space of a few days. In South Korea the neo-colonialist regime is arresting, imprisoning and assassinating Korean patriots whose only crime has been that of calling for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country.\n64.\tAll these facts make it quite clear that the United States of America and the Seoul regime are actively preparing for a new aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and that the American troops stationed in South Korea do in fact constitute a fundamental obstacle to the reunification of Korea and a serious threat to peace in that part of the world.\n65.\tDemocratic Kampuchea firmly supports the three principles and the five guidelines of President Kim II Sung for solving the Korean problem. The problem of Korea can only be solved in accordance with resolution 3390 B (XXX), that is to say, by a cessation of intervention and aggression by the United States in Korea, the total withdrawal from South Korea of American troops and their military equipment, including nuclear weapons, the dissolution of the so-called \\\"United Nations High Command\\\" and the transformation of the temporary armistice into a peace agreement.\n66.\tSecondly, in the Middle East, until the Palestinian people have recovered their inalienable national rights, there is no hope of establishing any lasting peace there.\n67.\tIsraeli Zionism continues, thanks to assistance from the United States, to impede all efforts and all relevant resolutions of the United Nations intended to settle the problem, It is persisting in its aggression against the Palestinian and Arab people and denying to the Palestinian people the exercise of their inalienable national rights recognized by resolution 3236 (XXIX). Furthermore, it is consolidating the establishment of its settlements on Arab territories occupied by force.\n68.\tDemocratic Kampuchea has always firmly supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people and will continue to do so until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable national rights, including their rights to self-determination, independence and sovereignty, and until they can exercise their inalienable right to return to their homes and their property, from which they were removed and uprooted. We are gratified by the considerable progress made by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is recognized by the United Nations, the group of non-aligned countries, the League of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity and the overwhelming majority of the international community.\n69.\tDemocratic Kampuchea will continue also firmly to support the just struggle of the other Arab peoples for the recovery of their territories occupied by force by Israeli zionism since 1967. It is our conviction that thanks to their struggle and their solidarity, which is persistent, stubborn and resolute, and thanks to the solidarity of all peoples who love peace and justice, the just and sacred cause of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples will triumph.\n70.\tThirdly, Taiwan has not yet been reintegrated with its mother country because of the intervention and military occupation of the United States, which has lasted for more than 27 years. We express once again our firm and constant support for the People's Republic of China in its struggle for the respect of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and for the return to it of that island.\n71.\tFourthly, problems of decolonization continue to be acute.\n72.\tIn East Timor, the people are still being denied the independence which they won at such high cost after a long and brave struggle. Indeed, on the very morrow of the independence of that country it was a victim of aggression and was then annexed by force. The General Assembly, at its thirtieth session, and the Security Council have adopted resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, and the respect of all countries for the territorial integrity of East Timor and the inalienable rights of the people of Timor to self-determination and independence. These are extremely relevant resolutions, but the country responsible for the denial of the rights is continuing to ignore them. The annexation of East Timor is an act committed in defiance of the aspirations of its people. The just struggle of the people and Government of the Democratic Republic of East Timor, under the leadership of the Frente Revolucionaria Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN] to recover its independence has won the support and active solidarity of Democratic Kampuchea. Neither force nor sophistry can weaken the will for independence of the people of East Timor.\n73.\tThe determination to be independent is asserting itself with unprecedented vigor in southern Africa, which has now become the cockpit of the struggle for decolonization. Minority racist regimes in Salisbury and Pretoria have rejected all the decisions of the United Nations, and have refused the offer of peaceful change contained in the Lusaka Manifesto.  With the assistance of other imperialist powers, they have intensified measures of repression, have strengthened their Fascist domination, stepped up their preparations for war and are multiplying their divisive manoeuvres against the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania. Massacres like that of Soweto, arrests, detention, torture, deportation of civilian populations are going on, veritable acts of defiance of the international community. But the peoples of southern Africa have come to the point where they can no longer suffer in silence the humiliation, the subjugation and injustice which they have suffered because of the color of their skins. They have intensified with determination their struggle against the inhumane and oppressive system of apartheid and racial discrimination to recover their freedom, justice and human dignity.\n74.\tWe would express our whole-hearted solidarity with the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania and also all friendly peoples in that part of southern Africa which, in support of those struggles, have taken energetic measures against the racist regimes in Salisbury and Pretoria. By their determined and persistent struggle, by the unity and vigilance in the face of the divisive manoeuvres of imperialism and all the forces of foreign domination, the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania will win their independence and human dignity. The struggle has received considerable encouragement from all African countries which together at the third OAU Summit  made an urgent appeal for the strengthening of the armed struggle and decided to that end to provide the utmost political, economic and military aid. This is a just stand which demonstrates that Africa belongs to the Africans and decolonization of the African continent is the business of the African peoples. We offer our whole-hearted support for this just position and also for all the efforts of the African peoples for the total decolonization of Africa.\n75.\tIn this spirit we would like to repeat our expression of firm solidarity with the struggle of the people of the Comoros for respect for their national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity through reintegration in the archipelago of the island of Mayotte.\n76.\tConcerning Western Sahara we believe, in accordance with our unswerving position, that this problem should be resolved on the basis of the principle of self-determination. We are confident that the OAU Summit will take decisions in keeping with the spirit of friendship and solidarity of the States of the area.\n77.\tWe firmly support the liberation movements of the peoples of Latin America. We express once again our solidarity with the people and Government of Cuba in their legitimate claim to have the Guantanamo base restored to them by the United States of America. We support the just struggle of the people and Government of Panama to recover effective sovereignty and total jurisdiction of the Canal Zone. We express again our solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico in their struggle for the full exercise of their national rights.\n78.\tFifthly, the profound changes which have occurred on the international scene over the last three decades necessarily entail a restructuring of the United Nations and a revision of its Charter so that they may be adapted to contemporary realities and be more responsive to the aspirations of all peoples who want to be masters of their own destiny, dispose of their national resources in all independence and sovereignty and establish international relations based on justice and equality in a new world founded upon genuine independence, democracy, social progress and peace, and free of imperialism, neo-colonialism, racism and all other forms of foreign domination and exploitation.\n79.\tThe essential objective of the revision of the United Nations Charter should be the strengthening of the role of the Organization in the search for solutions to the important and serious problems of the world today, dominated as it is by problems of the third world, and also in the effective application of the resolutions of our General Assembly. To this end it is necessary, first, that the great responsibilities of our Organization be entrusted primarily to persons perfectly familiar with the problems of the third world, who have displayed a determination to serve this end and who have won the confidence of the countries of the third world.\n80.\tWe should, furthermore, adopt a solution to the present anachronism constituted by the fact that the rich major Powers continue to exercise control, particularly in the Security Council, while the third world countries are asserting themselves with ever greater vigor on the international scene and also in the General Assembly. This anachronism is inimical to and weakens the role of the United Nations. It is clear that the role, composition and rules of the Security Council would benefit by being changed in the light of the new realities prevailing in the world. We should give serious attention to the possibility of limiting, if not abolishing, the right of veto, the use of which has in fact only served to preserve the privileges of the rich major Powers against the interests of the third world. In fact, the use of the right of veto to oppose just and relevant measures taken by the majority of States Members of the United Nations against States which have violated the Charter has paralyzed the efforts of the Organization to find solutions to the Palestinian problem and the problem of the decolonization of southern Africa. Similarly, the use of the veto to oppose the admission of new Members to our Organization is a way of curbing the dynamism of the third world.\n81.\tThere is no doubt that, if we really want to strengthen the role of the United Nations at the present time, decisions on major world problems can no longer be the prerogative of the rich major Powers but should form part of the responsibilities of all States, large and small, placed on an equal footing. And the organ where this responsibility could most effectively be exercised is our General Assembly, where all States are represented and whose powers would gain by being made more extensive and more effective.\n82.\tThe revision of the Charter and the restructuring of the United Nations have become very important because they are very far-reaching matters. They must therefore be adapted to the irreversible progress of our world towards a better and more just world. The effectiveness of United Nations actions is linked with the responses which it will give and the positions it will take vis-a-vis the new realities of the world today.\n83.\tSixthly, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is at a standstill, primarily because of the obstinacy of the major maritime Powers in preserving their privileges and failing to respect the sovereign rights of other coastal States. Our delegation would like to repeat here the position of Democratic Kampuchea on a certain number of problems.\n84.\tDemocratic Kampuchea believes that the sea should be harnessed to the service of development and well-being, prosperity of the peoples, and peace and justice. The new rules of the law of the sea should guarantee all States, particularly developing States, against any threats to their security, sovereignty or territorial integrity. Freedom of navigation and the development of international trade should not serve as pretexts to limit the sovereignty of coastal States or their rights over the natural resources of the sea.\n85.\tIn accordance with these principles, Democratic Kampuchea would like to make it clear once again that it cannot accept innocent passage over its territorial sea, which it set at 12 nautical miles with effect from September 1969. Indeed, so-called innocent passage has often been used by certain major maritime Powers and their allies for purposes of spying and subversion against our country and people.\n86.\tDemocratic Kampuchea unreservedly supports the right of all coastal States to possess an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles, which would not form part of the high seas. Within this economic zone the coastal State has sovereign and exclusive rights for the purposes of exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of all natural resources of the sea-bed, its subsoil and super-jacent waters. No one can claim on any pretext the right to tap these resources without the prior authorization of the coastal State. Such an act would constitute a violation of the sovereignty of the coastal State.\n87.\tWith regard to the continental shelf, Democratic Kampuchea believes that the coastal State enjoys full and total sovereignty over it for purposes of exploration and exploitation of its natural resources. This sovereignty is subject to no limitation, restriction or reservation, in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore its own continental shelf or does not exploit its natural resources for its own reasons, no one may undertake, whatever the circumstances or the reasons, such activities without the explicit consent of the coastal State. Democratic Kampuchea categorically opposes any action taken against its interests, or any foreign activity or undertaking, past, present or future, which would be prejudicial to its sovereign rights over its continental shelf.\n88.\tWith regard to the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed of the international zone which constitutes the common heritage of mankind, we believe that only an international authority given the necessary powers and competence can properly defend the legitimate interests of the developing countries.\n89.\tThe problems of economic development remain the major concern of our world. For almost four years the third world countries have combined their efforts to replace the present international economic order. This out-moded system, based on relations of domination, exploitation and dependence, made it possible for the developed countries to become rich very rapidly and to live in luxury and extravagance, while the developing countries are becoming progressively more impoverished and remain, since they became politically independent, in the grip of serious problems of poverty, malnutrition and hunger, disease and illiteracy.\n90.\tThe terms of trade of these developing countries have continued to deteriorate because the commodities and raw materials which they possess are constantly losing value. Their indebtedness, with all the financial implications attaching thereto, has become traumatically worse. Furthermore, the unequal and iniquitous relations have made possible the importation into those countries of the economic and financial crisis of the capitalist world with all its corollaries, namely, inflation, price rises, currency devaluation and the lowering of the people's standard of living.\n91.\tIn a word, the gap between the rich and poor countries keeps on growing. The developed countries cannot shirk their responsibility, which derives from many sources, in this increasingly alarming development. The establishment of a new international economic order, based on equality, respect, mutual advantage and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, has become an urgent need.\n92.\tMany conferences and international debates have been held and have made it possible for the developing and developed countries to adopt, after arduous negotiation, a certain number of resolutions on the establishment of this new international economic order. Although these resolutions are not all satisfactory to the developing countries, none of them has yet been put into effect. It is clear that there remains a great deal of ground to be covered, ground which is strewn with obstacles erected by the rich major Powers in order to preserve their privileges. Experience has taught us all that any renunciation of privilege can only be the fruit of stubborn, persistent and self-sacrificing struggle.\n93.\tHowever, together with this common struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order, developing countries are waging, with determination and success, a desperate and persistent struggle to win their economic independence and to consolidate their political independence. Of course, third world countries are poor today because they were exploited and pillaged for centuries by colonialism and then by neo-colonialism within the framework of the current relations of domination and dependence. But these countries possess great human potential and considerable natural resources. The mobilization and proper use of these resources would make possible rapid economic development, not on the model of the rich countries but on a model which would be more in keeping with the political, economic, social and cultural features of each nation and people.\n94.\tPlacing their confidence in the resources, strength and capacity of their nation and people, many developing countries have thus scored encouraging successes in the building of their economy on the basis of the principles of independence, sovereignty and self-reliance. These principles do not mean isolationism or any deliberate determination to live in self-sufficiency, or aloof from international co-operation; nor do they mean the rejection of foreign assistance. They mean that the efforts of building the economy must necessarily be based, above all, on the inexhaustible and creative strength of the people and the use of all resources and the full potential of the nation. This necessarily entails a bitter and constant struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and against all forms of domination and foreign exploitation, for the exercise of full national sovereignty over all the resources and economic activities of the country, including the sovereign right to nationalize transnational companies, which serve only to absorb all the energies of a country with a view to subordinating it to the developed countries. Foreign assistance is used in addition to the efforts of the whole nation, provided that it is unconditional, has no strings attached, and helps consolidation of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n95.\tThese principles of independence, sovereignty and self-reliance on the national level are by no means incompatible with the need to strengthen, in particular with the other developing countries, solidarity and international co-operation based on mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual advantage. In greater numbers now the third world countries are becoming convinced that, through their determined and stubborn efforts to build a national economy in each of their countries on the basis of the principle of independence, sovereignty and self-reliance, through their solidarity and co-operation based upon equality and mutual respect, mutual advantage, non interference in internal affairs, and through their common struggle against all relations of domination and foreign exploitation, they will succeed in establishing a new international economic order.\n96.\tThe numerous victories won in the liberation struggles of peoples should not make us forget that there are still very many obstacles blocking their long and arduous progress. The nations and peoples of the third world have to do away with the encumbering economic, social and cultural heritage bequeathed by colonialism. The peoples who are still oppressed will have to make a great many more sacrifices in order to win their freedom. Imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism and all the forces of foreign domination and exploitation are persisting in their policies of oppression and are stepping up their war preparations and multiplying their divisive and diversionary manoeuvres. But the oppressed know very well that freedom, equality and human dignity are not received as gifts but won by struggle. They were won at a time when imperialism held sway in the world, but in our time they will be won even more certainly, because our time is a time when the liberation movement is mobilizing all the peoples of the third world and all peoples in the world who love peace and justice.\n97.\tIn the struggle of all the peoples for a better world where freedom, peace, friendship, democracy, justice and social progress reign, the people of Kampuchea have made their contribution by the sacrifices they made in their national liberation struggle. At the present time they are continuing to make their contribution by their efforts to defend and build their country devastated by war. In the past, now, and in the future, the people of Kampuchea will identify themselves with the noble struggle of all the peace-loving and justice-loving people and will continue to work to hasten their victory.\n"

It is also an acknowledgeent, as he has stated, of the positive role that his country, Sri Lanka, has been playing in world affairs under the inspiring leadership of his Prime Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandara naike. On behalf of my delegation, I extend to Ambassador Amerasinghe our sincere congratulations and assure him our full support and co-operation at all times. We are particularly happy to see him in the Chair because his country is our closest neighbor, with which so many historical and cultural ties unite us and with which we have enjoyed very fruitful links of economic cooperation for the past several decades.\n137.\tOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of Maldives, I should like to express our deep appreciation of the man who has been directing, with such efficiency and skill, the executive machinery of the United Nations for the past five years, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His dedication to the cause of peace and his vision, courage and impartiality at all times have earned him the respect of the entire international community.\n138.\tOn the occasion of the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations, may I also extend our warm gre stings to its delegation. The Maldives looks forward to the establishment of cordial relations with the newly independent State.\n139.\tSince this is the first time that a representative of my country has had the honor of addressing the General Assembly for some years, allow me to convey to the President, the Secretary-General and the representatives the greetings of my President, His Excellency Amir Ibrahim Nasir, and his best wishes for the success of these deliberations.\n140.\tOn this occasion, I should also like to reaffirm fee commitment of the Government of Maldives to the purposes and ideals of the United Nations. We are convinced that the United Nations system, despite its short-comings, has been and still is the most important instrument the family of nations has so far evolved for the maintenance of peace and security in the world, and for the promotion of the principles of freedom, justice and human dignity. In its 30 years of existence, the United Nations has accomplished much, especially in the process of decolonization and in the development of peaceful co-operation in many fields of international relations, in addition to peace-keeping operations in many troubled areas. We believe that the United Nations remains the best hope for a better world.\n141.\tWe firmly support the call for the strengthening of the United Nations system in order to increase the effectiveness of its role in the pressing political and economic issues that face us today. A first step in this direction would be the implementation of the principle of universality of its membership. We feel that no sovereign State should be barred from membership in the -United Nations.\n142.\tWe are acutely aware that the non-implementation of its resolutions is weakening the very foundations on which the authority of the United Nations is based. We believe that it is the collective duty of all Member States to find ways and means which will ensure that the resolution and decisions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly are respected and implemented.\n143.\tThe primary concern of my Government is to improve the living conditions of our people. The Maldives is one of the smallest Member States in the United Nations. The most serious impediments to our social and economic development are our meager natural resources and the extreme fragmentation of our sprawling clusters of islands which stretch over an area of approximately 100,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean.\n144.\tUntil very recently, almost 90 per cent of our national income had been dependent on the fishing industry. Our efforts to find other sources of revenue have resulted in the establishment in recent years of some exchange-earning industries, the most promising of which has turned out to be tourism. The tropical beauty and the calm serenity of the sun-drenched islands have made the Maldives a country with tremendous potential for $ flourishing tourist industry.\n145.\tSo far the Maldives has depended solely on its own resources, however limited they may be, for its economic and social development. We are rightly proud of the fact that we have been able to achieve, under the dynamic leadership of our youthful President and by our policy of \\\"development through self-reliance\\\", a measure of success that others may find hard to believe. But owing to the nature and urgency of our development needs, combined \nwith the hard economic realities of our times, we find at the present stage of our growth that external assistance and co-operation are of vital importance for our continued progress. We have been fortunate indeed to receive bilateral assistance in some areas of our development program. We fully agree with the Foreign Minister of Australia that \\\"the best and most acceptable aid is that which eliminates the need for its own continuation\\\" [9th meeting, para. 173].\n146.\tThe stability of our own area is crucial to our political and economic well-being. For that reason the Maldives fully endorses General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), which declares the Indian Ocean a zone of peace, free from great-Power rivalry and conflict. We believe that the implementation of that Declaration is essential to the true independence and security of the States of the region. In this connexion, we welcome the statement made before this Assembly a few days ago by the Foreign Minister of the USSR [7th meeting]that the Soviet Union had no intention of building military bases in the Indian Ocean.\n147.\tThe Maldives has noted with deep satisfaction the normalization of relations between India and Pakistan, with both of which we enjoy very close and fruitful relations.\n148.\tThe Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries held in Colombo in August of this year was of special significance to us, since at that Conference the Maldives became a full member of the non-aligned group. We have joined the non-aligned movement as a result of our conviction that this movement embodies not only the legitimate aspirations of two thirds of the world's entire population, but also of mankind's search for peace and harmony among nations. In our perception, non-alignment is a constructive force that strives for the establishment of a new international economic and political order based on justice and equity.\n149.\tThe non-aligned movement is not a new political bloc, as so lucidly explained to this august Assembly only a few days ago by Mr. Amerasinghe's Prime Minister and the current Chairman of the group of the non-aligned countries [11th meeting]. By becoming a member of the movement, no country loses its right to formulate its own domestic or external policies according to the political will of its own people. The Maldives, as a Moslem country with its own cultural heritage on which no foreign culture has ever made its imprint over the centuries, has its own fundamental values by which it interprets the principles of liberty, democracy and social justice.\n150.\tThe Middle East is a region with which the Maldives has always had very strong traditional links. It is a matter of deep concern for us that no positive steps have been taken since the last session of the General Assembly in the search for a just and lasting peace in the area.\n151.\tThe Maldives reaffirms its solidarity with the Arab countries in their struggle to liberate their occupied lands. We firmly support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their legitimate right to establish a homeland on their own national soil. We are convinced that a just and durable peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through a comprehensive settlement based on\nIsrael's total withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem and other Islamic Holy Races in Palestine, and the immediate restoration to the Palestinian people of all their national rights in accordance with the numerous resolutions adopted by this Assembly.\n152.\tThe situation in southern Africa continues to constitute a threat to the peace and security of the region. We in the Maldives strongly object to the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination, since it violates all fundamental human values. We emphasize the need for the total and speedy eradication of apartheid and for the exercise, by the South African people, of their legitimate right to self- determination.\n153.\tWe denounce South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. We call for the immediate transfer of power to the people of Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations in accordance with Security Council resolutions 264 (1969), 269 (1969) and 366 (1974).\n154.\tWe firmly endorse the right of the African people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence. We welcome the recent diplomatic initiative of the United States to find an equitable solution. Mr. Kissinger is a man of great diplomatic skill, as he has proved in so many critical situations. His efforts will no doubt make a positive contribution towards a just and durable settlement. But we fully agree with the front-line African States that the prime objective in Zimbabwe should be the immediate introduction of majority rule.\n155.\tThe Maldives supports all efforts made in the search for a negotiated settlement to the problem of Cyprus. We hail the continued efforts of the Secretary-General to promote talks between the parties directly concerned that would, hopefully, pave the way to a peaceful solution. We feel that any realistic solution to the problem should take into account the legitimate interests of both the Greek and Turkish communities, and that it should preserve the independence and the territorial integrity of Cyprus.\n156.\tWe in the Maldives remain deeply disturbed over the continued presence of foreign military forces on the Comorian island of Mayotte. In accordance with the resolutions adopted at the Seventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Istanbul in May [see A]31[237] and at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo [see AI31[197, annex IV] we call for the immediate withdrawal of those forces.\n157.\tThe problem of disarmament has become of prime importance to all countries in the world, big and small. In the words of our Secretary-General, \\\"the problem of armaments continues to present the most serious threat to a peaceful and orderly future for the world community\\\". It is time that a comprehensive program of agreed measures for the opening of a process of genuine disarmament is worked out.\n158.\tThe Maldives, being a maritime nation, attaches great importance to the deliberations of the Law of the Sea Conference, which has had the good fortune of meeting under the leadership of Mr. Ameraszighe. We believe that the work of the conference has reached such a crucial stage that great patience and flexibility on the part of all the participants have become essential for the successful conclusion of the negotiations. On the positive side, the Maldives welcomes the consensus reached on such key issues as the 12-mile territorial sea and 200-mile economic zone.\n159. In this session of the General Assembly, as in many previous ones, we are faced with a multitude of crucial issues. The success or failure of our deliberations will largely depend on the manner in which we deal with them. If we, collectively, have the political will and the moral strength to face the challenges of our times with dedication and courage, success will be within our reach. If we lack that collective will or that moral strength, our efforts may turn out to be an exercise in futility.\n160. In conclusion, let me repeat these inspiring words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report:\n\\\"Our efforts to make the United Nations work will inevitably contain a measure both of hope and of frustration, of achievement and of failure. In the long run only the dedication of the Members to the ideals and objectives of the Charter, and their persistence in working to realize those ideals and objectives... will be the decisive factor in the success or failure of this great experiment.\\\" \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me, first of all, to join the ethers who have spoken before me to congratulate you warmly on your unanimous election to this high and demanding post. It gives my delegation much satisfaction to see that a distinguished son of a country with which we have very cordial relations and co-operation presides over this very important session of the General Assembly. We have all confidence that, with the distinguished service you have had within your Government and with your vast wealth of experience in international affairs, you will steer this session to a satisfactory and fruitful conclusion.\n2.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who with singular distinction led the General Assembly successfully through the thirtieth session. As all representatives will no doubt remember, that session was not particularly easy. Its successful conclusion was mainly due to the wise leadership and relentless efforts to resolve problems displayed by Mr. Thorn. We owe him a debt of gratitude for all this.\n3.\tI would also like to place on record our gratitude and thanks to our distinguished and untiring Secretary-General and his staff for their devotion to duty and loyalty to the Organization. They ploughed through many difficulties, prepared numerous conferences and fulfilled the many tasks assigned to them by this community of nations. They all deserve encouragement and thanks.\n4.\tBefore I go into the main part of my statement, I have the honor to convey, through you, to all delegates here assembled, warm greetings from my President, His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the Government and people of the Republic of Kenya. His Excellency the President, an ardent believer in the United Nations and a staunch freedom fighter, has particularly instructed me to send his personal best wishes for the success of this session, which he considers crucial for the final blow to colonialism, the restoration of human dignity to those still oppressed, particularly in southern Africa, and the establishment of peace in the world as a whole.\n5.\tIt gives my delegation great pleasure and satisfaction to welcome amongst us the new Member of our Organization, the Republic of Seychelles. Its admission is an important landmark: it symbolizes the progress made towards the eventual total elimination of colonialism; it also brings us closer to the fulfillment of the much desired principle of universality of the United Nations. We would like to assure the Seychelles of Kenya's full support and co-operation, and we are confident that together we shall accomplish the difficult tasks that lie ahead towards attaining a more developed and prosperous Africa.\n6.\tWhile we rejoice at the admission of the new Member, we must not lose sight of the fact that some countries, notably Angola, Viet Nam and the Koreas still remain outside this Organization through no fault of their own. We would like to urge those Powers that obstruct their admission to reconsider their stand and let these countries be admitted.\n7.\tAs we are meeting here, southern Africa constitutes the main center of tension in the world today, threatening international peace and security, We in Africa had cautioned this august body and the whole world that the racists' policies in that region constitute a threat to international peace and security, but the friends of the racists' regimes turned a deaf ear to our warning. Recent developments indicate that there is a change of heart. This is a positive step, and my delegation hopes that, now that we are all agreed that the racial policies in that region are a threat to international peace and security, we shall likewise agree to take measures that will put an end to the threat.\n8.\tIn Azania, the racist regime of Vorster has unleashed a specter of terror against the mounting forces of nationalism. The barbaric murder of innocent children in Soweto, whose only crime was to demonstrate peacefully against the imposition on them of an alien language and the diabolic creed of apartheid is a crime against humanity. As we stated during the SharpevQle massacre, mere condemnation of such heinous crimes was not sufficient to deter the racists of South Africa. We warned then that, unless South Africa was punished for that crime, it would be encouraged and would continue to perpetrate further atrocities against the innocent Africans. The apologists of the Vorster regime were quick to come to its defense. They even told us that the Sharpeville massacre was only an isolated incident and that, at any rate, it was an action taken to preserve law and order.\n9.\tThe same mad reasoning of maintaining law and order is now being used by the murderous, trigger-happy, Hitlerite police forces in South Africa to murder hundreds of people and maim thousands. Kenya condemns in the strongest terms possible these barbaric murders of innocent children, women and old people by the racist regime, and calls on the international community to impose sanctions on South Africa.\n10.\tWhat is happening in Soweto (Johannesburg), Cape Town and other areas, is not an act of lawlessness on the part of the non-whites. The demonstrators are not rioters as the racist regime is desperately trying to convince the world. They are freedom fighters. Their actions are a spontaneous reaction against continuous exploitation, degradation and deprivation of their fundamental human rights and dignity. The war of liberation has indeed set foot in the soil of Azania. So Vorster and his collaborators must realize that the handwriting is on the wall\u2014Azania shall be free-and no amount of brutal murders or the suppression and massacre of the black and non-white, or empty boasts that apartheid is here to stay, will turn back the hand of the clock of freedom in Azania. A systematic psychological war is being waged against those States and people who support the freedom struggle in Azania and other parts of southern Africa, who are constantly being accused by the supporters of the racist regimes of being vengeful against the whole population in these areas. The aim of this campaign is to slow down the momentum of the freedom struggle by inculcating a sense of guilt in those who advocate the use of legitimate force.\n11.\tAfrica, indeed the whole of the non-aligned group, cannot be accused of not having explored all channels for a peaceful settlement of the political issues in southern Africa. The Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  and the Dar es Salaam Declaration both of which the racists spurned with impunity when they believed they were invincible, speak for themselves. Now that the Vorster regime has realized that their sense of security was but an illusion, several conspiracies are being hatched, aimed at continuing to deprive the oppressed people in South Africa, of their inalienable rights. The first of these conspiracies, the now infamous dialog, has been exposed for what it is-a mere time-buying device! Kenya rejected and continues to reject the idea of having a dialog with the South African racists. In our view, to do so is not only to give respectability to the regime, but is in fact equivalent to selling the interests of the oppressed people. We find it quite unacceptable to dine and wine with the racists when they are brutally continuing to murder and oppress our brothers and sisters in South Africa. We have stated before and we would like to reiterate it again; the security of the white population in Azania does not lie in the assurances given to them by outsiders. If Vorster and his friends truly desire peace in Azania, they must enter into negotiations without delay with the authentic representatives of the Africans and the other non-whites in South Africa.\n12.\tThe second conspiracy is the policy of establishing \\\"bantustans\\\". The racists have the audacity to tell the world that this policy is aimed at inculcating a sense of pride in the various communities that live in South Africa. This is adding insult to the injury already experienced by the oppressed masses of South Africa. What civil pride can there be in continuing to be robbed of land and other rights in any part of the country of your birth? The white supremacists are using this device for two main purposes. First, to divide the African majority who, as a united force, are posing a serious threat to the privileged position of the racists. Secondly, once weakened by divisions, the \\\"bantustans\\\" will constitute a further continuing and useful source of cheap labor.\n13.\tWe reject the policy and the pseudo-independence that is supposed to go with it. Towards the implementation of our rejection of the policy, Kenya will not recognize the so-called independence that will be \\\"granted\\\" to Transkei this month. We are encouraged to see that many other States, even outside the non-aligned group, have also rejected this illusory conspiracy of South Africa. We in Kenya have known South Africa as one country and we shall continue to recognize it as one country that will soon be under black African majority rule.\n14.\tThe South African racist regime continues to occupy and colonize Namibia in defiance of the United Nations and international opinion. This is intolerable. The illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is rendered even more intolerable by the racists' imposition on Namibia of the abhorrent apartheid system with its essential complement, namely the policy of \\\"bantustans\\\". The illegal occupation, and the imposition of the foregoing policies on Namibia is a violation of the fundamental rights of the Namibian people and deprives them of their inalienable right to self-determination.\n15.\tSouth Africa must quit Namibia. It must abide by the United Nations resolutions and hand over power to the Namibian people. The delaying tactics employed by South Africa in convening the so-called constitutional' talks of hand-picked ethnic delegates must be rejected by us all. The Windhoek Conference was an illegal conference, organized by an illegal occupying force. South Africa must recognize the authentic representatives of the Namibian people- the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]- and enter into negotiations with them, under the auspices of the United Nations, with a view to convening a proper constitutional conference that will lead Namibia to independence. South Africa must free Namibian political prisoners and remove their troops and bases from Namibian soil.\n16.\tCondemnation of the illegal occupation of Namibia is no longer enough. We have done so for a long time. What is needed is action to dislodge the illegal regime from that African Territory. Should South Africa refuse to comply with the request to convene a proper constitutional conference under the supervision of the United Nations, economic and other measures of compulsion must be taken to oblige South Africa to comply with the decisions of the international community, in the opinion of my delegation, it is high time the United Nations considered sending a buffer force to Namibia to protect the interests of the Africans as well as to assert the United Nations resolve to free the Territory. We call on all States to effect a complete embargo on the sale, gift or transfer of arms and of all other forms of military equipment to South Africa. We also request all countries to put the respect for human dignity above short-term economic interests and cut their economic ties with South Africa as long as she continues to defy the United Nations and occupy Namibia illegally.\n17.\tI would like to take this opportunity to place on record my delegation's appreciation of the good work done by the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia, Mr. Sean MacBride. He has been a dedicated servant of the Commission, and in our view, has carried out the mandate bestowed on him by the General Assembly, namely, preparing Namibia for independence. We would like, through you, Mr. President, to convey our thanks to him.\n18.\tWe are now witnessing the final blow administered to the bastion of racism by the liberation movements in Zimbabwe. The rebel, Ian Smith, has taxed for a long time the patience of Africans. He has engaged himself in delaying maneuvers, as well as outright deceit to keep the rebellion going, always hoping for international recognition.\n19.\tKenya stated on many occasions that there was no justifiable reason to talk to a rebel. The only language that a rebel understands is force. We urged the British Government that had been, and continues to be, the legal administering Power to take appropriate measures to remove the rebel from its colony. We were told repeatedly that the administering Power was in no position to use force on Ian Smith and his group. The Africans had, therefore, no alternative but to take the responsibility for ridding themselves of this scourge. We have now witnessed victory after victory by the liberation movements. The Smith clique know that defeat is not far off, but they intend to cling to power as long as possible, regardless.\n20.\tSmith has now stated he is prepared to accept majority rule. While this, on the face of it, appears to be a definite and positive development, Kenya will not be deceived by his utterances and will continue to press for immediate independence with African majority rule, on the basis of the principle \\\"one man, one vote\\\". What the rebel, Ian Smith, has stated is new in that there appears to be capitulation, but there are many drawbacks in the supposed plan. It is a plan that aims at continued racial subjugation of the black people, and a possible prolongation of the interim period, and this cannot be accepted by Africa.\n21.\tIn the view of my Government, the first requisite to rapid restoration of peace in the rebel colony is the immediate removal of Ian Smith himself, and the replacement of the white chairman of the Council of State by a black chairman, with Africans forming a majority in the Council. We also consider the period of two years as unacceptably long. Kenya had an interim period of only six months between self-government and independence, and we deem this same period to be sufficient for Zimbabwe.\n22.\tWe have noted that the rebel Smith has placed premium on the success of his proposal on the cessation of the armed struggle by the liberation movements. This is not the first time that he has used this device in order to buy time to strengthen his armed forces. We have to take cognizance of the fact that, in his proposal, he has reserved the portfolio of defense for the hands of the white supremacists. This strengthens our belief that he wishes to use the time when the freedom fighters have laid down their arms to entrench himself and his clique firmly in power. Kenya, therefore, will continue to support armed struggle to go hand in hand with negotiations until the objective of independence and majority rule is achieved. What is wrong with having an African as minister for defense, and law and order, if Smith now genuinely agrees to majority rule as he says?\n23. We have noted that part of the package deal is a promise for financial and economic assistance to the beleaguered colony. While we support this, we must emphasize that it must not be used to blackmail an African-majority government or an independent Zimbabwe, nor should it be used to cripple the young State through the burden of heavy debt-servicing arising out of the plan.\n24.\tAs I stated earlier, southern Africa constitutes the main area where international peace and security is jeopardized. We have witnessed a growing tendency towards big Power rivalry in the subregion. Kenya would like big Power rivalry to be kept out of that subregion, indeed, out of the whole of Africa. What we need in the region is a genuine support by all States, aimed at bringing to an end apartheid, discrimination and the oppression and denial of human rights. Above all, we want freedom for all the peoples in the region to freely determine their future.\n25.\tSouthern Africa is not the only area in Africa still under colonial domination. There are two Territories, namely Djibouti and Mayotte, that are still under French colonial rule.\n26.\tWith regard to Djibouti, my delegation has noted with satisfaction the intentions of the French Government to grant independence to that Territory within the coming year. What is incumbent upon us all now is to assist the people of this Territory to move to independence as one nation. We call on all the States to recognize the territorial integrity of Djibouti and to do nothing that will endanger this. To this end, we recommend that no independent State in Africa should have any claim to any part of this Territory.\n27.\tThe continued occupation of the island of Mayotte by France constitutes a flagrant violation of the rights of an independent African State, that of the republic of the Comoros. As long as France continues to defy world opinion on this matter, the issue will continue to be a bone of contention between France and the independent States of Africa. Kenya, indeed the whole of the continent of Africa, will continue to give aid to the Comoro people until the island of Mayotte is liberated.\n28.\tThe plight of the people of South West Sahara needs our attention too. In the view of my delegation, the people of this region have a right to self-determination. They should, in accordance with resolutions of the Organization of African Unity fOAUJ and the United Nations be allowed to choose a Government of their own representatives without any interference from outside.\n29.\tThe Middle East continues to be a region fraught with all the elements of danger to international peace and security. While the state of no peace, no war continues, the dangerous signs for international peace and security are manifested through the tragic events that are taking place in Lebanon. The heavy daily loss of life and property in that unhappy country is a reminder to us all that there is an urgent need to resolve the political issues of the Middle East. The international community cannot any longer sit and wait for another holocaust because of indecision.\n30.\tKenya has stated on many occasions that peace will not prevail in the Middle East until the rights of the Palestinian people are recognized and implemented. Those rights include the right of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own. A whole nation of people cannot continue to live in exile, depending on charity from other people. It is not right to consider their problems only in the humanitarian context. Theirs is a political issue and must be solved through political decisions. .\n31.\tAs we have stated, Kenya feels that we should not wait for another outbreak of war to call for a peace conference. We urge the reconvening of the Geneva peace talks, where all the parties concerned, including the Palestinians, will be represented, to discuss all the political and other issues afflicting the area.\n32.\tFinally, we urge Israel to implement the decisions of this Organization and to return to the Arabs all the land it occupies as a result of force of arms. We cannot stress too strongly the dangers of flouting the United Nations in such an important and fundamental international principle, namely, the inadmissibility of acquiring territory by use of force of arms. To allow this to continue will encourage belligerency with its resultant outcome-a threat to inter-national peace and security.\n33.\tThe tragedy afflicting Cyprus, a founder member of the non-aligned movement, deserves our immediate attention. Kenya has always called and will continue to call for respect and recognition of the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. We urge the Cyprus people, with whom we have very cordial relations, to bury their sectional interests for the benefit of the whole people of Cyprus. We encourage them to continue with their discussions, and call upon all external forces to cease interfering with the internal affairs of Cyprus.\n34.\tMuch has been said about the need to reduce the armaments race, with apparently no effect on those who manufacture these means of mass destruction. While the poorer nations continue to experience economic difficulties as a result of lack of funds, the industrialized nations continue to pour billions of dollars into an industry that benefits no one but only acts as an instrument of intimidation. The arms race is not only a threat to international peace, but is also a clear violation of the ideals of this Organization. If our Organization was founded in order to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, why are we rushing so blindly into another catastrophe?\n35.\tKenya believes in living in peace with its neighbors. We urge that the major manufacturers of arms consider diverting the money they use for producing arms to the economic needs of mankind. We believe that, when States are not pressed by mere basic daily needs, they will have a better opportunity to devote their attention and energy to the pursuit of peace and happiness.\n36.\tKenya is greatly alarmed at the increasing pace of major-Power rivalry in the Indian Ocean. We have witnessed in the past few years a building up of the naval presence of the major Powers as well as the actual construction of bases. All the coastal States in that region have stated again and again that they desire to develop their countries without intimidation by the presence of the military might of the super-Powers. We have made a solemn declaration that we would like the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace. We therefore call upon all States to respect this solemn declaration.. We do so because we are convinced that the continued existence of the rivalry of the major Powers in the region constitutes, in our view, a threat to international peace and security and will, no doubt, also be a threat to the territorial integrity of the littoral States, of which Kenya is one.\n37.\tMy delegation would welcome a conference of all interested parties whose aim would be to free the Indian Ocean from the possibility of super-Power confrontation.\n38.\tLet me now turn to another issue to which my delegation attaches utmost importance. I refer here to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has just concluded its fifth session in New York on 17 September 1976. The Kenya delegation is fully aware and appreciative of the tremendous amount of work that has been done so far under your very able guidance, Mr. President. My Government is, however, seriously concerned that, despite all the efforts so far exerted, it has not been possible to arrive at a generally acceptable convention. While we appreciate the immense difficulties that have to be surmounted before a broad consensus on the outstanding issues can be achieved, Kenya cannot afford an interminable conference which entails an unacceptable burden of financial and manpower requirements.\n39.\tWe, therefore, request those delegations who have continued to adhere to rigid positions, to rise to their responsibilities, so that this conference, on which the international community has placed so much hope, can come to a successful conclusion.\n40.\tAlready a broad outline of a generally acceptable treaty has merged in some areas. It is gratifying to note that the concept of an exclusive economic zone, representing a compromise between the approach of a territorial sea consisting of 200 nautical miles and the traditional approach of maritime Powers that the area beyond the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea is the high seas with all the so-called \\\"freedom of seas\\\" idea, has now been accepted. Detailed elaboration of this concept, which fully guarantees the freedom of navigation and overflight, have almost been completed. Unfortunately, some major maritime Powers have obstructed final agreement on this process of elaboration by their insistence that the exclusive economic zone constitutes part of the high seas, other than for resources of the area. As a compromise concept, we continue to propose that the exclusive economic zone is neither territorial sea, nor high seas, but a zone sui generis.\n41.\tKenya appeals to all countries, especially the maritime Powers, to accept the realities of the exclusive economic zone and to work in close consultation with the coastal States in matters of scientific research and other activities not specifically authorized in the treaty. The coastal State must also be granted adequate powers within the 200-mile zone to control, abate and prevent pollution which, with the emergence of super-tankers, can cause untold damage to the marine environment and result in immense economic dislocation for any coastal State. The progress achieved in this field so far is encouraging, but more effort still remains necessary to arrive at adequate provisions.\n42.\tThe greatest concern to my delegation, however, is with respect to the deadlock that has arisen in the formulation of a regime and a machinery to regulate the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Kenya believes that a solution can be found by correctly reflecting the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), adopted without objection in 1970, which declared that area and its resources to be the common heritage of mankind. A system of exploitation which only pays lip service to this concept of the common heritage of mankind, while restricting effective exploitation to the developing countries with the necessary capital and technology, is unlikely to receive general acceptance. Realistic solutions should be found which will ensure that the machinery to be established, in particular the proposed enterprise, will be effective tools to ensure that the immense wealth of the deep sea-bed as the common heritage of mankind will benefit all nations, particularly the developing countries, and shall not serve to widen further the economic gap between the developed and developing countries. The Kenya delegation will remain open-minded to any proposals to arrive at equitable and just solutions to all outstanding difficulties. We expect all other delegations to approach these issues in the same spirit so as to achieve a speedy conclusion of the Conference, resulting in a generally acceptable convention. Kenya will, however, not accept the misuse of the rules of procedure, and in particular the use of the so-called consensus rule as a veto to prolong this important Conference indefinitely.\n43.\tKenya attaches great importance to the work done by the United Nations in the field of environment and general improvement of the quality of life. We have noted with satisfaction that within the short time that the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has been in existence, it has embarked on practical projects and assisted Member States in tackling their environmental problems. This is indeed a most welcome aspect of co-operation between the United Nations system and Member States.\n44.\tThis year the United Nations is focusing its attention on the needs of Habitat. As we stated in the Vancouver Conference,  this is most appropriate. The world population is increasing each year. Industrialization is encouraging the concentration of people in smaller areas with the result that slums are increasing in the world. My Government will give all support to the United Nations in the field of urban planning and rural development. We are particularly encouraged to see that the United Nations is not going to confine itself to the problems of urban slums, but will also deal with the needs of the rural areas where more than 90 per cent of our people live.\n45.\tI could not end these remarks without expressing my Government's satisfaction in the manner in which UNEP has taken root in my country. We feel greatly honored that this great institution of the United Nations is located in our country, and we shall do all that we can to see that its work is successful. We must not forget that much of its success has depended on officers who serve it, in particular those who were entrusted with the task of leading it. My Government would like to place on record its appreciation for the magnificent job done by its first Executive Director- Mr. Maurice Strong and his successor, Mr. Mostafa Tolba, who has shouldered the responsibility with energy and foresight. The Kenya Government will continue to give full support to his effort to ensure that the first United Nations body in a developing country will effectively and successfully discharge its responsibility to Member States.\n46.\tKenya has followed with great interest the work-that is being done in reconstructing the United Nations system. We are convinced that there is room for improvement, but we would like to emphasize that, whatever we do, we must at all times place the interest of the Organization first. The move should be towards making the system more appropriate to the needs and aspirations of Member States.\n47.\tOne area that Kenya feels needs urgent consideration in the reviewing of the Charter is the power of the veto. The world political and economic balances, basis and priorities have shifted since the United Nations was established. The membership of the Organization has increased more than twofold and with it the demands on this august Organization. The Kenya delegation is therefore of the opinion that the distribution and the powers of the veto should also be reviewed to reflect the changed world situation.\n48.\tAllow me now to turn to some other issues which my delegation feels are of equal importance to the ones already enumerated. The principles which will govern our future international economic relationships have already been established. This was done at both the sixth and seventh special sessions, after the realities of our interdependence had finally convinced the world community that the time for smooth expressions of international economic solidarity was definitely over; words had to give way to tangible expressions of this co-operation. Hence, the adoption by the General Assembly of both a Declaration and a Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S- VI) and 3202 (S-VIj] based on equity, justice, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interests and co-operation among all States. We are now firmly in the implementation stage of these noble objectives.\n49.\tIt was with this expectation that the Government of Kenya had awaited eagerly for the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], which, if I might be permitted to add, my country had the honor and privilege to host on behalf of the African region. The constructive spirit and the favorable climate which had prevailed towards the end of the 1975 seventh special session of the United Nations General Assembly had engendered great hopes in the peoples of the developing countries especially. The successful conclusions of the special sessions had, in fact, led us to believe that there did now at last exist an opportunity for the international community to concretize issues which had been the subject of discussions and confrontations for over two decades.\n50.\tWhile noting the ground work that was covered at Nairobi, my delegation would be less than candid if it did not express its honest disappointment with the limited nature of the outcome of the fourth session of UNCTAD. The failure of the session to make the expected breakthrough, especially in the fields of international trade, debt problems, the transfer of financial resources and the reform of the international monetary system, left the developing countries far from satisfied with the pace at which our negotiations were proceeding. Our economies are in fact declining to unacceptable levels when each day passes without action in these critical fields. The international community should not expect the developing countries to acquiesce in the prolongation of an international economic system which is by itself the greatest constraint on our development. The economic predicament which my country finds itself in at present is deep-seated and of such a complex and inherently international dimension that my Government is firmly convinced of the immediate necessity of implementing new concepts, new options and an entirely new range of international economic ground rules to govern our future international economic relationships.\n51.\tHow can we, for instance, pay for our imports when from time to time the uncertainties and fluctuating nature of the international monetary system continues to play havoc with our balance of payments? How can we improve the lot of our people when our exports-our principle engine for growth-are perpetually in a disadvantaged position in international commodity markets? How can food production be increased when the prices of strategic inputs such as fertilizers and agricultural machinery are continuously being raised by the exporters? And to what extent can we maintain a reasonable rate of industrialization when we have to contend continuously with staggering price increases for practically all the capital inputs that we need?\n52.\tThis is the problem, and any effort to blur its focus or to assure the world community that no crisis exists and that no consequential extraordinary new measures are required is to engage in self-deception. Benefits will have to be more broadly distributed if justice is to be served and potential violent confrontations avoided. The world's wealth cannot be allowed to continue to flow just to a limited and privileged few. The immediate establishment of an inter-national economic system which will promote, rather than obstruct, the economic emancipation of the peoples of the developing countries should continue to occupy the priority attention of the international community, for it is still our firm contention that hunger, poverty, economic deprivation and deliberate exploitation can never form a solid base for either international understanding or international peace and stability.\n53.\tPeace cannot be maintained in a world where one third of the population lives in economic splendor while the other two thirds continues to wallow in the vicious grip of economic squalor, misery and human degradation. In promoting the establishment of a new international economic order, the United Nations system has embarked on a noble task whose objectives are manifestly enshrined in the very ideals and objectives of the United Nations Charter. As Member States solemnly pledged to those ideals and objectives, each Member State has a role which it can and must now play. It is imperative that we make a positive effort to perceive our interdependence and common dependency in a more comprehensive and enlightened perspective, for it is only out of such a perception that meaningful recommendations and action-oriented programs can be evolved, quickly agreed upon and implemented. For our part, we in the developing countries do recognize that the road to a fair deal between us and the developed world may be difficult, and perhaps even long. Our determination is, however, resolute; we are prepared to walk the.distance. The Government of Kenya will not be found wanting either in the battle for the needs of our people or in the search for a stable and just international economic co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly is a reflection of your personal merit and of the honorable place your country, Sri Lanka, occupies in the international community. It is no accident that your Prime Minister, Mrs. S. Bandaranaike, is the current Chairman of the non-aligned movement. Prior to your entering the foreign service of your country in 1963, you served with distinction in your country's civil service, rising to the rank of Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance. At the United Nations, you have acquired an enviable reputation for your acute intelligence, for your mastery of the English language, for your eloquence, your personal charm and your outspokenness. Our two countries, Sri Lanka and Singapore, have very close bonds based on a very long association of history and peoples, some of whom emigrated to Singapore and have become Singaporeans. It therefore gives me great pleasure to congratulate you and to wish you a very successful tenure as our President.\n97.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly witnessed some very controversial debates and decisions. We must all be thankful to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who presided over our proceedings with admirable calm and fairness.\n98.\tThe Secretary-General's job has often been described as the most impossible job in the world. We are fortunate to have Mr. Kurt Waldheim as our Secretary-General because he has faced the endless stream of problems and challenges posed to him with fortitude and with a judicious mixture of realism and idealism. I would like to single out for special mention the competent manner in which he has managed the United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East and in Cyprus. We should also thank him for his efforts to bring about an accommodation between the two communities in Cyprus and encourage him to persist in his efforts in spite of the disappointing results.\n99.\tI should like to greet our newest Member, the Republic of Seychelles, and to extend to its people and Government our best wishes for peace and prosperity.\n100.\tA global problem which has come increasingly to dominate the work of the General Assembly is disarmament. This is one sixth of the agenda, and no other subject or question has as many items on the agenda. Our Secretary-General has repeatedly called our attention to this problem. The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, in his farewell address to the Assembly [1st meeting] gave prominent place to the question of disarmament, and in your presidential address, Six, [ibid] you also referred to the problem of disarmament and even suggested the possibility of holding either a special session of the General Assembly to consider the question of the convening of a World, Disarmament Conference.\n101.\tThere is no denying that the relentless arms race in which all of us are participants is alarming. It poses a threat to the very survival of man on this planet and a constant challenge to our rationality. The arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons which the States Members of this Organization have accumulated are sufficient to annihilate mankind several times over, and yet they are being constantly augmented.\n102.\tThe amounts of financial resources expended by countries, rich and poor alike, for the acquisition of arms are astronomical. It has been estimated that in 1974, the last full year for which data are available, actual arms expenditure totaled well over $300 billion. In the 10-year period 1964 to 1974 the world's arms expenditure doubled. The two super-Powers alone account for 60 per cent of the world's total arms expenditure. The five permanent members of the Security Council together account for 70 per cent.\n103.\tOne consequence of this massive accumulation of weapons is the proliferation of armed conflicts, almost all of which are in the third world. In the period 1945 to 1975, it has been estimated that a total of 119 wars of a civil and international character occurred. Those 119 wars were fought by 81 States in the territories of 69 countries -that is, nearly half the membership of this Organization. More people were killed in those wars since 1945 than during the Second World War. Indeed, since September 1945 there was not a single day in which one or several wars were not being fought. On an average day about 12 wars are under way.\n104.\tIt would, however, be factually wrong were we to pretend that the problem of disarmament is a problem primarily of the two super-Powers or of the developed countries. Questions of war and peace should, in our opinion, be of greater concern to third-world countries because they have already become the battlefields of what could be described as the Third World War, for, in our view, a new world war will not be a single dramatic catastrophe but a cumulation of an interlocking series of proxy wars fought in third-world countries.\n105.\tTherefore, I would like to return to a thesis which I propounded in this Assembly five years ago at its twenty- sixth session. At that time the theme was somewhat tentative and, to some, possibly even tendentious. It was an expression more of probabilities than of actualities. But, unfortunately, what I then merely feared has now become real. A new threat confronts the third world.\n106.\tThis extract from my statement made at the twenty- sixth session summarizes my theme:\n\\\".. conflicts between big Powers are inevitable so long as the drive for power and dominance remains the overriding consideration in international relations. But they will be waged by means other than direct confrontation [between them].\n\\\"And the means are the small nations. Big wars can be and have been fought through small nations. The idea is not really new. In the past, small nations have been pitted against one another to further the interests of great Powers. But today the technique of wars with small nations as proxies has been more systematically developed. Small wars have in the nuclear age become the only safe method of conducting big-Power conflicts. That is why... small wars are ... gradually increasing [in number]; that is why the third world is the scene of\ngrowing violence...Textbooks on military strategy\nrefer to this as the strategy of fighting limited wars\tIt\nalso includes the promotion of wars of national liberation, support for guerrilla uprisings, subversion and the engineering of coups in small countries.\n\\\"\tThe small nations are more than ever before\nnecessary instruments for big-Power conflicts-the only available instruments .. .\\\".\nThat was what I said five years ago.\n107.\tFive years ago it could have been said that this was mere hypothesis. It may have been so then, but it is no longer the case today. Violence and wars in third-world countries have increased, while rumbles of new conflicts can be plainly heard. Cities and countrysides are being laid waste at this very moment-not by the invading armies of great Powers, but by contending forces within the third world.\n108.\tThere are a number of draft resolutions for consideration in this Assembly which, stripped of their diplomatic phraseology, pertain in one way or another to conflicts between developing countries. Just as once before in years past small nations had to scrutinize carefully draft resolutions by the big Powers to avoid becoming partisans in their conflicts, so today we search draft resolutions to avoid entanglements in disputes between friends. However, benevolent neutrality becomes increasingly difficult as draft resolutions, in response to sharpening bitterness, are worded with a precision and openness that preclude neutrality. Abstention, where it injures one party, is not now accepted as evidence of impartiality and friendliness.\n109.\tAnd so one consequence of this is the new practice by this Assembly of voting for draft resolutions which are contradictory and irreconcilable because we do not want to offend our friends, and we cannot judge what is right and what is wrong.\n110.\tMore alarming evidence of increasing third-world conflicts is the flow of arms from some half-a-dozen wealthy, industrialized countries into the third world. There has been a steady increase in the flow of arms from developed to developing countries over the years. There was nothing disturbing about the initial flow of arms. It was natural that as States became independent they should acquire arms commensurate with their defense requirements. But since 1970 the flow has acquired tidal proportions, and with each passing year the appetite for arms in the third world has grown alarmingly. The quantity and quality of arms exceed normal defense requirements.\n111.\tReliable statistics on the arms trade are, for obvious reasons, difficult to come by. It is by nature a furtive trade, and both client and arms dealer are prone to give a lot of misinformation about this most profitable business. In fact, only the United States, of the four major arms-exporting countries, provides information about its transactions. So such figures as I will quote about the transfer of deadly weapons to less-developed countries probably err on the side of underestimation. But even with these reservations, such statistics as are available portend, in my view, not only catastrophic dangers for the third world but also a very high probability of a new kind of enslavement of the third world through proliferation of what I called proxy wars. This is not enslavement designed and directed by advanced industrialized countries, but enslavement emerging as a consequence of divisions and conflicts within third-world countries.\n112.\tAnd there is a close correlation between the level of arms flow into third world countries and increasing contention among them. My primary source of information is the 1976 yearbook on world armaments and disarmament published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. \n113.\tAccording to that Yearbook, the value of major weapons transferred to third-world countries had increased 17-fold between the years 1950 and 1975. The figures were $US 294 million in 1950, but it increased to $US 4,803 million in 1975. Hie big surge forward in the import of arms was in 1974 and 1975, when the value of weapons transferred from developed to developing countries increased by more than 60 per cent. It is also worth noting that those were the years when the industrialized countries were reeling under the impact of increased oil prices and the third-world countries were making efforts to unite against the industrialized countries for a new international economic order.\n114.\tThe 1970 s were also the years when detente was arrived at between the great Powers on the sound grounds that direct confrontation between them would be mutually destructive.\n115.\tThis was also a period which saw a steady decline in aid from rich to poor countries. A recent study by the United Nations predicts that, on the basis of current flow, aid from rich to poor countries will be reduced to a mere trickle. For example, between 1961 and 1968 the global assistance development program was valued at $US 75.2 billion, the bulk of which came from the Western world. The flow of aid between 1974 and 1976 will decline to an annual average of between $US 14 billion and $US 12 billion, which, given the present level of inflation, is meager compared with what was available in the 1960 s.\n116.\tThough the flow of aid has declined, the flow of arms to the third world has swelled dangerously. The third world is clearly creeping towards a more equitable share of the arms resources of the world. For example, the consumption of total arms production by the two main power blocs has dropped from 91 per cent in 1955 to a more prudent 78 per cent in 1975.\n117.\tAs against this, consumption of arms by the third world has shot up from a modest 3.2 per cent in 1955 to an alarming 123 per cent in 1975. Presumably this does not take into account the unofficial flow of weapons sold or given under the counter. In fact, the third world's consumption of the world's arms output now exceeds the combined purchases of China, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; their share of the world's arms output in 1975 was only 9.5 per cent as compared with the third world's 12.3 per cent.\n118.\tCertain disturbing inferences can be drawn from these statistics. One of these is that the level of arms consumption is an indicator of the intensity of tensions in an area and of its prevailing political philosophies, policies and anxieties in an area.\n119.\tThe rich industrial nations, largely in the north, have in practice accepted that force is of less importance in their inter-State relations than other forms of power. They rely more and more on economic power, technological superiority and organizational skills for influence and dominance over other nations. It is a fact that the nations of the north have technically been at peace with one another since the end of the Second World War. True, some of them have fought in third-world countries, but even this is being abandoned as counter-productive.\n120.\tShort of some grave miscalculation on the part of the industrialized nations, I see no prospect of serious wars in the north. The devastation and tragedies brought about by two world wars, coupled with the knowledge that the industrial Powers now have the technology to destroy themselves utterly in another war, act as effective curbs on resort to naked force.\n121.\tBut it would appear that in the third world the errors and tragedies of European nationalism are being reproduced. In the absence of economic power or advanced technology, force is used, when necessary, to regulate inter-State relations. Reliance is placed on force and the show of force to gain influence and dominance over other nations.\n122.\tHowever, it is borrowed force, and therein lies the danger to third-world countries. The accumulation of effective force in this day and age depends on very sophisticated and very expensive weapons produced, at the moment, by less than half a dozen industrial nations in the north. In the past, the sale of arms to third-world countries from the advanced countries was governed by some sort of gentleman's agreement between industrial countries. The flow was always regulated to modest proportions. What was sold, moreover, were hand-me-downs, simple and unsophisticated weapons for which the industrial nations had not much use and which, by current standards, were less destructive.\n123. But the current flow of weapons is of a different category altogether. The gentleman's agreement has broken down. Far from there being any inhibition about selling arms to the third world, arms dealers of the industrialized countries are pushing their hardware with great zest and fervor. There is now a growing clamor in industrialized countries -including those who had kept out the arms business out of moral or political considerations-to remove existing restraints on the export of arms. As the Swedish Yearbook quite correctly observes:\n\\\"Indeed, so hectic has been the international market for arms over the past two years that all appearances of control, whether supposed or real, have vanished.\\\" \n124.\tThere are depressingly sound economic and political reasons for this changed attitude in regard to arms sales to developing countries. First let me deal with the economic reasons. The arms industry has for many years been an important and growing industry. The annual output of arms throughout the world is estimated at over $US 300 billion. It employs some 400,000 scientists and engineers and other experts who spend some $US 200 billion in research on more deadly weapons. It is a growing industry. The capacity of the rich nations to absorb the products of this industry, especially as war between them is least likely now, has reached saturation point. As research progresses, weapons become obsolete at a more rapid rate. Astronomically expensive weapon systems suddenly become so much junk.\n125.\tThe increase in the number of rival States in the third world, or, more generally, the increase in mutual suspicion and fear among third-world countries, offers a neat solution to the junk problem facing the arms producers. These obsolete weapons, generally one or two generations behind the latest model, can be and are being disposed of in third-world countries.\n126.\tIt also solves yet another problem for the industrialized countries. It ensures a steady flow from less developed to developed countries of wealth, which was and is in danger of being reduced as a consequence of decolonization and the growing economic self-assertion of the developing countries. Modern arms are spectacularly expensive and more so if they are packaged as a weapons system. Moreover, in contrast to the situation in other industries, the greater the number of arms sold, even greater grows the demand for those arms. There is no such thing as over-production in the arms industry. This has to do with human fear. Once an up-to-date weapons system has been sold to a client, the reassuring feeling the client has can only be temporary. The anxiety returns the moment an even more up-to-date weapons system has been delivered to his rival by the same arms dealer or by his competitor. Having once embarked on the arms race, the participant has no choice but to stay in the race until he concedes defeat or is ruined. If he decides to stay in the race, he must keep on from time to time disposing of his obsolete weapons system and negotiating for one more up to date and decidedly more expensive.\n127.\tIf ever arms-producing countries should form a mutual-aid association to regulate and promote their trade, then the third-world countries would certainly become captives of the great Powers. The dealers could decide -either by a gentleman's agreement or otherwise-when a client's weapons system should become obsolete by simply selling a more up-to-date version to his rival or even by hinting, whether justifiably or not, that the other side was negotiating for an improved weapons system. I am not saying that this is being done at the moment, but the possibilities are there, especially if the weapons industry should run into economic difficulties.\n128.\tSo much for the economic advantages to industrial countries accruing through weapons sales to developing countries.\n129.\tHowever, the most dangerous consequences are political. The flow of arms carries with it a measure of dependency on the part of the client on the seller of arms not unlike that prevailing under the old imperial system. The weapons now being imported are not only highly sophisticated but also packaged as parts of a very complex, very comprehensive and very expensive weapons system. When a country buys a weapons system it imports not only weapons but a whole army of experts and advisers. Arms contracts today include provisions for-training, technical support and the establishment of facilities to maintain and repair equipment. Often those contracts include provisions for foreign experts to build roads, communication networks and other facilities which come under the term \\\"infrastructure\\\". For without such an infrastructure the performance of the system is likely to be substandard or to fail altogether. There must also be an assurance from the seller of spare parts and replacements when needed, as it is not economic to stock spare parts for the lifetime of the equipment.\n130.\tAll this is ideal for the direction and conduct of proxy wars. The client can start wars but he needs the co-operation and goodwill of the dealer to ensure that the operation does not end in total disaster. Once a war is begun or engineered, it is the dealer and not the client who becomes the crucial element. Ware between developing countries can be sustained or halted by the dealer. They can be halted by the dealer's withdrawing his experts and withholding spare parts and replacements; or the dealer can sustain and direct the war if he thinks it Is in his interest to do so.\n131.\tOf course, the client can dismiss the dealer, but only by putting himself into possible bondage to another arms supplier.\n132.\tThat, then, is the dangerous situation in which the third world finds itself today. I have merely stated the nature of the problem without offering possible solutions to it because that would require an address just as lengthy. My purpose is simply to alert us to this clanger; to accept that the danger is real, even though it may not be as stark as I have presented it.\n133.\tThe compulsions behind the third-world arms race are many and complex; undoubtedly, manipulation by great Powers contributes to it. Also, confrontation with neighbors is a time-honored way of distracting attention from the short-comings of a ruling class and of re-establishing the national solidarity once forged when the enemy was the alien imperialist whom we have driven out. To those, add recollections of ancient glories and new broodings over real or imaginary wrongs predating the imperialist era.\n134.\tFurther, in some third-world countries a Messianic spirit appears to be emerging. The successful liberation of their own people from imperialism has led some leaders to see themselves as chosen vehicles for the liberation of all mankind and, in particular, their neighbors, whose independence has been recognized by this Organization. It is saddening to hear formerly subjugated countries, like the imperialists of old whom they displaced, proclaiming their right and responsibility to bring \\\"true\\\" liberation and independence to lesser breeds outside their borders.\n135.\tIt is the suspicion and fear generated by Messianic proclamations such as those which are driving many third-world countries into the arms of the arms dealers and thereby creating the necessary conditions for proxy wars, for the enslavement of the third world.\n136.\tIf that enslavement is to be avoided, it is imperative that third-world countries stop saying and doing things that increase mutual distrust and fear among themselves. If we do not fear one another then there is no need for us to put ourselves in bondage to arms dealers.\n137.\tIn my part of the world, the five countries which have grouped themselves into the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] have succeeded in dissipating fear and distrust among themselves. There are possibly differences of views and conflicts of interest from time to time, but through ASEAN co-operation we have been able to resolve, or at least to contain, those differences and conflicts. We are discovering that, when nations set greater store by seeking out areas of agreement than areas of disagreement fear and distrust are likely to fade away.\n138.\tConcepts of co-operation and not concepts of liberating one another should govern relations between third- world countries. Co-operation means the pooling of re-sources, skills and aspirations to enhance further our independence and bargaining position against the more advanced nations.\n139.\tThe liberation of others, on the other hand, can be undertaken only by pawning our resources, our lives and, eventually, our integrity to those on whom we depend for our arms and who will make quite sure that when the slaughter and the battles are over it is they, not we, who emerge victorious.\n140.\tI shall sum up my thesis in the following way. The massive flow of arms to the third world confronts it with a new danger. It is, first of all, a drain on the economies of the third-world countries; but even more important is the fact that it creates a new form of dependence on the great Powers, which can exploit the third world's dependence on them for arms to manipulate them, to engineer conflicts between them, and to use them as their proxies in their competition for influence and dominance. This may partly account for the tremendous acceleration in the arms race, especially among countries of the third world. In order to check the arms race, we must understand why nations arm themselves in the first place. Some nations may arm themselves in order to increase their power, but most nations arm themselves because they feel insecure. Therefore, in order to promote disarmament, we must attack the problem of international insecurity.\n141.\tMy thesis is that in the present state of international relations the most effective way to promote international security is to work at the subregional and regional levels. For this reason my country would attach great importance to the efforts by countries in different parts of the world to promote regional economic co-operation and mutual trust. Wars are not made by arms, but they are conceived in the minds of men. To prevent wars we must therefore free the minds of men from the cobwebs of age-old suspicions, fears and mistrust.\n"

        "file_text": "We are loyal to the fundamental postulates of international law, one of which is the juridical equality of States, and thus we should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his well-deserved election to the office of President. His election is an acknowledgment of the tradition of culture and the devotion to peace of the country he represents. This election does honor to our world Organization and underlines the effectiveness of the principle of the equality of States, since it indicates that it is not necessary to possess great economic wealth to serve in a leadership role in the United Nations and its General Assembly.\n193.\tFor nations such as ours, which do not have abundant economic means, it is encouraging to see that within this Assembly high moral values are respected, because only by recognizing the true and transcendental value of the human person is it possible to foresee a bright future for mankind, which, unfortunately, is hesitantly groping along at the present time.\n194.\tWe should also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for his discretion and his effectiveness in guiding the debates of the last session of the General Assembly.\n195.\tWe also extend our praise to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, for the positive action he has taken during the period as is outlined in his report on the work of the Organization [A/31/1], which is before the Assembly.\n196.\tA new Member has come to swell the concert of nations gathered within the portals of this world Organization. We are extremely pleased to welcome the Republic of Seychelles, and at the same time we should like to express our admiration to the United Kingdom for its strict compliance with international law. By giving autonomy to the Seychelles, the United Kingdom has punctiliously applied the principle of the self-determination of peoples.\n197.\tWith due attention we have taken note of the report of the Secretary-General with regard to the maintenance of peace and international security, which constitutes one of the most outstanding duties of the international body, and is one of the fundamental concerns of exponents of the law of nations, both ancient and modern. Any weaknesses or imperfections attributable to the international legal order arise out of the conscious will of States which regulate their relations according to its tenets, for they have not wished to be compelled to abide by its precepts or to make them binding. Even the jurisdiction of the legal arm of the Organization depends upon the free will of the parties involved in any legal dispute, and the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter, which, because they refer to acts which constitute breaches of the peace, seem to be highly effective, in fact lack any threatening power. Despite this, hesitant steps have been taken, albeit with understandable caution, to make international law more effective, and the defects in the legal arm of the Organization can now be compensated for by the application of compulsory measures. This means that the factor of virtual coercion has made its appearance: its absence had been one of the many gaps inherent in international law. This more sophisticated thinking demonstrates the achievements which can be made when there exists a will to acknowledge that there are limitations to traditional concepts. Those concepts are not absolute, and it is to be hoped that States, the principal protagonists in the legal field, once they are convinced that coercion, even if only moral coercion, can be embodied in principles and resolutions, will co-operate so that international order may rise to even greater heights of perfection.\n198.\tThis degree of development will be possible only when it is generally held that any dispute can be settled by means of instruments in which the will of the parties is taken as the decisive positive factor. In other words, the effectiveness of a means of solution does not depend upon the technical or legal tool itself; rather, it flows from the willingness and concurrence of States to contribute to the success of the regulatory system.\n199.\tBut if, instead of contributing to the strengthening of the world body or of regional bodies, Powers are compelled to perfect the means of mass destruction, while law languishes from neglect and repudiation, we can see looming over the future the risk of a conflagration that would imperil the survival of civilization itself.\n200.\tFor those reasons, we believe that the detonation of atomic devices in the atmosphere, underground or under water should be prohibited by a treaty or by conscientious self-limitation on the part of States which possess such weapons. Explosions in the atmosphere pollute with their harmful gases elements which are essential for life, while explosions under water will destroy or make unusable species which inhabit vast areas within the range of radioactive fallout. Indeed, there is no general belief to the contrary. Moreover, experiments of this type can alter ecological conditions, and hence any test which would, intentionally or otherwise, modify the environment should be prohibited.\n201.\tIn this connexion, it would seem that the nations which have scarce resources and limited economic and war-making potential are the ones looking hopefully to juridical systems for the settlement of disputes. Honduras, through civilized channels, is in the process of solving its dispute with El Salvador, both countries having agreed to mediation, the recommendations of which would be respected by the parties. Such respect is necessary because, besides complying with the minimum requirements of ethics, it would open the way to a, bright future for two nations which, because of their identity of origin, should undertake joint enterprises.\n202.\tIf mediation fails to settle all issues, Honduras would be ready to take its case, in all goodwill, to any other body able to eliminate once and for all any basis of disagreement or lack of understanding, and would comply fully with any ruling, in the case of an arbitration or judicial procedure, both because of the nature of those means and because of the fact that it is the inherent factor of good faith which must underlie such agreements.\n203.\tWe are pleased to see proceeding the talks to end the existing dispute over Belize-a Central American region which, because of its historical and juridical links with the sister Republic of Guatemala, is foremost in the minds and spirit of justice of the peoples of the Isthmus. Because of everything Honduras and Guatemala have gone through together, Honduras trusts that this time the negotiations will lead to recognition of those rights which Guatemala is claiming.\n204.\tThere is also a recommendation before this Organization that the parties continue in their talks aimed at settling the status, of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Any time a dispute is settled, it can be said that no party loses because, in any case, what is feeing strengthened is the juridical order, and this in itself constitutes a guarantee for the preservation of peace and the harmonious coexistence of States. Hence we wish to take this occasion to express our optimism for the success of those direct negotiations which, with mutual understanding based on their long diplomatic tradition,, are to be undertaken by the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom, and we hope that those negotiations will culminate in a just settlement for Argentina.\n205.\tIn the same spirit of equanimity which inspires our international relations, we sincerely hope that the negotiations being carried out by the United States and Panama within the framework of mutual respect will yield positive benefits for both States and the recognition of their mutual rights.\n206.\tBut while some American countries are toying to solve their differences by peaceful means in other parts of the world burning passions unleashed by opposing factions are endangering international order, wasting hundreds of thousands of lives in a sterile holocaust, because on innumerable occasions the ideology of a prevailing regime has flouted basic rights and principles of human conscience, which are recognized by only one form of social interaction: the Western system of coexistence. It is to be hoped that these difficulties will cease so that civilization, which must face a future of limited physical potential, as indeed the world which surrounds us is limited, will be able to apply its energies and intelligence to meeting the needs' of the immediate future.\n207.\tDuring the course of this year, the fourth and fifth sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the law of the Sea have been held, presided over by the President of this Assembly. As is logical to suppose, it is not easy in a short time and on so controversial a subject to reach agreements that reconcile the interests and aspirations both of those States having vast economic potential and those which, for all their incipient development, still have the right to share in the benefits of wealth which belongs equally to all peoples of the world, as do the resources of the sea. Efforts are being made to establish a special tribunal for the settlement of disputes \\\"which may arise in this connexion. This proposal should be considered in all its ramifications, because if jurisdiction is fragmented by the creation of other legislative bodies we run the risk of weakening the authority of the International Court of Justice, which is the highest judicial body, par excellence, of this Organization. And even if that should not occur, there would be a fragmentation of jurispurdence, which is one of the principal sources of the law of nations. It might be better to consider systems for the joint exploitation of marine resources through the setting of quotas proportionate to the capabilities of States, so that their peoples, who must regard the sea as being the safeguard of the future, may be able to share in the benefits of this resource which is the common heritage of mankind.\n208.\tA concern which must be shared by all nations of the world derives from the Malthusian theory that the relentless rate of population growth will outstrip the rate of food production. Few States have rationally conserved their natural resources; others-the poorest-have frittered them away improvidently. But whatever precautions may be taken, it is certain that there is a growing shortage of food-stuffs, and in a few decades the squalor of hunger will overshadow many horizons, just as the scourge already exists as a living fact in many regions. That is why we must take collective measures to forestall that evil. Any contribution made to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will be small in relation to the dimensions of the problem, and the one relatively untapped reserve, the riches of the sea, must be protected so that it may feed the progeny of tomorrow.\n209.\tWith regard to the item on our agenda [item 80] which deals with freedom of information, I can announce with heartfelt satisfaction deriving from respect for a right of such magnitude, that the Government of my country is fully complying with a commitment which, besides being enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, corresponds to a guarantee rooted in the depths of the conscience. Therefore, this ethical imperative must be strictly observed so that no one, in this day and age, should be interfered with or persecuted for expressing his thoughts.\n210.\tAlthough it does not exist in our country, political terrorism is of great concern to the people of Honduras. The proliferation of such acts in recent years merits a thorough study of their causes, and drastic action on the part of States in which terrorists seek refuge, even though those who commit the transgression may be identified with the prevailing ideology of the particular country. The form of mass danger generally inherent in these acts of terrorism means that they must be considered as a flagrant crime against humanity.\n211.\tAlthough not of specific concern to our continent, apartheid does affect mankind as a whole. Hence we join our voice to the chorus of those calling for the elimination of the discriminatory practices of apartheid, An infraction of the most fundamental principles of social interrelations, apartheid cannot continue to exist in human society, where daily the essential moral values of man are being reaffirmed.\n212.\tThe contribution of the United Nations to forging peace has been great, and its efforts at maintaining collective security have been effective. But an Organization bom of a conflagration must adjust its machinery to the experience acquired over 30 years of existence. This is why Honduras has supported the efforts designed to carry out a new study of its statute: and those of its subsidiary bodies. There can be no doubt that grave and frequent infractions of the code of coexistence among States do indicate gaps and imperfections which could be overcome. The slowness with which infringements of national sovereignty are sometimes dealt with; the possibilities and the subtle untilization of the veto; the fact that some provisions, recommendations and resolutions are not compulsory; the limitation and neutralization of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice; and the fact that the Organization cannot take up facts or conflicts, however serious they may be, when they are being studied by other regional bodies, are all serious impediments to the effectiveness of the Charter and mean that the United Nations organs do not function as they should.\n213.\tAll this deserves a revision that would really be a proof of goodwill, taking into account the experience gained over 20 years. It would make it possible to strengthen the United Nations once again while maintaining its present organic and legal structure.\n214.\tOnce unswerving confidence has returned to the international sphere the new order will prevail in a collective life free of anguish and ensure a future free of catastrophe for man, who longs to follow a sunlit path brightened by the light of law, which, as Cicero said, frees us as we abide by its principles.\n215.\tThe tasks before this General Assembly at its thirty-first session are of great importance, and great are the hopes of the peoples whose trust is placed in this highest forum. We should like to express our desire that decisions may always be taken in furtherance of justice and man's dignity and we shall contribute as far as we can to this-so that within this body the law of nations will reach levels of excellence such that here may be heard the clearest voice of the conscience of mankind. \n"

        "file_text": "): It is gratifying for us all to be able to applaud the unanimous election of Mr. Amerasinghe as President of the General Assembly. His wide experience, his well-known qualities as a diplomat and his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations make his election an act of justice. It is, moreover, an expression of gratitude to the Government and people of Sri Lanka, which, under the guidance of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, play an active role in the forefront of the struggle of the non-aligned countries to build a new order in international relations based on independence and equality. It is especially gratifying to my delegation to congratulate him by virtue of the brotherly relations that exist between Cuba and Sri Lanka and the friendship that has characterized our relations with Mr. Amerasinghe in the course of a number of years' work in the United Nations.\n2.\tMay we extend our congratulations to the Government of the Republic of Seychelles, which has recently obtained independence and has become a new Member of the United Nations. Those two events represent a tribute to the world struggle against colonialism and demonstrate once again the inevitable nature of the process of decolonization at the world level.\n3.\tIn welcoming the admission of Seychelles we must voice our protest against the exclusion of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Those two States, which are members of the non-aligned movement and of its Co-ordinating Bureau, have become members of a number of international bodies and maintain normal relations with almost all the members of the international community. Their admission to the United Nations has the virtually unanimous support of countries of all regions and political and social systems. If Angola and Viet Nam are not among us today, this is due exclusively to the disgraceful, irresponsible and obstinate opposition of the Government of the United States of America, which appears to base its foreign policy on whim and arbitrariness.\n4.\tThe year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been characterized by advances and victories in.the struggles of peoples-against imperialism, colonialism and racism.\n5.\tDuring that stage, together with the achievements of the socialist countries and of the forces struggling for peace, we must note the historical victories of the people in Viet Nam, which was reunified under the banner of socialism; in Laos, where the Democratic People's Republic was established; and in Kampuchea. We also witnessed the success of the liberation movement in the former Portuguese colonies, especially the defeat of the South African racists in Angola, the positive consequences of which have given a decisive impetus to the struggle for liberation in southern Africa and the continuation of the process of detente in Europe.\n6.\tAll those achievements show a predominant trend in international relations in favor of the cause of peace, independence and progress. However, together with those encouraging factors, we continue to witness trends that could lead to war and aggression and the activities of those favoring the use of force in international relations continue to threaten the process of detente, which has not yet become irreversible and universal. It is not difficult to see that the forces of imperialism and reaction are still stubbornly intent on changing the course of events and repressing peoples in order to halt or deflect the processes of liberation, while attacking progressive Governments. We are living in a situation in which the progressive forces and those which seek to hold back the march of history are engaged in a decisive struggle and bloody confrontation. That antagonism is the characteristic feature of the present international situation. In order to consolidate peace and to obtain an order of relations in keeping with the principles and purposes of the Charter it is essential to maintain the united efforts of the socialists, the non-aligned and all other countries interested in the promotion of true international co-operation. That effort must be channeled along three levels at the same time: we must consolidate, extend and make irreversible international detente; we must achieve effective agreements on the road towards general and complete disarmament; we must adopt measures for the speedy and total elimination of colonialism and racism in all its forms and manifestations and for ensuring the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and promote the establishment of a new international economic order. The Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo last August, represents an important contribution to that universal endeavor. It served to ratify the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist orientation of the non-aligned movement and its decision to strengthen co-operation with other progressive and peace-loving States and forces.\n7.\tThe African scene, at the time of the opening of the current session of the General Assembly, has undergone radical changes. The heroic and consistent struggle of the liberation movements culminated in the downfall of Portuguese colonialism and the accession to independence of Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and Angola. The racist regimes in the southern part of Africa were cornered by the impetuous advance of the liberating process. Faced with that different situation, the imperialists, colonialists and racists conceived a new strategy which was more brutal, more aggressive, more subtle and insidious. On the one hand, they organized the most shameless military aggression against independent Angola, invaded its territory and committed every kind of crime, misdeed and outrage against its noble people. On the other hand, the diplomats and theoreticians of imperialism, disconcerted by the image of an Africa that was standing on its feet and firmly repulsing its oppressors, showed an unaccustomed interest in that continent and attempted, through demagogy, deceit and the manipulation of docile collaborators, to confuse their peoples and disseminate deceitful formulas for the \\\"solution\\\" of their serious problems, the object of which was to sow division among the anti-colonialist forces and to perpetuate the supremacy of racism in that continent.\n8.\tThey are still today continuing this two-faced game which combines flattery with the stick, the cleverness of their professors with the bayonets of their mercenaries. While Mr. Kissinger hurries off to a region of the world which he has only lately discovered, his colleagues in the Central Intelligence Agency and in the Pentagon continue to forge aggressive plans against the People's Republic of .Angola and are unflagging in their promotion of con-spiracies against the progressive States of Africa. While the United States Secretary of State talks with Mr. Vorster and Mr. Smith of magic formulas to perpetuate apartheid and white oppression under the guise of new clothes designed at the eleventh hour, the racists in Pretroia are massacring children in Soweto and the Salisbury troops are bombing the territory of Mozambique and destroying refugee camps.\n9.\tThose who believe that they can deceive those who have been subjugated and impoverished for centuries are mistaken. They will be even more mistaken if, dominated by an arrogance that makes them believe in their capacity to repeat successfully the deceitful practices of the first European sailors and discoverers, they attempt to pass themselves off as liberators of those whom they are oppressing and as friends of their victims.\n10.\tThere is no possibility, nor has there ever been or will be one, of reconciliation between the oppressor and the oppressed and between the victims and those who victimize them. We must not forget that, if today the former colonialists and racists are attempting maneuvers to enable them to negotiate with those against whom they fought for so many years in the most difficult circumstances, this is precisely due to the effectiveness of the struggle, to the successes achieved by the liberation movements in their difficult and selfless struggle. The international community must not condone any action which might affect the liberation movements or weaken them in their efforts. The correct and consistent thing to do in this decisive hour is to redouble the most resolute political, moral and material support to the African liberation movements in order to speed up the downfall of the colonialist and racist regimes, with which we cannot legitimately compromise until such time as the cause of freedom and independence has triumphed throughout the continent.\n11.\tHie General Assembly must renew its commitment of solidarity with the struggle of the African peoples for independence, freedom and racial equality. In this connexion the Assembly should energetically condemn the maneuvers of the Pretoria regime designed to perpetuate its oppression over Namibia. The deceitful racist words spoken in the fraudulent \\\"constitutional talks\\\" in Windhoek must be categorically rejected. The only peaceful solution of this question consists in the transfer of all power to the Namibian people represented by its national liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. This organization has indicated its willingness to contribute to a peaceful solution if its proposals are accepted, namely the holding of direct talks only between SWAPO and South Africa. The sole purpose of these talks would be to put an end to colonial domination over Namibia; they must not be part of previous talks with tribal groups and must be preceded by the unconditional release of all political detainees, and, finally, a cease-fire must be decreed and the army of SWAPO must be recognized.\n12.\tThe adoption of effective measures by the United Nations to expel South Africa from Namibia has now become obviously urgent, since Pretoria has systematically flouted all the relevant decisions and resolutions of the international community and has used and is continuing to use the Territory of Namibia as a base for aggression against African countries. Last year's invasion of the People's Republic of Angola, which ended in the most humiliating and decisive defeat ever suffered by the racists, their mercenaries and their imperialist tutors, served to draw the attention of the world to the threat to international peace posed by the continuation of South Africa's presence in that Territory. Now, while the General Assembly is in session, the South African regime is maintaining tens of thousands of soldiers concentrated close to the Angolan frontier, continuing to fortify the northern part of Namibia and carrying out constant attacks and provocations against the territory of Angola.\n13.\tThe situation in Zimbabwe demands the most careful attention of all progressive countries and forces. Encouraged by the success of Angola and the advance of the revolution in Mozambique, the national liberation movement is giving proof of growing vitality and is carrying out ever more effectively and victoriously its struggle against the Ian Smith clique and its imperialist partners. It is in this context of imminent bankruptcy of the Salisbury regime that Mr. Kissinger decided to carry out his recent and suspicious safari. The purpose of his journey could not have been more obvious. Representing the great North American monopolies which are the main beneficiaries of the exploitation of the peoples of southern Africa and, therefore, those which are more keenly interested in perpetuating the status quo in the region-the head of United States diplomacy is today attempting to serve as a vehicle for a new maneuver designed to save the essence of the racist and colonialist regime imposed on the masses in Zimbabwe. Die main thrust of his proposals-which he reiterated before this Assembly a few days ago-seeks to gain time for the racist minority while promoting division among the nationalist sectors, attempt to suspend the sanctions against the illegal regime and organize the massive invasion of foreign capital, especially United States capital, which would strengthen white domination.\n14.\tMr. Kissinger's proposals must be rejected. They show that there is a need to strengthen our solidarity with the true freedom fighters of Zimbabwe in their armed struggle which they are engaged in and which will soon lead them to total victory.\n15.\tWe must not disregard the fact that a key interlocutor in Mr. Kissinger's recent travels was the head of the racist regime in Pretoria. This is not surprising if we realize that one of the strategic motivations of the present maneuvers of imperialism in Africa is the preservation of the system of oppression and discrimination imposed on millions of Africans by the Government headed by Mr. Vorster. Regardless of the successes of the African liberation move-ment, however numerous its achievements against traditional colonialism, nothing can ever make us forget the fact that Africa will not be entirely free, that no African country can ensure its independence and sovereignty, that no African people can live in peace and security while there continues to exist in South Africa the heinous system of apartheid because there, in the southern extreme of the continent, there is a cancer which attempts to devour all the African peoples; there persists there the most brutal forms of human exploitation; there we find still the crudest manifestation of all that is inhuman, repugnant and hateful that colonialism and racism have meant to the peoples of the third world.\n16.\tThe struggle of the people of South Africa against apartheid has therefore acquired an importance going far beyond the boundaries of the continent. The whole world must pay a tribute to the South African workers, students and patriots who, in every corner of the racist territory, have heroically and resolutely raised their voices in protest, have unmasked the brutal and repressive essence of the Vorster regime, and have shown that the African masses are not willing to live with racial oppression. The General Assembly must adopt strong and effective measures against apartheid and in support of the struggle of the South African people, and must definitely reject the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" and repression practiced by the Vorster clique. \n17.\tThe anti-colonial action must be consistent and must encompass all the regions of the world where peoples are denied the exercise of their national rights. We reiterate our support for the struggle of the people of so-called French Somaliland (Djibouti), of Western Sahara, of East Timor, of Belize and of Puerto Rico, as well as of any other territory till subjected to colonialism.\n18.\tIt is necessary to solve the problems that have arisen because of colonial domination and that prejudice the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sovereign States. In that connexion we reaffirm our support of the people and Government of the Comoros, which have a just claim over the island of Mayotte, an integral and inseparable part of the territory of the Comoros; we support also the legitimate aspiration of the Argentine Republic to recover the Malvinas Islands.\n19.\tIt is indispensable to eliminate the vestiges of the aggressive imperialist policy that still weighs heavily on many States and affects millions of human beings. We must crown the victory of Viet Nam by admitting it to the United Nations very soon. Furthermore, the United States Government must comply with the commitment it assumed, in subscribing to the Paris agreement,  to con-tribute towards healing the wounds of the war that it imposed on that noble people. The international community has a debt of honor to the peoples of IndoChina, which so bravely defended the right of all peoples to decide their own destiny freely by facing up to the most ferocious aggression. Therefore, we are duty bound to give them all the co-operation they may require in their national reconstruction.\n20.\tThe so-called Korean question will never be solved without the complete withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea, the dissolution of the United Nations Command and the ending of foreign interference in the affairs of the Korean people. Only in that way will we achieve the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. My delegation reiterates its support for the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve that, goal.\n21.\tThe Middle East crisis is still of grave concern to our Organization. A solution to that problem can be found only on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied since June 1967 and full respect for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. This appears to be an opportune moment to convene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, in which the Palestine Liberation Organization should participate on an equal footing with all the other parties involved in the conflict. My delegation participated actively in the work of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people and supports its recommendations [see A/31/35], which we believe could well trigger the process that will lead to the solution of this burning problem. The tragic events in Lebanon have shocked world public opinion. My delegation reiterates its support for the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon and the right of its people to solve the country's problems by itself and without violence. It is urgent that an end be put to the fighting from various Arab trenches, since that is depriving the Palestinians of that center of resistance against the common enemy. The continuation of the struggle in Lebanon is helping to strengthen Zionist aggression and the designs of its imperialist allies in the region.\n22.\tCyprus is still the object of intolerable aggression* which has taken specific form in the occupation of a large part of its territory by foreign troops. Once again we call for their complete and unconditional withdrawal and demand respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial, integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, a loyal Member of this Organization, and a founding member of the non-aligned movement. The problems that exist between the Cypriot communities will be solved satisfactorily only . on the basis of strict respect for the principles of non-intervention and the sovereign equality of States, principles that have as much validity with regard to Cyprus at they have with regard to any other member of the community of nations. In reiterating our solidarity with the Government of Archbishop Makarios, the sole legitimate authority on the island, my delegation urges the Assembly to adopt effective decisions to put an end to the aggression, to alleviate the tragic conditions of the thousands of refugees in that country, and to restore peace. and justice.\n23.\tThe peoples of the world have applauded the process of detente, which promotes the strengthening of world peace, the greatest aspiration of mankind. This process of detente, we repeat, must be strengthened in order that it may become irreversible and universal in character. To that end it is necessary to adopt effective measures for the speedy elimination of colonialism and to ensure respect for the rights of all States, large and small. An important contribution to the cause of peace would be the achievement of concrete progress in disarmament. In that connexion we reiterate our support for the convening of a world disarmament conference. Similarly, we reaffirm* our support for negotiations to achieve effective and strict measures for the total prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Among disarmament measures, we attach priority importance to the elimination of the foreign bases which the imperialists and colonialists have disseminated throughout the world against the will of the peoples. In this connexion we reiterate our demand that the Government of the United States return to Cuba that part of our national territory it usurps in the region of Guantanamo. Equally necessary for the security and peace of the peoples of the Caribbean is the dismantling of United States bases on Puerto Rico and Panamanian territory.\n24.\tThe proposal submitted to the Assembly by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Comrade Andrei Gromyko, relating to the conclusion of a treaty banning the use of force in international relations [A!311243] is further proof of the constructive attitude of the Soviet Govern\u00acment and its desire to improve the international climate. The exclusion of the use of force from international relations is the aspiration and desire of all the peoples of the world, and we therefore trust that that proposal will receive the enthusiastic support of the General Assembly.\n25.\tThis year, as we commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama, the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean are engaged in a decisive struggle to preserve the independence for which they fought so boldly. History Has brought them to a cross-roads where the cause of freedom today demands of Latin Americans the same readiness to fight, the same lucidity in working out the appropriate strategy and the same solidarity that was inculcated in them by Simon Bolivar.\n26.\tThe measures for the defense of national sovereignty adopted by some Latin American countries, the growing struggle of our peoples to recover their national wealth, Panama's firm defense of its sovereign rights over the Canal and the. neighboring zone and. the. active international policy of the Government of Mexico have made possible Latin America's participation in the world struggle being waged by the peoples of the third world to establish a new international order based on equity and respect for the rights of all peoples.\n27.\tIn these past few years the countries of Latin America have created some instruments which may help to defend their national interests and strengthen their ties of co-operation. The establishment of the Latin American Economic System, the Caribbean Multinational Maritime Transportation Enterprise, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar-Exporting Countries is the most successful example of this.\n28.\tThe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean are, however, confronted by the attacks of North American imperialism, which is seeking to halt recent advances and to reinstate its domination over the region.\n29.\tNorth American imperialism is attempting to extend over the map of the continent authoritarian and servile regimes such as that established in Chile on 11 September 1973. Today Latin America is faced with the threat of a fascism dependent on the dictates of Washington, which co-ordinates its repressive practices beyond its national frontiers and commits crimes and engages in torture and persecution that know no geographical or humanitarian limits. The danger this phenomenon represents for the interests of all our peoples is clearly shown by the recent ties established between Pretoria and the regimes in Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and other South American countries with which the apartheid authorities are seeking to establish a strategic alliance.\n30.\tThe international community must resolutely support the Latin American freedom fighters who are resisting the repression of these dictatorial regimes. It will have an occasion to do so in the General Assembly when the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile [A/31/253, annex], which was established by the Commission on Human Rights to study the Chilean situation is considered. The information amassed by the Ad Hoc Working Group shows that there are strong grounds for the accusation of those who, having been established in power as a result of imperialist intervention, have unleashed against the Chilean people the most brutal and unbridled repression and terror. Vast sectors of Chilean society are calling for effective international action to put an end to the crimes and excesses of the Pinochet junta. Such action is especially urgent when it is remembered that the agents of the Chilean regime, obsessed by their complete internal isolation and their vigorous repudiation by the international community, are now committing crimes beyond their frontiers. The assassination in Washington barely two weeks ago of the former Foreign Minister of Chile, Orlando Letelier, confirms this fact. His death, like the deaths of thousands of Chilean victims of Fascist terrorism, will be justly dealt with in the not-too-distant future, when the Chilean people recovers its freedom through heroic struggle.\nBut now the international community must take strong measures against those who have made terror and crime into standard official policy.\n31.\tThe struggle of the Latin American people is not easy, nor will it be easy to stop their relentless march towards freedom.\n32.\tGuyana and Jamaica bravely continue a policy of recovering their national sovereignty and they are making important economic and social changes which open up to their working masses prospects of a future of justice and well-being. Against both processes imperialism and international reaction are launching conspiracy, economic sabotage and hostile propaganda, and, in the case of Guyana, they are also threatening its territorial integrity. Prompted by sincere feelings of brotherhood born of a colonial experience shared for many centuries, Cuba reaffirms its full solidarity with the peoples and Governments of Guyana and Jamaica in their endeavor to consolidate and protect their national independence and to make the social changes that will liberate their peoples for ever from their past of servitude and oppression.\n33.\tBoth countries are protagonists in the profound process of renewal that is stirring up the whole Caribbean region.\n34.\tInternational public opinion must be mobilized in support of full respect for the rights of the Caribbean peoples. After many centuries of colonialist and imperialist outrages, the time has come for those peoples to determine their own destinies freely, without foreign interference. That demand is expressed today particularly in their call for unrestricted respect for the independence, sovereignty, self-determination and territorial integrity of Guyana, Jamaica and other States of the region. It is also necessary to take effective international action once and for all to put an end to manifestations of colonialism in the Caribbean and, especially, to contribute to the struggle of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize for their national independence and for full respect for their territorial integrity and their enjoyment of their natural resources.\n35.\tThe cause of Panama is considered their own by all the peoples of the region. I am therefore happy to reiterate the support of my Government for its just demand for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Canal and the neighboring zone and our solidarity with the Government of General Omar Torrijos in his strong defense of Panamanian national sovereignty.\n36.\tCuba confirms its full solidarity with the struggle of the Puerto Rican people for independence. Despite the obstinate opposition of the administering Power, the international community is expressing ever more vigorously its demand that Puerto Rico be allowed to exercise its sacred national rights. Recently, the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by consensus a decision reaffirming the inalienable right of that people to self- determination and independence, reiterating earlier decisions of the Committee; taking note of decisions on that question adopted by the non-aligned countries at their Colombo and Lima Conferences; and deciding to continue examination of that question next year in order to consider appropriate measures.  My delegation believes that that was a positive decision which will enable the Committee next year to move forward in the adoption of just decisions that will contribute to the liberation of the Puerto Rican people. For our part, we reiterate that we shall continue to give them our support in their just struggle for independence.\n37.\tAs we have repeatedly stated, this attitude of Cuba's is in keeping with our policy based on principle and therefore cannot be modified.\n38.\tEconomic problems have aroused much attention during the current general debate as a reflection of the growing concern of the developing countries over a situation which calls for strong and effective measures if we truly wish to establish an order of relations that will promote peace and be based on co-operation. The present economic crisis is placing an increasing burden on the peoples of the third world. The Declaration and Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VT)J have remained a dead letter, and the majority of the developed capitalist countries have shown no true will to make changes in the structure of the world economy and trade, which is an inescapable need and a demand that is firmly supported by all the countries of the so-called Group of 77. Meanwhile, the inflationary process continues, and the capitalist world burdens with its consequences the under-developed countries, which in turn do not obtain remunerative prices for their exports or find favorable conditions for the development of their trade. It is imperative that the developing countries strengthen their unity to demand radical changes that will put an end to this unequal exchange and to the burdensome load imposed by external debt on many States, and that will help promote a true transfer of resources for development.\n39.\tAn important contribution to this unity and to the development of the developing countries would be for the oil-producing countries to adopt a policy of true co-opera-tion with the other developing countries. \u2022\n40.\tFor the Cuban people the past year has been one of intense and fruitful work, it began shortly after the First Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, which served as the framework for an in-depth study of the national situation, laid the basis for the restructuring and institu-tionalization of the socialist State, traced the guidelines for the first five-year plan, adopted a new system for manage-ment of the economy, and took all-important decisions on the future orientation of Cuban society. This year has as its main orientation the concept of applying, enthusiastically and with confidence in the future, the conclusions of the in-depth, careful analysis carried out by Cuban Commu-nists. Our entire people has undertaken this task with love, dedication and perserverance. In February, with the wide support of the people voiced in a plebiscite, it adopted the new socialist constitution, which enshrines the gains achieved by our working classes and by our people since the revolution of January 1959, and guarantees its definitive institutionalization.\n41.\tIn the process of the establishment of genuinely and profoundly democratic machinery through which it will be the people itself which governs, takes decisions and permanently controls State affairs at every level, scarcely a few days ago, throughout my country, free elections were held, by secret and direct ballot, whereby the people elected their representatives. That process will culminate on 2 December with the formation of the National Assembly of the People's Power and the constitution of the main organs of the State and Government.\n42.\tThis stage will coincide with the twentieth anniversary of one of the major events in Cuban history: the day on which Fidel Castro and a handful of heroes disembarked on the beaches of Cuba's Oriente Province to begin the final stages of the armed struggle which was to do away with the Batista tyranny and lead to the final liberation of our. homeland.\n43.\tTwenty years ago, Cuba exemplified the degree of domination, poverty, corruption and despotism to which North American imperialism had led our peoples. It was oppressed by a corrupt .and sanguinary military clique which, in the service of Yankee interests, instituted a brutal regime of terror. The struggle to do away with it cost my people 20,000 martyrs, who live today in the hearts and memory of all Cubans and serve as guidance for our revolutionary intransigent decision.\n44.\tThose were hard, agonizing, unforgettable years, which formed the vanguard that was victoriously to lead the Cuban people to the successes represented by the singular honor of making socialism, for the first time, a triumphant reality in the Western Hemisphere.\n45.\tTwenty years later, in the Cuban archipelago, trans-formed radically by the revolution, there emerges a reality which is a lasting tribute to the freedom fighters of Goma. In a space of time brief in historical terms, the revolution dH away fully with illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, racial discrimination, unhealthy conditions and all the social vices of the past. It rescued Cuba's dignity and sovereignty, and marches firmly along the path of economic development. For each of the revolutionary martyrs there are today hundreds of Cubans who, for the first time, have an opportunity to attend the universities of our country; there are scores , of new school centers which all Cuban children may attend; scores of hospitals which guarantee adequate medical attention to all citizens; hundreds of social buildings and housing developments, which ensure for the masses a well-being they had never known before. There are thousands of works of every kind which have completely changed the past backward and feudal image of our country of two decades ago. Each of our martyrs lives in the constant efforts of 9.5 million Cubans, who work feverishly to construct the new society. Those martyrs are reborn with each achievement, with the completion of each new work and with the culmination of each effort.\n46.\tHowever, we are faced with serious difficulties which will affect our economic development plans. External factors beyond our control will compel our people to make new sacrifices, but our people will be able to face them, thanks to its unyielding revolutionary conscience.\n47.\tThose external factors are the collapse of the price of sugar on the world market which has lowered the value of that product to levels that are no better than those that prevailed during the great crisis of 1931 and 1932; the persistent rise in the price of many items of equipment, machinery and primary commodities which we must import with the hard currency that we obtain from the depreciated value of our sugar; a severe drought which has seriously affected the eastern provinces of Cuba and substantially damaged important areas of our agricultural production; and the maintenance of the economic and trade blockade imposed on Cuba by North American imperialism which prevents our country from having access to international credit institutions and drastically limits our capacity for export. This last is reflected particularly in the closing of many markets to Cuban nickel, which could have been one of the few export products that might have compensated my country for the critical situation in which it now finds itself as a result of the decline in the price of sugar. The recent decision of the Government of the United States to triple the import duty on sugar in the American market is an aggression against sugar-exporting countries and will help to aggravate further the crisis in the sugar trade in world markets.\n48.\tConsidering these problems last 28 September, Comrade Fidel Castro, the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, stated:\n\\\"Of course, the news of our difficulties may make our enemies happy, but they do not know us well. We know the times in which we live. We know how much the world still has to go through as a result of the unequal system of trade and the exploitation to which the third world is subjected by the developed capitalist countries. We know that the world is subjected by the developed capitalist countries. We know that the world has still to change a great deal. We know that the road of revolution is long, not only the road of the Cuban people's revolution but also that of world-wide revolution, and that the underdeveloped countries will have, for many years, to face these problems.\\\"\n49.\tDespite all these obstacles, the Cuban people will continue, firmly and perseveringly, along the road of revolution. Hie serious economic difficulties of the present will not affect the maintenance of basic social services which, in the fields of public health and education, have already reached levels of which we are legitimately proud. Neither will they affect the living conditions of the masses. It is precisely in these moments of trial and tribulation that we see clearly the superiority of socialism in facing up to difficulties without placing on the working masses the weight of the consequences of economic reverses.\n50.\tWhile I-am speaking before you, the peoples of Cuba and of Guyana are in mourning. Barely a week ago the Cuban people witnessed a further manifestation of the brutality of its enemies and of their miserable and cowardly actions. A DC-8 aircraft of the Cuban Airlines was a victim of criminal sabotage in the waters of Barbados, which cost the lives of all those aboard. In connexion with this serious incident, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba will, tomorrow, Friday, make an important statement which we will distribute in due course to delegations.\n51.\tOur people will continue, with unswerving determination, on its revolutionary course. It will continue to raise the banners of socialism; it will continue to hold high the internationalist principles of its foreign policy; it will persist in its decision to defend its small territory and maintain it as an impregnable bastion of revolution. Nothing and no one can divert it from its course, because it knows that it is accompanied in its march by the solidarity of all those who are fighting for freedom all over the world; because it is impelled and encouraged by the mandate of thousands of Cubans who fell along a road bathed with blood and marked with sacrifice and heroism over a central of struggle for freedom and independence; because it knows that however many the obstacles, however great the difficulties at present, however great the sacrifices imposed by a world that is still unjust and unequal, the future is in the hands of the peoples who struggle and the future belongs entirely to socialism.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in the general debate to proffer to you, Sir, the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your unanimous election to the high and responsible office of President of the General Assembly.\n122.\tI also tender my delegation's good wishes to Mr. Gaston Thorn, who presided over the deliberations of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly with such distinction, and to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his devotion and assiduity in the performance of his onerous duties.\n123.\tWhat is the aspect of the'United Nations as it enters into its fourth decade? Physically, the Organization works well. One must ask, however, if the principles of the United Nations Charter, as they were determined in San Francisco 31 years ago, have proved equally resilient; if intellectually and morally the United Nations has withstood the test of experience -the experience of a generation which, although it has been spared the devastation of a world war, has still seen major armed conflict, massacre, political terrorism, slavery, tyranny, persecution, hunger and poverty in all too many areas on the surface of the globe for every minute the United Nations has been in existence. Regrettably, the answer must be negative.\n124.\tIt is indisputable that world public opinion has become increasingly disenchanted with the United Nations; increasingly frustrated by the opportunism and hypocrisy of so much of its debates and decisions; increasingly disgusted by the power of a mechanical majority to bend the Organization to its own purposes, by, for example, transforming an initiative designed to outlaw terrorism into an apologia for terrorism; or by converting the Commission on Human Rights into a forum in which the guilty are the accusers and the innocent condemned, In the twisted terminology which is used here a defeated aggressor is portrayed as a victim, a successful defender as an aggressor; those who refuse to treat with their neighbors are hailed as lovers of peace, and those who seek peace negotiations branded as warmongers.\n125.\tThe list of discrepancies between the current practices of the United Nations and what the Charter says is long, and there is no need to labor the point.\n126.\tTo a great extent the General Assembly has become an arena for empty rhetoric and arbitrary recommendations which have little to do with right, justice and international reality. Indeed, there appears to be no limit to the absurdity which the General Assembly, as it operates today, can reach it even achieved a record in futility by adopting, at the same session, two conflicting resolutions on the same subject.\n127.\tTwo further examples from the record of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly demonstrate that clearly. One is the ludicrous and evil attempt to stigmatize the national liberation movement of the Jewish people as racism and racial discrimination; the other is the bizarre episode of the Committee of 20 members, from the resolution which the General Assembly was not competent to adopt; through the biased and non-representative com-position of the Committee itself, to the report of the Committee which is not only a flagrant intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of a Member State but also a prescription for its dismemberment by stages.\n128.\tHistory will consign these resolutions to oblivion, and those countries which supported their adoption will bear the shame.\n129.\tBut the United Nations system is an essential feature of the international scene of our times and it is hardly possible to conceive of a world without it. It must be cured, however, of the grave maladies which afflict it: there must be a return to the Charter; there must be an end to the rancorous confrontation which is the dominant feature of our deliberations; consultation and agreement must be restored to their primary place; the United Nations, and particularly the specialized agencies, must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they are being dragged by Arab obsessions about Israel, so that they may devote themselves to the social, humanitarian, scientific and technical tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform very well when they are allowed to do so; and, lastly, there must be full participation of all Members in all United Nations activities on an equitable basis, by strict alphabetical rotation, instead of the discriminatory bloc system.\n130.\tThe effort to bring into being a new order in international economic and trade relations has become a major focus of interest and debate throughout the world and in the United Nations system.\n131.\tIsrael belongs to a small group of countries in the developing world which, though meagerly endowed by nature, have by hard work and the application of science and technology reached a promising level of development.\nThese countries have a special role to play because they show what can be done even in the most difficult of circumstances.\n132.\tIt is thus important, I believe, that developing countries consider not only what the fortunate countries of the industrialized world can do for them but what they can do for themselves and what they can do for one another. As our sage Hillel taught some 2000 years ago: \\\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me; but if I am only for myself, what am I; and if not now, when? \\\"\n133.\tFor our part we have tried, at the seventh special session and at the fourth session of UNCTAD, to present some ideas which some delegations found useful and constructive.\n134.\tWhat we can best do is to put our experience in overcoming some of the major problems which beset a large part of the developing world at the disposal of all who wish to avail themselves of it. For many years now it has been the policy of the Government of Israel to conduct programs of technical co-operation with other emerging and developing countries and, indeed, it is a source of pride to us that, with all the limitations which nature has imposed on us, and saddled as we are with tremendous burdens caused by the absence of a peace settlement in the Middle East, we are at this very moment co-operating in one technical field or another with over 50 countries represented in this hall.\n135.\tOne such important field is water development in semi-arid climates. In view of the forthcoming United Nations water and desertification conferences scheduled to take place next year, the practical experience of Israel in water exploration and management as well as in the development of highly efficient methods of irrigation, which has already aroused much interest in a number of countries with similar problems to our own, might well prove to be susceptible of wider application.\n136.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has just concluded its fifth session here in New York, and it is a matter of some disquiet that it has not achieved any significant progress in the direction of an acceptable international agreement.\n137.\tThe trend towards unilateral decisions by individual States concerning the increase in the width of their territorial sea or the proclamation of economic zones is asserting itself without a parallel international reaffirmation of proper rules to guarantee the essential freedom of navigation and overflight on the seas and through and over straits. This is a regrettable situation which cannot but result in an increase in international tensions.\n138.\tAnother problem which is still without solution is that presented by the lofty idea that the sea-bed beyond the economic zones constitutes the common heritage of mankind. A realistic compromise between this concept and its practical application for the benefit of all nations is still apparently far away.\n139.\tA goodly number of representatives who have spoken before me have raised their voices in condemnation of\ninternational terrorism, which these last few years has spread over the face of the earth like a malignant cancer.\n140.\tThere is no excuse for terrorism. No cause can justify or condone it. It is a criminal activity, totally indiscriminate in its effects, which by design strikes at the very elements of the population that every society tries to protect-the innocent, the weak, the defenseless, children and women.\n141.\tThe record of the United Nations in combating terrorism is dismal. In 1972, after the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games by a gang of Arab terrorists, the Secretary-General proposed an item for the agenda of the General Assembly on measures to prevent terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms.7 We all know what happened to that praise-worthy venture: it was deliberately sabotaged by a group of States whose interest was not to prevent terrorism but to encourage, aid and abet it on the evident assumption that, because it seemed to serve their own interests, they would be immune from harm.\n142.\tThey were grievously mistaken. Nobody is immune; and some of the States whose representatives were the most eloquent in thwarting any effective United Nations action have themselves been victims of terrorism in the past few weeks-Yugoslavia, India; Egypt and even Syria. The item, now distorted so as to appear like an apology for and justification of terrorism instead of a call for action to suppress it, is still on the agenda of the General Assembly, but is is conceded by all that nothing will ever come of it.\n143.\tThe issue is a fundamental one for the international community, for the attitude this Organization takes on the question of terrorism is a very clear reflection of its moral strength and international responsibility.\n144.\tThe terrorism of today is especially deadly for three principal reasons: the availability to terrorists of sophisticated modern weapons capable of causing mass loss of life and destruction; the complicity of certain States which supply these weapons, frequently delivered in their diplomatic bags, and which provide the terrorists with shelter and comfort; and the abhorrent practice of taking innocent hostages as a means of blackmail.\n145.\tThe rescue by Israel in July of the hostages hijacked to Entebbe in the Air France airbus has shown that given the will it is possible for even a small State to combat terrorism effectively. However, operations such as that would not be necessary if potential hijackers and terrorists knew that nowhere in the world would they get refuge and support.\n146.\tIsrael thus welcomes the proposal made on 28 September by the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany that the United Nations should draft a convention banning the taking of hostages internationally and providing for the prosecution or extradition of the perpetrators f 7th meeting, para. 113]: This is an important step in the right direction and the General Assembly would lose all credibility as an effective international instrumentality if it failed to take it.\n147.\tBut in view of the extreme gravity of the problem and the sorry performance of the United Nations in dealing with it, we would be deluding ourselves if we imagined that that would be enough. Only by close multilateral co-operation and concerted organized action between States which really intend to fight terrorism will this atrocious crime be suppressed.\n148.\tThe enemies of Israel in this Organization strive mightily to convince the world of similarities between Zionism and apartheid, and make much of the relations between Israel and South Africa to bolster a fraudulent case. Racism and racial discrimination, in any guise, including apartheid, are abhorrent to my country and my people. The basic tenets of Judaism are irreconcilable with any form of racial discrimination. The Jews are the classic victims of racial discrimination and over the centuries our martyrs have run into the tens of millions.\n149.\tIt is equally specious to single out Israel for links with South Africa when most of the world maintains links with that country. According to the latest available statistics, the foreign trade of South Africa totaled over $12 billion in 1974. Of this huge sum Israel's share was less than two fifths of 1 per cent-infinitely smaller than the share of many Arab and some African countries. The armed forces of the Republic are large and equipped with modern weapons -tanks, artillery, aircraft, destroyers and submarines. It is not Israel that supplied them.\n150.\tIn my address to the General Assembly last year  I stated that as far as Israel was concerned we had two criteria for judgment on the policy of detente which was given formal expression in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Those criteria are that detente must apply to the Middle East no less than to Europe and to other areas of the world, and that the humanitarian provisions of the Helsinki agreement must be scrupulously applied. On both counts detente has been a grievous disappointment to us.\n151.\tI declare that detente has not been felt in the Middle East. Moreover, I regret to record that there has been no improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Exit from the Soviet Union-a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki agreement-is still severely restricted, while those Jews who do insist on their rights are subject to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment, and in some cases to arrest and imprisonment. I once again call on the Government of the Soviet Union to permit those Jews who wish to leave in order to join their families in Israel to do so.\n152.\tThe situation of the Jews of Syria remains tragic: a small community continues to be held as a hostage. Jews are victims of persecution and oppression, are circumscribed in their movements inside Syria, while travel abroad is permitted only under severe restrictions. Surely these 5,000 men, women and children cannot make all that difference to the Government of Syria. Why is it holding them?\n153.\tWhen I spoke in the General Assembly last year the war in Lebanon was but six months old. At that time some 5,000 people had already been killed and nearly 18,000 wounded. Twelve months have passed since then; the carnage goes on. By now over 40,000 men, women and children have lost their lives and over 100,000 have been wounded-and this out of a total population of less than 2.5 million. A rough equivalent would be a toll of killed and wounded totaling some 13 million in the United States, 15 million in the Soviet Union and 3 million in France. The ruin and devastation are almost beyond description; most of the flourishing towns and villages of Lebanon have become a bloody and merciless wasteland.\n154.\tFor a year and a half a Member State of the United Nations has been bleeding to death before the eyes of the whole world. At the beginning it was claimed that this was a civil war, and thus outside the purview of the Security Council. No one produces this specious argument now, when massive armed intervention by regular and irregular foreign Arab troops is known and admitted-Syrians, Iraqis and Libyans, to mention only the larger contingents. But not a word from the Security Council, not a whisper.\n155.\tThe silence of the world Organization in the face of this tragedy is an awful warning to all small States. It is clear that a country which relies on the United Nations for its security, a country which cannot defend itself by its own means, is lost.\n156.\tThere is yet another conclusion to be drawn. For years now the world has been bombarded by a propaganda campaign peddling the notion of the replacement of Israel by a so-called secular democratic State where Muslims, Christians and Jews would live in blissful amity. But where is this beautiful mirage now? Destroyed in the fires of Lebanon, by the same gangs of terrorists who are the prime instigators of the blood-letting there in Lebanon.\n157.\tIsrael is an immediate neighbor of Lebanon, and what goes on there concerns us closely. Our overriding desire is that peace and tranquility should be restored to Lebanon, for that is the essential condition for the reaffirmation of the national independence and the territorial integrity of that unhappy land. Moreover, we expect that the future constitutional structure of Lebanon will* be determined by the citizens of Lebanon in their respective communities, and by them alone; that foreign troops, both regular and irregular, will leave the country; and, above all, that Lebanon will not again become a base for attacks on Israel and its people.\n158.\tBut the Lebanese conflict, although the most grave, is not the only current conflict in which countries of the Arab world are engaged. There are many others. A random listing makes, indeed, extraordinary reading.\n159.\tThere is the bitter quarrel between Iraq and Syria. Then comes Iraq's designs on the territorial integrity of, Kuwait; Democratic Yemen's quarrel with Oman, with Yemen and with Saudi Arabia; Somalia's designs on Ethiopia; Egypt's conflict with Syria; Libya's clashes with\nEgypt, with Sudan, with Tunisia, with Syria, with Chad and with practically every other independent State in the Arab world and in North Africa; and, finally, the feud between Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania in the Sahara desert.\n160.\tThere is only one island of stability in this stormy sea, and that is the State of Israel.\n161.\tThere is clearly a moral to be drawn here. The neighbors of Israel know that their border with Israel is the safest border they have. They know that if they preserve the peace on the borders with Israel then their own borders are secure. Moreover, their people know full well that when they are in distress they can turn to Israel for humanitarian assistance, as the villagers of South Lebanon are doing this day at the fence of goodwill.\n162.\tIn my speech last year I drew attention to a problem of particular gravity for the prospects of peace as well as for the economic and social well-being of the countries of the Middle East. I refer to the seemingly limitless flow of weapons of war into the region, resulting in a frantic arms race. In the past three years the value of arms supplies delivered by both East and West to the Arab countries in the vicinity of Israel is estimated at $7.5 billion; a further approximately $22 billion worth is contracted for delivery from the end of 1976 onwards, making a total of nearly $30 billion invested in weaponry. This is an utterly staggering sum which is difficult for the human mind to take in. If, instead of being spent on means of destruction, most of this sum was invested in the economic and social development of the area, the Middle East would be transformed and restored to its ancient glory.\n163.\tHowever, as long as the Arab States continue to arm themselves with highly sophisticated modern weaponry on this vast scale, Israel is compelled to keep up, and will keep up. But we repeat emphatically that we are prepared now, even before peace is made, to negotiate with our neighbors for a balanced limitation of the inflow of arms into the area in such a manner that the burden will be lightened for all without adversely affecting the security and the defense capacity of any.\n164.\tIt causes us no joy that the Middle East is ablaze with conflict, because the peace that we seek is its principal victim. Therefore, in order to keep up the momentum following on the successful conclusion of the 1974 separation of forces agreements with Egypt and Syria and the 1975 agreement with Egypt, we have tried to take additional steps in the direction of a just and lasting peace in the area.\n165.\tWe have proposed that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East be reconvened with its original membership. The proposal was torpedoed by the USSR, Syria and Egypt. When it was intimated to us that there was no chance at this time for an overall peace treaty and the normalization of relations, we responded favorably to a United States suggestion to negotiate agreements on the termination of the state of war. This proposal has remained without response or acknowledgment from the Arab side to this day. As far as we are concerned, this possibility still exists.\n166.\tIsrael wants peace, seeks peace and is ready for peace at any time-a peace which will emerge from the region itself, which will break down the wall of hostility dividing the States of the region and which will be shaped by free negotiations between them. We believe that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) form the only agreed basis both for the nature of the peace and for the method of achieving it. For that reason we are ready to take part in a reconvened Geneva Peace Conference, with its original composition, at any time acceptable to all. At such a conference, or by any other means which the parties find satisfactory, we would hope to negotiate with each of our neighbors a final peace settlement based on a fair compromise which, on the one hand, will provide Israel with defensible borders, and, on the other, will satisfy genuine Arab interests, including, within the context of the settlement with our neighbor to the east, a just and constructive solution to the problem of Palestinian Arab identity. Only a peace which serves the interests of Israel and its neighbors will endure.\n167.\tPeace is the foremost objective of Israel, and its Government will not be deflected from the constant effort required to attain it.\n"

        "file_text": "The thirty-first session of the General Assembly, like all previous sessions, will be a reflection of the world of the present day. It is a world confronted by perplexing and complex problems-a world plagued by international conflicts and rivalries, by foreign domination and racism, by inequitable monetary and trade relations, bv economic crises, by pollution and ecological imbalances, by unregulated use of the ocean and its resources-to name but a few. When confronted by this wealth of problems, it gives my delegation a reassuring feeling to see you, Mr. President, presiding over the deliberations of our present session of the Assembly. Your personal qualities, your great experience in the affairs of the United Nations and the manifold contributions that you have brought to the work of our Organization reaffirm our confidence in the success of the work of this Assembly.\n89.\tYour election is also a fitting honor to your country, Sri Lanka, which has been in the forefront of the efforts of the non-aligned movement to bring about a new pattern of international relations based upon a greater democratization of decision-making and a more equitable and rational international order through consultation rather than self- destructive confrontation.\n90.\tAs the representative of a fellow Asian State dedicated to the realization of those principles, and one which has enjoyed long and close relations with Sri Lanka, it gives me great satisfaction to see such a distinguished son of Asia chosen to preside over our deliberation.\n91.\tOur sincere appreciation also goes to the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for the proficient and dignified leadership with which he has guided the work of the thirtieth session.\n92.\tIt is my pleasant duty, moreover, to welcome a sister archipelagic State, the Republic of Seychelles, as a Member of our Organization. My delegation looks forward to establishing a close and friendly relationship with the delegation of Seychelles and hopes to have a mutually fruitful co-operation with that delegation.\n93.\tIt is the sincere hope of my delegation that soon we will be able to welcome also the, delegations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and of Angola as full participants in the work of our Organization.\n94.\tIn his usual eloquent and at the same time sober manner our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has reminded us in his introduction to the report of the work of our Organization that \\\"we live in a transitional period when the undoubted fact of increasing interdependence has by no means decreased the power or the prevalence of the concept of national sovereignty [A/3111/Add.l, sect. //. It is not without hesitation that I touch on the problem of interdependence, for the main reason that this expression has through the years become rather well-worn. None the less, the interdependence of nations has become a fact of life which we cannot negate, either now nor in the future. Men and nations have always needed each other. No man is an island, and neither is any nation. The advent of the economic crisis in 1973, precipitated by the October war of the same year in the Middle East, was a catalyzing factor in the process of the reawakening of the developing world, which propelled the world towards making a new reappraisal of interdependence among nations. The world has now reached a stage in which nations, both developed and developing, not only need each other, but at the same time possess the capability to harm one another-a stage where interdependence contains seeds of confrontation that may result in the extinction of mankind. So, while we still stand a chance, let us not pass the opportunity to build such systems and institutions, which will ensure a more equitable and just political and economic order indispensable to the survival and progress of mankind.\n95.\tMy delegation has on several occasions hailed detente as a process of special importance. When the Final Act of Helsinki was signed in 1975, we acclaimed it as a significant step towards easing the atmosphere of suspicion and enmity of the European continent, thereby greatly enhancing the prospect for more constructive relations between, all countries in this region. But, while noting the hopeful developments in East-West relations, the limited scope of this process, both in substance and in geographical extent, never escaped our notice. Detente should not be a mere preoccupation with East-West affairs, but should also address itself to finding solutions in respect to problems affecting North-South relations, giving more positive response to the legitimate demands of the developing countries for the establishment of an equitable world economic order.\n96.\tThe establishment of a new international order is undoubtedly in the objective interest of the entire world community. The Conference of non-aligned countries in Colombo advanced this ideal by adopting a number of positions of great importance to the Members of the United Nations. The decisions taken by that Conference will certainly help to encourage the establishment of a new order in international relations, one based upon co-operation and the equality of all States.\n97.\tTrue to its firm adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, the non-aligned movement has always sought to commit itself to the cause of the strengthening of the role of this Organization. Non-alignment will, therefore, never lend itself to become the instrument of fragmentation of the United Nations. Let me quote in this regard a paragraph from the statement before this Assembly of the distinguished current Chairman of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Bandaranaike, and I quote:\n\\\"I have said this before, but it will bear repetition as there are still some nations which look upon non-alignment as a new alignment, a new bloc, even a new threat The world should not be victim to this fear and distrust of a movement which came into being as a creative alternative to mutual suspicion, recrimination and hate.\\\" [11th meeting, para. 85.]\n98.\tIndonesia will continue to support the historic policy of the non-aligned movement and to promote constructive co-operation when and wherever possible.\n99.\tThe region of South-East Asia finds itself now in the wake of new realities and, therefore, new challenges. Indonesia, together with the other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], has given a positive, and at the same time a realistic, response to these changes and challenges.\n100.\tThe strategic and economic importance of South\u00acEast Asia has made the region the subject of rivalry and competition for influence and control among the big Powers. The leaders of ASEAN realized that the time had come for the States of the region to co-operate and to stand together in order to take their destiny in their own hands, free from outside interference. It is in conformity with this resolve that the ASEAN countries in 1971 called for the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. The determination of ASEAN to materialize the aspirations of zonal peace and stability, free from external interference and big-Power rivalry was reaffirmed on 24 February of this year at Denpasar in Bali, where the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the ASEAN countries pledged to take active steps for its early establishment.\n101.\tI submit that it was in the same spirit and because of identical preoccupations that the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries expressed concern that, as a result of recent developments, the Indian Ocean is becoming the main focus of big-Power rivalry in Asia through growing competition among the big Powers for naval superiority. In this context of continuing rivalry and arms escalation, the establishment of zones of peace in areas such as the Indian Ocean, South-East Asia or any other area in the world had, therefore, assumed a new urgency. And it is in this context also that my Government strongly supports the proposal to convene as soon as possible a conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean in order to coordinate efforts in seeking the accelerated implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n102.\tWe are all aware that since the end of the Second World War there have been nearly continuous rounds of negotiations to end the arms race. In addition, every year the General Assembly has before it an ever-growing number of items dealing with disarmament. Yet, the results so far achieved are far from satisfactory. The escalation of the arms race has now reached even more frightening proportions.\n103.\tWhile Indonesia remains committed to tKe idea of convening a world disarmament conference, my delegation reaffirms its support to the initiative taken by the non- aligned countries at the Fifth Conference in Colombo to convene not later than 1978 a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations to be devoted to the problems of disarmament. We strongly believe that such a special session might be able to generate a break-through in the stalemate that so far has characterized disarmament negotiations. It is therefore our hope that the present session will be able to decide to convene this special session in order that preparatory work can soon be started.\n104.\tMy delegation cannot but view with deep concern the increasing deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. Today we are still confronted by Israel's persistent policy of occupation by force, by the establishment of permanent settlements in the occupied territories and by the alteration of their geographical, demographic and economic features and the destruction of their cultural aspects. My delegation hopes that the present session of our Assembly will be able to intensify its efforts to secure a comprehensive, just and lasting solution in the Middle East. Indonesia's views on the basic requisites for such a solution and its unswerving and total support for the cause of our Arab brothers and for the fundamental rights of the Palestinian nation need no reiteration. I would like to affirm Indonesia's readiness to extend all possible support to the struggle of our Arab brothers to regain their moral, legal and historical rights.\n105.\tThe tragedy that has befallen the people of Lebanon is a matter of deep distress and concern to the Government and people of Indonesia. The discouraging absence of a solution to Lebanon's deepening crisis has already caused incredible suffering to the people. On certain occasions there seemed to emerge a ray of hope that the contending armed factions would be reconciled. However, again and again these slender hopes have evaporated into oblivion, and fighting has been resumed in all ferocity. My delegation therefore expresses its sincerest hope that the forthcoming summit meeting of Arab leaders in Cairo will finally succeed in putting an end to further suffering of the unfortunate people of Lebanon.\n106.\tIndonesia views with deep regret the stalemate that has occurred in the talks under the aegis of the United Nations between the two communities in Cyprus. It is our hope that these talks could be resumed so that renewed efforts could be made towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement that would preserve the territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus, in which the two communities can live together in harmony as equal partners and on an equal footing.\n107.\tIt must give the Assembly somehow a certain sense of relief that our present session is absolved from the consideration of the perennial problem of Korea. Indonesia believes that the solution of the problem of Korea should first and foremost come as a result of the efforts of the Korean people themselves. In this context, the creation of an atmosphere conducive to a continued and direct dialogue between North and South Korea is of the utmost importance. All efforts should proceed from a recognition of existing realities on the peninsula. Disregarding these realities can bring no other result than the further aggravation of the situation.\n108.\tA problem of crisis proportions has for some time engulfed southern Africa, caused by the persistent and stubborn pursuance of the policies of apartheid, colonialism and racist minority rule. The violence that has recently erupted in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe is, however, testimony to the indomitable determination of the peoples of the subregion to resist oppression and the degradation of human dignity.\n109.\tFor years the minority regime in Southern Rhodesia had defied United Nations sanctions and arrogantly rejected any approaches made by African States, as set out in the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa,  to settle the problems of southern Africa by peaceful means. The heroic struggle of the Zimbabwe people has now, however, forced the illegal regime to bow to the inevitable and to open the door for majority rule long overdue.\n110.\tThe white minority racist regime of Pretoria displays the same arrogance by intensifying its repressive measures against the Namibian people, causing untold misery and deprivation, which come only as the natural result of its hideously inhuman policy of apartheid. The international community cannot be deceived by the recent maneuvers of the Pretoria regime to perpetuate its rule by dividing the Namibian leaders and by excluding the representative of the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ from the so-called constitutional conferences. SWAPO, which is the only movement recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the United Nations as the sole representative of the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people, should be accorded a decisive role in the determination of the future political status of Namibia. The tragic events in Soweto and other places, which have shocked the human conscience all over the world, showed the indomitable determination of the people of Azania to put an end to the policies of apartheid.\n111.\tIn conformity with relevant resolutions adopted by the Colombo Conference, Indonesia reaffirms its solidarity and pledges all possible support to the gallant people of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania in their struggle to regain freedom, justice and human dignity. While Indonesia commends all efforts that have been undertaken to achieve a negotiated settlement for the problems in the southern Africa subregion, we are, at the same time, of the view that utmost vigilance should still be exercised, as the regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury are doing their utmost to procrastinate in order to win time and attempt to strengthen their already tottering power. In this regard, Indonesia shares the view expressed by the Presidents of the \\\"front-line\\\" States in the subregion in their statement of 26 September that no solution would be acceptable if it were \\\"tantamount to legalizing the colonialist and racialist structures of power\\\".\n112.\tWhile in the sphere of international peace and security the world has been spared from armed conflicts of a global dimension, this situation is continuously being threatened by persistent inequalities and discrepancies in the international economic scene. Economic backwardness and stagnation, mass poverty and unemployment continue to be the condition of the vast majority of mankind. This situation has to be rapidly improved if our achievement is to be preserved and fostered.\n113.\tIt is widely recognized that the basic cause of this deplorable condition has its roots in the structural imbalances in the international economic relationship. We are all committed to build a better world economy based on equality and justice, for which we had adopted at the sixth special session the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n114.\tThe seventh special session, which followed and was hailed as a milestone in international negotiations, has set in motion the process of restructuring the world economic system through a series of negotiations. The results of the seventh special session indeed represent the first global consensus on the need to restructure the international economic system substantially in favor of the less fortunate countries. The progress in the implementation of this consensus has so far been extremely slow, and in certain areas there is indeed no forward movement at all. But as our outgoing President rightly stated at the opening meeting of this session, it is a source of encouragement that tills problem of sharing fairly the resources of the world continues to be the focal point of our debates. It was notably at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi this year that an important stage was reached in the restructuring process as called for in the decision of the seventh special session. Although clearly falling short of the aspirations of the developing countries as contained in the Manila Declaration,  a number of decisions reached at Nairobi can be regarded as essential steps forward in the continuing progress towards the goals as envisaged in the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n115.\tIn the area of world commodity trade, a field of vital interest to the economies of developing countries, general consensus was for the first time obtained for the integrated program for commodities, including a common set of objectives, interrelated measures and agreed procedures, as well as a specific time-table for the negotiation of a number of individual commodities and the common fund. As a result of these decisions on commodities, we are to embark upon a major negotiating process over the next two years. These negotiations will provide us with a real opportunity and challenge to bring about a significant break-through in our efforts to arrive at the new international economic order.'\n116.\tIn the fields of manufactures and the transfer of technology, important advances were also made on the major issues involved. A significant decision was also taken on the institutional issue, which considerably strengthened the role and function of UNCTAD as a major forum for negotiations within the United Nations system.\n117.\tMy delegation has however noted with dismay that no progress was made at the fourth session of UNCTAD with regard to money and finance. No measures could be agreed upon for an increase of financial flow to the developing countries. No satisfactory solution could be found to the critical debt problems of the developing countries. My delegation is aware of the urgency of the need to find a comprehensive solution to these problems, and of the serious political and economic implications of prolonged failure to do so. The performance of the International Development Strategy in the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade is indeed disappointing in many important areas, including the area of money and finance. The net flow of official development assistance not only remained below the target set for the Decade, but its distribution was hardly related to the development needs. There has, however, been an encouraging increase of the share of the developing countries in world financing flows, in particular from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has injected a dynamic element into the picture.\n118.\tThe pressing need for development finance on a continuing and expanding basis has time and again been emphasized on successive occasions at various forums. We therefore earnestly hope that positive response be given to the appeal made by the Mexico Conference of the Group of 77,  which urged the donor countries to demonstrate their goodwill regarding the fifth replenishment of the International Development Association and at the same time also urged the member countries of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to agree to significantly increase the Bank's capital.\n119.\tAnother point, which I wish to refer to with regard to the Mexico Conference, is its consensus which took note of the proposal of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Zulikar Ali Bhutto, on a summit conference of the Developing Countries of the third world [see A/31/208]. Indonesia is giving this important proposal the serious consideration it deserves.\n120.\tThe non-aligned Conference in Colombo undertook a comprehensive assessment and review of the results of the multilateral trade negotiations, the Kingston Conference, the fourth session of UNCTAD, the Paris Conference, and arrived at a number of important conclusions and decisions which will have an important bearing on our future negotiations. Failure to achieve significant results could then seriously jeopardize the spirit of dialogue which was hailed as the most important achievement of the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n121.\tAn essential element that is bound to make a significant contribution to the restructuring of the old economic order is the realization of the concept of collective self-reliance through strengthening economic cooperation among developing countries. My Government has long since been aware of the potential benefits which can be derived from such co-operation. For the past decade, the countries of ASEAN have been actively engaged in seeking joint solutions to problems of national development and regional co-operation with a view to strengthening their individual as well as collective resilience and self-reliant growth.\n122.\tOver the years, ASEAN has gradually evolved into an increasingly effective vehicle to co-ordinate policies both in regard to intra-ASEAN problems as well as in safeguarding ASEAN's economic interests vis-a-vis the developed countries. With the recent signing of the Declaration of ASEAN Concord at the Bali Conference another major step forward has been made in concretizing and accelerating mutual co-operation in several important fields, such as the establishment of joint ASEAN industrial plants.\n123.\tThe complexities and injustices facing the world can be resolved only through joint and concerted action by the international community. The United Nations as the most universal instrument for collective action should be made more responsive to the requirements of the new economic order.\n124.\tAt the seventh special session, the international community recognized the need to make the United Nations system a more effective machinery for economic co-operation. We welcome the positive work undertaken by the Ad Hoc Committee,  which provides a useful basis for pursuing the approach of the restructuring process in the United Nations system. We share the view that the effectiveness of the General Assembly should be enhanced. There should be more coherence in the decision-making process of the United Nations system, and better synchronization of the work at the different levels of organs dealing with economic and social problems. The role of the Economic and Social Council as the central co-ordinating body should be revitalized. UNCTAD, as a major organ within the United Nations system, in which major elements of the new international economic order are increasingly brought up for negotiations and decisions, should be strengthened and made more effective.\n125.\tIndonesia attaches the greatest importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose mandate is to draw up a new international legal order of the sea. The success or failure of the Conference will indeed have far-reaching effects on mankind. Indonesia, being an archipelagic State which is vulnerable due to its strategic location at the cross-roads of international communications, has a vital interest that the outcome of the Conference will safeguard its security, territorial integrity and national unity. The fifth session of the Conference has just ended a month ago. We have noted with caution that in certain areas some progress leading to a consensus or agreement has been made. Unfortunately, however, this did not prove sufficient to bring about general agreement on concrete texts, since progress in those areas has been thwarted by deadlock in others, such as the question of the regime for the international sea-bed and the problem of the rights of States in the exclusive economic zone. Moreover, acceptable balanced formulations on some other issues, like passage through straits used for international navigation, have yet to be found. It is our sincere hope that the coming sixth session will be the last substantive one and that comprehensive agreements can be reached on all issues, not only on the so-called \\\"key issues\\\" or \\\"priority issues\\\", but equally so on issues of vital interest to a certain number of countries, such as the regime of archipelagic States. I take this opportunity to express Indonesia's deep appreciation to those friendly countries who have given their support and sympathy to Indonesia's position on the principles relating to archipelagic States.\n126.\tWith regard to the problem of the taking of hostages, Indonesia welcomes the initiative taken by the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany,, which will enable us to consider this issue in all its aspects [A/311242].\n127.\tI believe that an expression of appreciation is due to our .Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the efforts he has exerted in the interest of our Organization during his tenure. His dedication has contributed much to the strengthening of the effectiveness of the United Nations.\n128.\tThe delegation of Indonesia has been gratified by the many positive accomplishments achieved by the United Nations, often in the face of great obstacles. The attainment of these accomplishments owes much to the near universality of membership in our Organization and to the growing awareness which it has demonstrated of the need to create a new system of political and economic relationships based on peace and the recognition of the equality of all States. My delegation is confident that in the coming years the United Nations will play an even more significant role in the application of these progressive principles to international relations.\n129.\tBefore concluding, may I take this opportunity to present our views regarding East Timor. I shall confine my remarks to a brief review of our position and to an explanation of the latest developments in East Timor. From the outset Indonesia has made it clear that it has no territorial ambitions in East Timor. It has always insisted that the political future of East Timor should be decided through the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of that Territory. These are the underlying principles of Indonesia's position as reflected in its record in the United Nations, where Indonesia supported the aspirations of all dependent peoples and their national liberation movements throughout the world. It is upon the basis of these principles that Indonesia responded to developments in East Timor.\n130.\tAt the town of Balibo in East Timor on 30 November, 1975 four political parties (Uniao Democratica de Timor, Apodeti, Kota and Trabalhista) representing the majority of the people of that territory proclaimed their decision to become independent through integration with the Republic of Indonesia. While welcoming this decision, the Government of Indonesia expressed at the same time its considered view that such a decision should be based upon the result of the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of East Timor. After normalcy had returned to the territory, the people of East Timor exercised on 31 May 1976 their right to self-determination through the People's Representative Assembly, whose members were elected in accordance with established customary practice in East Timor. Having taken this action, the people of East Timor declared that as of that date they had already exercised their right to self-determination and thereby had concluded the process of decolonization of their Territory. And now the people are concentrating their efforts on the task of reconstruction and development.\n131.\tThe constitutional process of the integration was subsequently completed on 17 July 1976, when a statute of integration was formally promulgated by the President of the Republic of Indonesia. It was with great emotion that the people of East Timor listened to President Suharto, when he declared on 16 August 1976 before the House of Representatives:\n\\\"Now the people of East Timor have made the decision about their own future, namely integration with the people and State of the Republic of Indonesia. There is no other way, therefore, but to accept with full responsibility such an integration. And now, from this forum, on the eve of the commemoration of the thirty-first anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, I hereby officially inform the people of Indonesia, the people of East Timor and the world that the people and the territory of East Timor have been integrated with the people of Indonesia, within, the unitary State of the Republic, in compliance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of East Timor themselves, and this integration was warmly accepted by the entire Indonesian people and nation.\\\"\n132. In the history of decolonization no two cases have ever been implemented in the same way. Each case has to be viewed in its own particular situation and circumstances, taking into account the historical, social, cultural and political realities which prevail in the territory concerned. What is even more important is that the right to self-determination should be exercised on the basic precepts of the Charter which stipulate that \\\"the interests of the inhabitants of the Territory are paramount\\\".\n133. These paramount interests were translated by th-j people of East Timor in their declaration to integrate with the Republic of Indonesia expressed in a manner of their own choosing and in conformity with their traditional institutions. Consequently, the people of East Timor have exercised their right to self-determination in accordance with the provisions of the .Charter and of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). In his statement before the House of Representatives on 16 August 1976 President Suharto stated:\n\\\"Time and again we have stated that the East Timor problem is a question of self-determination. It is a problem of abolishing colonialism. The fate of the people of East Timor can only be decided by themselves and right there on the soil of East Timor, neither in New York, nor in Lisbon, nor in Jakarta.\\\"\n134.\tThe people of East Timor have made their decision. Indonesia respects it. And it is our hope that this decision will also be respected by all members of the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me first of all, Mr. President, to convey to you the warm salutations of His Excellency Abdel Halim Khaddam, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, who, because of some important duties, is unable to attend today's meeting in person but who has entrusted me with the honorable task of delivering his statement before this august Assembly. It is my pleasurable duty to fulfill that task and to add to all that he has expressed in his statement regarding your election to the very high office of the Presidency of the General Assembly my personal expressions of high esteem and admiration.\n47.\tIt pleases me to commence my statement by stating how proud we are, Sir, of your assuming the presidency of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. We all know the role you have played since you assumed the representation of your esteemed country at the United Nations in upholding. the principles of the international organization and supporting the rights of the underprivileged peoples, as well as in the constant initiatives you have taken to uphold justice. In doing so, you have expressed the adherence of your country to the principles of right and its major contribution to the call for liberating humanity from slavery and backwardness. The last initiative taken by your country in this connexion was the recent Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and the efforts Sri Lanka exerted for its success. Therefore, please accept our best wishes for your continued success. Hope is pinned on the present session for consolidating the bases of right, justice, peace and progress.\n48.\tOn this occasion, I likewise praise Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the previous session, for the efficient way in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirtieth session and for his endeavors to translate its deeds into tangible results.\n49.\tWe are meeting today after having taken another step towards the universality of the United Nations through the admission of Seychelles to our Organization. We congratulate that State on the sovereignty and independence that have crowned its struggle and we welcome it as an active Member in our midst. We hope to take more steps forward towards the universality of this Organization, so as to see in our midst the representatives of Angola and Viet Nam -those two heroic peoples who deserve the world's admiration and who, through the misuse of the veto in the Security Council, have so far been denied admission to the United Nations. We are certain of the victory of the cause of right and we are confident that the complete liberation of the peoples who are still divided and denied entity and independence by the proponents of aggression and racism will soon be consummated. We earnestly look forward to the day when all these peoples will become Members of this Organization and share in enhancing co-operation, security and peace.\n50.\tLast, but not least, I take this opportunity to praise the untiring efforts exerted by Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, in the service of justice, progress and peace. We would like to assure him of the continued support of the Syrian Arab Republic in the pursuit of these efforts.\n51.\tThe present session of the General Assembly is meeting today, following an event that attracted the attention of the whole world. Two months ago, the Fifth Conference of the non-aligned countries met in Colombo, where the Heads of State or Government of 85 States met and issued declarations and resolutions that embodied the will of more than half the countries of the world to affirm the identity of the non-aligned movement, upholding it and affirming its principles. Events have proved that these humane and international principles are designed to achieve justice, equality and coexistence among States and peoples.\n52.\tThe fundamental significance of the Colombo Conference lies in the determination of more than one half of the world population to rid themselves of the system of unequal relations; to establish democratic relations among nations in political, economic and scientific spheres; to eliminate all forms of colonialism, racism and apartheid; and to end domination, occupation, backwardness and deprivation. The Colombo Conference has proved that the non-aligned movement is moving with sure steps towards the realization of these goals. The clarity of concepts that characterized the work of the Conference enabled it to conform to international changes and to develop its positive aspects without deviating from the principles and bases of the non-aligned movement. We hope that the General Assembly will support the demands included in the declarations and resolutions of the Colombo Conference [see A/31 / 197], since all the stands and demands expressed therein are in full harmony with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\n53.\tInternational peace cannot be established as long as the differences between rich and poor countries remain as big as they are at present, the technological gap between industrial and developing nations continues to increase, and trade dealings remain tarnished with aspects of exploitation, rising prices of manufactured goods and production equipment, and declining prices of raw materials. Is the deficit suffered by the thirds world countries not a direct outcome of such exploitation? Are not the constant disturbances witnessed by the world monetary system, for which responsibility lies with the capitalist countries, a source of imbalance in world trade and an addition to the huge burdens already borne by the economies of the developing countries in order to overcome backwardness, accelerate the rate of development, and achieve economic and social progress for their toiling people?\n54.\tShould the economic strategies of the major industrial countries continue to be guided by the quest for maximum profits without regard for the principle of equal cooperation, and should they continue* to maintain their dealings with the developing countries on a purely materialistic, closed and narrow basis, and should they not appreciate the major problems whether current, medium term, or long term-and the burdens of the third world, and, consequently, participate seriously in relieving its debts and supporting its development, then the present world situation foreshadows an explosion the victim of which will be the whole of humanity.\n55.\tOur earnest desire for peace and the realization of true equality and the shaping of a better future for the overwhelming majority of mankind prompts us to press for the implementation of the resolutions adopted during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI), 3202 (S-VI) and 3362(S-Vn)], supported by the resolutions of the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ*, and by the Economic Declaration of the non-aligned Colombo Conference [Al31ll97l annex II], as well as of the resolutions of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries held in Mexico in September. \n56.\tOn this occasion, it should be pointed out that one of the foremost duties of our Organization is to implement the transfer of part of the funds spent by the super-Powers on the arms race to development purposes. The sincere appeals of the non-aligned and developing countries in this regard must not remain unheeded.\n57.\tWe, in the Syrian Arab Republic, believe that no solution can be found to the suffocating world economic crisis that would produce an impact on over-all international relations -particularly that of international co-operation- unless we expedite the establishment of a new international economic order based on equality, equal sovereignty, co-operation and common interests among all the countries of the world.\n58.\tWe hope the debates of the present session will yield the best positive results. Apart from the serious crises it has to deal with, this session has before it critical matters to tackle, since it is on the effective solutions for these issues that the future of humanity depends. Total disarmament, strategic arms limitation, the prevention of nuclear proliferation, and the convening of a world disarmament conference are problems that require a great deal of goodwill and constant effort, so that the resolutions shall not remain theoretical and without practical application in relieving tension and halting the arms race,\n59.\tThe whole of the human race pins its hopes on the exploration and use of the wealth in the bottom of seas and oceans for the sake of the whole of humanity. Therefore, it would be worth while if we move ahead in shaping the exact executive international framework that would realize such hopes in order to secure new sources of food supplies and eliminate hunger and backwardness.\n60.\tOf no less importance is the possibility of enacting advanced rules for maritime law and materializing the keen desire to safeguard the environment through tangible comprehensive measures that would eliminate all kinds of pollution threatening all nations.\n61.\tMoreover, the numerous economic, cultural and social matters whereby the Organization is trying to disseminate the spirit of the Charter in theory and practice and to ensure justice, equality and progress in the international community, must be given the greatest attention, since they help in strengthening international friendship and under-standing among peoples,, especially since attention is focused at present on the fruits of the international detente which we hope might become general, embracing all regions and not limited to European or to East-West relations.\n62.\tMoving to other spheres in which the United Nations plays a leading role, we note that, though decolonization is making important progress, this process, however, falters sometimes because of the obstinacy and maneuvers of some colonial Powers confronting it. Therefore, numerous peoples and regions are still struggling for their freedom and right to self-determination.\n63.\tRacism, which is causing many people great suffering, notably in South Africa and Rhodesia, is a shameful blot on the history of mankind and an obstacle to the advance of civilization. The racist regimes in those African regions persist in slaughtering African patriots and committing aggression against independent States, such as Angola and Zambia, even going so far as to occupy Namibia.\n64.\tThose regimes which are the enemies of mankind could not have persisted in their crimes were it not for the political, military, and economic support and backing they are receiving from some Western Powers and were it not for the close collaboration between the said regimes and the Zionist racist entity in occupied Palestine.\n65.\tWhile those racist regimes have managed to impose their existence through injustice and aggression, the awareness of the indigenous population was able to create national liberation movements that are endeavoring by every possible means to eliminate racism and its regimes and to create the necessary conditions enabling the peoples of those regions to exercise their right to self- determination, sovereignty and independence. We hail the struggle of the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe under the leadership of their liberation movements. We also applaud the decision of the Government of\nMozambique taken in March 1976 to close its borders with Southern Rhodesia, in application of the relevant United Nations resolutions. We call upon the General Assembly and the Security Council to take all measures under the Charter to help those peoples gain their liberation and to deter the racist regimes from pursuing their obnoxious policies and practices, and to force them to implement the pertinent United Nations resolutions.\n66.\tI feel duty-bound to declare our support for the just struggle waged by the people of Korea for the reunification of their country. We believe it has become necessary to eliminate the causes of tension and explosion in that part of the world by withdrawing all destructive weapons and all foreign forces from South Korea, and to commence dialog between the two parts of Korea aimed at their reunification.\n67.\tThe problem of Cyprus remains unsolved due to imperialist maneuvers and attempts to transform the island into a NATO base. We hereby declare the necessity of speeding up the implementation of the United Nations resolutions related to this problem. We call also for the respect of the sovereignty of the island, its independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment. We commend the efforts exerted by the United Nations Secretary-General for the resumption of negotiations between the two parties to the conflict.\n68.\tWhile we warmly welcome the Helsinki document and the constructive spirit enshrined in it, we still believe that any talk about international detente and European security remains inadequate if the causes of tension in the Middle East are not eliminated. This can be done only through the evacuation by the Zionist forces of all the occupied Arab territories, and the guaranteeing of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people as provided for by United Nations resolutions. The world community has realized this fact, as was manifested by the October war. It has also realized that the core of the problem is the Palestine question and the expulsion of the people of Palestine from their homeland, and Israel's occupation of this homeland in addition to its occupation of important Arab States in the region. Therefore, it was natural and logical to regard the policy of partial solutions and small steps as merely a policy of anesthetization and bluff, the failure of which has been proven by events. It has also been shown that the Sinai Agreement, signed over a year ago,  was nothing but a move that immobilized peace efforts and restored to the region the state of no war, no peace. Syria has therefore refused to fall into the trap of the agreement and has put an end to the step-by-step policy.\n69.\tThe maneuvers of imperialism and the enemies of peace have not stopped there. While the Arabs were struggling to recover their occupied territories, the forces hostile to the Arab nation concerted their efforts to provoke a new crisis in the Middle East. Those forces generated the events in Lebanon, which led to bloodshed and destruction and thus dimmed the hopes for a just peace in the region and diverted the Arabs' attention from the Palestine question and the path of struggle to secondary issues. The aims of these forces are to hamper the search for a just peace, to leave the problem unsolved, and to create one crisis after another, all for the sake of perpetuating Israel's occupation of Arab territories and keeping the Palestinian people displaced, and without a homeland.\n70.\tIn the face of this explosive situation, and considering the fraternal and national ties, as well as the special ties, which exist between Syria and Lebanon, and in response to the sentiments and to the appeals of the diverse parties to the correct in Lebanon, Syria had no alternative but to contribute to the efforts aimed at putting an end to the fratricidal fighting and to encourage the parties to find a common ground on which dialog would take place in a democratic manner. To do this, Syria has exerted all possible efforts. You are undoubtedly aware of all the steps that we have taken, the latest of which was our effective contribution to enabling the new President of Lebanon, Mr. Elias Sarkis, to assume his constitutional functions and to create the necessary positive conditions for him to be able to solve the crisis. We shall not fail or hesitate to provide him with all necessary assistance for the restoration of stability to our brothers in Lebanon and for the preservation of the country's territorial integrity and the national unity of its people.\n71.\tWe have also exerted every possible effort to alleviate the sufferings and diminish the difficulties of our Lebanese and Palestinian brethren in Lebanon. Syria has had, at the same time, to shoulder the burden and meet the daily needs of nearly 1 million Arab citizens-Lebanese, Palestinians and others-who fled death and hunger. These sincere efforts have been successful in bringing security and tranquility to vast regions in Lebanon. Syria is pursuing its national and humane efforts until the conspiracy against Lebanon, the Palestine cause and the Arab nation is completely defeated.\n72.\tIf the first task of our Organization is admittedly the consolidation of international peace and security, it follows that any talk about such peace and security cannot be separated from the Middle East situation, which is becoming increasingly explosive as a result of Israel's intransigence and its flouting of United Nations resolutions.\n73.\tThe Palestine question and the problems arising therefrom, notably the June 1967 aggression, have occupied the various bodies of the United Nations, especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, for nearly 30 years. The General Assembly has examined the Palestine question year after year until the number of resolutions adopted by the United Nations and its specialized organs on the Palestine question and its ramifications exceeded 360, towards which Israel has adopted an attitude of rejection and defiance.\n74.\tThis obstinacy and arrogance led to the October war, exposing the world to the menace of a new war. By pursuing this path, Israel is pushing the world once again to the verge of a general world conflict. Daily declarations and innumerable incidents confirm that the Zionist entity will not withdraw from the territories it occupied through aggression and that the Palestinian people will remain under occupation and in exile. Conflict will thus continue in the region, endangering international peace and security.\n75.\tFollowing the October war, the international community became aware of the dangers implicit in the troubled situation in this region. The United Nations was moved by the gravity of the tragedy of the Palestinian people. Engaged in settling the conflict with a measure of justice, and recognizing that the Palestine issue is the core of the Middle East problem, the United Nations has called upon Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The world community has also recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Palestinian people by receiving the Palestine Liberation Organization in the General Assembly and the Security Council as the representative of this people who voices their rights and aspirations.\n76.\tIsrael has gone far in its continued rejection of all the United Nations resolutions related to the Palestine cause and the Middle East problem. By such conduct, Israel has never, since its admission to the United Nations, departed from the line it set for itself, namely that of violating the principles of the Charter, of international law, of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the United Nations resolutions. Such conduct on the part of Israel is not to be wondered at, since its structure is founded on aggression and usurpation. Israel has never hesitated to .resort to lies and deceit although it undertook before the United Nations and in the context of its membership to abide unreservedly by the Charter and its principles, and to implement General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, and resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948 relating to the return of the refugees. It is high time for the General Assembly to act firmly and decisively and to assume its responsibilities and exercise its powers under the Charter by reconsidering Israel's membership in the United Nations. It is high time for the General Assembly to take the necessary measures with regard to the present explosive situation by implementing its resolutions 3236 (XXIX), and 3376 (XXX) on the question of Palestine and its resolution 3414 (XXX) on the situation in the Middle East. The General Assembly must determine the steps and timing of the implementation of the said resolutions and take practical measures both to ensure their effective implementation and to deter the recalcitrant party.\n77.\tHaving felt profoundly the grave injustice suffered by the Palestinian people, and desiring during its last session to implement the international will to do justice to this people and to restore their rights not only by reaffirming general principles but also by ensuring their practical application, the General Assembly adopted its historic resolution 3376 (XXX) relating to the establishment of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. The general functions of this Committee are based on the principles of the Charter and the United Nations resolutions. Its task is to draw up a procedural plan aimed at enabling the Palestinian people to exercise the rights recognized in resolution 3236 (XXIX).\n78.\tThis Committee has completed its task in the best possible manner and deserves the appreciation of the overwhelming majority of the members of the international community. In its report/A/31/35J, it specified the phases necessary for putting an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories occupied during the 1967 aggression.\n79.\tThis constructive initiative manifesting the will of the international community and the valuable work that has been accomplished by the Committee, was reaffirmed by the majority of the members of the Security Council. Last June, however, the United States vetoed the draft resolution approving the report of the Committee [ibid., annexes III and IV]. Thus, the United States aborted a valuable effort which was bound to achieve the most concrete tangible move towards the establishment of peace and justice in this strategic region, so vital to international peace and security. The United States veto this year also aborted two other attempts when we resorted to the Security Council, which is the highest international organ, and won the support of the majority of the Council's members. Thus the United States has blocked other paths that could have led to a just and durable peace.\n80.\tThe Zionist occupation of Arab territories following the June 1967 aggression has continued. Israel has persisted in carrying out its settler-colonialist plans and designs and in annexing the occupied territories, as well as in oppressing the Arab population in order to force it to submit permanently to occupation, or to depart. About 70 settlements have been established in the occupied territories.\n81.\tIn the face of all these aggressive acts, the Palestinian people had no alternative but to organize their ranks inside and outside the occupied territories and to fight with every means at their disposal to recover their usurped rights. This was the cause of the widespread popular uprising that has been raging in the occupied territories since last spring despite all the Nazi-type measures used by the forces of occupation to suppress the rebelling population and to perpetuate occupation.\n82.\tThe revolt of the Palestinian people and the Zionist- Nazi methods of annihilation and oppression, and the explosive situation in the Middle East have constituted a decisive answer to all those who imagined that Israel would withdraw from the occupied territories and would recognize the rights of the Palestinian people. A few months ago, the Israeli Cabinet faced an acute crisis because of a proposal to move a settlement that had been established in the vicinity of an Arab village. The Cabinet was about to collapse when some of the ministers considered that such a move contravened Israel's alleged right .to settle in the Arab territories. The Israeli Cabinet finally reached a compromise, namely to maintain the settlement until another location could be found in the occupied West Bank. If the relocation of a colony illegally established on Arab territories has caused a Cabinet crisis, is it at all possible to believe that Israel might withdraw from the occupied territories or recognize the rights of the Palestinian people?\n83.\tWe are striving for peace. However, the desired peace we are eager to attain through your help and that of all peace and justice-loving peoples is the just and durable peace that would ensure for us the complete restoration of all our occupied territories and of the national right of the Palestinians.\n84.\tWe have spared no effort and we have tried to seize every opportunity to achieve this aim. We have welcomed, and still welcome, every initiative conducive to the implementation of the United Nations resolutions in conformity with the principles we have repeatedly affirmed. The first principle is that any initiative that ignores and disregards the unity of the cause and does not aim at a comprehensive solution perpetuates stalemate and carries with it the germs of a flare-up. The second principle is that any initiative that is not based on the recognition of the complete and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and on total withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967 is in contravention with the principles of the Charter and United Nations resolutions, and is doomed to failure. The third principle is that any international effort made to establish a just and lasting peace without the participation of the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people as a principal party equal to the other parties concerned is in contravention to the General Assembly resolutions, and deprives the desired peace of its basic factors of justice, continuity and comprehensiveness.\n85.\tIn addition to this, we believe that any delay in seeking means to avoid the current stalemate or in implementing the United Nations resolutions would inevitably lead to a heightening of the tension in the region and would expose peace and security in the Middle East and in the entire world to grave dangers.\n86.\tWe can sum up the three-year period that has elapsed since the October war of liberation-whose third anniversary we are celebrating today-by saying that all peace initiatives in the Middle East have been obstructed by Israel's aggression and colonialist tyranny. So long as serious and constructive efforts towards peace stand immobilized and paralyzed in the face of doors hermetically sealed by Zionism and imperialism, the only course left open to our people is to continue the struggle by all means until our aims, which in fact are the aims of the Charter, and the aims of the General Assembly resolutions, are achieved. The October war has proved that we possess the necessary and adequate potential and that we are capable of utilizing it, and that we have no alternative but to utilize it should peace efforts continue to fail. This makes it incumbent upon our Organization to stand firm against the aggressor and to deprive it of means of aggression and compel it to carry out the provisions of the United Nations Charter and resolutions.\n87.\tAchieving the desired peace depends on the earnest desire of the members of the General Assembly to implement the resolutions adopted by them, resolutions based on the principles of the Charter. Members of the Assembly, we are fully confident of your belief in the Charter and your eagerness to consolidate the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security, as well as in establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This can be achieved only if you determine the steps and time phases for the implementation of your resolutions, and if you adopt the practical steps that would ensure such implementation and would deter the aggressor and force it to heed the decisions of the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a true honor for me to speak on behalf of Bolivia from this, the most lofty platform of the international community. The United Nations General Assembly is the universal parliament par excellence and in accordance with the principle of universality, there coexist in this Assembly nations which, like mine, advocate peace, proclaim brotherly cooperation, support integral and shared development and favor equality and solidarity in international relations. In this context, we must assume fully the inescapable commitment to work resolutely for a future of security and hope for all peoples.\n103.\tMany are the items to which we must devote our attention at the current session. Their number and importance is obviously in keeping with the most disquieting problems of contemporary life.\n104.\tBefore giving the views of Bolivia on a number of these items, which concern not only my country but the international community as a whole, I should like, on behalf of the Government and people of Bolivia, to convey the most cordial greetings to the delegations present here and, in particular, to the President of this Assembly, the distinguished statesman from Sri Lanka, Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe.\n105.\tSimilarly, I should like to convey our appreciation to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for his able conduct of our deliberations during the last General Assembly.\t\n106.\tMay I also, at the same time, pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his unswerving dedication to peace and understanding throughout the world.\n107.\tBolivia is likewise happy to extend a warm welcome to the State of Seychelles, which has joined our Organization as a Member, thus strengthening the faith of all peoples in the United Nations.\n108.\tIt is clear that since the adoption of the San Francisco Charter new realities have emerged. The principles it incorporated 31 years ago, however, still retain their full validity. For this reason, the Government of Bolivia wishes to reiterate its respect for the norms of civilized coexistence, which must be decisively strengthened as a foundation for the great edifice of peace, security and development.\n109.\tWe wish to maintain our support of the postulate of universality in international relations. In rejecting foreign interference and intervention in all its forms, we recognize the legitimate right of peoples to choose their own means for the achievement of their national destiny.\n110.\tWe belong to a society characterized by diversity; our desire for solidarity with all States is bounded only by respect for our sovereignty and for the loyal interdependence that characterizes our times.\n111.\tPlurality mast undoubtedly be interpreted as the result of the observance of the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and juridical equality among nations. Otherwise, we would fall into the historic error of seeking to achieve unity by following the course of divergency.\n112.\tIt is my Government's view that, for the full exercise of these lofty principles, there must be absolute respect for human dignity and condemnation of any discriminatory practices. We therefore reaffirm our support of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.\n113.\tThe classical tension produced by the desire for predominance of the great Powers has relaxed as a result of the constant action of this august body, since such attitudes do not represent the constructive contribution that mankind expects for development untrammeled by the fear and uncertainty.\n114.\tWorld tension, however, still exists and today assumes different features that are equally dangerous for the maintenance of peace and that stem from the imbalances to be covered in the general picture of international economic relations.\n115.\tI firmly repeat that we shall not achieve the society of well-being to which we aspire if conditions prevail that allow the prosperity of the wealthier nations to become a threat of greater poverty and dependency to the developing countries. This is one of the major concerns I feel should be sincerely expressed at this time.\n116.\tHie task of consolidating a democratic international order entails the need to effect the historic task of eliminating injustices from economic relations, a matter of paramount importance alluded to by His Excellency, the President of Bolivia, General Hugo Banzer Suarez, last year in this same Assembly. \n117.\tThe developing countries advocate the establishment in this era of interdependence of political and juridical instruments enabling them to participate effectively in economic decision-making.\n118.\tAny refusal or attempt to limit the right and the responsibility of our countries to participate in the establishment of a new international economic order could give rise to new and prolonged tension which might endanger peace and security.\n119.\tThe concept of that new order should unquestionably be based on the resolute political will of all countries-large and small, rich and poor- to achieve the goals set in the different spheres of co-operation, because nothing will have been gained if, despite the commitments assumed in different international forums, some industrialized nations continue to give piecemeal and reluctant co-operation to the detriment of the economy of the less favored nations where poverty is rampant.\n120.\tIn the field of trade we are, it is true, endeavoring to remove a series of obstacles preventing access of products from the developing countries to the markets of the economically powerful nations on satisfactory conditions. Regrettably, it is equally true that, while we use our imagination and our acts to endeavor to overcome these difficulties, new restrictions are being created at the same time.\n121.\tIn practice, this simply transmutes in different ways the negative effects that it was intended to eliminate. Thus equitable participation by the developing countries in the expansion of world trade is prevented.\n122.\tSuch policies cause damage of unforeseeable con-sequences to those nations that are desperately trying to obtain the well-being to which their peoples are legitimately entitled.\n123.\tI must point out that such difficulties greatly weaken the will for world co-operation and destroy faith in the establishment of a future forged in solidarity and justice.\n124.\tOne of the questions that has caused the greatest concern is that relating to the prices of raw materials and stability in the supply of such products.\n125.\tIt is desirable, in respect of this very pertinent matter, to adopt equitable criteria in order to determine truly fair and just levels for the prices of primary commodities. A strongly subjective factor comes into play here. For the highly developed countries, just and fair prices tend to be those which improve their already abundant economies. For the developing countries, remunerative prices can be none other than those which guarantee effective margins of earnings from their exports. Only thus can they give the necessary impulse to their industrialization process.\n126.\tWe mention these facts because they are the premise of the ideal goal of raw material producers' associations. We believe that these associations pursue the objectives I have mentioned and not that of confrontation, as some would have us believe-an attitude not shared by my country, since we know that thus we would only increase tension and imbalances.\n127.\tQuite to the contrary, we hope that through frank, direct and equable dialog between producers and consumers it will be possible for large and small countries to reconcile their mutual interests.\n128.\tFor Bolivia this question is of paramount importance because our export earnings depend on the stability of the prices of commodities and internationally guaranteed levels of remuneration. Consequently, we believe that the disruption produced in world trade by the dumping of strategic reserves practiced periodically by some States constitutes a policy alien to the spirit of co-operation underlying the objectives implicit in the achievement of collective eco\u00acnomic security.\n129.\tIn this context Bolivia propounds the effective adoption of a bilateral or multilateral consultative system capable of preventing adverse and disrupting effects for the developing countries, whose economies depend on their exports of primary commodities and raw materials.\n130.\tIn keeping with the statement made by the delegation of Bolivia from this same rostrum during the twenty-ninth General Assembly,  I wish to reiterate that my country is still convinced of the need to establish within the appropriate organs of the United Nations automatic mechanisms for linking and adjusting the prices of the commodities exported by the developing countries with the manufactures produced by the industrialized countries. Thus we would prevent the continued erosion of the true value of exports from the developing countries and would lay the bases for the replacement of confrontation between producers and consumers by dialog.\n131.\tWhile it is true that the fourth session of UNCTAD did not yield the expected positive results, partly because of the reticent attitude of some of the developed countries, it is desirable to recognize the significance of the resolution relating to an integrated program for primary commodities which was adopted by the Conference  and which has led to the establishment of a primary commodity stabilization fund of great interest to the economically disadvantaged countries. The implementation of the program will make it possible to introduce rational elements in this very sensitive aspect of international economic relations, such as the aforesaid primary commodity trade.\n132.\tIt is also desirable to point out the adoption within the framework of the United Nations of a normative system for the establishment of appropriate bodies to ensure access by our countries to technology, which is a basic requirement if we are to overcome the obstacles of underdevelopment.\n133.\tMay we also say that we adhere to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], which was strengthened by the adoption of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].\n134.\tWe also hope that the set of principles and measures set forth in those instruments will make possible in a period of time meeting the expectations of the developing countries the reversal of the existing imbalances as a result of which the indebtedness in the balance of payments of the peripheral countries has grown enormously in the last biennium.\n135.\tWe would have nothing to add to the statements already made in favor of the harmonious and integral development of peoples.\n136.\tThe principles have been laid down; we have the appropriate mechanisms. All we need is resolute political decision to implement them, and this is the fundamental question on which we should focus all our attention.\n137.\tHowever not all the disruptive factors are to be found in the area of economic requirements. There are other situations to which we must also devote our special attention.\n138.\tWe cannot remain impassive observers of the conflicts that are localized in different regions of the world and in respect of which there appears to be no solution in the offing.\n139.\tAt a time in which awe-inspiring advances are made in the conquest of outer space, the formidable creative potential of human intelligence cannot resign itself to accept the idea that armed and fratricidal confrontation is the only alternative to the situations that divide us.\n140.\tThere is an imperative need to strengthen the will for conciliation of conflicting interests. I therefore believe that it is our inescapable duty to address an appeal to those parties that have assumed attitudes of confrontation so that they may exercise tolerance and bend every effort to find rapid solutions through peaceful means.\n141.\tWe also appeal to the spirit of co-operation of those States which, by reason of their size, bear the greatest responsibility in this area, so that they may try to prevent, by every possible means, the search for independence or political controversies becoming the arena of the most acute ideological antagonisms. Mankind would highly appreciate those noble demonstrations of concession for the sake of peace.\n142.\tConsistent with these views we honor those who, imbued with a spirit of understanding, have decided to tackle their problems jointly while sharing responsibilities. \n143.\tThat is the clear-cut and categorical response that mankind needs if it is to go forward along the path of constant improvement.\n144.\tWe sincerely hope that this attitude will prevail in contemporary international relations, and in particular in the inter-American community, thus strengthening the bonds of lasting friendship in the regional area to which Bolivia belongs.\n145.\tConsequently we view with pleasure the pursuance of negotiations in this direction under such enlightened leadership between the Republic of Panama and the United States of America on the Canal question and express our wishes for their happy conclusion.\n146.\tBolivia wishes to reiterate its repudiation of violence whether it assumes the form of armed or covert aggression.\n147.\tTerrorism has caused many victims and its dark threat which knows no boundaries hangs over us all in an increasingly alarming manner.\n148.\tThis escalation of irrational, systematized violence cannot be a valid means on which to base the legitimacy of any claim, be it political, economic or social.\n149.\tIt is the pressing duty of the international com\u00acmunity to agree on the most effective means of eradicating the proliferation of these practices, which offend the conscience of civilized man, which ought to be the guide of our times.\n150.\tIn this connexion we give our firm support to the initiative on this question taken by the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany [AI31I242J.\n151.\tI cannot but mention the serious concern of my country at the staggering upward trend of the arms race. We see with profound discouragement that, compared with the very modest progress of negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons, we are now astounded by the announcement that military and' weaponry expenditures have exceeded in 1975 the figure of $300 billion.\n152.\tIt is difficult to understand that while gigantic resources are earmarked for the manufacture of some weapons and the development of others which are capable of changing our earth's environment and even of exterminating our species, the execution of work which would lead to progress is stopped or limited because of insufficient financing.\n153.\tWhat is more, the arms escalation has extended.to developing countries, a fact which exposes certain areas, including the American continent, to the possibility of becoming hotbeds of tension, as a result of which the aspirations of their inhabitants, who seek to achieve minimum levels of well-being consonant with the dignity and worth of the human person, will be postponed.\n154.\tAt the beginning of my statement, I said that it was the inalienable right of peoples to choose the means most in keeping with their historic traditions to achieve their aspirations.\n155.\tFor this reason, the Nationalist Government of Bolivia, presided over by General Hugo Banzer Suarez, as the authentic interpreter of the feelings and desires of our people, proposed to Bolivia in 1971 an all-important historical option.\n156.\tFive years of fruitful government in my country have shown that only through order, unity, social peace, political stability and institutional continuity is it possible to lay the foundations for speedy and comprehensive national development.\n157.\tThe President of Bolivia, at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, elaborated on the results and prospects of the work of his Government, which has the backing of a broad national consensus of all Bolivia's nationals.\n158.\tThis great Assembly, which is concerned with all matters relating to the consolidation of peace and security and the removal of obstacles, to growing co-operation among peoples, is well aware of heritage need of my country to be once again linked to the sea by means of free and sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.\n159.\tIn order to attain the most fundamental objective of the Bolivian nation and in conformity with our conviction that major solutions can only be achieved through frank and constructive dialog, last year we opened diplomatic negotiations with the Republic of Chile-negotiations which have now assumed the greatest historical significance.\n160.\tThe President of Bolivia, General Hugo Banzer Suarez, as a statesman who wishes to make a personal and direct contribution to the establishment of harmonious international coexistence based on real justice and solidarity and bearing in mind that Bolivia's maritime cause is closely connected with the prevalence of those ideals, informed the last session of the General Assembly of the scope of the present negotiations, based on the Bolivian proposal for peace, development and integration.\n161.\tWe wish to go on record as stating that the raison d'etre of that formula is based on Bolivia's decision to regain access to the sea in full sovereignty, contributing to the harmonious coexistence of neighboring nations, and to this end it had chosen the instrument of dialog and the search for a shared development in order to achieve its aim of achieving access to the southern Pacific.\n162.\tBolivia's land-locked position has detracted from the effectiveness of internal efforts to promote its economic, social and cultural development and limited its participation in Latin American integration processes.\n163.\tThe negotiations designed to resolve the problem of my country's geographical encirclement are going forward under the auspices of America, as was decided at Atlanta and Ayacucho. They are at the same time supported by the conviction of world public opinion that the building of a sound future must be based on a common determination to achieve equanimity and justice.\n164.\tThe perpetuation of situations that are not in keeping with these principles would mean abandoning the constant moral values of the international community.\n165.\tFor all these reasons, and because the legitimacy of Bolivia's maritime cause is clear and a spirit of broad understanding must prevail among the parties involved, we shall continue steadfastly along the path that will lead to the total solution which we are advocating. In this way, the sovereign return of Bolivia to the Pacific Ocean will, through the completion of the dialog currently in progress, become a tangible reality.\n166.\tBolivia is participating with great determination in making its utmost contribution to the efforts to achieve this goal, which will be an enduring example of what can be done in the Americas through a firm and brotherly will to reach understanding. It is also doing so because this undertaking is of such importance that it requires full support and because it will arouse the confidence of all Latin Americans in their common destiny.\n167.\tMy country and my people have high hopes of the negotiations under way, which have aroused the expectations of the whole continent and the whole world.\n168.\tOur action is inspired by the ideals proclaimed by the world Organization and it is on this account that my Government has entrusted me with the pleasant task, which I now perform, of conveying a message of friendship and support to all the peoples represented in this forum of nations which aspire to live in a climate of peace, stability, international justice and close human solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Soviet delegation I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the thirty- first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you all success in the performance of this honorable and responsible task.\n146.\tThe United Nations operates uninterruptedly all year round and, like international politics, it knows no interludes. But the annual sessions of such a forum as the General Assembly are of special significance. They provide an opportunity-now to almost 150 States -to scan the political panorama of the world in all its diversity, to identify the main problems that await solution and, most important, to provide by joint efforts, new momentum to international co-operation.\n147.\tThe very emergence of the United Nations as an international organization on the crest of the great victory over the forces of fascism and aggression was an expression of the will of the peoples of the world to prevent another war. In the name of those who perished and those who survived, its founding States declared their determination \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\".\n148.\tNow, as then, the peoples of the world have every right to demand of their political leaders, Governments and parliaments that efforts to strengthen peace be intensified and not slackened.\n149.\tWe are very far from underestimating the United Nations. After all, the Soviet Union is one of its founders. The United Nations has given useful and significant support to the peoples of the world in their struggle for liberation from colonial oppression. It has also made a weighty contribution to getting negotiations under way and preparing agreements which have curbed the arms race in certain areas. In certain cases it has been helpful in extinguishing conflicts. All these things are true.\n150.\tNevertheless, if the role of the United Nations is viewed in terms of the problems which still remain on the political agenda of the world there are at least two questions which arise.\n151.\tFirst, is the United Nations potential always fully exploited whenever tension grows or blood is shed in any given part of the world? No. The United Nations does not always measure up to the situation. This was true in the case of IndoChina. It is still true in the Middle East. It is true in Cyprus, and it is true in southern Africa.\n152.\tAs a result, people's faith in the effectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to give the necessary support to the victims of aggression is undermined.\n153.\tWhen anyone succumbs to the temptation to use force to seize the lands of others or tramples upon the right of peoples to free development, then there arises the question of what has become of his signature on the Charter of the United Nations. No matter how you put it, one thing is clear: such a policy is alien to the interests of peace and to the noble goals in the name of which the new international Organization was brought into being. And this is precisely why all too often the Security Council finds itself paralyzed, while many United Nations resolutions remain mere ink and paper.\n154.\tThe second question is this. Has the United Nations really addressed itself to the task of solving the most burning issue facing mankind today-the elimination of the threat of another world war? Unfortunately this question cannot be answered affirmatively either.\n155.\tWhenever the General Assembly meets, it discusses at its sessions some hundred items and adopts even more resolutions. At times the resolutions are so eloquent, and their verbal fabric so splendid, that they could be hung around this hall as slogans.\n156.\tBut resolutions are resolutions, and at the same time there is the gigantic machinery of arms production, or, in other words, of material preparation for war, continuing to gather momentum. Figuratively speaking, the globe, or at any rate a sizable part of it, is criss-crossed with assembly lines continuously churning out ever deadlier weapons -land-based, airborne, underwater weapons and whatever others you care to name.\n157.\tAnd many political figures who have linked their careers with the arms race and who are building their policies on that basis are clamoring for the development of ever newer weapons of destruction and annihilation. Not satisfied with wingless missiles, they want winged missiles. The B-type bomber no longer suits them. They must have the B-l, or, better still, a C-type.\n158.\tIt is indeed a fact that today the world spends 60 times more money to teach a soldier the ABCs of annihilation than to teach a child the science of creation. And, if one goes through the records of some parliaments, it would appear there is no greater evil than a reduction of military spending. As a result, record-breaking military budgets are being adopted. Those who work at the factory bench and in the fields or who are engaged in scientific and cultural activities are increasingly deprived of funds that could be used for improving nutrition, public health, education, housing and social security.\n159.\tScience and technology have made tremendous strides forward. Opportunities for raising the material and cultural standards of the people have increased immeasurably. But a huge proportion of the material and intellectual resources of the world are being devoured by the arms race. According to United Nations data, the world today spends on armaments about $300 billion a year, or more than a million dollars every two minutes. In the three hours of this very plenary meeting we are attending, another $90 million worth of means of destruction will have been added to the total.\n160.\tAnd what are we to say about the arguments -which have been elevated almost to the rank of theories -of those who preach, with criminal neglect of human life and the achievements of civilization, that it is better to build man's future on radio-active ashes?\n161.\tWe shall not now go into an analysis of the causes of the arms race or their social nature, although of course we could certainly find a few things to say about this too. Now, here in this hall, where States with different social systems are represented, we should focus our attention on what concerns us all equally: the prevention of war and the consolidation of peace.\n162.\tThe Soviet Union rejects the grim conclusion that putting an end to the arms race is beyond human ability. No one can prove that people must either constantly be at war or be preparing for mutual annihilation.\n163.\tFor almost six decades now our country has been guided in its policies by ideas of a different kind, those of peace and friendship among nations. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet State, said, \\\"An end to wars, peace among nations, an end to plundering and violence-that is our ideal...\\\".\n164.\tThe Soviet Union acts in the international arena in close unity and co-operation with its allies and friends, the fraternal socialist States. We are proud that the impact of the socialist countries on the course of world affairs is becoming ever more profound, and we are proud because that impact is used not only in the interests of those States but also for purposes of strengthening universal peace.\n165.\tAny objective observer can realize that the members of the Warsaw Pact, the countries of the socialist community, bring to international politics a feeling of respect for the independence and sovereignty of all nations and put forward concrete peace-loving initiatives and proposals and serve as a reliable bulwark for peoples fighting for national liberation and social progress.\n166.\tThe Leninist ideas of peace found new, vivid expression in the decisions of the highest forum of our Party, the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held last spring. Its program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples, set out in the report delivered by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is imbued with a sense of profound optimism and an unshakable belief in the possibility of making peace on earth enduring.\n167.\tAs one of the major objectives of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, the Twenty-fifth Congress set the task of seeking to contain the arms race, and then to reverse the trend and begin disarmament. We have put forward numerous specific proposals. Some of them are long-term proposals; others, with goodwill on the part of our partners too, could be implemented in the near future.\n168.\tNow, what specifically do we have in mind?\n169.\tThe first step would be the curbing of a further build-up of weapons of mass destruction, to be followed by their complete prohibition and elimination. The conscience of mankind demands that ultimately nuclear weapons be eliminated altogether.\n170.\tThe Soviet Union has been, and remains, in favor of the removal of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of States, and of using nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. We believe that the nuclear Powers-and all other States could join them-should come to the negotiating table to examine comprehensively the problem of nuclear disarmament and to chart together ways leading to its solution. The Soviet Union is prepared to take part in such negotiations at any time.\n171.\tIndependently of these negotiations, nuclear- weapons testing should be stopped everywhere and by all. This would put an end to the qualitative improvement of those weapons. That is the purpose of the proposal to conclude a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons testing approved by the General Assembly at its last session [resolution 3466 (XXX)]. The start of negotiations on this question is being unjustifiably delayed. The problem here is not the absence of objective conditions -they have long existed-but the unwillingness of some nuclear Powers to begin negotiations.\n172.\tThe question of underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes cannot be allowed to become a stumbling-block: the USSR and the United States have, after all, succeeded in agreeing on this matter, and have recently signed a relevant Treaty.1 2 We hope that this Treaty will soon be ratified by the United States. On our part, there will be no delay.\n173.\tThe problem of verification has been artificially inflated for quite some time now. Advanced techniques for identifying seismic phenomena have eliminated this point of disagreement as well. If, nevertheless, there are some who still harbor doubts on this score, we are confident that a mutually acceptable approach can be found that would remove such doubts.\n174.\tIn short, no room has been left for any plausible excuses which would prevent the completion of the task of prohibiting all nuclear weapons tests.\n175.\tIt is a matter of growing concern that channels for the proliferation of nuclear weapons have not yet been fully blocked. One can only imagine how much greater the risk of nuclear war would become if new States, particularly those in conflict with each other, became involved in the process of developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons.\n176.\tIt is well known that at present international commercial exchanges of nuclear materials are increasing. In some cases, however, it is not sufficiently certain that the possession of fissionable materials could not be used for dangerous purposes or that the means of developing nuclear weapons would not fall into the hands of irresponsible persons, adventurists, or simply madmen. This is not a question of trade, but of politics and security.\n12 Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes, signed at Washington and Moscow on 28 May 1976 (see document A/31/125).\n177.\tSurely it follows that the world must be safely protected from all such risks. The way to achieve this is to strengthen the regime on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We should redouble our efforts to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] truly universal and to secure the accession to it of all States, without exception.\n178.\tThe Soviet Union proposes that all chemical means of warfare be completely prohibited and destroyed, as has been done in respect of bacteriological weapons. If all States are not prepared to take such a step, then, to begin with, agreement should be reached on banning and eliminating the most dangerous and lethal types of chemical weapons.\n179.\tIt is not only the means of mass destruction already accumulated that pose a threat: potentially, weapons based on qualitatively new operating principles, in terms of methods of use, targets or effects, could become just as formidable. Today such weapons may exist only as blueprints, mock-ups or ideas, but experience shows that their appearance may not be too far away.\n180.\tAt the last session of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of an international agreement which would preclude the development and production of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction,  Some have asked how you can prohibit something that does not yet exist. However, since the very beginning of the discussion of this matter in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, it has become evident that there is here a subject for serious discussion. It is vastly more difficult to agree on the elimination of those types of weapons which have already been supplied to armies. The Soviet Union believes that everything possible must be done to prevent the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.\n181.\tConventional types of weapons are not normally included among weapons of mass annihilation. But modern tanks, aircraft, cannon and even small arms have been perfected to such a degree that they have actually become instruments capable of wiping out great masses of people.\n182.\tSince the Second World War, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed that conventional types of arms and the strength of armed forces also be reduced. We believe it imperative to discuss these questions as well.\n183.\tAs it always has, the Soviet Union favors the dismantling of all foreign military bases on alien territories. The existence of such bases is one of the main causes of the complications and tensions in the world. This problem is no less urgent today than it was yesterday.\n184.\tTo open up ever new avenues towards the solution of the disarmament problem, efforts are required along many lines. In some cases, the desired result is brought closer by singling out as a subject for negotiation certain types of weapon-say, strategic nuclear missiles. In other cases, the consideration of some particular aspect of the curbing of the arms race in the context of a certain region of the globe is more promising. The Soviet Union is in favor of using either of these approaches, or of combining them when circumstances permit. That also determines the attitude of our country towards regional measures of military detente, including the possibility of creating zones of peace or nuclear-free zones.\n185.\tWe consider it reasonable that a number of Asian and African States desire to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. In this connexion, the essential point is that there should be no foreign military bases in the area which constitute the main element of a permanent military presence. As for the Soviet Union, it has never had and does not have any intention of building military bases in the Indian Ocean.\n186.\tIn solving the problem of foreign military bases along these lines, the Soviet Union is prepared, together with other Powers, to seek ways of reducing on a reciprocal basis the military activities of non-coastal States in the Indian Ocean and the regions directly adjacent thereto. Our country has shown its readiness to contribute to the realization of the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, but of course, this should not create any obstacles to freedom of navigation or scientific research in that Ocean. If due account is taken of our approach by the States concerned, the Soviet Union will be able to participate in consultations on matters relating to preparations for convening an international conference on the Indian Ocean.\n187.\tAmong the various methods of securing the curtailment of the arms race there is another one which, as it were, combines the various possibilities, and that is the reduction of military budgets.\n188.\tThree years ago, the General Assembly approved our proposal that the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council be reduced by 10 per cent while a part of the money thus saved could be used to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3254 (XXIX)]. Because of the position taken by some States, the practical solution of this problem has been blocked. Wishing to break the deadlock in this matter, we are prepared to look for mutually acceptable specific figures with which the reduction could be started. As a first step, a figure either greater or smaller than 10 per cent could be agreed upon as soon as for 1977, next year. But it is necessary to begin negotiations on this question.\n189.\tThe opponents of reductions of military budgets are resorting to every possible means to frustrate any agreement about this. They are endeavoring to prove that inflated military budgets are necessary in the interests of peace, higher employment in industry and the reinforcement of negotiating positions, primarily in negotiations with the Soviet Union. All these arguments are illusory. Those who use them are well aware that they are turning the truth and standing it on its head. But, of course, they do not want to tell the truth. Those who base their policy not on deceiving people but on revealing to them the true causes of such an international phenomenon as an uncontrolled arms race cannot reconcile themselves to that, and they even feel it necessary to say so from this lofty rostrum of the United Nations.\n190.\tSo far, the pace of the arms race has far outstripped the efforts of States to arrest it, and this gap is growing. It is time, and everything possible must be done not only to narrow this gap and even to eliminate it totally, but also to ensure that disarmament negotiations outstrip the arms race in terms of effectiveness, thereby facilitating its termination. The Soviet Union continues to believe that if the elimination of one type of weapon cannot be immediately agreed upon then, to begin with, its production should be substantially limited. But in any case, the important thing is to make a start.\n191.\tNo one today will deny that the arms race has assumed unprecedented dimensions. This makes it imperative for all States, nuclear and non-nuclear, great and small, developed and developing, to combine their efforts to arrest it.\n192.\tThat is why the Soviet Union has proposed, and continues to propose, that the problem of disarmament be considered in its entirety at the broadest and most authoritative forum-a world disarmament conference. An overwhelming majority of the States of the world have declared themselves in favor of convening such a conference. But the implementation of this proposal continues to meet with the objections of some big Powers.\n193.\tIn this regard it has been suggested that it would be appropriate to hold a special session of the General Assembly to discuss disarmament questions. Well, this, too, is a suitable forum if it is viewed as an intermediate stage in the preparations for a world conference. But it must really be a special kind of session, not a routine one. We see its task as that of paving the way for a world conference and finally ensuring a real break-through in solving disarmament problems. Its work must reflect the grave responsibility of all States of the world, especially the great Powers.\n194.\tSuch, fundamentally, is our approach to the problem of stopping the arms race and of disarmament. Such is the essence of the Soviet Union's memorandum on these questions which we are submitting for consideration at this session and circulating as an official document of the United Nations [A/31/232],\n195.\tSome of the provisions of the memorandum have already been proposed earlier by us, and others have been put forward for the first time. I should like to express the confidence that this important document will be viewed by States Members of the United Nations as reflecting the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union, of our people, to help banish the threat of a world war of annihilation.\n196.\tNeither in the years preceding the Second World War nor in the first few post-war decades did there exist the objective conditions for making progress towards ending the arms race and towards disarmament such as those that exist today. It will be recalled that it has recently proved possible to achieve international understandings which impose certain limits on the arms race in some areas. As far as one can judge, an important agreement on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques seems to be within reach. A number of questions relating to disarmament are now being discussed among States.\n197.\tPride of place belongs, for obvious reasons, to the continuing talks between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on strategic arms limitation. The importance of these talks far transcends the interests of just our two countries. We are ready actively to continue our efforts to translate the well-known Vladivostok understanding into the text of an agreement.\n198.\tThere can hardly be anyone who would doubt that the fullest guarantees of peace will be provided by general and complete disarmament. Ever since Lenin's days, Soviet foreign policy has been aimed at achieving that ultimate goal.\n199.\tBut along with efforts to solve that historic task, it is possible and necessary to seek by other means, too, a reduction of the risk of the outbreak of war. Now, what is of decisive importance today? Above all, a firm agreement between States not to use force in international relations.\n200.\tIt could be argued that the principle of the renunciation of the use or threat of force is already embodied in the United Nations Charter. This is true. But it is also true that many States are seeking ways of putting this principle into practice. It is no accident that it was considered necessary to lay special emphasis on it in recent bilateral and multilateral international treaties and agreements.\n201.\tThe principle of the non-use of force has been developed in detail in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The need to abide strictly by this principle has on more than one occasion been stressed by non-aligned States, and particularly at their highest forums.\n202.\tThere is another important consideration. When the Charter of the United Nations was being signed, nuclear weapons were virtually non-existent. Their emergence-and especially their growth into a huge complex of various kinds and types of weapon-is a qualitatively new factor. It radically changes our concepts of the consequences of armed conflict. Therefore, it was not without reason that the General Assembly of the United Nations in its special resolution adopted in 1972 linked renunciation of the use of force with the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. Thus, the question of how States should deal with each other without seriously endangering the security of the peoples of the world has not become a whit less urgent.\n203.\tThere are certainly enough unresolved problems in today's world. They were bequeathed to us by the Second World War and the period of the \\\"cold war\\\", and they continue to arise now and again in the course of the current development of international relations.\n204.\tThese knots of differences among States should be untied and outstanding problems should be resolved at the conference table, by peaceful means. The principle of renunciation of the use of force must become an iron law of international affairs. That is the purpose of the proposal made from the rostrum of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concerning the concluding of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.\n205.\tWe note with satisfaction that that proposal has met with a broad response and has aroused the interest of many States. At the same time, we are asked what the Soviet Union has in mind in terms of the specific contents of such a treaty.\n206.\tThe answer to this question is to be found in the draft world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations which the Soviet Union is submitting to the General Assembly [A/311243].\n207.\tThe essence of the proposed treaty lies in the idea that in their relations with each other, as well as in their international relations in general, all parties to it will strictly abide by the undertaking to refrain from the use or threat of force either against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\n208.\tThey will accordingly refrain from the use of armed forces involving the employment of any types of weapon, including nuclear weapons, on land, at sea, in the air and in outer space and will not threaten to use such forces.\n209.\tThey will have to reaffirm the undertaking to settle disputes among themselves solely by peaceful means in such a way as not to endanger international peace and security.\n210.\tThere is, of course, a fundamental difference between the launching of hostilities for the purposes of aggression and the legitimate right to repel aggression or eliminate its consequences. Can the Arabs, for instance, resign themselves to the loss of their lands? And do the colonial peoples have no right to fight for their independence till final victory? They do indeed have an inalienable right to that.\n211.\tThe substance of the matter is the prevention of aggression. In this case there will be no further need to use force to repel it. The source of the evil is aggression and not the desire to restore justice; that is the cause and not its effect. Underlying our draft treaty -and I want to lay special emphasis on this -is the definition of aggression worked out by the United Nations, and everyone voted in favor of that document [resolution 3314 (XXIX)].\n212.\tThe treaty takes fully into account the system of bilateral and multilateral relations of States that has developed in the world. One of its articles provides that nothing in the treaty affects the rights and obligations of States under the United Nations Charter and treaties and agreements concluded by them earlier.\n213.\tIt is envisaged that the treaty would be open for signature by any State of the world at any time. This means that, first, it would be of a general, universal nature. Secondly, for the signatory States the treaty would enter into force upon ratification. Consequently, there would be no need to wait for the accession to the treaty of a specific number of countries.\n214.\tAccording to our draft, the Secretary-General of the United Nations would be the depository of the treaty. The United Nations as a whole would be called upon to lend all its moral and political prestige in support of the treaty.\n215.\tThe conclusion of the treaty we are proposing would be a major step bringing the world closer to the time when it will prove possible to eliminate entirely the threat of war and aggression. Supplementing and reinforcing the provisions concerning the non-use of force contained in various international instruments, the treaty would offer new and more reliable guarantees of security to all countries, big and small, and strengthen their confidence that their peaceful life would not be disrupted.\n216.\tThe treaty would undoubtedly also expedite the implementation of effective disarmament measures. The draft clearly provides that the parties will make all the necessary efforts to that end.\n217.\tWhose rights and interests would be infringed by such a treaty? Who would fail to benefit from it? Every State that really wants peace and international co-operation would stand to gain from it. The conclusion of such a treaty would be of benefit to peace throughout the world.\n218.\tThe Soviet Union hopes that the General Assembly will thoroughly consider the proposal to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations and declare itself in favor of it.\n219.\tThese are the new and concrete initiatives designed to stop the arms race and exclude the use of force in relations among States which have been proposed by the Soviet Union in this important forum. We are convinced that the fundamental strengthening of the bulwark of universal peace depends to a decisive degree on progress precisely in those two directions. The political climate in the world and the processes of relaxation of international tension prevailing in it are conducive to an undertaking of the implementation of these initiatives in a practical and serious manner.\n220.\tThe relaxation of tension and the attitude of States towards it are now in the searchlight of world politics. This alone shows that detente is not a myth or a catchword. Underlying it is a real change-over from confrontation and brinkmanship to peaceful and mutually beneficial co-operation among States and the investing of such co-operation with ever greater material content.\n221.\tNot a single State, not a single Government-if, of course, it really wishes to remain in touch with reality should hesitate in choosing its policy: either to promote the further reduction of tension and the elimination of the remnants of the cold war or to kindle conflict and friction. Every Government, every statesman should consider it an honor to be in the mainstream of the forces working for the further reduction of tension in the world.\n222.\tStatesmen who are directly responsible for the foreign policy of their countries should be imbued with the awareness that the course towards solving international problems, including the most urgent and complicated ones, through negotiations -and negotiations alone- equally serves the interests of all peoples and all States. And if that is so, then is it permissible to favor detente today and oppose it tomorrow? Is is permissible, while talking about one's desire to improve relations among States, particularly among the major Powers, at the same time in actual fact to follow in the wake of those who in major politics see no further than the buttons on their military tunics? To invoke in this regard some kind of considerations of domestic policy means to regard detente as the mere small change of political dealings, and not as a firm and noble guideline for ensuring peace,\n223.\tSome attempts have also been made to interpret detente as if it almost amounted to sanctioning interference in the domestic affairs of other States. How else can one describe the false solicitude of certain people for the rights of citizens in other countries? In actual fact these people are extolling those renegades who believe that the laws of their own country were not written for them to obey. Those who display such touching solicitude for them should open their eyes and take a good look at themselves and around them and see how matters stand in their own house in so far as real, not imaginary, human rights violations are concerned.\n224.\tWe believe that the foreign policy of States in matters relating to peace should be determined and pursued consistently and in good faith. We welcome statements precisely in favor of such a policy from the rostrum of this world Organization. As for the Soviet Union, its position has been determined with utmost clarity by the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Expressing the will of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, of the entire Soviet people, Leonid Brezhnev has stated that our country would\n\\\"...do everything possible to deepen international detente and to embody it in concrete forms of mutually beneficial co-operation between States,\\\"\nThat is our firm foreign policy line, one which the Soviet Union will steadfastly follow.\n225.\tExperience has shown that if States, no matter how different, take account of reality and exert their will for the same goal-the strengthening of peace- the results are impressive. Europe is a compelling example of that. The year that has passed since the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe shows that the development of the situation there is, on the whole, marked by a realization of the understanding approved at Helsinki.\n226.\tThere are, however, some who are not averse to grumbling. There are various things in the Final Act of the all-European Conference which are not to their liking. We also could point out quite a number of provisions which do not go as far as we would like. But what has been accepted by all the participants and solemnly sealed by the signatures of the leaders of States should be implemented-and implemented fully. That naturally applies also to the clauses relating to the inadmissibility of outside interference in the domestic affairs of States. That is how the Soviet Union acts and intends to act.\n227.\tOf course, this is not only a question of the Helsinki decisions. All the treaties and agreements concluded in recent years in the interests of a peaceful future for Europe should be scrupulously observed by all parties. I should like to emphasize particularly that attempts to undercut the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin, which has been serving the cause of improving the situation in the center of the European continent for five years now, run counter to these interests.\n228.\tIn the light of the results of the all-European Conference new possibilities have opened up for expanding relations between States in Europe in the political, economic, scientific and technological fields, as well as in the sphere of culture, contacts, information and education. The Soviet Union has put forward concrete proposals for organizing multilateral co-operation in such important fields as energy production, transport and protection of the environment.\n229.\tThe task of supplementing political detente with military detente is now coming to the fore in European affairs. What does that mean primarily? It means a successful conclusion of the Vienna talks on mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, where the concentration of armed forces and armaments is higher than in any other part of the world.\n230.\tThe Soviet Union and other socialist countries taking part in the negotiations are seeking to make the discussions constructive. We have given figures with regard to the total strength of the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty countries stationed in the zone of reductions, including land forces. It is now our partners' turn to respond. If no attempts are made to obtain unilateral military advantages, the negotiations in Vienna will also succeed.\n231.\tIt is well known how important for the international situation is the state of Soviet-American relations. As a result of the agreements and understandings reached between the USSR and the United States of America in previous years, the necessary conditions have been created for continuing to build those relations on a constructive foundation.\n232.\tSo far as concerns the Soviet Union, it is not guided in its policy by temporary considerations of the moment. The true interests of both countries and the interests of peace are served by only one course of action-that of acting in conformity, with a course jointly formulated in recent years, with the spirit and letter of the agreements that have been concluded. The Soviet Union expects that the United States will proceed precisely in that way. That will primarily determine further developments.\n233.\tRelations between the Soviet Union and France are developing in a favorable direction. This is something which has been reflected in the signing of many agreements, including the Declaration on the further development of friendship and co-operation, singed last October. The recent Soviet-French agreement to prevent the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons  is along the same lines. In so far as concerns the Soviet Union, we will consistently follow the line we have taken in our relations with France.\n234.\tA great deal of what has been achieved in relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and, above all, the conclusion of the Moscow Treaty between the two States on 12 August 1970, has marked the end of a whole phase in the post-war history of Europe. A fundamentally important page was turned in the right direction. The Soviet Union believes that further development and deepening of co-operation with the Federal Republic of Germany-in the expectation, naturally, that the policy of that country will be determined by the interests of peace, including the interests of peaceful development and good neighborliness in Europe is desirable.\n235.\tThe relations between the Soviet Union and practically all States which are known as \\\"Western\\\"-Great Britain or Denmark, Italy or Belgium, Canada or Sweden- are increasingly assuming the character of normal, mutually advantageous co-operation.\n236.\tThe successes of the policy of detente by no means signify that it no longer has any opponents. Ill-assorted forces often presenting a common front against it are easily found in Europe and elsewhere-in fact, they reveal themselves every day.\n\n231. The fruits of the policy of detente must be accessible to all peoples. It is well known, however, that the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus are still threatened. Tensions in the Middle East have not abated.\n238.\tThere can be no doubt that, so long as the occupation by Israel of Arab lands continues, so long as the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine are trampled upon, the Middle East will continue time and again to be in a state of fever.\n239.\tIt is now common knowledge that thousands of people have been killed or crippled in Lebanon in recent months. The tragic events which have occurred in that country are the direct result of imperialist aggression against the Arabs. The events in Lebanon are a direct consequence of the lack of an overall settlement in the Middle East. The blow is being aimed primarily against the patriots of Lebanon and the valiant Arab people of Palestine, whose just struggle cannot but evoke our admiration.\n240.\tThe Soviet Union believes that the crisis in Lebanon must be settled in a peaceful, democratic way by the Lebanese themselves, without any outside interference, on the basis of the preservation of the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.\n241.\tThe protracted nature of the tension in the Middle East gives us no grounds for concluding that the situation there is hopeless. A good basis for establishing peace in that area has been worked out through the efforts of many\nStates, including the Soviet Union. What it boils down to is: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; the satisfaction of the legitimate national demands of the Arab people of Palestine, including their inalienable right to create their own State; and the furnishing of international security guarantees for all States in the Middle East, including Israel.\n242.\tIs there anything here that could fail to be to anyone's liking, provided that there is a real intention to live in peace with one's neighbors?\n243.\tUnfortunately, the international machinery for producing the necessary agreements on the Middle East-the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East-is still inactive. The Soviet Union is in favor of a resumption of its work, and the sooner the better, for a consideration by it of all the major issues involved in a Middle East settlement\u2014I repeat, all the major issues involved in such a settlement.\n244.\tIt is becoming ever more urgent to spread detente to Asia. Conditions are ripening there for tire consolidation of peace through the joint efforts of the Asian States. This is demonstrated by a fact of vast historical significance- the end of the war in IndoChina and the formation of a new major peace-loving State, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The Soviet Union is confident that the voice of an independent, united Vietnam will soon be heard from this rostrum too. We insist that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam be admitted to the United Nations without delay.\n245.\tFriendly co-operation between the Soviet Union and India is an important stabilizing factor in the Asian continent. Mutual understanding and confidence between the two States were vividly manifested once again during the recent visit to the Soviet Union of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.\n246.\tAlong with the trend towards an improvement of the situation in Asia, there are other facts. In that part of the world, too, circles are active which are by no means loath to create tension by stepping up military preparations, particularly in the area bordering on the southern frontiers of the Soviet Union. History knows how such efforts have ended and this should not be forgotten.\n247.\tThe question of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea should be finally resolved. We support the proposals of the Korean Democratic People's Republic for the peaceful reunification of Korea without outside interference. As we know, last year's session of the General Assembly adopted a resolution in this regard [resolution 3390 (XXX)] on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice in Korea into a lasting peace and for expediting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. That resolution should be put into effect.\n248.\tThe Soviet Union continues, as it has done in the past, to attach great importance to its relations with the People's Republic of China. The normalization of those relations would undoubtedly have a positive effect on the situation in Asia, and, indeed, have even wider international repercussions. Our position in this respect as regards the People's Republic of China has been made quite clear by the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and that position is fully valid today.\n249.\tThe situation in the south of Africa is a subject requiring the most serious attention. The rulers of the Republic of South Africa and of Southern Rhodesia and all those who support and arm them are now demonstrating and would have us believe that they have resigned themselves to the inevitability of the process of national liberation and that they are trying to adapt themselves to it.\n250.\tBut in actual fact everything possible is still being done to repress the just struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and of the indigenous people of the Republic of South Africa for their legitimate rights and for an end to the hateful policy of racism. Every possible method is being resorted to, from direct suppression and violence to attempts to divert the national liberation movement from genuine independence and freedom through political gimmickry and financial hand-outs.\n251.\tWhat is being sought from these people before the eyes of the whole world? A renunciation of their inalienable right to free and independent development, a development along the path of social progress. But we are confident that the inexorable course of events and the facts of life itself with its political realities will put everything in its proper perspective. Peoples have learned and have learned well to distinguish between truth and falsehood.\n252.\tToday, as always, the Soviet Union stands firmly by the side of the fighting peoples of southern Africa. We are in favor of the unconditional ending of the policy of apartheid and racism in South Africa, of the immediate withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia, of the unreserved transfer of all power to the people of Zimbabwe. No one will ever see the Soviet Union failing to oppose attempts to prolong colonial and racist oppression under whatever guise.\n253.\tIt is worth recalling, particularly in this hall, that on 14 December 1960 thunderous applause greeted the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. Its adoption signified that historically the hour had struck for the complete elimination of colonial domination in the world.\n254.\tWe have all witnessed the failure of the attempt to stifle with the help of arms the young independent State of the People's Republic of Angola. If there are still Governments which would impede the exercise of its legitimate right to participate in the work of the United Nations, they stand to gain nothing by that action; they only stand to lose. Angola will without any doubt take its lawful and proper place in this hall.\n255.\tWe should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations and to wish the people of that country success in the building of a new life.\n256.\tThousands of miles separate the Soviet Union from Latin America, but our people have feelings of friendship towards its peoples and wish to have good relations with Latin American countries. So much greater, then, are our bitterness and indignation at tHe unabated violations of human rights and liberties in several parts of that continent, primarily in Chile, where these rights and freedoms are being flagrantly and criminally trampled under foot. Together with all progressive mankind we demand freedom for Luis Corvalan, arrested three years ago, and for other Chilean democrats.\n257.\tRecently, problems of the restructuring of international economic relations have been assuming increasing importance in world affairs. We support the just demands of the developing countries to do away with discrimination and artificial barriers in international trade, to eliminate all instances of inequality, the imposition of will and exploitation in international economic relations. On behalf of the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation intends to make a special statement on these matters at this session of the General Assembly.\n258.\tAmong topical issues of international affairs a prominent place now belongs to questions relating to the co-operation of States in the uses of the world's oceans. A search for ways of establishing such co-operation is, as we know, under way at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the latest round of which came to an end just a few days ago, The Soviet Union believes that the issues facing that Conference should be resolved by its participants on a mutually acceptable basis. No one should try to impose on the Conference any arbitrary or one-sided decisions which have nothing in common with the interests of justice and the fruitful co-operation of States in such an important field as the use of the world's oceans.\n259.\tThe present international situation is far from being monochrome. Along with the positive changes which have occurred in the world, which have been characteristic of recent times, certain phenomena of a different kind have been noted, namely, opposition to detente. This requires the vigilance and active efforts of all those who cherish the cause of peace. And yet the overall political background of the world today gives grounds for looking to the future with optimism,\n260.\tThe States of the socialist community have thrown their prestige, their material and foreign policy resources onto the scales of the policy of defending peace. The newly independent countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have resolutely favored the strengthening of international security. This has also been demonstrated by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Colombo.\n261.\tA sound tendency is emerging in the policy of a number of capitalist States and gathering momentum, although not without snags. The essence of this trend is the recognition in practice of the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems. Certain public circles, movements and political parties which consistently advocate peace among nations and social progress are being listened to more and more.\n262. We are convinced that, in the light of present-day dynamics of the correlation of forces in the world, with detente making ever more confident headway, the United Nations should exploit all its possibilities as a reliable instrument for maintaining and strengthening peace. But it will be able to fully evince this quality only when all its Member States are firmly abiding by its Charter and observing it.\n263.\tThe Soviet Union unswervingly strives to ensure that the questions discussed at sessions of the General Assembly are resolved in such a way as to be of benefit to the peace, co-operation, freedom and independence of the peoples of die world. And at this session too we are determined to co-operate constructively with all those who support these great humane goals which meet the aspirations of all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a signal honor for our delegation to address through you on behalf of the Party-State of Guinea and its Secretary-General President Ahmed Sekou Toure our most sincere congratulations upon Mr. Amerashinghe's brilliant election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. His outstanding qualities and his lengthy experience shall be for us a precious augury of true success.\n252.\tWe should like similarly to address a tribute to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, whose personal qualities made it possible for the thirtieth session of the General Assembly honorably to discharge its duties.\n253.\tWe should also like warmly to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, with the passage of time and events, has vigilantly ensured respect for the provisions of the Charter.\n254.\tOur delegation wishes to welcome here the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to our Organization. We are convinced that through its participation in our activities it will make a worthy contribution.\n255.\tThe delegation of Guinea would also take this solemn opportunity to pay a well-earned tribute to the memory of Chairman Mao Tsetung, one of the great figures of the international proletariat, an outstanding leader whose authority, conferred upon him by his great ideological and practical contributions, has decisively marked the phase of world revolution dating from 1945 until today.\n256.\tThe Guinean revolution considers the eminent role played by Chairman Mao has made a very positive contribution to the multifaceted enhancement of the theory of the popular revolution and of the struggle of peoples for self-determination.\n257.\tThis session's agenda includes some interrelated questions of great importance not only to the developing countries but also to the world as a whole.\n258.\tIn this connection, international economic relations are characterized by an intolerable injustice. Relations of dependence are now closer and firmer, giving our countries no opportunities whatsoever for independent development, which could imperil the position of economic subordination inherited from the colonial era.\n259.\tThe development of industrial production propagated one of the disguised forms of dependence-that is, technology controlled by the monopolies of imperialistic companies.\n260.\tThe deficit in the balance of trade has for many countries become a structural aspect of their economies.\n261.\tDespite two special sessions devoted to problems of development and raw materials, and the adoption at the twenty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States; despite the several sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea; despite the so-called North-South Conference in Paris  and the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi, the international economic situation remains unchanged and is therefore still the overriding preoccupation of developing countries. Everything points to a total absence of political will on the part of the industrialized Powers establish a new international economic order. Thus, for developing countries, the final solution remains to struggle by effecting radical changes within each State, to remove key sectors of the economy from the corrosive action of transnational companies, subsequently to modify their relations of dependence vis-a-vis developed States, and finally to ensure full and complete economic emancipation.\n262.\tAt the international level, our delegation fully subscribes to the Declarations and Action Program for Economic Co-operation recently adopted at Colombo [see A/311197], which emphasize, inter alia, the convening of a ministerial conference in 1977 to deal with the problem of the external debt of developing countries. The creation of new associations of producers of raw materials and the consolidation of existing associations can only hasten the arrival of the new international economic order we so deeply desire. In this effort to change international relations, the co-operation and cohesion of non-aligned and other developing States are necessary. It is appropriate here to express our pleasure at the recent meeting in Mexico, which constitutes a first step in this direction.\n263.\tOur delegation, like those of other States, has always considered that present negotiations on the law of the sea have a special role. Among the economic questions touched upon during the 30 years of the existence of the United Nations, there are none more important. We must be able realistically to define the continental shelf and the economic zone. In this connection, a 200-nautical-mile limit seems to be most reasonable, because of the immense possibilities offered by modern technology. International solidarity naturally implies that navigation and communications should be facilitated. Once and for all, a decision must be reached with regard to the financing of the authority called upon to manage the resources of the sea-bed beyond the continental shelf for the well-being of mankind. But that authority must be established immediately, and it must be provided with an effective administration. A small proportion of the resources of the sea, in the view of our delegation, should, at a suitable time, be utilized for the financing of the United Nations. Then, and only then, a new international brotherhood will be born, because unequal financing always goes hand in hand with unequal influence.\n264.\tFaced with the problem of disarmament, the Republic of Guinea believes that solutions should not be envisaged merely among ^Powers possessing nuclear weapons, because, as President Ahmed Sekou Toure says,\n\\\"Disarmament is a question of paramount importance and interest to all peoples. Thus its postulate must be respect for the will of peoples to escape from imperialist domination. This necessarily means that relations of subordination must disappear, and that colonialism, neo-colonialism and exploitation must be liquidated and an equitable economic order established.\\\"\n265.\tThat is why our delegation supports the initiative taken by the non-aligned States to convene in 1978 a special session devoted to the consideration of this burning issue. We are convinced that the results of such action will facilitate progress in the negotiations already under way.\n266.\tAlso, if the conclusions of the Helsinki Conference are to be meaningful in the context of detente, they must necessarily be applied to other areas where military bases for imperialist aggression are implanted-such as the Indian Ocean, the coastal States of which deeply desire total demilitarization and complete denuclearization -since it is true that international peace and security concern all States of the world, without exception, and absolutely equally.\n267.\tMoreover, analysis of the international situation reveals more than ever the fundamental contradiction pitting imperialism against peoples struggling for their political, economic, cultural and social independence. In-deed, hotbeds of tension are still numerous throughout the world in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa and the Middle East supplied and abetted by monopolistic capitalism, which refuses to yield to historical reason and' only considers its selfish interests, based exclusively on the exploitation of peoples and the systematic pillage of natural resources.\n268.\tAs we know, the dominant Powers think they have several strings to their bow. When, under pressure from the liberation struggle, they are forced to let go, they find other ways and means to perpetuate their presence. Their final aim is the establishment of neo-colonial governments. To this end they sometimes go so far as to encourage secession. The case of the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes the most flagrant example of this. That is why our delegation reaffirms its staunch support for the people and Government of the Comoros in their efforts to recover their province.\n269.\tWith regard to French Somaliland, our delegation demands the immediate, unconditional independence of that Territory, in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of its people.\n270.\tThe crisis in the Middle East is as yet unsolved. Just as yesterday in Viet Nam, imperialism at work today, pitting brother Arabs against one another, is seeking by all means possible to liquidate Palestinian resistance and its vanguard, the Palestine Liberation Organization. While voicing its deep concern over this situation, our delegation wishes to renew its active and resolute support for the courageous struggle of the martyred Palestinian people and demands that the Zionist State of Israel return all occupied Arab territory. The Party-State of Guinea gives it full support to the document drafted by the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [A/3I/5].\n271.\tDespite decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations recommending a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus crisis, talks between the Greek and the Turkish communities remain deadlocked, and the island continues to be occupied by foreign troops; all the while, everything is being done to turn it into a NATO military base, thereby creating an area of tension prejudicial to the establishment of a climate of confidence and peace in the world. Therefore, our delegation voices its support for the unity of the Cypriot people and for the safeguard of its territorial integrity.\n272.\tIn Asia, the liberation struggle victoriously waged by the heroic peoples of Viet Nam, Democratic Kampuchea and Laos compels the admiration of all, and constitutes an inestimable contribution to the triumph of the ideals of liberty and progress. The international community must contribute to the efforts of national reconstruction undertaken by those States.\n273.\tOur delegation wishes to take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the great people of the immortal Ho Chi Minh, which, after having defeated, one by one, all the imperialist armies, has just proclaimed to the world the birth of its reunified nation, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\n274.\tThe American veto two years in succession, of the admission to the United Nations of this country, which has contributed so much to the liberation of peoples and to the strengthening of peace, is inadmissible and demonstrates the omnipotence of some countries in the conduct of world affairs within an Organization which seeks universality.\n275.\tOur delegation hopes that, during the upcoming discussion of this matter, reason will prevail over rancor.\n276.\tWith regard to Korea, the Republic of Guinea will at any time welcome with satisfaction any peaceful solution which could permit the unification of this country according to the freely expressed will of the entire Korean people, without any foreign intervention.\n277.\tHowever, the Republic of Guinea, which has recognized the Democratic Republic of East Timor as an independent and sovereign State, denounces the invasion of this territory by foreign troops and supports the decisions contained in resolution 3485 (XXX) of 12 December 1975 and in Security Council resolution 389 (1976) of 22 April 1976, by which it called upon the Indonesian Government, inter alia, to withdraw without further delay all its forces from the Territory; requested respect for the territorial integrity of East Timor; and called upon neighboring States to co-operate with the United Nations in order to facilitate the decolonization of that country.\n278.\tSome regions of Latin America remain hotbeds of tension of no less concern to the international community.\n279.\tThis is why we condemn the inhuman actions of the Fascist regime in Chile and express to the Chilean resistance our; militant solidarity.\n280.\tOur delegation would also like to express its support of the claim of the Panamanian people to exercise sovereignty over its Canal. The inalienable rights of the Panamanian people over the whole of its national territory should be recognized.\n281.\tBelize* a member of the non-aligned movement, legitimately aspires to self-determination and national independence. The Republic of Guinea supports these noble aspirations in accordance with resolution 3432 (XXX) of the General Assembly.\n282.\tIn the Caribbean region, as a result of the legitimate measures of nationalization taken by Guyana and by Jamaica, and particularly because of their support of liberation movements, imperialism has launched in these countries a systematic action of subversion, economic sabotage and destabilization. Is there any need to emphasize once more with conviction the fact that, despite all of these imperialist plots, final victory belongs to the peoples of Guyana and Jamaica?\n283.\tThe Republic of Guinea and its State Party, under the enlightened guidance of its prestigious leader, President Ahmed Sekou Toure, faithful to the principles of the Democratic Party of Guinea, which have always underpinned our great revolution, would like to assure all these countries of its countries of its militant support of and total sympathy with the full achievement of the ideals of the United Nations, whose work nonetheless leaves a great deal to be desired today.\n284.\tIndeed, after 31 years of existence, during which nearly 100 new independent and sovereign States were born, fundamental adjustments to the United Nations Charter appear increasingly indispensable if we wish to portray the scope and quality of the changes which have transpired, because, while it is proclaimed that all nations are equal within the United Nations, the truth is that the African nations are far from fully enjoying all these recognized rights, and as President Ahmed Sekou Toure recently emphasized:\n\\\"Africa alone is not included among the permanent members of the Security Council possessing the right of veto. For a long time, and, indeed, for too long, we have requested the elimination of the veto; this has not been achieved. Now it seems normal that an African State should also be a member of the Security Council, and should be a permanent member. This country would exercise, on behalf of the African continent, the right of the veto to preserve the higher interests of the African continent\\\".\nAnd President Ahmed Sekou Toure continued:\n\\\"We shall finally see the true face of imperialism, because each Power says that it- is not imperialist. Those who would oppose our proposal to give a permanent seat to an African State will reveal themselves before the world as being imperialists, racists, colonialists and anti-African Powers\\\".\n285.\tOur delegation would like to echo OAU resolution CM/Res.486(XXVII) [see A/31/1961] inviting all members to work for the pure and simple elimination of the iniquitous veto in order to ensure respect for the principle of the equality of all States Members of the United Nations because, as the head of the Guinean State says, \\\"the United Nations is practicing apartheid in the Security Council\\\".\n286.\tIn fact, the repulsive veto cast by the United States against the entry of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola constitutes a perfect illustration of this flagrant iniquity. Injustice in international relations cannot last forever. The achievement of the legitimate aspirations of our peoples will surely contribute to the building of a new world founded on solidarity, social justice and democratic progress.\n287.\tThe Republic of Guinea, whose support has never been found wanting by the freedom fighters, has, by this consistent policy, drawn upon itself the hatred of international reaction and of the agents of neo-colonialism.\n288.\tIn the African and international sphere, the effective participation of Guinea in all emancipation struggles of peoples has been constant and positive. Imperialism is continuing its struggle against all progressive African States, and particularly against us who are ceaselessly condemning it and struggling against it in all spheres where it acts contrary to the interests of the African peoples and those of other peoples in the world.\n289.\tSince the establishment of the popular and independent State of Guinea, the imperialist forces have remained hostile to the Guinean revolution, which they unabeatingly struggle against and attempt to bring down by all means, up to and including armed aggression, as was the case on 22 November 1970.\n290.\tThe Democratic Party of Guinea remains convinced that the cause which it defends is assured of resounding victory. The revolution, which has become increasingly radical in Guinea and in Africa, will overcome all obstacles to impose true sovereignty and African unity unencumbered by any reactionary influence.\n291.\tAfter the numerous victories won over Portuguese colonialism, Africa notes with legitimate pride that prospects for the liberation of southern Africa in the relatively near future are today even more real.\n292.\tThe racist regime of Ian Smith, maintained in place with the complicity of the imperialist Powers, can no longer confine the armed struggle of the Zimbabwe people. In the anguish of his inevitable downfall, his final weapon remains genocide and armed aggression against the neighboring States, in particular the People's Republic of Mozambique and Zambia.\n293.\tThe Namibian people, whose immediate and total independence must be demanded and obtained by our Organization, continues to be illegally weakened by ferocious repression. The racist and Fascist regime of South Africa systematically flouts the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Even more, it was extending and consolidating apartheid, terrorizing the peoples and fragmenting them by utilizing this reprehensible \\\"bantustanization\\\", in a vain attempt to combat the armed struggle of SWAPO. These acts of repression are regularly camouflaged by so-called \\\"constitutional conferences and dialogues\\\" which are convened with great publicity, either in Windhoek or elsewhere, and which bring together white minorities, tribal chiefs and other puppets.\n294.\tIn Soweto, in Alexandra and in other places, the supreme sacrifice of young martyrs will not be in vain, because no military arsenal can quell the fierce determination of Africans to eliminate apartheid. As President Ahmed Sekou Tour\u00a3 said: \\\"Of what importance are atomic bombs? Africa will live for a long time, whereas apartheid, its allies and its weapons will be buried.\\\"\n295.\tAfrica is not duped by those who with hollow statements are condemning apartheid but with concrete acts are firmly supporting it. Thus the imperialist Powers are verbally condemning apartheid and the regime of Ian Smith, they are proclaiming their support for the principle of self-determination and the integrity of Namibia and are denouncing the demands of the white minority regimes against Africans, whereas at the same time they are increasing their investments in these racist countries and are providing them with weapons of mass destruction.\n296.\tBefore the general reprobation of the international community for the Pretoria regime, Vorster and his Western allies, in order to give an aura of respectability to their inhuman system and thereby perpetuate apartheid, are using subterfuge; but, despite all these political maneuvers by the Vorster regime and the subtle game of its allies, final victory for the people of southern Africa is ineluctable.\n297.\tMy delegation would like to salute the memory of the martyrs of Angola. Few countries have paid such a high price for their national independence. However, despite the recommendations of OAU, the exercise of the iniquitous veto in the Security Council today prevents the admission of the sovereign State of Angola to our Organization-a State which is nevertheless recognized by more than 100 countries.\n298.\tThis is the appropriate time to pay a warm tribute to those States in our Organization which, in conformity with resolution 3328 (XXIX) of the General Assembly, have given moral and material assistance to the People's Republic of Angola.\n299.\tThe United Nations met and took away South Africa's trusteeship over Namibia. The Security Council has taken a stand in support of that brotherly people. OAU has also met and has supported its independence. All inter-national organizations have already expressed similar views. However, South Africa has refused to respect this will of the peoples. What remains for us to do? Are we to believe in the exorcist seances that are now being organized with great publicity to allay our vigilance? No; the five heads of State of the front-line States of southern Africa have expressed the unshakable will of our peoples, which proudly reject a compromise which would have merely dishonored Africa and its thousands of martyrs.\n300.\tTherefore it is perfectly normal to reject agreements which would have diminished the worth of the struggle of the fighters in southern Africa. Zimbabwe cannot wait another 18 months to attain independence. No! It is perfectly normal to demand immediately and totally the full and complete liberation of Zimbabwe.\n301.\tTo judge negatively such an attitude of African dignity would be to be blasphemous towards the martyrs of Soweto and Alexandra, and Africa would be unable to pardon this.\n302.\tThe right of peoples to national independence, sovereignty and full and complete freedom, the right of peoples to self-determination, the right of peoples to choose freely their own government-this is an inalienable right. It is a right free from all conditions. Nothing, no power, can limit it or allow its realization to be delayed. This is not a right which can merely be enunciated without action being taken to achieve it immediately. It is not an abstract right; still less is it a potential right. It is a concrete right, the achievement of which can in no way legitimately be delayed.\n303.\tThus there is only one solution: that of struggle. Dignity is not conferred; it is conquered. Liberty is not negotiated; it is conquered. Victory belongs to the peoples that fight.\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should like to congratulate, through you, Mr. President, Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Danish delegation I wish to say that we are fully confident that he will preside over the negotiations with impartiality and efficiency. We promise to do our best to make the session proceed in a constructive and realistic atmosphere. Every effort must be made to avoid new confrontations which might bring into doubt the possibilities and objectives of the United Nations.\n57.\tWe welcome the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations family and look forward to co-operating with this one hundred and forty-fifth Member State. Its admission to the United Nations has brought us a step closer to the important goal: that all peoples of the world shall be represented in the world Organization.\n58.\tIn the opinion of the Danish Government all States should be entitled to join the United Nations and remain Members thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. We favor the admission of both the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Should the Republic of Korea want to renew its application for membership, we would support that, too.\n61.\tIn this connexion I should like to pay a tribute to the United States Government for having brought the matter to this point on the basis of a plan devised by the United Kingdom Government a few months ago. Only the influence of the United States in .collaboration with the United Kingdom could, I think, have the impact necessary to bring about a solution. It is now the duty of all States Members of the United Nations to contribute.in whatever way they can to the success of the coming difficult negotiations.\n62.\tHowever, history has taught us to be skeptical about any promise of progress towards self-determination in southern Africa. In the past this skepticism has been amply justified. Since the outline of a solution now on the table is ambiguous on decisive points, it is understandable that the peoples of Africa should show reluctance to relinquish pressures on the white regime of Mr. Smith before the necessary guarantees have been obtained that the proposals will be carried out in good faith.\n63.\tWe appeal to all concerned to work constructively for a peaceful solution in the area. Let me stress, in this context, that it is particularly important that the African movements in Zimbabwe unite and avoid giving Mr. Smith any pretext for not going ahead towards majority rule.\n64.\tThe developments in Zimbabwe should not make us neglect the other important southern African questions. The problem of Namibia and the question of apartheid should not be put into the refrigerator. The problems of the area are not solved until Namibia is a free independent nation and until the inhuman policy of apartheid is abolished.\n65.\tSouth Africa must at the earliest possible moment bring to an end its continued illegal occupation of Namibia, an occupation that.has been condemned by the United Nations and declared unlawful by the International Court of Justice. The international community must go on exploiting every opportunity to make it clear that in the name of peace and justice South Africa must withdraw from Namibia in order to give the country its independence, with due participation .by the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPOJ\\ and the United Nations in conformity with the resolutions of the Security Council.\n66.\tThe declaration of intent adopted by the committee of the Windhoek Constitutional Conference, published last month, stated that Namibia was reasonably certain to achieve independence by the end of 1978 and that the unity of Namibia would be maintained. The implications of these decisions do not seem clear. It is therefore doubtful whether the decisions mark any real progress. The transition to independence on the premises of the Windhoek Conference will only prepare the soil for renewed conflict. It should therefore be made absolutely dear that SWAPO must take a full part in the independence process, that the United Nations must he allowed free access to monitor this process, and that South Africa must accept Namibia as a nation State.\n67.\tThe policy of apartheid practiced by the Republic of South Africa has once again manifested itself in violence and brutality. The organized oppression by the South African Government, resting as it does on an inhuman\nphilosophy, can never provide the foundation .of a viable society. Events in Soweto have shown that the white minority is ready to resort to uncontrolled violence in order to maintain its privileged position at the cost of the African population. The events also demonstrate that the African population cannot be pushed any further; it is prepared to fight for its rights.\n68.\tConfronted with these serious developments we call upon the Security Council to seek agreement on an effective policy of sanctions. I appeal to all members of this Assembly to utilize any opportunity to work for the introduction of measures in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. In this context, I refer to the endorsement by the Nordic countries of a binding arms embargo. Statements about support for the liberation of the African population are worthless if at the same time arms are supplied enabling the minority to continue its illegal policy.\n69.\tIn the course of the current session a specific example of the apartheid policy may be introduced. What I have in mind is the Transkei question. Transkei does not meet the objective requirements of a State. It is a reflection of the South African \u201cbantustan\u201d policy. Therefore we are not prepared to recognize Transkei as a nation State. We are gratified that so many countries share our view. A massive international rejection of South Africa's obvious distortion of the concept of independence is extremely important in order to keep up the international pressure against the apartheid regime.\n70.\tAll countries of the world must contribute constructively to finding solutions to the problems of southern Africa.\n71.\tWe for our part-and this was clearly brought out by the Netherlands Foreign Minister speaking on behalf of the European Community [7th meeting]-are ready to join in such efforts. This is a policy which for years has been pursued by Denmark and the other Nordic countries- expressed very clearly in the five-point program contained in the communique of the Nordic Foreign Ministers' meeting in Copenhagen last month.\n72.\tHowever, the outside world must not try in any way to impose any solution. We are faced with African problems. To African problems African solutions must be found.\n73.\tWith regard to my second point, the North-South dialog, the economic relations between the developed and the developing countries constitute a question on which the attention of the General Assembly has been focused increasingly during the last few years.\n74.\tAn important achievement of the General Assembly was the adoption at the seventh special session of a comprehensive set of guidelines for future co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-VII)].\n75.\tWe are now in the early stage of a long process of negotiations aimed at the realization of a more equitable international economic order.\n76.\tMy Government understands the demands of the developing countries and we understand their impatience. We recognize the urgency of their problems.\u2003\n77.\tThere is no reason to conceal that among Member States opinion differs on important issues. There is no reason to conceal that negotiations are bound to be difficult. I am convinced that real progress is possible. But progress is only possible if all parties continue to show the political will to compromise. Confrontation would only postpone the necessary changes in the present international system. Lasting solutions to the problems of developing countries can only be achieved through co-operation.\n78.\tAt the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi we succeeded in establishing a negotiating plan for an integrated program for commodities. We must now build on the results accomplished at that session. Our aim must be to secure for the developing countries a more stable and more satisfactory income from their commodity exports.\n79.\tExport earnings from commodities are of vital importance to most developing countries. But along with the commodity negotiations we must also strengthen our efforts to bring about a diversification of the economies of the developing countries. We must intensify the work which is already under way in various organizations inside and outside the United Nations in areas such as trade, industrialization and technology.\n80.\tIt has often been said that building a better international society will require new thinking in the developed countries. This is true. It is also true that it requires new thinking in the developing countries themselves.\n81.\tThe developed countries will have to accept changes in the structure of the international economy that will run counter to vested interests. They must accept the emergence of a new international division of labor between developed and developing countries.\n82.\tThe developing countries will have to accept the fact that increased global interdependence will add to their responsibility for the international economy.\n83.\tIt is only one year since the seventh special session of the General Assembly adopted the resolution on development and international economic co-operation. There may be different interpretations of the results achieved up to now, but I believe we are irreversibly on the way toward the creation of a more just international economic order. There is no alternative to such a development.\n84.\tIn this search for a new international economic order, the need for an increase in development assistance must not be forgotten. The need for development assistance will be with us for a long time.\n85.\tDenmark has over the years steadily increased its development assistance. We have decided to meet the target of a contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product by the end of this decade. Regrettably some countries which can afford to meet this target are still way behind it.\n86.\tThe aim of assistance should be to promote economic growth, social progress and political independence. In this effort we should concentrate on the poorest of the developing countries. We shall endeavor to have the aim\npursued to the greatest possible extent by the international organizations in the planning of their multilateral assistance.\n87.\tIt is at the same time important not to forget that an effectively functioning multilateral development system has been built up inside the United Nations. I have, of course, especially in mind the United Nations Development program [UNDP], which, however, has experienced serious financial difficulties during the last year. Only if all Member States which are in a position to do so are willing to increase their contributions to the UNDP will it be possible to continue the dynamism of the program. And only if we succeed in financially strengthening UNDP will it be possible to maintain the coherence of the United Nations development system and thereby increase its possibility of playing a central role in the new international economic order.\n88.\tI now turn to my third main theme, disarmament, which is and remains a primary objective of the United Nations activities and which commands great interest among all nations, in particular the question of nuclear disarmament. Denmark most fervently wishes to support efforts to bring about a complete test ban to be accompanied by the appropriate control and verification provisions. We have noted with satisfaction the rapprochement in the matter of control which has taken place between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n89.\tObviously, account must be taken of the problems relating to peaceful nuclear explosions. This does not make it easier to draw up an agreement on a complete test ban. But in this field we shall hopefully have a better foundation to work on when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna has concluded its work.\n90.\tWith regard to non-proliferation we are pleased to note that Japan has ratified the non-proliferation Treaty. The Japanese ratification constitutes a significant strengthening of this Treaty because its value depends on the extent to which it is adhered to, especially by countries which possess sophisticated nuclear technology.\n91.\tThe arrangement set up in London between a number of important countries aiming at intensifying control of the export of nuclear material and equipment represents another positive move.\n92.\tI should also like to recall that in its Final Declaration the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons expressed its unequivocal support of the control work of IAEA and recommended that it be further strengthened and expanded.  This seems to be the right moment to recall the powerful exhortation by the Director General of IAEA at its General Conference a few days ago. That statement aimed at making it an indispensable condition for the delivery of nuclear material or equipment that the receiving State accept IAEA safeguards on its entire nuclear program.\n93.\tThese observations aside, it must be conceded that the disarmament picture is rather gloomy.\n94.\tThe aims race is continuing at an accelerating pace and ties down enormous resources which might otherwise have been used to provide better living conditions for humanity.\n95.\tWhat can the United Nations do in this situation?\n96.\tDuring this session we shall once more consider a large number-and I sigh a little bit-of agenda items in the field of disarmament, in our opinion far too many. The adoption of a number of resolutions does not in itself promise results. A tightening of our field of operation and greater concentration on key problems and realistic disarmament proposals, not least in this forum, would undoubtedly add some of that dynamism and efficacy to our work which it so sorely lacks at present.\n97.\tThe Danish Government therefore appreciates the initiative which was taken at last year's General Assembly to strengthen the United Nations role in the field of disarmament issues before the United Nations may serve this cause. At the same time we realize that the political will of Member States to contribute to this end remains the decisive factor.\n98.\tThe idea of a special session of the General Assembly to discuss disarmament issues should be carefully weighed. If such a special session is prepared so that realistic results may be expected, the Danish Government will endorse the idea. We should deplore very much if a special session developed into another barren propaganda forum.\n99.\tI am quite aware that the United Nations as such cannot solve the problems, but by taking a more realistic approach to them and by concentrating our efforts on key problems we shall probably be able to reach the point where our endeavors in this field will command greater respect and where our efforts and working results will exert greater influence on those best qualified and able to bring about solutions.\n100.\tI have devoted most of my speech to three very serious political topics of great urgency for all of us in this Organization. I would like to conclude with some remarks on the fundamental question of human rights and the prevention of international terrorism.\n101.\tInternational terrorism as a political instrument has indisputably become a sinister feature in the political climate of recent years. Frustrated population groups have sought to enforce their demands by the taking of hostages and by the murder of innocent civilians. This has become an ugly part of life in the 1970s.\n102.\tWe therefore welcome the intention of the Federal Republic of Germany, mentioned here this morning [7th meeting, para. 113], to introduce a new agenda item on measures to prevent the taking of hostages, and the proposal to draft a convention on this issue. The initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany deserves the widest possible endorsement. Being limited to a purely humanitarian aspect of international terrorism and thereby avoiding an acrimonious debate on a definition of terrorism, for which, as all of us know, the world community is probably not ready, the German proposal should command the support of all members of this Assembly.\n\n103.\tWe have noted with regret that the efforts of the United Nations on the human rights issues have become increasingly unsatisfactory in recent years. This serious issue is being increasingly exploited for political purposes. The protection of human rights must be universal. Violations of human rights must be condemned whenever and wherever they occur.\n104.\tThe Danish Government will continue its efforts to strengthen the respect for human rights and will work actively for the elimination of torture and other degradations of the individual. The role of the United Nations in combating violations of human rights in all parts of the world must be strengthened. An important stage in the work of the United Nations to promote the respect for human rights was reached earlier this year when the two International Covenants on Human Rights entered into force. The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* which deals with complaints from individuals about violations of human rights, also entered into force this year, but we have noted with regret that very few countries have ratified it. We urge all countries which have not yet acceded to these three instruments to do so without delay.\n105.\tThe work which is being done by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must be backed and facilitated in every part of the world by the Governments involved.\n106.\tThe problems facing us are numerous and they are difficult. In the search for solutions to our problems we have a unique instrument in the United Nations. Nowhere else are 145 countries trying in common to solve the conflicts and problems of the world. If we are to succeed, it is of paramount importance for us to respect and abide by the principles laid down in the Charter.\n107.\tWe do not want to stress procedure and form and all these things for their own sake. But an Organization of this kind cannot live unless the rules of the game are respected and observed by all Member States.\n108.\tOn the other hand we must realize that these principles should be applied in keeping with the times. It is important that-within the given framework-our Organization should be constantly and constructively adapted to the new conditions of this changing world.\n109.\tWe have the instrument. Let us demonstrate that we have the political will to use this instrument.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Barbados delegation wishes to add its congratulations to those which have already been so eloquently expressed on your election to preside over the current session of this august Assembly. Your election clearly reflects the esteem in which the State which you represent is held in this Organization. Your country, like Barbados, is an island plagued-but, I am happy to say, not paralyzed by economic problems. In the face of serious difficulties, the commitment of your country to extending the frontiers of international justice and equality is particularly welcome. We wish to acknowledge also your personal contribution to the negotiations that have taken place to establish an international regime for the use of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed. The people of Barbados have followed with keen interest and a sense of optimism these deliberations and have observed with constant admiration the skill which you have been displaying as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n3.\tMy delegation wishes to place on record, too, its appreciation for the unstinted application and diligence of the Secretary-General of this Organization, who has quietly and seriously pursued the maintenance of international peace and security in the very troubled months of the last year.\n4.\tMy delegation, which represents a small but proud and industrious people of the Caribbean, wishes to restate its commitment to two sacred principles, namely, the principle of the equality of States and the principle of the universality of this Organization. As far as the equality of States is concerned, countries like Barbados are aware of the ease with which the strong and mighty nations are often alternately bored and irritated by what are considered the empty pretensions and vain posturing of small States. Many large and wealthy States subscribe understandably to the maxim that he who pays the piper should call the tune, and they seek to call the tune for small States like Barbados. But the attitude of painful tolerance does not take account of the part which the sober interventions of small States can, and do, play in the heated debates and discussions which often preoccupy the attention of the world and impinge upon the deliberations and discussions of this body.\n5.\tConscious of the possible contribution of the small States, Barbados happily anticipates the imminent participation of fellow States from the Caribbean, including Belize, in the activities of the United Nations. We island people from the Caribbean stand at the cross-roads where history meets and where alien civilizations converge. I use the word \\\"at\\\" advisedly. I hasten to point out that our role is not to stand in the crossroads, to be trampled by strong and conflicting forces-and there are many abroad in the Caribbean-but to use our experience to influence the course of international developments. We, the small island States of the Caribbean, are peace-loving, progressive and democratic States. Indeed, it is the tide of democracy that has brought me here to this forum after IS years of loyal opposition in Parliament. As members of the Assembly will note, we of Barbados and of the Caribbean are not only peace-loving, progressive and proud; we are also patient.\n6.\tMay I again underline our commitment to the universality of this Organization. This delegation does not held the view that retaliation born of pique and false pride arising out of lost causes should frustrate the legitimate desires of nations to become members of the United Nations. In this regard, this delegation hopes that a way will be found to welcome to our numbers the unrepresented millions of formerly war-torn Angola, Korea and Viet Nam in the near future. Today, we are of course delighted to welcome to the United Nations the representatives of the Seychelles-like Barbados, a Commonwealth and an island people.\n7.\tIt is fitting that I should indicate the commitment of the Government of Barbados to this Organization. We are convinced that continuing dialogue in this forum will eventually lead to solutions to the problems of this world. We are of the opinion that the major international problems have their birth in the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms to individuals and in a lack of real concern about the distribution of wealth among nations. Consequently, in our relations with other States, both within and outside this\nforum, we shall support cases which are concerned with the protection of human rights, the rights of self-determination and the fundamental freedoms of any people. In economic matters, our sympathy will be for the under- endowed, underprivileged and underrepresented.\n8.\tBarbados is a very small State, limited in status and power by its size. But there are some things which operate strongly in Barbados' favor. We face no imminent threat of invasion by a more powerful neighbor. We live in a politically stable and socially homogeneous country. We have strong aid dynamic social institutions. Our educational system is as good as any. Our religious institutions are alive and outward-looking. Our trade unions are free and alert. In short, Barbados' strength is in the quality of its people.\n9.\tWith the support of all Barbadians, the Government is dedicated to trying to find a way towards independence of mind and policy. The Government will embark on an active foreign policy, hoping to strengthen its economic base by strengthening its international links, especially with all Caribbean, Commonwealth and Latin American countries, and with the developing countries as a whole.\n10.\tOur hope of success lies in negotiation and collective action, and one of the main pillars of our hope is this Organization and the specialized agencies to which it has given birth. For this reason, the delegation of Barbados hopes that the work within the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization will contribute to a restructured United Nations system that reflects the configurations of power and the pattern of changes that have taken place since 1945.\n11.\tMatters of war and peace were as crucial in the framing of the Charier of this Organization as they have been in its operation over the past 30 years. The increasing emphasis being placed on matters of economic co-operation and development and on issues related to human rights and freedoms is an indication of the Organization's ability to adapt to the imperatives of the world situation in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n12.\tBarbados will exert itself to achieve a higher standard of living and a better quality of life, not only for the disadvantaged within its own boundaries, but also for the world's deprived who may be assisted by international co-operation.\n13.\tIn respect of the international situation my delegation notes with disquiet the continuing imbalance between the exports and imports of the developing countries, and the failure of these countries as a whole to approach the 7 per cent growth target set in the International Development Strategy for the -Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. On the other hand, the growing concern of Member countries of this Organization about problems of distribution indicates an awareness within the international community that productivity goals without the moral objective of greater equality are in-adequate for the resolution of current international social and economic problems. It is imperative that there be a more equitable distribution of consumption internationally.\n14.\tOn the question of the transfer of resources to developing countries, Barbados has been disappointed. The failure of official development assistance to meet the levels targeted in the International Development Strategy has been a major deficiency in the structure of international co-operation for development. The international economic crisis of recent years, accompanied by an apparent disillusionment among donor countries with, the results of aid programs, has led to a widening gap between aid targets and disbursements. It is perhaps understandable that the perceived needs of the poorest of the developing countries have led the international community to give them priority in disbursement of development assistance. However, it seems that the international norms which have guided such decisions are partial and incomplete.\n15.\tThe emergence of consultative mechanisms at the international level for determining the need for external assistance of a particular recipient country may ensure some measure of consistency in the treatment of that country. However, the recognition that multilateral and bilateral agencies are acting consistently provides no comfort to the small developing country that finds its requests for external support for its domestic efforts increasingly ignored. What is evident is that the current trend of dividing the developing countries into various groups based on allegedly common characteristics can lead to disturbing results. Indeed, there is a real danger that some donors may adopt the view that, because the needs of some groups of States for concessional assistance are particularly urgent, the needs of others have become less urgent. The dangers inherent in the use of crude classifications for determining relative need of external assistance can be obviated only by the establishment of measures and guidelines which apply uniformly to all developing countries and which take full cognizance of the social as well as structural features of their development prospects.\n16.\tBarbados is hopeful that the attempts to deal with the problems of unequal distribution will soon bear fruit. In this connexion the so-called North-South dialogue taking place in Paris, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, must attempt to find answers to the problems developing countries are facing in the four broad areas being dealt with by the commissions, that is, those on energy, raw materials, development and financial affairs. We are concerned that the developed countries appear to be set against accepting the principle of \\\"indexation\\\", which we believe to be an important aspect of any mechanism that may be devised to deal with decreases in export earnings from the commodities of our countries. My delegation is convinced that a relationship must be established between the prices we receive for our exports and those we pay for imports; for our economic development prospects are conditioned by the purchasing power of our export earnings. We trust that such arrangements as the compensatory finance facility of the International Monetary Fund and the integrated program for commodities approved by the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] at Nairobi will be utilized, after appropriate adaptation to meet the needs of developing countries. Moreover, we hope that some means will be found to redress the cash flow shortage in the United Nations Development program [UNDP] which has meant a virtual cut-back in aid to some countries certainty in such aid to Barbados, where we have had to reduce or close programs as a result of UNDP shortfalls.\n17.\tJust as man cannot live by bread alone, so for nations growth targets achieved will not by themselves create a better quality of life for all mankind. A well-fed prisoner or a well-groomed slave is not the Barbadian picture of the happy man. For us human dignity and self-respect are paramount. Therefore this delegation is prepared to raise its voice in the support of international action against imperialism of all kinds, colonialism of all types, and racism of all shades.\n18.\tThe festering wound of gross social injustice and political and economic inequality within southern Africa remains with us. Perhaps, however, at no previous session was it possible to state with as much confidence as we can today that that wound is beginning to heal. The patience of the black people of southern Africa has been sorely tried. Their fortitude, however, has not wavered, nor has their dignity diminished.\n19.\tBarbados wishes to pay a tribute to the courage of and sacrifice made by black men and women and by black youngsters of southern Africa who have been callously cut off in the bloom of their youth. Let all be assured that their contribution will not be forgotten. Equally, let all be cognizant that, even though brutal and heartless tyranny may postpone the day when this Organization will welcome to its ranks with rousing and endless acclaim and enthusiasm the representatives of a free Namibia and a free Zimbabwe, that day must surely come-sooner, rather than later. Let me parenthetically state that Barbados will not support the sham independence of a Transkei. The tide of freedom is flowing southwards across Africa relentlessly and irresistibly. This tide may be temporarily interrupted or momentarily deflected but it cannot be permanently checked or eternally halted. My delegation, speaking without rancor, without bitterness and without malice, calls upon all nations especially those whose assistance has in the past made possible the extension and retention of the iniquitous and inequitable empires of southern Africa, and whose economic strength underpins the racist regimes of southern Africa to exert all efforts to bring about in the near future the demise of racial oppression. Enlightened self-interest suggests it, and objective justice demands it.\n20.\tBarbados notes with pleasure the coming into force earlier this year of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and regards with even more signal pleasure the operation of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That only a handful of nations have found it possible to ratify the Covenants and Protocol is for Barbados a cause of regret and concern. Barbados, as a contracting party-and an early contracting party-to the Covenants, sees them as an opportunity to make a positive contribution to the advancement and development of international order and welfare.\n21.\tThe Optional Protocol which offers individuals who are deprived rights and freedoms an opportunity to bring their grievances before an international commission is revolutionary. In this, Barbados is delighted to be numbered among the revolutionaries. It is our wish that other revolutionaries who often mark the soil more deeply with their footprints because their interests bring them more frequently down revolutionary paths will, in this matter, join us. It is submitted that by the coming into force of those important Covenants the identity of those mysterious inalienable rights adumbrated in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations is more likely to be revealed and realized.\n22.\tBarbados will oppose without fear or favor all social conditions which reduce men to the level of playthings of other men. All too frequently, just as stronger nations make playthings of weaker nations, so do men make playthings of women. The Government of Barbados will be stout in its defense of women, nationally and internationally, and will be in the vanguard with those who fight for the promotion and advancement of the rights of women. Nationally, the Government which I have the honor to lead is committed to a new deal and a charter of rights for women, and a national commission on the status of women will be established. In this way my Government will seek to ensure equal opportunity for employment and equal pay for equal work. My Government is pledged to equal access to education and equal scope for intellectual development; and my Government is solemnly resolved to remove all semblances of female second-class citizenship, with regard to property and personal rights.\n23.\tLegislation will fortify practice; equality before the law will enhance equality in the eyes of the people. Internationally, my delegation will set its face like flint against any discrimination on grounds of sex, will actively join in promoting the enjoyment and exercise of civil rights and will participate in any move to achieve the full integration of women in the total development effort. Perhaps a nation like mine, aware of the contribution and merit of mothers and grandmothers, and aware of the intrinsic strength in people traditionally considered weak, understands better than most the importance and potential of women's increasing contribution to the development of friendly relations among States and to the strengthening of world peace.\n24.\tI am sure that speaking to you, Mr. President, of the need to promote, defend and advance the rights of women is mere preaching to the converted. The achievements of the Heads of Government of the great Republics of Sri Lanka and India are well known in our part of the world and they have spurred on the efforts of women everywhere providing, as it were, encouragement and justification for those efforts.\n25.\tAs in affairs pertaining to the advancement of women and to the promotion and defense of their rights, so in matters regarding the sea, to outline this delegation's progressive position to you, Mr. President, is like carrying coals to Newcastle. My Latin American colleagues tell me that the modern apt hemispheric expression is echar peces al mar-to throw fish into the sea.\n26.\tAs far as the law of the sea is concerned, the Government of Barbados is pledged to the extension of its territorial waters from three to 12 miles, in this respect moving moderately with the tide in extending the saver-\neighty of the coastal State over adjacent waters. Barbados also supports the reasonable preservation of the resources of the sea and will continue to participate fully in the Conference on the Law of the Sea. Our aim will be tG link our efforts with those of other like-minded nations towards the achievement of a just and reasonable international regime for the sea.\n27.\tBarbados' concept of a just and reasonable arrangement includes access to the resources of the sea and the sea-bed for disadvantaged States, whether the disadvantages be natural-for example, those of being land-locked or shelf-locked-or technological. As in so much of our foreign policy which is a reflection of our domestic policy, the view which Barbados will defend is that the strong must share the burdens of the weak. We are all, as nations and peoples, our brothers' keepers.\n28.\tMy delegation therefore subscribes to the view that the sea is jointly owned by the peoples of the world and its resources should be shared fairly and equitably, with a conscious effort to meet the needs of the needy, while utilizing and rewarding reasonably the abilities of the able.\n29.\tIn attempting to reconcile the occasionally conflicting interests of the able and the needy, Barbados believes that the demands of the needy are paramount.\n30.\tThat the discussions on the law of the sea have been so protracted mirrors the controversial and positive nature of the problem and the clash of conflicting self-interest. This delegation does not feel that its intervention in the debate will suddenly resolve the thorny issue. What the representatives of Barbados will bring to the debate, as in all other international issues, will be a measure of good sense, balance and integrity clothed in a willingness to understand contrary viewpoints-with, I admit, a pardonable bias towards the deprived and the disadvantaged.\n31.\tThe threat to international law and order assumes many guises. In the Caribbean we have only recently been confronted by the acts of embittered and frustrated persons intent on waging, in the aim, a campaign of unbridled terror against innocent travelers. Bombings, hijacking of aircraft and other acts of international piracy are being perpetrated with criminal abandon. The new international assassins now injure the innocent in the same manner as those whom they perceive to be the guilty. The Government of Barbados wishes to register in the strongest possible terms its repugnance to this form of international terrorism and blackmail and calls on all countries to raise their voices against this type of conduct.\n32.\tLess than a week ago my country was indirectly dragged into a dastardly incident of this sort which resulted in a serious loss of human lives. We have already expressed, and do so publicly again, our deep regrets to the Republics of Cuba and Guyana and also the the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for that senseless and tragic act. In collaboration with another small sister country, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, my Government has pursued and will continue to pursue a vigorous investigation of that act of terrorism which caused the total destruction of a Cubana Airlines plane shortly after it left our shores. Within 12 hours of the occurrence our investigations and pursuit had already borne some fruit.\n33.\tWe believe that if all the other countries in the world would treat international terrorists with the same determination shown by Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, then this evil would be wiped off the face of the earth. We issue a stern warning to the misguided who would think of involving Barbados in their wicked designs that we consider such acts as instances of gross unfriendliness and that we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to ferret out and punish the perpetrators.\n34.\tWe do not believe that the end justifies the means, and that is why we have endorsed the Tokyo, the Hague and the Montreal Conventions. We urge all countries to do likewise without further delay before such acts of air piracy trigger disruption on a universal scale.\n35.\tBarbados will aim through its work within inter-national organizations to soften extreme positions, to emphasize the need for a modicum of morality and justice in international affairs, and to utilize those organizations for the promotion of peaceful initiatives and for the alleviation of social and economic inequality and injustice. This type of undertaking is of course nothing new in this Organization, and perhaps the experienced and the cynical will say, \\\"We have heard it all before; let's hear his tune in 1980\\\". It is by the actions of Barbados and not by the words of its Prime Minister that Barbados will ultimately be judged. It will be a challenge for my island of Barbados to match its deeds over the next years with the words I have spoken on its behalf today. The international challenge is no more daunting than the national challenge.\n36.\tIt is a challenge that, as the new Prime Minister of Barbados, I am happy to accept on behalf of the people of Barbados.\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin my statement by congratulating Mr. Amerasinghe most warmly on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. His broad and fruitful activities not only as the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka in our Organization but also at the head of the delicate tasks of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea are outstanding qualifications for his difficult task.\n128.\tI wish also to express my gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for his effective and constructive discharge of his duties during the last session.\n129.\tArgentina is pleased at the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to our Organization, and we most sincerely wish to co-operate with it,\n130.\tThe Argentine Government considers that the United Nations has a role of paramount importance in the international system. It is so because the Charter has combined, developed and put into effect principles which are basic and irrevocable axioms of Argentina's foreign policy, and because in recent years, our Organization has formulated other principles which, although novel, are nonetheless important since they lay foundations from which Argentina hopes to see arise a legal framework that will enable us to tackle the solution with possibilities of success.\n131.\tWith the admission of new States at the current session, the United Nations has taken one of the final steps towards achieving the earnestly desired aim of universality. No doubt, this fact marks the end of one stage and the beginning of another of equal or greater importance, because universality is not and could never be an end in itself but is rather the indispensable means of achieving, completely and comprehensively, the aims and ideals which led to the foundation of the United Nations thirty-one years ago.\n132.\tThe time is, therefore, propitious to pause and objectively examine the road we have traveled so far and, what is even more fundamental, to take an inquiring look at the road we will have to travel together if we want to turn a dangerously uncertain future into a promising reality.\n133.\tIt is undeniable that, in recent times, and for the most varied reasons, the Organization has been the target of unfavorable criticism and judgments, either for its actions or for its lack of action. These judgments did not come exclusively from a particular group or sector and in some cases they have been the result of excessive skepticism because of the changes of all kinds that have occurred since 1945; in other cases they have been due to a failure to perceive or accept the reality of the moment and the profound changes that have taken place in the world.\n134.\tThese disappointments probably have, to some extent, a common origin, namely, the fact that misguided or exaggerated expectations have been placed in what the Organization should do to fulfill particular aspirations. But, if we accept the premise that, in the final analysis, the Organization will be what its Members want it to be, it is obvious that, if the political will exists to reconcile individual interests in furtherance of the general interest, we may be able to forge it into an effective instrument of co-operation to solve the pressing problems we face. This is a task that brooks no delay.\n135.\tThe multiplicity of approaches created by these problems, far from discouraging Us, represents an additional challenge in overcoming a temporarily difficult situation, whose greatest ally is immobility.\n136.\tIt has been said, and rightly so, that the United Nations is the mirror of the world. With its shortcomings and its virtues it constitutes the institutional framework which reflects the reality of a dynamic society in a state of constant evolution. What is more, we should be pleased that it has not only been sensitive to changes but has, in many cases, also carried them resolutely forward and legitimized their existence.\n137.\tSuch has been, for example, its history in all matters relating to decolonization. In a process which posterity will recognize as one of its most positive achievements, the Organization was a decisive factor in hastening the end of colonial domination. Resolution 1514 (XV), one of the General Assembly's greatest achievements, was the catalyst which mobilized the efforts to promote decolonization. Its provisions embrace guidelines for dealing with different situations and make them adaptable to each particular case, whether it is the monitoring of self-determination or ensuring the inviolability of a country's territorial integrity.\n138.\tIt is within this latter context that Argentina hopes that an early solution will be found to the problem of the Malvinas, a remnant of colonial expansion in America, which has for so long obstructed the relations between my country and the United Kingdom. The justness of our claim, so often recognized by an overwhelming majority of the States Members of this Organization, with the support of the Latin American countries, reaffirmed in the Inter- American Juridical Committee Declaration of 16 January 1976 [see A/31/23/Rev.l, chap. XXX, annex II] and more recently at Colombo by the Foreign Ministers and Heads of State and Government of 85 countries [see A/311197, annex I, para. 199], was further endorsed by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in its resolution of 17 September last [see A/31/23/Rev.l, chap. XXX, para. 8], in which it reiterated the appeal to the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to expedite the solution to this dispute over sovereignty.\n139.\tThis encourages us to persevere in our efforts through bilateral negotiations, as urged in General Assembly resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII). In this connexion the Argentine Republic constantly bears in mind the interests of the present inhabitants of the islands, whose well-being it guarantees and will continue to guarantee, having shown already specific evidence of this concern which, furthermore, has been acknowledged by this Organization. But it goes without saying that our action cannot be unilateral. Similar determination must be forthcoming on the part of the United Kingdom to enable us to decide together on the measures for ending this dispute and thus cementing the friendship which has predominated in our traditional relationship.\n140.\tThrough the full implementation of the Charter, the United Nations in a few years assisted in the orderly and peaceful transition of numerous peoples and territories from the status of dependence in which they had been for centuries to the status of free and sovereign nations. The very membership of this Assembly is the best permanent tribute to what has so far been done in this field.\n141.\tThe accession of almost a hundred countries to independence entailed some other fundamental consequences also affecting our Organization. First, it promoted the democratization of international relations by enabling all States, regardless of their political, economic or military potential, to express their views and hopes. Secondly, it enabled the new Members to participate on an equal footing in the adoption of decisions likely to have a decisive impact on world events. More important still, it encouraged the emergence of new common areas of interest and created the conditions for a more just and balanced distribution of power. Lastly, a better and broader knowledge of each other's positions has gradually fostered the awareness among States that co-operation and understanding are the only viable means of maintaining peace.\n142.\tIn discharging this primary responsibility of maintaining peace under the Charter the record of the United Nations is not consistent. Although it was unable to set up the machinery of collective security, based on the harmonious collaboration of the great Powers, it can be stated without any doubt whatsoever that, directly or indirectly, it has helped to avert a third world conflagration which would have endangered man's survival. Certainly, on not infrequent occasions it has been powerless to prevent the outbreak of local wars but even so, in many cases, its intervention has served to limit the extent or duration of the conflict. By offering a forum for venting grievances and passions, it has managed, to a significant extent, to ward off situations which in the past would inevitably have led to armed confrontations.\n143.\tThe presence of United Nations forces in different areas of the world where serious possibilities of conflict exist; besides being one of the most instructive examples of what international co-operation can mean, has been and continues to be a vital element for ensuring peace. Once minds were set in the conviction that a nuclear war would entail mutual destruction and the disappearance of every vestige of civilization, the United Nations promoted and welcomed with hope the emergence of a new climate of understanding among the great Powers. Of course, much still remains to be done before the ideal proclaimed at San Francisco of saving \\\"succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" is completely fulfilled. The tragic events in the Middle East and the critical situation in southern Africa are a constant reminder of the fact that this effort must be continuous and unflagging.\n144,\tNevertheless, it is discouraging that spiritual values are still failing to guide the world along a path which would lead to the elimination of hunger, violence and injustice.\n145.\tWith the decline of colonialism in its traditional form, the problems of development became one of the key concerns of the system. In response to urgent needs, and to the actual precepts of the Charter whose Preamble includes the pledge \\\"to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, the United Nations is devoting increasing efforts to this task. A first stage, whose main feature was the identification of the problems and the formulation of the strategy for overcoming them, has slowed down after performing the crucial function of awakening the world's conscience to the problems of development and to their importance for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n146,\tNow, as is clearly evident from the conclusions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, we are well into another stage which ought to be characterized by joint action to achieve a more equitable balance between the developed and the developing countries. It is here that most practical opportunities open up for the so frequently mentioned co-operation between Governments and peoples. It is here that the United Nations can also play a key role in reconciling and concording the legitimate interests and needs of both before the gap dividing them assumes dangerous proportions. It is here, finally, that.the real capacity of the Organization to conclude and implement comprehensive agreements reached through a genuine process of negotiation will be put to a severe test.\n147.\tEvery success in this endeavor will set a meaningful course that may well promote consultations in other fields, such as disarmament, which continues to require urgent and categorical decisions. Despite the numerous resolutions adopted and the incessant urging of the great majority of countries, the armaments race has assumed steadily growing proportions both in terms of the astronomical budgets allocated to it and of the dangerous and sophisticated nature of the weapons themselves. The United Nations has exerted tremendous efforts, by all the means at its command, to check the pace of the competitive armaments race among the great Powers. Hence, it is the latter which must assume the essential responsibility of devoting greater efforts to achieve agreement on effective disarmament measures, giving priority to nuclear disarmament.\n148.\tThe objective of the inescapable negotiation process to be faced and developed in economic relations and disarmament is to devise practical solutions to the global problems now confronting the international community, such as ensuring man's subsistence and guaranteeing his dignity and respect for his essential rights, the production and distribution of food, protection of the environment, the rational and balanced use of resources, population growth, the establishment of a legal regime for the sea, the use of outer space for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of mankind, the application of science and technology to development, trade, and the international monetary system: all these questions must be tackled and solved not by one nation or group of nations, however powerful they may be, but by the whole organized community.\n149.\tThis brings us to a matter that attracts increasing attention, namely, interdependence. Only a relatively short time ago this was a topic deserving academic treatment in the same manner as any working hypothesis is analyzed. The circumstances that I have previously mentioned have radically changed this state of affairs. Nowadays the interdependence of nations and peoples is a fact allowing of no discussion. What can and must be discussed are the guidelines for achieving it, for determining the community of interests it involves and for reactivating the machinery that would foster better international co-operation while respecting and reconciling the identities of the different countries.\n150.\tInterdependence implies, first of all, recognition of the existence of different cultures, policies, ideologies, and legal and economic structures, it entails above all the obligation not to try to impose any system at the expense of another by force, by coercion or by any other form of outside intervention. Interdependence presupposes the sovereign equality of all States and their right to participate in the adoption of decisions that may affect their interests. Interdependence also means the need to conserve the resources of this planet, in order to guarantee our children and our neighbors' children a world worth living in. Interdependence is also the commitment by all States not to jeopardize unilaterally the biological and natural balance of an ecosystem by actions which might affect other countries.\n151.\tIn this connexion I take the liberty of drawing attention to the permanent and effective action taken by various bodies of the United Nations system to ensure compliance with customary and positive norms pertaining to the environment and to improve them on a continuing basis.\n152.\tThere is no doubt that the attitude of the permanent members of the Security Council had a categorical impact on the decisions adopted at San Francisco and, ultimately, on the shape that the Organization would take. The same can now be said regarding the vital questions of peace and war. But what is singularly striking is the ever-increasing role being played by all the other countries, large or small, strong or weak, in the shaping of world events. This growing strength which the great majority of States have been acquiring through their active presence on the international scene must be accompanied by a comparable degree of responsibility and maturity because, in the final analysis, this majority can benefit more from the United Nations in the furtherance of its rightful claims. It is not rash to state that the very existence of the Organization depends on that fact.\n153.\tThe recent significant reduction in the tensions between the super-Powers, the crisis of colonialism and its immediate aftermath and the emergence of new independent countries on the international scene are contributing factors which must help to revitalize the United Nations so that, with renewed impetus, it becomes the forge in which the new formula of understanding are to be molded or, to use the words of the Charter, so that it serves as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of. .. common ends\\\".\n154.\tThis difficult assignment is both urgent and possible. One prerequisite is the conviction that from confrontation no one will gain and all will suffer; that no sector can prosper in isolation, ignoring the legitimate demands of the rest; that, in order to reconcile conflicting interests and secure shared benefits, it is indispensable to act with realism and to make mutual concessions, especially for those better able to grant them.\n155.\tIn some cases it is absolutely indispensable to define the feeling of the international community accurately in matters involving the protection of high moral values or principles that are fundamental for nations and peoples. There cannot and must not be any compromise when resolutions of this nature are adopted. Would it in any case be justified to soften the condemnation deserved by apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination, with the sole objective of getting the support of a few more countries for a draft resolution? To do so would mean evading a solemn responsibility and distorting the spirit of the Charter.\n156.\tThere are areas in which the majorities, and, of course, the minorities, must show greater flexibility and willingness to compromise. I refer to those action-oriented areas in which the success or failure of a decision depends on the general will to carry it out. It cannot be claimed that certain sectors will docilely comply with resolutions of this kind if their opinions have not been sought or duly reflected in the texts prepared.\n157.\tIn order to strengthen the role of the United Nations as an instrument of co-operation it is essential to reverse certain trends which militate against its authority, prestige and effectiveness. Without assigning priorities, I shall name some of them in order to emphasize the singular importance of the task: holding consultations and reaching agreements outside the Organization on essential matters such as peace, security and development when the interests of all Member States are at stake; failing to consider certain questions which are strictly within the competence of the United Nations-a salient example of this is the passivity so far shown towards the serious crisis afflicting Lebanon; applying selective and partial criteria, for political purposes that cannot be concealed, in judging actions and omissions with regard to some problems while ignoring similar situations in other countries; substituting procedural expedients of very doubtful legality for strict compliance with the Charter; ignoring the decisions adopted by the bodies of the system, a large number of which have not begun to be implemented, or obstructing international conferences convened to deal with specific items, by introducing political controversies which can only be analysed and settled by this General Assembly or the Security Council; stressing the importance of problems that are of unquestionable current interest or. of real or potential concern to all countries, while allowing sectional interpretations to intervene in the search for solutions,\n158.\tI must pause here to refer, in this context, to a tragic scourge afflicting the whole world, independently of ideologies and economic systems, namely, international terrorism.\n159.\tAs a contribution to this Assembly, I wish to refer to our unhappy experience. Impelled by its nihilistic motives and in pursuit of its disruptive objectives, terrorism began to creep into our country through the cracks that the free operation of unwary democracy leaves open. The Argentine Government has therefore had to contend with intense and strongly entrenched terrorist activity. The cruelty with which the terrorists act and the suffering they have inflicted and are inflicting on the country are common knowledge. Personal security and the most elementary human rights are constantly threatened by indiscriminate terrorist action, It is obvious that the ultimate aim of the terrorist groups is to destroy the State and undermine the political institutions. My Government is resolutely and firmly determined to take whatever action the situation may dictate to maintain peace and security.\n160.\tRecently some international forums have been showing a dedicated concern for the exercise of human rights in Argentina. In these forums it is forgotten that the Argentine Republic has a tradition and well-deserved reputation as a country that respects the rights and fundamental freedoms of the human person and that it has been a pioneer in developing the right of asylum. Its population is composed of all those who came from other continents in search of peace and liberty, so necessary for the progress offered them under the system and the political organization oT our generous and open land without distinction as to nationality, race or creed. This is the political system which international terrorism is seeking to destroy in Argentina, invoking for the purpose alleged socio-political claims and the enjoyment of human rights.\n161.\tWe Argentinians know that we live in a land of hope for the world; we know the rights we enjoy and we do not shirk our responsibilities vis-a-vis the just causes of mankind. My Government appeals in this honorable Assembly to the Member countries to take cognizance of the dangers which this scourge of the modern world creates for mankind, of the manifold and complex forms in which it manifests itself and operates in the different regions of the world. We realize that distance may make difficult the understanding of the true state of affairs, particularly when information does not reflect it objectively.\n162.\tIn this endeavor, the mass media, which constitute an indivisible part of the international community, and therefore share the responsibility incumbent on all in the effort to create an ever-improving world, are called upon to play a fundamental role in presenting daily events with sincerity so as to provide the world with a true picture of the problems and of their magnitude and thus help solve them.\n163, In his statement to this Assembly a few days ago [7th meeting], the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, suggested that we should undertake a partial study of the matter regarding the taking of hostages for purposes of extortion. While we support this idea, we think it does not fully cover all the complex forms in which international terrorism manifests itself these days. We therefore consider that we should resume the work started by the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism established by resolution 3034 (XXVII) of 18 December 1972, and try to reach an understanding of the broad and general context in which terrorism regularly and tragically appears, with a view to deciding, on the basis of consensus, what international action ought to be taken to solve the problem as a whole. We say this with all the deep conviction of people who are suffering its indiscriminate effects and consequences. We therefore cannot but join the Secretary-General in urging that once and for all the United Nations should address itself with determination to finding a solution to the tragic scourge of international terrorism.\n164.\tIn addition to its universality aspect, Argentina's foreign policy has pursued, is pursuing and always will unswervingly pursue one mandatory concern, namely, America. One of the essential features of our international policy is the.priority we give to America, a priority which is subject to our respect for the principle of national sovereignty. This principle does not involve restrictions, but is on the contrary a clear premise for our firm advance towards continental union.\n165.\tThe Argentine Republic pursues this objective consistently, following in a rational manner a geographical and historical plan that obliges it to phase its activities, which extend all the way from intensive trade with the countries sharing its borders to the continuing search for circumstances conducive to strengthening the bilateral and multilateral links in the region.\n166.\tWe are stout defenders of peace in the continent based on mutual agreement aimed at progress and our contribution to this end is practical and specific. We know we are not alone in this endeavor, that American solidarity is a constantly improving reality and that the day is not far off when our geographical continuity will reflect an outlook based on liberty, democracy and human and community development.\n167.\tI also wish to reiterate, in this forum, my country's renewed commitment to the objectives of co-operation and physical integration on which the joint program of the Rio de la Plata basin has been and continues to be based. In this region, defined as such for its dependence on one hydrographic basin which is possibly one of the world's richest, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina continue to develop joint projects and enterprises both in the field of hydroelectrical power and in the planning of bridges, thoroughfares, roads and communications net-works, thus strengthening the links forged by the geography they share.\n168.\tAlthough differing opinion still exists as regards the best utilization of the resources shared by the region, we are convinced that a new spirit of co-operation will soon emerge for the purpose of carrying out all the scheduled projects on an equitable and rational basis. To that end my Government will take all the necessary steps to clear the way in the assurance that all the other nations of the basin will show a similar will for joint action. Our country has assigned special priority in its foreign policy to the integrated and joint development by all the countries of the Rio de la Plata basin and believes that co-operation in the region can develop on such a scale and acquire such a degree of exemplary effectiveness that its impact will spread to other areas of the world.\n169.\tWith this knowledge and in the conviction that the water problems confronting my country today are of a universal nature, it is opportune that Argentina should have offered to be the venue of the United Nations Water Conference to be held at Mar del Plata in March 1977, in respect of which our Government has already committed itself. In this connexion, I wish to extend to all the countries and organizations here present the wannest of welcomes to Argentina. I am sure that this first international meeting on one of the world's most important resources will enable us to sharpen our critical awareness and at the same time nurture our hopes regarding the possibilities of international co-operation.\n170.\tThe thoughts which I have had the privilege of expressing are motivated by the fervent desire to make a constructive contribution to the progress of our Organization.\n171.\tThe Argentine Government wishes thus to affirm its deep-rooted faith in the United Nations, because it is completely convinced that this Organization is man's most consummate effort to build a future of peace and concord; because, with its long list of successes and mistakes, it is still the only effective means of establishing civilized norms for the coexistence of peoples; because, in it and thanks to it, Argentina has been able to extend its friendly relations to all countries of the world on a basis of mutual respect, thus fulfilling one of the basic precepts underlying its foreign policy; and, finally, because the triumph of the ideals that inspired its creation, with which we fully identify ourselves, is not just an option but a most categorical necessity if reason is to prevail over force, understanding over confrontation, and co-operation over selfishness.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by extending to the President my Government's warm congratulations on his unanimous election to be President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. We are happy indeed that this high office has been filled by his country this year, and that the choice has fallen on him in particular. It is a mark of international tribute to Sri Lanka and its noteworthy role in the United Nations. It is also yet another mark of recognition of his own wide experience and skill in conference diplomacy. We feel sure that the success of the thirty-first session is in safe hands.\n48.\tI wish to place on record also our appreciation of the work of his distinguished predecessor, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg who under difficult circumstances maintained a high standard of leadership and objectivity.\n49.\tIt is customary for us to say a few words about our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. He has tried always to represent the United Nations as accurately as possible. He has reaffirmed his faith in the United Nations when it was most needed. His loyalty to the principles and purposes of the United Nations has been demonstrated on many an occasion, when a lesser man might have faltered. We wish him many more years of dedicated service to the United Nations.\n50.\tWe are glad to welcome Seychelles, our youngest Member. The attainment of its independence through peaceful constitutional means is a tribute to the maturity of its people and its leaders.\n51.\tIt is unfortunate that Viet Nam and Angola have not yet' been admitted to the United Nations, despite their clear entitlement to membership. The peoples of these two countries have had to wage prolonged and bitter struggles for winning their national independence, and having won their birthright, their Governments have applied for admission to the United Nations. This is a remarkable manifestation of their belief that the best guarantee of their independence and future development lies in joining the United Nations. And yet, our doors remain closed to them for reasons that do not carry conviction. We feel sure therefore that there will be a change of heart. We reaffirm our support for the admission of Viet Nam and Angola and we have every expectation that they will soon be seated among us.\n52.\tAn important recent event was the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo in August 1976. It was the largest ever of its kind and demonstrated that, despite their diversity, non-aligned countries are united in their struggle for freedom, equality and peace. The fact that most States on attaining independence from colonial rule have joined the non-aligned family is proof of the continued validity and importance of non-alignment. My Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, stated at the Colombo Conference that in a fast changing world non-alignment remains the bulwark of the ever widening area of peace, a shelter against external pressures and a catalyst for a new world economic order based on equality and justice. The Action Program for Economic Co-operation adopted by the Colombo Conference [A/311197, annex III] is a significant achievement and provides a basis for further collective action.\n53.\tThe United Nations has now been in existence for 30 years and it has seen dramatic changes in the world. It has survived the years of the cold war and has entered a period of detente between the great Powers. It has managed to contain situations of active hostilities and in the process it has acquired useful experience in peace-keeping operations. Its membership has increased rapidly and the United Nations has become a hallmark of independence of countries that have liberated themselves from colonial rule.\n54.\tThe United Nations stands for the promise of peace, equality, justice and full opportunities for the common man everywhere. When one examines the resolutions adopted by the United Nations on a wide variety of subjects, one sees that a quiet revolution has been taking place during the last 20 years- a revolution in the realm of ideas about the quality of peace and the quality of life for all in the future.\n55.\tOn the one hand, the United Nations has been trying to cope with current problems and controversies. Some-times these are issues that could be resolved outside the United Nations by the countries concerned. It is our belief that if the United Nations is to survive and grow into a cooperative organization equipped to deal with problems of the future, we should not unduly burden it with issues that lend themselves to solutions outside the United Nations in conformity with the principles of its Charter. After all, Article 2, paragraph 3, of the Charter stipulates that all Members shall settle their disputes themselves by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered.\n56.\tOn the other hand, there are other types of issues that concern a number of countries and they seem to need the healing hand of the United Nations. But the experience of dealing with even such issues indicates that in the final analysis it is necessary for the parties directly involved to sit together and negotiate practical and reasonable solutions to their mutual benefit. This is as true of the Cyprus question as it is of the Korean question or any other such question for that matter. We wish to draw attention to this basic fact of life, because it is often forgotten in the early stage of most problems. As a consequence the credibility of the United Nations is placed under increasing strain.\n57.\tIssues that directly pose a continued threat to inter-national peace and security merit our attention as a matter of priority. The situation in the Middle East has been a source of grave anxiety. Another war in that region will affect all of us in one way or another. It will almost certainly plunge the peoples of that region into disasters of unprecedented magnitude. The continuing civil war in Lebanon makes us very sad, because of the heavy loss of life and destruction of property. It has also added a new dimension to an already complex situation.\n58.\tThere is no doubt that peace must come eventually to that troubled part of the world. The essential ingredients for a peace settlement have already been set out in Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973). In subsequent resolutions the United Nations has recognized the national rights of the Palestinian people and affirmed the vital importance of the exercise of those rights for the maintenance of peace in that region. The root of the problem of course is the continuing occupation of Arab lands and territories by Israel. Ways and means must be found for implementing the Security Council resolutions and a proper climate for their implementation should be quickly created by an early resumption of the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.\n59.\tThe process of decolonization has maintained its momentum everywhere, except in southern Africa. We had hoped that after the withdrawal of Portuguese colonialism, white minority rule elsewhere in southern Africa would quickly yield to majority rule. But it would seem that our hopes were based on wrong premises. The national liberation movements have been left with no option but to resort to armed struggle. It is particularly sad that the peoples of southern Africa should have to make many more sacrifices before winning their freedom, because it is within the competence of the United Nations to prevent them by taking enforcement action.\n60.\tIn Zimbabwe the time is overdue for the introduction of majority rule. The question of a constitution, safeguards for minorities, etc. surely must follow the establishment of majority rule. Diplomatic efforts are being made by front-line African States and others to resolve the problem democratically and peacefully through negotiations. The regime of Ian Smith clearly has no basis in law or in the will of the people, and it must yield to majority rule without any delay, if further bloodshed is to be avoided. The United Kingdom, whose legal responsibility continues, could play a helpful role at the present juncture.\n61.\tIt is necessary to remind ourselves that the Territory of Namibia has international status and that South Africa's presence there is illegal. South Africa's open challenge to the authority of the United Nations has remained unanswered in effective terms. Almost every Member of this Organization agrees that steps should be taken to retrieve in practice what the United Nations legally holds in trust, which is the Territory of Namibia and the destiny of its people. But nothing has been done so far except to adopt recommendatory resolutions. Nothing could cause greater harm to the credibility of the United Nations than its failure to assume in practice responsibility for what belongs to it in law. The implications of this should be squarely faced by those countries that support the legal position but are not prepared to enforce it. Here again, diplomacy seems to be at work to bring together representatives of the people of Namibia to discuss and agree upon the process towards their independence within a short period of time. The United Nations cannot afford to fail in Namibia, because the Members of this Organization have a collective legal responsibility for its independence.\n62.\tThe infamous policy of apartheid, which is the device employed by the white minority regime in South Africa to perpetuate its rule, has been roundly condemned by nearly all Members of the United Nations. That policy, racist in concept and rooted in slavery, contains within it the seeds of its own violent destruction. It is a flagrant violation of the concept of equality of human beings regardless of color or race. We see already the beginnings of its end and we hope it will be peaceful. We extend our sympathies to the victims of racist oppression in Soweto and Cape Town.\n63.\tWe hope that the white rulers in South Africa, in order to avoid further loss of life and property, will give up the policy of apartheid and replace it with a forward-looking enlightened policy that will enable all persons, regardless of race or color, to live together on a basis of complete equality. The intention of the white South African Government to grant so-called independence to Transkei sad to create similar \\\"bantustans\\\" is no solution. It is nothing more than the logical extension of the policy of apartheid and is intended to create satellite black areas without any real independence. It will intensify racial discrimination rather than eliminate it, and it should be rejected by the United Nations.\n64.\tTurning now to some other important problems, may I mention that while we have welcomed the state of detente in East-West relations, we have always stressed that efforts to consolidate and intensify detente should respond positively to the anxieties and aspirations of the rest of the world. This can best be done through meaningful disarmament measures, through implementing agreed measures for securing a rational and equitable new economic order, and through non-interference in the internal affairs of developing countries. It is only through such steps that detente can spread to all regions and create its own momentum for establishing mutually co-operative and beneficial relations between all States.\n65.\tThe frightful dilemma facing mankind today is the incredible accretion of enormous military power by a few countries and their seeming inability to deescalate the arms race. They seem to be under a strange compulsion to race faster and faster in order to remain in the same position of parity. The price of this parity is reported to be Of the order of $US 300 billion per annum at present. Despite the astronomical waste involved in the diversion of vast resources for achieving the so-called balance of strategic power or mutual deterrence, war continues to remain a likely consequence. It is significant that the United States Secretary of State should have cautioned that any one of the current regional crises could blossom into a larger conflict [11th meeting].\n66.\tThe rest of the world cannot remain insensitive to this prospect. It seems unlikely that there will be significant progress in social reform and economic development in developing countries as long as world military expenditure continues to grow at the present rate. My delegation has been among the foremost to propose a variety of disarmament measures since 1950 but it is regrettable that little progress has been made. The need for a world disarmament conference has become increasingly urgent. It might be useful by way of preparation to have a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted exclusively to disarmament. If we can have world conferences on space, atomic energy, environment, human settlements, trade and development, and so on, there is even greater reason and greater urgency for organizing a world conference on disarmament.\n67.\tSeveral speakers have referred to the problem of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. India has consistently supported efforts in the direction of achieving nuclear disarmament. We are surprised that attempts are continuously being made to confuse the question of non- proliferation of nuclear weapons with the legitimate right of all Member States to engage themselves in programmers involving peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We reject the thesis that access to the benefits of nuclear energy should be limited only to a few nations, or that only some countries can be trusted to behave in a responsible manner in embarking upon and implementing programs in the area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n68.\tThe initiative of the USSR in proposing a treaty on non-use of force in international relations is a positive step and deserves the most careful consideration by the General Assembly. It is in fact an attempt to elaborate the principle already enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter that all members shall refrain from the threat or use of force in their international relations.\n69.\tAnother initiative of the USSR, which is of direct interest to us, is the statement made by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union the other day that his country did not have \\\"any intention of building any military bases in the Indian Ocean\\\" [7th meeting, para. 185] and that it was \\\"prepared, together with other Powers, to seek ways of reducing on a reciprocal basis the military activities of non-coastal States in the Indian Ocean and the regions directly adjacent thereto\\\" [ibid., para. 186]. This is a welcome statement. We trust that it will be reciprocated by other great Powers so that existing foreign military bases such as Diego Garcia are eliminated and the Declaration of the General Assembly that the Indian Ocean shall be a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] can become a reality.\n70.\tIndia attaches great importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. While it has succeeded in evolving a consensus on many important issues, the search for a consensus is still continuing on the remaining issues like the system of exploitation of the- international sea-bed area and its resources which are the common heritage of mankind. The developing countries, which have suffered from the consequences of colonial domination and the arbitrary operations of an unjust economic order, cannot be deprived of their legitimate share in the vast sea-bed resources by technologically advanced countries unilaterally exploiting these resources.\n71.\tI should like to say a few words about a problem that has been recently plaguing many countries and affecting the lives of all travelers. It is the pernicious practice of making hostages of innocent persons for political or other reasons. I feel sure that this practice deserves to be condemned by all States in the strongest terms. But what is more important is that we should all do something more to put an end to it. The initiative taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to propose an international convention against the taking of hostages [A/311242] is timely. The terms of such a convention should be so drafted as to secure the widest possible support.\n72.\tIn our part of the world, India has been pursuing a deliberate policy of normalizing and improving relations with all its neighbors. We intend to continue to persist in developing good neighborly relations with all.\n73.\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan referred the other day [8th meeting] to the so-called dispute relating to Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. He also referred to the resolutions of the Security Council of 1948 and 1949. Those resolutions were not implemented at that time because Pakistan did not fulfill certain essential preconditions that had been laid down in them. As a consequence the resolutions became obsolete and this was repeatedly made clear to the Security Council. In our opinion it is now entirely unrealistic to hark back to those resolutions. The Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, however, provides a practical and realistic basis for overcoming all impediments to friendly and co-operative relations between India and Pakistan. The implementation of that Agreement has already resulted in a large measure of normalization of relations in several fields. It is our intention to persist in this process because we believe that it can lead to stability and durable peace in the subcontinent.\n74.\tWith Bangladesh we wish to develop, on a basis of equality, close and friendly relations to our mutual benefit. Unfortunately Bangladesh has chosen to bring before this General Assembly certain misconceived allegations concerning the equitable sharing of the waters of the river Ganga during the lean period of the dry season every year. My delegation expressed our views on this issue when the question of the inclusion of the item came up before the General Assembly [4th meeting], I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate our firm belief that the discussion of this question in the United Nations will only serve to complicate the situation and impede bilateral negotiations.\n75.\tI should like to turn now to the struggle in the United Nations for a square deal for developing countries-a struggle that has already entered its second decade with no promise or even hope of an early solution. The grievances and expectations of developing countries have been clearly set out in previous sessions of the General Assembly and in various other conferences. But we still seem to be convening one conference after another for no ostensible reason other than to repeat and reaffirm earlier resolutions. Developing countries find themselves in a state of political independence in an economic environment over which they have little control and which they have inherited through historical circumstances. They are in the grip of forces manipulated by developed countries largely for their own benefit. Such a situation is likely to lead to the permanent impoverishment of developing countries, while developed countries continue to prosper at the expense of others. This state of affairs is both immoral and intolerable. Decisions already taken and measures agreed on at earlier conferences should be speedily implemented through constructive negotiations.\n76.\tThe indebtedness of developing countries has exceeded $US 15O billion with repayments increasing every year. Developing countries now face the dilemma of either not paying their debts, or suspending altogether the process and tempo of their national development. This problem can be resolved only if the international community as a whole draws up mutually agreed norms for affording realistic and immediate relief to debtor countries. Even a 5 per cent reduction in the military budgets of developed countries could facilitate the transfer of much needed resources and open for two thirds of mankind vast opportunities for development.\n77.\tThe survival of mankind in all its many splendored diversity depends on planned expansion of areas of equitable interdependence. My Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi observed recently at the Colombo Conference of non-aligned countries:\n\\\"The community of nations should jointly and peace-fully achieve that elusive equation between global production and consumption that yields the right share for each nation. Patchwork remedies are no substitute for genuine reform. We need a global perspective plan that would relate resources to human needs and provide a system of early warning of imbalances and disasters. Improved terms of trade and credit, easier access to markets and better value for raw materials and industrial goods are all essential to secure greater equity in the distribution of benefits.\\\"\n78.\tTo that end we need to evolve a global ethic, a code of conduct and a set of principles for managing interdependence for the purpose of sustaining economic development. We need also the sort of interdependence among nation States that preserves their sovereignty, transcends political ideologies, harmonizes the actions of States for common ends, strengthens the weak and prevents their exploitation by the strong, prohibits policies which beggar one's neighbor and envisages an equal share in decision-making.\n79.\tRecognition of this mutuality of interests and of the need to rearrange the present economic system on a more equitable basis should influence the attitudes of the affluent countries in such a manner that their people respond readily and positively to the modest national objectives of developing countries. Unfortunately, the response of the developed countries so far indicates a certain wavering of political will to meet the full dimension of the challenges and opportunities inherent in the present situation, as evidenced by the slow progress made by the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation. Perhaps fear of the unknown future, or reluctance to reduce wasteful consumption, is at the root of their inadequate response.\n80.\tSurely, they must realize that there can be no freezing of the status quo of dependence between the developed and developing countries. The present situation must inevitably evolve into a new order of equitable interdependence and mutual benefit. Self-serving short-term remedies will not meet the long-term requirements of the present situation. So far as the developing countries are concerned, they should be prepared to safeguard their own interests through a higher level of individual and collective self-reliance as well as mutual co-operation.\n81.\tThe strength of the developing countries rests, of course, entirely on their own unity and their sense of purpose. Theirs is not the strength that comes from numbers alone but rather from the shared awareness that they form the backbone of peace-loving nations. They represent not only the majority of the nation States of the world but also the majority of the world's population. Their aspirations therefore acquire a special meaning for mankind's future, for they represent the hard core of suffering humanity. Their collective position should make an appropriate impact on the attitudes of developed countries and their peoples.\n82.\tAs the United Nations enters the fourth decade of its existence, I would like to recall in conclusion the words of our former Prime Minister and leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who said on the first day of our independence: \\\"Peace is said to be indivisible; so is prosperity, and so also is disaster in a world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments.\\\"\n"

This policy has the support of the entire Swedish nation. We believe that this policy enjoys the confidence and respect of other countries. It will, as hitherto, be pursued with firmness and consistency.\n85.\tSweden will continue close and trustful co-operation with the other Nordic countries.

It contributes to peace and stability in our part of the world.\n86.\tSweden will work to ensure that the policy of detente benefits all countries. It is natural for us to stress the importance of detente for the development of peaceful conditions in Europe and for increased co-operation between all European States. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Helsinki, was an important step along this road. We shall work for the implementation of all parts of the Final Act of the conference and for the serious consideration of all possibilities for extended co-operation.\n87.\tSupport of the United Nations is a corner-stone of Swedish foreign policy. The United Nations should be an organization where all the States of the world have an opportunity to make their voices heard and to assert their rights and interests. This is of particular importance for the small nations that wish to preserve their national independence while developing a widespread international cooperation.\n88.\tIf peace is to be stable and lasting, progress must be made towards the halting of the arms race and the reduction of armaments. Sweden will continue to make vigorous efforts to achieve results in the disarmament work of the United Nations and in other international forms. We shall pay special attention to measures designed to reduce the risk of that catastrophe for mankind, a nuclear war. This implies a demand that the nuclear-weapon Powers stop all nuclear-weapon tests and continue, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons[resolution 2373(XXII), annex], their negotiations on effective measures towards nuclear disarmament. It implies a demand that all the States of the world seriously consider the risks of a spread of nuclear weapons to countries that do not now possess them and shoulder the obligations motivated by these risks. If nuclear energy equipment and technology is transferred from one country to another, means must be found fully to guarantee that all nuclear energy in the recipient country be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n89.\tToday, the sum of $300 billion is used annually for military purposes. The total development assistance contributed by the rich countries to the poor countries is but one fifteenth thereof. These figures point to the gigantic and tragic misuse of the material and human resources of the world, creating injustice both within and between nations. What is more, it does nothing to bring us one step nearer the intended goal: increased military security. We have here an enormous reserve of resources which could be used for realizing a new international economic order. Everyone must recognize that there is a link between disarmament and development.\n90.\tThe role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament must be strengthened. A first step towards that goal has already been taken.\n91.\tSweden welcomes the idea of a special session of the General Assembly dealing with disarmament issues. Such a meeting would give all the States Members of the United Nations an opportunity to contribute to the strategy for genuine disarmament. If it is well prepared, it would mark the beginning of a new and fruitful epoch in negotiations on this issue-ultimately a matter of the survival , of mankind.\n92.\tSweden will take an active part in efforts to create more equitable relations between countries at various stages of development. Our development co-operation is designed to promote social and economic justice and equality in the developing, countries. We consider that solidarity places an obligation on all the rich countries, in both East and West, to realize the ideas behind a new international economic order. Sweden will, as hitherto, consistently seek measures-at the national as well as at the international level-which can bring us closer to this .important goal.\n93.\tIt must obviously be in the interest of the rich countries to co-operate with the developing countries in order to reduce the risk of confrontations which in the long run can endanger peace.\n94.\tWe want to see tangible results from the negotiations which are now in progress or at the planning stage in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCIAD], in the North-South dialog in Paris and in other forums. Among problems requiring solution are the stabilization of commodity markets, joint responsibility for developments in the field of energy, in a global perspective taking into account the interests of all nations, reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official assistance to developing countries before 1980, promotion of trade between the industrialized and the developing countries and between the developing countries themselves, and alleviation of the heavy public debt burdens of the poorest countries in particular.\n95.\tIn the long-term perspective, all States will have to undertake strict management of scarce global resources and take forceful measures to protect the human environment.\n96.\tAmong other important issues to which we must devote much more attention and greater resources is th? development of alternative sources of energy. We believe that it is essential for all of us, not least for the developing countries, to take part in such efforts.\n97.\tOur purpose must be to bring about stable economic and social progress and promote security throughout the world. In a spirit of international solidarity, we must strive patiently and persistently towards the ultimate goal-global justice. The endeavors being made to this end within the framework of the non-aligned movement-most recently at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo-have our appreciation and support.\n98.\t1975 was International women's Year. We must ensure that the recommendations adopted by the Mexico Conference are put into practice. Our work for equality between women and men must not be confined to isolated manifestations; it must permeate our day-to-day work \nwithin Member States as well as in the international organizations.\n99.\tAll the States Members of the United Nations have undertaken to protect human rights. This is a vital task, not only for promoting the well-being of the individual, but also for the development of friendly relations between States and for avoiding international tensions and crises. It is all the more deplorable that people all over the world still suffer under outrageous forms of degradation and violence.\n100.\tSweden will lend unrelenting support to the struggle against the oppression of individual human beings or groups of people. We condemn any form of persecution of men and women on account of their political or religious convictions, or their racial and ethnic background, wherever this occurs.\n101.\tGuided by these general principles, on which there is wide consensus in Sweden, we pursue an active foreign policy. These principles will also determine the stand we take on questions discussed in the various organizations within the United Nations family.\n102.\tLet me now give you the Swedish Government's view on some of the issues before this General Assembly.\n103.\tBefore doing so, I wish, on behalf of my Government, to extend a heartfelt welcome to the Republic of Seychelles, our newest Member in the United Nations. I also want to express the hope that Angola and Viet Nam, which have gained independence after long struggle, will very soon be granted membership and given the opportunity to take part in our work.\n104.\tDie oppression of the black majorities in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia has rightly been condemned by the various organs of the United Nations for many years. The systematic racial discrimination practiced there is in glaring conflict with the Charter of the United Nations and is a particularly abhorrent violation of human rights and freedoms. The system can only be upheld by force and leads to continuous and escalating violence. The brutal acts of oppression in Soweto and Nyazonia this last summer testifies to the desperation of the white rulers. Sweden will increase its support to the struggle for liberation in southern Africa.\n105.\tSweden and many other States have characterized the situation in southern Africa as a threat to peace. If acceptable results cannot be attained through negotiations, the Security Council should therefore impose sanctions to eliminate the threat. In the first place, we have proposed that the recommendation already adopted by the Security Council on the cessation of all shipments of weapons to South Africa  should be made mandatory. Such a measure would give effective expression to the entire international community's condemnation of South Africa's policies.\n106.\tFurthermore, Sweden would be prepared to support realistic proposals for further measures, inter alia, a ban on new foreign investments in South Africa and Namibia.\n107.\tThe black population of Zimbabwe has waged a long struggle for its legitimate demand for majority rule. If this demand is now met as a result of negotiations, it will be a source of great satisfaction in my country, which feels deep sympathy with the struggle of the black population for their rights. All attempts to delay the transition to majority rule increase the risk of intensified violence.\n108.\tIn Namibia, South Africa upholds its illegal rule and increases the oppression of the black majority. South Africa must now be forced to accept the solutions prescribed by the United Nations, so that Namibia can at last achieve national independence as a unitary State. SWAPO must be a principal party in the negotiations towards such solutions.\n109.\tThe abhorrent apartheid system in South Africa itself must be brought to an end. We know that every attempt towards change meets with fierce resistance. The white minority clings to their economic and political privileges. It is against this background that we must view the plans to establish the so-called independent homelands, in other words, the \\\"bantustan\\\" policy. Sweden will in no form recognize such States. We should examine whether the United Nations can assist in bringing about early negotiations between all racial groups in South Africa in order to prepare a future, free of discrimination and oppression for all South Africans for the good of the whole country. As the situation is now, we must continue our efforts in the United Nations to achieve broad consensus on measures that can bring apartheid to an end.\n110.\tAnother problem which is continuously in the forefront of the United Nations is the situation in the Middle East. During the past year, we have followed with deep concern the tragic civil war in Lebanon. The war means catastrophe for the population of the country. It is a forceful reminder that a comprehensive solution to the conflict in the Middle East must be found without delay. The Swedish Government holds that a settlement must be based on Security Coronal resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). Israel and all other States in the area have the right to national existence and integrity within secure and recognized boundaries. The principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force must be respected. Moreover, it must be firmly established that the legitimate national interests of the Palestinian Arabs must be satisfied. This includes their right to create their own State which lives peacefully with Israel. Above all, it is essential that contacts be established without delay for the purpose of achieving an agreed settlement. If not, the risk of new outbreaks of violence will increase, bringing again terrible suffering to the peoples concerned.\n111.\tI have already stressed the importance that the Swedish Government attaches to the protection of human rights and freedoms as well as to the fundamental economic and social rights of all human beings and all groups in society. We shall actively combat the use of torture and other particularly abhorrent violations of human rights. Chile and South Africa are two examples present in our minds. International co-operation is also necessary to prevent the taking of hostages, the hijacking of aircraft and other similar repugnant forms of violence. The encouragement of, and co-operation in, acts of this kind is equally reprehensible. We are of the opinion that the United\u2003Nations should take an active part in combating criminal acts of this nature. The United Nations should consider the question of the treatment of men and women who, in many parts of the world, are imprisoned because they have voiced inopportune opinions.\n112.\tWe welcome the progress which has been made in Geneva towards the formulation of humanitarian rules to be applied in armed conflicts. Sweden hopes that all States will soon realize their common interest in imposing a total ban on the use of certain particularly cruel weapons, such as napalm. As the Colombo Conference also declared, negotiations on these issues must be accelerated.\n113.\tTo conclude I wish to reiterate the readiness of the Swedish Government to contribute towards making the United Nations into an organization for the broadest possible co-operation between all countries in order to promote security for human beings all over the world and to satisfy their most fundamental needs -peace, freedom, equality, and social and economic security. If we can clearly demonstrate that the United Nations serves these purposes, the world Organization will also gain the confidence of nations, of non-governmental organizations working for the principles and ideals of the United Nations, and of individual human beings all over the world. This is the only foundation on which we can base the future work of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, as I join my voice to those of the distinguished speakers who preceded me in congratulating Mr. Amerasinghe on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly, I do so, not merely to conform to standard General Assembly practice, commendable as it is, but also to pay a heartfelt and profound tribute to an outstanding statesman of great vision and comprehension of the contemporary world and, equally important, to one whose deep and innermost sense of moral values does not, however, detract from his objectivity and pragmatism. We are firmly convinced that, under his accomplished guidance, the work of the thirty-first session of the Assembly will be carried out with statesmanship and vision.\n184.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n185.\tJordan is happy to welcome to the United Nations its newest Member, the Republic of Seychelles, and wish it success and prosperity.\n186.\tA study of the agenda of the current session, which contains nearly 125 items, shows how monumental it is in scope, variety and magnitude. It is a true affirmation of how far the United Nations has come in its never-ending search for the emancipation and advancement of humanity in many fields.\n187.\tThere are landmark achievements which have fundamentally transformed the political map of the the world and have restructured relations among nations, replacing a long and painful era of dominance and subjugation by one of liberation, independence and formal equality among nations. There still persist pockets of non-emancipation, injustice and aggression-relics of ages past. But it is, we are certain, a foregone conclusion that these pockets will wither away sooner rather than later and that the United Nations; with its unbending commitment to its Charter and its collective determination to abide by that Charter, will be a principal catalyst in achieving this goal.\n188.\tIt would be an exercise in futility even to attempt in this relatively short address to tackle more than a few highlights of the issues which my Government deems of the utmost urgency for world peace and security, as well as for the fulfillment of the principles, purposes and ideals of the United Nations. The attainment, by and large, of the new international political order has now been complemented by concerted efforts towards achieving an equally equitable new economic order, in which formal equality is given substantive expression in the life of nations and of humanity at large. The desire for and achievement of sovereign national existence, formerly a final objective, are giving way to the stark realization of the imperatives of interdependence in a continually shrinking world.\n189.\tThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in his exemplary introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/3111 /Add.l], has summed up and focused attention on the major areas of vJnited Nations achievements and concerns. In a balanced, sober and oftentimes critical appraisal, the Secretary- General has most ably alerted us to what was, what is and what ought to be if the willingness and the will are available to help us move forward towards the realities of a changing world.\n190.\tThe overriding concern of humanity is the preservation of international peace and security, which in the nuclear age means nothing less than the survival of this earthly planet and its people. It goes without saying that Jordan, like other nations, rejoices in the continued preservation of the policy of detente and looks forward to its concrete institutionalization and expansion. Some cynics say that detente is the result of the \\\"balance of terror\\\" and the \\\"balance of prudence\\\". But regardless of the motivation, the policy of detente has spared humanity the certainty of its own global destruction.\n191.\tMy delegation can only express the hope that the negative motives of. detente can be transformed so that there may be positive and constructive coexistence. That requires a \\\"mutation of consciousness\\\", so that aggressiveness may be replaced by friendship and understanding.\n192.\tWorld peace and security require the intensification of the current efforts in the field of disarmament, which, we must regretfully note, have been painfully slow and inconclusive. It is very difficult to assess the complex factors which, quantitatively or qualitatively, have blocked the achievement of progress in this field. The super-Powers long ago exceeded the levels of global over-kill. None the less, further success in controlled disarmament is symbolic of a healthy change in orientation, from resignation to the feasibility of war as an option to a firm determination that war shall never be an option.\n193.\tI would express my Government's hope that the realization that global war is impossible will not be supplanted by a tolerant attitude towards sub-global and regional wars, which, although they may not destroy the whole world, can bring great destruction and in the end can, even by accident, escalate and lead to doomsday.\n194.\tWhile I am speaking on this important subject, I should like to affirm once again my Government's support for the proposal that the Middle East should become a nuclear-weapon-free zone. But it must be emphasized that this proposal can have credibility and permanence only if it is accepted by all States in the area without exception. It is an open secret that Israel has subtly acknowledged its nuclear capability and has leaked information about its readiness to include that capability in its military arsenal and options. That is a dangerous situation, whose grotesque and far-reaching implications can hardly be over-emphasized, particularly at this crucial juncture when all States, large and small, are addressing their urgent attention to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is a situation in which the world cannot accept exceptions. This is a contagious, dangerous disease which must be promptly and firmly contained.\n195.\tIt is now an accepted truism that international society, like any national society, cannot be sustained indefinitely in conditions where the world is divided between small islands of riches and affluence, and vast oceans of human poverty. The earlier optimism, of the 1950s and 1960s, when hopes hinged upon a gradual but imperative bridging of the gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots,\\\" is gone. The original gap seems to be widening today rather than narrowing and at an accelerated rate which only phenomenal technological breakthroughs are making possible. There is a growing realization that national efforts at economic and social betterment are wholly inadequate to remedy a situation whose seriousness is compounded as we enter the final quarter of this twentieth century. It was in recognition of that lamentable fact that the General Assembly, meeting in its sixth special session in 1974, issued a call for a new international economic order and later, at its regular session, adopted a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Since then the forums of debate have proliferated and multiplied, which has been only natural in view of the complexities and wide-ranging dimensions of the issues involved.\n196.\tThis year alone has witnessed five major conferences, not to mention more limited regional meetings, endeavoring to grapple with the ever-growing economic and social ills which afflict our contemporary world of interdependence. The law of the sea, the fourth session of UNCTAD, Habitat, the World Conference on Employment  and the recently concluded Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries in Mexico City are but highlights in the ongoing progress of collective co-operation. It was heartening that at the last-mentioned conference, in Mexico, a major key-stone was the emphasis on the concept of collective self-reliance. This is highly gratifying because the developing countries, with their deep sense of pride, would never wish to be in the position of coveting the riches of the more richly endowed or of queuing up to receive doles in the name of economic egalitarianism.\n197.\tJordan endorses the proposal of Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, concerning the convening of a summit conference of developing countries, which was adopted in Mexico.\n198.\tThere are historical circumstances, including colonialism and exploitation, and there is also the social and scientific gap. There are also the dwindling natural re-sources. All these factors make the developing countries remain backward when compared to developed countries. If those countries look forward to anything, it is to themselves planning and controlling their internal development. But it is clear that they need assistance in order that their development may be pursued seriously.\n199.\tThe developing countries urgently need technology, education, experience and initial capital outlays, which are available to only a small number of countries. It is against this background that we are dismayed to read that, whereas close to $300 billion were spent on wasteful armaments last year alone, a mere $15 billion were spent in official aid for developing countries. The figures just cited show clearly that we are still in the embryonic stage of the drive to structure the new international economic order and that at this session and for decades to come the United Nations should give all its attention to the appalling inequities which afflict the world.\n200.\tThe great continent of Africa is dear to our hearts not only because of the numerous cultural and historical ties which have bound the Arab world to the peoples of Africa since the dawn of recorded history but also because, like ourselves, the peoples of Africa have in the past been among those most maligned, exploited, colonized and discriminated against. We rejoice that Africa is once more master of its own destiny and a potent force in the family of nations. But there are still residues of resistance to the newly emerging world of freedom, dignity and common decency . South Africa stands condemned before the world as the standard-bearer of resistance to the newly born world order.\n201.\tFirst there is the situation in Namibia, where South Africa while feigning readiness to comply, continues to defy United Nations decisions to grant the Territory and its people their inalienable rights to freedom and independence, in its efforts to ward off the relentless pressure of the international community to make it comply fully with United Nations resolutions.\n202.\tSecondly, the long-overdue solution to the tense situation in Southern Rhodesia seems to have reached a turning-point in the direction of a peaceful solution, thanks to the courageous struggle of its people, the concerted efforts of the United Nations, and, latterly, the serious pressure the United States and Britain have exerted to bring about the long-sought solution. We look forward to removing the loop-holes which the leaders of Africa most directly concerned find unacceptable and to welcoming Zimbabwe to this Assembly in their near future.\n203.\tThe policy of racial discrimination and apartheid in South Africa itself continues as an affront to the conscience of the civilized world. Its exclusive nature, identical with the exclusive nature of its counterpart, the Israeli system in the Middle East, is a blatant violation of everything the United Nations Stands for.\n204.\tAt the outset of my discussion of the Middle East I cannot but express the most profound sorrow concerning the tragic events which at present afflict Lebanon and its inhabitants. Lebanon has always been and will continue to be a land of fraternity, tolerance, love and peace.\n205.\tWe hope that the efforts which all parties concerned are at present exerting towards the restoration of peace, stability and tranquility to Lebanon will be concluded successfully within the framework of its national unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty so that it may resume its leading role in the contemporary.Arab renaissance.\n206.\tIn discussing the intractable situation in the Middle East, by far the oldest item on our agenda, we find that it still seems the most unnameable to reasonable solution or even to any movement forward in that direction. On the contrary, any moves are in the direction of continual retrogression, as I shall explain later.\n207.\tNo statement could with greater precision have described the situation in the Middle East today than the Declaration adopted by the Fifth Conference of non- aligned countries at their meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in the summer of this year. That is why I beg the Assembly's indulgence as I quote from that Declaration. It states:\n\\\"The Middle East situation continues to pose a grave threat to international peace and security. About nine years following its 1967 aggression, Israel continues to occupy Arab territories and violate the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The Israeli aggressors persist in their policy of expansion, annexation, mass expulsion and repression of the Arab population, in violation of the United Nations Charter and resolutions and the principles of humanitarianism and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention. Moreover, Israel continues to establish settlements in the occupied Arab territories and take measures aiming at the alteration of the political, demographic and cultural features and religious character of Jerusalem and other occupied Arab territories.\\\" [A/31/197, annex I, para. ',0.]\n208.\tI may add on this occasion that I condemn the desecration of the Ibrahimi Mosque in recent years by the Israeli settlers, at a time when the occupying authorities were present and able to see all these desecrations.\n209.\tThe Israeli authorities are indulging in these acts of spoliation, sequestration and plunder with a zeal and lust which surpasses their absorption of the territories which they occupied in 1948, both within and without the areas allotted to them by the United Nations. It is to them a race against time-a time when the world will have mustered the will and the courage to bring them to account. And when that time comes, they will answer: \\\"But how can we change the new faits accomplis? \\\"\n210.\tThe Israelis have practically devoured the heartland of the occupied West Bank. The Jerusalem which they claim as wholly theirs, against the categorical and irrevocable will and decisions of the world community, has been so expanded in area that it now encompasses the outskirts of Bethlehem to the south, Ramallah to the north, the Nebi Sumwail to the west and the Khan el-Ahmar to the east. As the United Nations well knows, this has been done in violation of all its relevant resolutions, and all of you know that the greater part of the Jordan Valley, west of the River Jordan, has been largely confiscated from its legitimate farmers in the pretext of its being a military zone, which invariably means colonization by Israeli settlers. Even within the remaining hinterland, confiscations are being diligently carried out, often with official approval, and on many other occasions by groups which take the law into their own hands. Arab quarters and lands in Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, Jericho, Kofr Qaddum and many other locations throughout the length and breadth of the West Bank and Gaza -in themselves a mere one fifth of Mandated Palestine - are regarded by the Israeli occupation as attractive prey to its insatiable lust and ambition, with no regard whatsoever for the legitimate and elemental rights of their inhabitants.\n211.\tThe peak of the tragedy of a decade of occupation, and its most grotesque manifestation, is the tragedy of the city of Jerusalem, which has befallen not only its inhabit-ants but also hundreds of millions of people, belonging to every race and creed throughout the world.\n212.\tHow can the Israelis deny that Jerusalem has, throughout history, been the object of infinite veneration, worship and hope, not merely to themselves but to countless millions in the Muslim and Christian worlds, and indeed to mankind as a whole? For 1,4G0 years we have been the proud and faithful custodians of its uniquely universal and indestructible legacy and glory. How does Jerusalem stand today? It is being defaced and dismantled systematically beyond recognition. New structures have ringed the city on all sides, in violation of the norms which govern the status of ancient and historic cities- and, indeed, in violation of specific and categorical General Assembly and Security Council resolutions in this respect, which had reiterated that all Israeli actions in the city are totally invalid and should be revoked.\n213.\tIt is inconceivable that the universal character of Jerusalem should be desecrated, compromised and emasculated by the exclusive claims to hegemony of Israeli occupation.\n214.\tI need hardly reiterate my Government's deepest concern and sorrow over the adamantly insoluble question of the Middle East and the fate of well over 3 million people of Palestine, who are at present divided between dispersal and suffering on the one hand, and occupation on the other. Their fate continues to be a deep wound in the minds and hearts of all humanity. My Government's most profound concern is understandable, considering that Jordan is so inextricably involved in the daily sufferings and. ordeals of this unending tragedy.\n215.\tThe all-important quest for international peace and security is intimately related to this. The peace and stability of the Middle East as a region hinge upon the solution of this problem.\n216.\tMy delegation finds no useful purpose in engaging in futile acrimonies which only serve to play into the hands of Israel in its present policy of ambivalence, deliberate procrastination and obstruction. What we most decidedly seek is movement-in deeds rather than words-towards an equitable and just solution. We do not share the prevailing view that the situation in the Middle East is in a state of stalemate and that, therefore, prompt action can be postponed to a more appropriate time. The truth is that there is no stalemate in the occupied territories that would permit postponement of speedy and decisive action.\n217.\tThe valiant resistance of our people in the occupied territories, which has been sustained at great cost and sacrifice for so long, is a reflection of their firm belief that, if the present situation were allowed to continue for any additional length of time, their whole existence as a people would be placed in mortal jeopardy.\n218.\tHaving posed some of the aspects of the Middle East crisis and the Palestinian tragedy, my Government urges, in the strongest possible terms, that the United Nations should, without any further delay, implement its resolutions pertaining to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all territories occupied in 1967.\n219.\tLikewise, my Government urges that prompt and effective action should be taken by the United Nations concerning the implementation of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including their natural right to repatriation, self-determination and sovereignty.\n220.\tTo achieve these goals there must be movement to transform resolutions into concrete actions. The different avenues, procedures and modalities are mere means which should not block the road to achieving the end.\n221.\tIn the meantime, and pending effective and practical steps, which it is empowered to carry out, and to which I have referred, the United Nations should reassert its demand that Israel desist forthwith from its present course of changing the status of the occupied Arab lands as a precondition to any viable, feasible and positive movement towards the desired solution.\n222.\tLet us hope that the General Assembly and the Security Council will, at long last, throw their full weight behind implementation of these resolutions in order to put an end to one of the most sordid, intractable and tragic issues which has haunted the world for almost three , consecutive decades.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honor and a privilege for me to be able to speak for the first time before this Assembly.\n50.\tIn the name of the President, the Government and the people of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar, I should like to offer my fraternal greetings and my friendly congratulations to the heads of delegations which have come to take part in this thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, a gathering which is to debate the vital issues involved in the strengthening of peace in the world and the establishment of a new world economic order, which has already been the subject of numerous international meetings here in New York and at Manila, Nairobi, Colombo, Mexico City and Paris.\n51.\tI wish particularly to take this opportunity to welcome the admission among us of the Republic of Seychelles, our neighbor in the Indian Ocean, which, I am sure, will make an important contribution to the work of our Organization.\n52. Universal participation is virtually assured, and our delight would have been complete if the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which we wish to congratulate upon its reunification, had not been the victims of ostracism by a super-Power which, for reasons having to do with arbitrary logic dictated by fleeting interests, has deliberately taken refuge in the concept-not so long ago decried-of selective universality and the improper and unilateral interpretation of the Charter.\n53.\tMy delegation would wish to renew to the Delegation of China the condolences expressed by the Malagasy Head of State on the occasion of the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung, the great leader of the Chinese Revolution. The passing away of this great man is felt in all countries, including our own, as a loss affecting those who have admired his work and his life, dedicated to the liberation of peoples and to the triumph of social progress over oppression and aggression.\n54.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar wishes to extend to Mr. Amerasinghe its most heartfelt congratulations on his unanimous election to the office of President of this thirty-first session of our Organization. It is certainly no accident that the Assembly has chosen Mr. Amerasinghe, whose outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman were frequently highlighted during the difficult negotiations held at the various meetings of the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries which only recently concluded in Sri Lanka, his native country.\n55.\tI should like to renew here our warmest congratulations to Madame Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and to the Government and people of Sri Lanka on the warm hospitality extended to all the delegations of non-aligned countries at Colombo, a welcome which certainly contributed to the success of the conference, some of the issues of which are to be submitted for our further consideration.\n56.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the delegation of Madagascar, our profound appreciation for the heavy responsibilities so brilliantly fulfilled by Mr. Gaston Thorn, Resident of the Council of Ministers of Luxembourg, Mr. Amerasinghe's eminent predecessor.\n57.\tFinally, my delegation would wish to pay a tribute to the vigilant action of the Secretary-General, who, despite all manner of difficulties, has spared no effort to ensure that our Organization faithfully reflects our collective concerns and responds to the just aspirations of the third world.\n58.\tWe are here among independent countries, some of which were colonized and others not. All over the years, nationalism, which has been the mainspring in the struggle against colonialism in these formerly colonized countries, has expanded and has been enriched through multilateral diplomacy . The formerly colonized countries have become aware of their common problems and the highly justified challenge of any relationship of the imperialist kind is at present taking the form of the requirement for a new international order. In doing this, the countries concerned are not calling for anything less than the establishment of a new international community which should be genuinely democratic; where the rights of peoples and nations to freely determine their economic destinies would be recognized; where international peace and security would not be the simple results of the balance of terror brought about by a limited number of great and super-Powers constantly in quest of monopolies and hegemony, but would derive from a common awareness of the nuclear dangers threatening the survival of mankind as a whole; where the words detente and disarmament would not be limited concepts designed to safeguard the interests of a single region or a single group of countries, to legitimize the upkeep and the perfecting of a considerable military means, or to conceal the maintenance, and even the seeking, of zones of influence in regions so far spared the permanent confrontation of the great Powers; where imperialism and reaction would no longer.be tolerated in all of their manifestations to subjugate, to divert and to subvert the struggles and the profound aspirations of peoples to freedom, justice, equality and national independence; where the peoples, freed from the threats of arbitrariness and from the conspiracies of the great Powers, would be able to devote more of their means to their own development than to their security', more energy to the promotion of their cultures than to the safeguarding of their sovereignty, and more effort to the work of national construction than to the defense of their territorial integrity.\n59.\tSome have been misled into confusing the strengthening of the cohesion of the third world around these themes with a will at confrontation on our part and with our desire to crystallize some alleged opposition between the North and the South and between the rich and the poor. This is to misunderstand the very foundation of our action which seeks, above all, to promote the development between States of a mutually beneficial co-operation, which, while recognizing interdependence, does not wish to accept it as a synonym for the immutability of the present structure of international relations.\n60.\tThe fifth Conference of non-aligned countries which recently met in Colombo, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, and the member countries of the Group of 77, at their two meetings at Manila and Mexico, came to convergent conclusions which indicate that the success of such a policy of international co-operation presupposes: first, the recognition of the specific nature of the authentic interests of the majority and, therefore, the abandonment of a policy oriented towards the defense of privileges and the status quo, which is profitable only to a minority of countries; secondly, the renunciation of the imperialist and capitalist practices of exploitation, domination, intimidation, interference in the domestic affairs of other States, of destabilization of Governments and of State terrorism, as practiced by Israel at Entebbe and by South Africa in Zambia, among others; thirdly, the abandonment of arbitrary procedures and practices which have so far kept the majority away from the decision-making centers and have prevented it from realizing their peace initiatives, thereby placing the world in a state of permanent instability and insecurity; fourthly, the right of all countries to participate on an equal footing in the settlement of all world problems, in particular those relating to disarmament, to the strengthening of peace and of international security, and to development.\n61.\tIn this respect, the importance of the United Nations derives both from the lofty principles which it symbolizes, and from the fact that it remains a center for study, reflection, negotiation and concerted action.\n62.\tWhile recognizing its weaknesses and its inadequacies, we are pleased by the role played by the Organization, which was devised initially as a coalition of victors of the Second World War, and which has subsequently become the principal instrument in the structural changes that have taken place in the international community as a whole, sometimes in spite of the reluctance, if not the outright opposition, of some of its founding fathers.\n63.\tThe vitality of our Organization is reflected in the ever-increasing range of fields that it is dealing with and the constantly-growing priority it is according to the problems of particular interest to the countries of the third world.\n64.\tWe shall note, however, that as progress is being achieved in the elaboration and the refinement of the political and economic platforms of the third world, the Western countries tend to confine themselves to a virtually systematic role of opposition, and are developing procedures and practices aimed at frustrating the political will of the majority by requiring consensus on all points or by expressing reservations, whenever they do not actually cast negative votes. We also know that threats and intense political pressures are directed against certain specialized agencies which are playing a governing role in the development of the third world, even at the risk of precipitating a serious crisis of confidence in the whole of the United Nations system.\n65.\tSimilarly, the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, the Ad Hoc Committee on the restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System, of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Review of the Role of the United Nations in the Field of Disarmament, are indicative of the impatience of the countries of the third world before the survival within the system of influences acting against our legitimate claims.\n66.\tThe right of veto, which is not accompanied by any special political wisdom on the part of those holding it, is in our eyes an anachronism, if not a downright obstacle, to our desire for change. To display our participation, we demand that the right of veto, if it is to be maintained, should also be given to a member of the non-aligned countries.\n67.\tThe conditions for future progress are tied into the recognition by all of the fact that a distinction must be made between the principles of the Charter and the institutions it establishes which are subject to improvement as the result of the profound changes that have taken place in the composition of the international community.\n68.\tThis progress will also be linked to the recognition of the fact that the principles of the Charter will remain a dead letter without the political will to apply them.\n69.\tThis in particular applies to disarmament and security.\n70.\tThe idea proposed at the Colombo Conference to convene a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament is a major initiative this year in this field. This is a reaction to the feelings of powerlessness and frustration brought about by the standstill of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the exclusive attitude towards the majority on the part of the super-Powers and the participants of the European disarmament conference.\n71.\tThis special session will serve its purpose if it can reaffirm the interest that the international community as a whole has in the achievement of general, complete and immediate disarmament, entailing the destruction of the stockpiles of nuclear weapons and of other weapons of mass destruction.\n72.\tThe resumption of the initiative by the majority within the United Nations, which must remain the appropriate context for negotiation and decision-making in the field of disarmament, must not be interpreted by the super-Powers as a threat to their interests, but rather as legitimate evidence of our concern in the face of dangers inherent in the existence of the large stocks of arms throughout the world, of the eminently unstable and precarious equilibrium of the groups of Powers holding these weapons, and of the great resources absorbed in the maintenance and the perfecting of these weapons, which should instead have been utilized for the welfare of mankind.\n73.\tThis resumed initiative is justified particularly in the face of the negligible results obtained through bilateral negotiation. Indeed, the second phase of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] could not be concluded this year as anticipated. The agreement of 28 May 1976 between the United States of America and the USSR on the regulation of peaceful underground nuclear tests is far too limited in its object and has not even been ratified by the parties concerned. The exchange of letters of 16 July 1976 between the French and Soviet Governments  is an illustration of the danger inherent in the unleashing of nuclear arms by error or by accident and it is regrettable that the Governments concerned should not have gone far enough to remove the deep causes of such errors or accidents. The action of the majority must be based upon these inadequacies and must tend towards the establishment of a structure of peace and security good for the community as a whole and not for some States only. The security of countries not possessing nuclear weapons must in particular be sought through the taking into consideration of concrete proposals advanced by members of the Group of 77 at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May 1975.\n74.\tBy reaffirming the importance of the denunciation of nuclear weapons by the majority of States, we denounce the continuation of the production of such weapons by countries which already possess them and we express our grave misgivings before the danger of proliferation of such weapons made evident by the co-operation given by France and Israel to South Africa in the form of equipment and technology strengthening the capacity of the latter in particular to produce atomic bombs. We reaffirm that countries exporting equipment and nuclear technology have the responsibility to develop machinery which would be a satisfactory guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and we ask that countries possessing nuclear weapons also subscribe to the solemn declaration mentioned in resolution 3472 B (XXX) which defines their principal obligations with respect to nuclear weapon-free zones and the States included therein. The full respect of the status of such zones constitutes, in our opinion, an effective measure to strengthen international security and that is why my Government has placed the establishment of a genuine peace zone in the Indian Ocean as the forefront of its foreign and defense policy.\n75.\tWe reaffirm the validity of the principles incorporated in the declaration making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVl)] whose goals are to safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States of the region and to eliminate from it the great Power rivalries and in particular to eliminate the military bases and nuclear weapons introduced within the context of these rivalries. We condemn the seeking of naval superiority and projections into the Indian Ocean of defense concepts of countries which are not part of the region because they are a source of tension which is both useless and dangerous. We cannot accept in this region a balance of forces other than a zero balance in a context where the question would not be stated in terms of the maintenance or the strengthening of the military presence of the Great Powers.\n76.\tThe Government of Madagascar takes note of the statement made in the course of this debate by a Power to the effect that it was \\\"prepared to seek, together with other Powers, measures aimed at reducing on a basis of reciprocity the military activities of non-coastal States in the Indian Ocean and in adjacent regions\\\". The promise contained in this declaration can pave the way towards the preparation and convening of a conference to study the application of the declaration on the Indian Ocean. Indeed the convening of such a conference will be neither possible nor useful if the great Powers and the maritime users continue to refuse to co-operate with the Ad Hoc Commit-tee on the Indian Ocean.\n77.\tThe events in southern Africa have caused us much concern. Indeed, the racist and minority regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury, in their blindness and stubbornness, may very well cause a widespread war in that area. We wish to make it quite clear that the African populations seeking liberation are not to be held responsible for the violence, the escalation of which we have witnessed with anxiety and impatience. We wish also to say that, in our opinion, there is no such thing as a problem of Namibia, a problem of Rhodesia, or a problem of South Africa. There is one single problem concerning the entire area and that is that the African majority must take power and the dignity of Africans must be restored. It would indeed be a serious misreading of African desires if one wished to settle the problem by trying to contain a given ideology or ensuring the future for a given minority, for that might legalize or perpetuate neo-colonial or imperialist structures. The problem of southern Africa cannot be solved by preventing an armed liberation struggle or eliminating sanctions decreed by the United Nations without first acceding to the claims of the majority, the legitimacy of which has been recognized. In the circumstances it is only natural that we should continue to give our political, material and military support to the liberation movements in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania which are the authentic representatives of the populations concerned.\n78.\tIn the context of the foregoing, we uphold the right of the Namibian people to independence with respect for its territorial integrity. We require the immediate elimination of the system of apartheid in South Africa and we oppose the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" which is the most extreme form of that policy. As regards Zimbabwe, we support the position of the Presidents of the front-line States who have rejected the interpretation put forward by Ian Smith of the Anglo-American plan, because that plan prejudges the decisions that the people of independent Zimbabwe should take in full sovereignty. This applies in particular to the presence of white ministers of the \\\"rebel\\\" minority regime in the transition government. It is our firm view that it is the duty of the United Kingdom, acting in concert with the genuine representatives of Zimbabwe, to lay the groundwork for that transition with a view to the country's speedy attainment of independence. In summary, in all these cases we call for the full implementation of the principle of self-determination and respect for human rights.\n79.\tIn the name of the same principle, we demand the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly in respect of East Timor and Western Sahara, which are victims of aggression and \noccupation. We do not understand why the States that have decided to annex the territory of Western Sahara, in agreement with the former colonial Power, so much fear the implementation of this principle, which our Organization has defended in the past 20 years of decolonization. If the peoples concerned truly want their destiny to be associated with that of Morocco and Mauritania, then let them state their views freely and let us not be satisfied with the vote of an assembly of notables. Madagascar, as the first country to recognize the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, is convinced that that is the only solution that will bring peace to the area. At the present time that Republic is in danger of extinction by a Moroccan-Mauritanian invasion. We demand the immediate cessation of that invasion and we request that urgent humanitarian assistance be given to the Saharan people. It is also our firm hope that Djibouti will soon achieve independence and that France will take the necessary steps to create an atmosphere favorable to democratic procedures leading to the immediate and unconditional independence of the so-called \\\"French\\\" Somali coast.\n80.\tThe resolutions adopted on this subject at the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU make it perfectly clear that Africa will not accept any subterfuge that might delay the independence of Djibouti. We wish to appeal to all the political parties of the territory to find a common political platform before the referendum promised by France. That would ensure security and peace in the area and the unity and integrity of the Territory.\n81.\tWt emphasize this latter point because, in the case of the Comoros, the former colonial Power has used and is still using manoeuvres that are contrary to specific commitments and to the very principles of the Charter relating to the independence and sovereignty of Member States. How can one fail to recall here the various resolutions of the United Nations and OAU concerning respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the independent Republic of the Comoros? What right has a non-African Power to refuse to evacuate Mayotte, when 95 per cent of all the Comoros voted in favor of independence and the unity of the archipelago? The maintenance of a European Power in that island smacks of a policy of spheres of influence which we had thought was a thing of the past, and we demand the immediate withdrawal of France from the territory.\n82.\tWe remain concerned by the threat to international peace and security in the Middle East. Efforts to bring about a just and lasting settlement in the area have unfortunately remained ineffectual owing to the intransigence and obstruction.of Israel.\n83.\tWe deplore in particular the fact that, after the bogus relinquishment of the \\\"step by step\\\" policy, no firm commitment has been entered into regarding the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East on the basis of respect for the principles that we have always upheld, air or which is full participation by the genuine representative of the Palestinian people. We wish to reaffirm our support for the recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, of which we are members. It is necessary that we should continue to give political and diplomatic support of the Palestine liberation Organization, and that we should oppose the policy of exclusion and annexation practiced by the Zionist State. We find it intolerable that the Palestinian people should continue to be victims of a civil war imposed on them despite themselves, and that they should be blamed for the distressing situation in Lebanon, the deterioration of which has been encouraged by the reactionary forces of international Zionism and its heedless allies.\n84.\tThe Democratic Republic of Madagascar, like many other countries, calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea, the dismantling of foreign military bases, and the removal of the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\". In a word, we call for the honest and immediate implementation of resolution 3390 B (XXX), adopted by the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. May I remind you in this connexion of the words of President Didier Ratsiraka at the opening of the international seminar on the ideas of Djoutch6, which has just been held in Antananarivo:\n\\\"I wish also to express the very sincere hope that the Korean people, in the very near future, without any foreign interference, in full independence and in democratic respect for the single will of the majority of its sons, will finally rediscover the joy of reunification and the virtues of progress, justice and peace which that nation so ardently desires and to which it has an absolute right.\\\"\n85.\tHaving reviewed the primary sources of tension in the world, I cannot fail to mention the problem of Cyprus. Here the continuation of negotiations between the two communities on an equal footing remains the only possible solution, provided there is strict respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that country.\n86.\tThere remains one continent, Latin America, which, it would seem, has been spared open conflict, but where imperialism and neo-colonialism have not abandoned their intentions to dominate and exploit. Nevertheless, the emergence may be noted there of a co-ordinated policy of independence and sovereignty, characterized by solidarity with the Government of Panama and by the lifting of the blockade imposed on Cuba. The increasingly positive role of Latin America in the non-aligned movement is a trend that we support.\n87.\tAs regards social problems, in view of their important place among the objectives of the United Nations Charter, and in view of the efforts deployed in this area in the past 30 years, the Democratic Republic of Madagascar is convinced that those problems remain among the major concerns of the political leaders of all countries, particularly of developing countries.\n88.\tThe challenges which confront us today are particularly acute, for the situation is constantly deteriorating, especially in regard to social factors that are an affront to human dignity. Reviewing the main events that have occurred this year in violation of various resolutions of the General Assembly, we note the following: the persistence of all forms of racial discrimination, particularly in South\u2003Africa; measures of oppression, repression and aggression adopted recently by the South African regime, which may well cause widespread racial war in southern Africa, and threaten international peace and security; co-operation in a variety of forms between the Western Powers and the racist regime in South Africa, which continues despite our numerous protests; difficulties encountered by committees and working groups inquiring into the practices of torture and cruel and degrading treatment, showing the determination of certain countries to defy international opinion.\n89.\tAlthough the various problems I have just mentioned have been the subject of a number of international conferences, and while it is true that the regional groups deserve credit for the work that has been done thus far, it must be concluded that the action adopted has been inadequate and ineffective. The resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council have been unavailing and their implementation remains determined by a mistaken interpretation of the concepts of responsibility and sovereignty.\n90.\tThe attention of the international community must once again be drawn to the gravity of the. situation and to the harmful consequences of these social problems at the political and economic level. The importance of those problems cannot be underestimated. They constitute the two major challenges of the century-to combat under-development and to safeguard international peace and security.\n91.\tI shall not read all the economic provisions appearing in the United Nations Charter, but may I read this part of the Preamble: \\\"We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom ...The cautious estimates established at the World Food Conference, held in Rome in November 1974, indicated that 500 million human beings were affected by famine and malnutrition. Forty per cent were children, of whom over 300 million suffered \\\"serious physical retardation\\\". The World Bank, for its part, says that 750 million men, women and children live in nearly absolute poverty, with a per capita income of less than $50 a year.\n92.\tThis gloomy picture leads to an inevitable conclusion: the development crisis resides primarily in the poverty of the masses, whose needs, even the most elementary ones-food, health, shelter, education-are unfulfilled.. They are victims of a system of exploitation linked to a power structure established primarily in the countries of the center. The result is great national insecurity, heightened by the deterioration in the terms of trade and the growing gap between the industrialized countries and the disadvantaged countries, and by inappropriate trade structures stemming from the errors of the colonial past.\n93.\tIt is therefore essential to abolish the old structures to which the poor countries have been subjected. The Secretary-General of the United Nations rightly pointed out in one of his reports that the Governments of the world must in most cases be prepared to adopt radical policies to deal with the problems of mass poverty. In the same spirit, the international community, shocked by the continuation of the grave international economic imbalances, decided to lay the groundwork of a new international economic order.\n94.\tThe countries of the third world have an abiding faith in the legitimacy of their claims and have proposed that the fundamental principles underlying this new vision of international relations be set forth in international documents such as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. Moreover, in addition to regional and interregional action, and the action of associations of producers of raw materials, the peripheral countries did not hesitate to convene the seventh special session of the General Assembly in order to engage in a dialog in an atmosphere of give and take and mutual accommodation. Since that session a year has passed, in the course of which that mood has regrettably not prevailed. The Group of 77 has therefore had to concentrate its efforts on collective autonomy, in the hope of being able to transcend the mere restatement of divergent views by the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world, and to fend off the danger that two separate worlds will no longer feel themselves bound by the obligations of interdependence.\n95.\tIt is indeed regrettable that the efforts of the international organizations, on which the developing countries had relied, should at times have failed. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which was the expression of a new concept of dialog between the third-world countries and the industrialized market economy countries, adopted no decisions commensurate with the questions on its agenda. Incidentally, how can the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [ UNIDO] be regarded as the primary instrument of industrial development in the peripheral countries when the intergovernmental committee responsible for establishing its constituent act failed to recommend a decision along those lines? And how can one understand the attitude of the countries of the center which, on the one hand, recognize the urgency of the problems of food and agriculture that prevail in the poor countries, and on the other hand are reluctant to contribute and adhere to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\n96.\tIf the United Nations fails to inject new life into international co-operation, that means that the countries of the center refuse in fact, their protests notwithstanding, to enter into a businesslike and meaningful dialog with the peripheral countries.\n97.\tHence, the only solution that can yield fruit in the immediate future would be for the latter countries to rely on their own strength, through collective autonomy, the implementation of which would postulate the will to take action, .the ability to formulate strategies and to define institutional or negotiating procedures, and finally the power to offer mutual concessions.\n98.\tSuch strategies should not be regarded as substitutes for real solutions, but as alternatives for breaking the present deadlock in negotiations with the industrialized countries. AH the principles of the new international economic order, as well as certain programs of action, remain valid, but strategies must be planned to any them out.\n99.\tAt a time when the defense of privileges and of the status quo prevails over the general interest when all kinds of political expedients are used as pretexts to justify the maintenance of relations of inequality and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of certain States, particularly in Africa, it is necessary to reaffirm the overriding importance of the principles and objectives of our Charter, and to render them fully meaningful through the strict observance of their provisions.\n100.\tThe role of our Organization must be reaffirmed, and it must be allowed to exercise its influence without obstruction in the conflicts which have a tendency to persist and which represent constant threats to international peace and security in the Middle East, in Korea, in southern Africa or in Latin America.\n101.\tWe must see to it that detente as proclaimed in one area is not used as a pretext to justify lack of action in the vital area of disarmament, and we enthusiastically support the idea of restoring this problem to its central position in United Nations concern.\n102.\tIn these areas, as in the economic and social areas, the majority wishes to be considered as active and responsible partners. That is a precondition for any form of progress, the foundation of any form of genuine international co-operation, and we have no doubt but that this need will be recognized before it imposes itself through its own momentum.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I join previous speakers in Congratulating Ambassador Amerasinghe most warmly on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. The exceptional qualities of leadership and experience which he brings to his high office are well known to the international community. My Government is particularly grateful for the dedication, the experience and the tireless efforts which he has so amply displayed in his leadership of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. His election to the presidency of the General Assembly augurs well for the future work of this session, and is a tribute to the country which he has so ably represented in this hall. He can be assured of our fullest co-operation in his challenging task.\n53.\tFive years have elapsed since Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected as the chief administrative officer of our Organization. I should like once more to express to the Secretary-General our deep-felt gratitude and appreciation for his ceaseless energy and dedication to the cause of peace and the promotion of international co-operation. His outstanding leadership qualities have enhanced the prestige of the United Nations and been a great asset to this Organization.\n54.\tThe agenda of this session of the General Assembly contains many and important issues, such as disarmament, the situation in the Middle East, the conflicts of southern Africa and the whole complex of problems related to the search for a new international economic order-to mention just a few.\n55.\tWe can approach these items from various angles, all relevant. One approach can be based on considerations of power politics: how will the way in which we attack or resolve a problem reflect or affect existing power relation-ships in the world?\n56.\tAnother approach is to deal with these problems in a more functions! perspective, reflecting on how the process towards internationalization and interdependence are con-fronting us with an ever-increasing number of problems common to all countries, and which can be resolved only through concerted action.\n57.\tThere is a third approach, however; one based on considerations of and concern for the peoples of the world, the situation of the human beings of whom these peoples consist. Nation States as well as international co-operation exist for the sake of the individual, and not the other way around. The rights of each individual, as they have been spelled out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, should therefore be the very basis of the work of the United Nations.\n58.\tThus the international responsibility and international challenge confronting us are, firstly, to work to secure for each human being those basic political and civil rights which are today being violated in so many countries. Secondly, to safeguard individuals and groups of people against suppression and racial discrimination, practiced most flagrantly today in southern Africa. And thirdly, to protect each individual human being against hunger and want in a world where the gap between a rich minority and an impoverished majority is becoming increasingly wider.\n59.\tThis will be my approach. My basis when I deal with some of the main items on our agenda is the responsibility that we all have for each other and for the peoples of this world.\n60.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General has reminded us once more that the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is a primary goal of the United Nations.\n61.\tThis year we have moved a little closer towards that goal with the entering into force of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The parties to the Covenants are now under more specific and binding obligations to observe human rights. Our objective must be universal acceptance of the Covenants.\n62.\tHowever, more than formal acceptance is needed. As Mr. Gaston Thorn stated when he presided over the opening meeting of the current session:\n\\\"As long as practical measures have not been taken in each of our States to respect, and to ensure respect, for the rights of each individual, our words, void of sense, will remain lies and hypocrisy\\\". [ 1st meeting, para. 6.] .\n63.\tIt is a regrettable fact that, in spite of solemn pledges, human rights are flagrantly being disregarded in many parts of the world, even in countries where the material and general social conditions should present no obstacle to their observance. Numerous reports from unbiased and reliable sources provide evidence of torture and other inhuman practices. This is intolerable. The international community has a collective responsibility to deal seriously with these matters.\n64.\tAll implementation of legal norms require action. Each Government must seek actively to fulfill its obligations. The United Nations, for its part, must establish the organs and the procedures necessary to encourage Governments to act. My country therefore welcomes the establishment of the Human Rights Committee under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We continue to support the work of the Commission on Human Rights, which is a central organ in the United Nations work for human rights and should focus its efforts on preventing and correcting violations of human rights, irrespective of where they occur. We also believe that the proposed office of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights could render valuable services in this respect. As an \\\"ombudsman\\\" for human rights, he might be able to survey the status of human rights all over the world, assist individuals and provide guidance to Governments in fulfilling their obligations.\n65.\tActs of terrorism affecting innocent victims are also, regardless of their motivation, an intolerable form of violation of human rights. We have so far failed to establish effective procedures to deal with these problems. We must recognize that there is a need for the international community to take defensive measures against international terrorism before it will prove possible to solve the underlying causes. The problem of international terrorism is complex and manifold. We may therefore find it more productive to seek partial solutions aimed at protecting innocent victims. In this connexion, the Norwegian Government supports the idea put forward by the Federal Republic of Germany to seek an agreement outlawing the taking of hostages.\n66.\tOne of the areas in the world in which human rights have long been systematically violated and ignored is southern Africa. The apartheid policy of South Africa, the white minority regime in Rhodesia and South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia are all remnants of an outdated political and economic order.\n67.\tFor years the prevailing situation has been an affront to the United Nations and to the international community, and time is now rapidly running out for peaceful solutions. Developments in southern Africa have entered a decisive phase. We all fear that developments in this area will end in tragedy and in a blood-bath.\n68.\tThe Nordic Foreign Ministers, meeting recently, adopted a program of action with a view to stepping up their support for the liberation movements of southern Africa, and with parallel efforts to further isolate the white minority regimes of the area. This continues to be the policy of the Norwegian Government. In our view, world opinion, formulated in the main through resolutions of the United Nations, has been a decisive factor in shaping the developments now under way in southern Africa.\n69.\tA new element in the present situation is the important last-minute American initiative efforts which we are following with expectations and anxiety. It has given us a glimpse of hope that a bloody war can, in spite of all odds, be prevented and that a peaceful solution can be found. The white minority regime seems to have recognized for the first time that there exists no alternative to black majority rule. This recognition comes late, as we are confronting a very difficult and complex situation indeed. The proposals now put forward might require more patience and a greater readiness to compromise than may be left at this late hour. We still have, however, to embrace the hope that the efforts which we are now witnessing can prevent an all-out war with its tragic consequences and its dangerous implications for the world as a whole. In our view, the big Powers share a special responsibility. A solution of the outstanding problems in southern Africa requires their support and active participation. Their co-operation is, according to the United Nations Charter, a prerequisite for action by the Security Council. In the present situation it is of vital importance that the problems of southern Africa are not made part of the east-west conflict. The big Powers have a joint responsibility not to give these conflicts further international repercussions and to see to it that they do not develop into an increasingly serious threat to world peace.\n70.\tHuman rights are more than legal instruments. Today we must apply an extended concept of human rights. This comprises basic security-the absence of social violence, in the form of war or civil strife; or the surrender of the social structure to disorder and chaos. Human rights also comprise satisfaction of the basic material needs of the ordinary person freedom from hunger and want. In this sense, the safeguarding of human rights on a global level depends on our ability to solve the problems which arise as part of the new international economic order.\n71.\tMy Government is deeply concerned with the widening gap between the rich and the poor countries. We refuse to accept this trend ,as irreversible. We are determined to make our contribution, within the limitations placed on a small country, towards bridging that gap.\n72.\tWe regard our commitment towards the new international economic order as a logical extension of the internal policy, pursued by successive Norwegian Governments at home, aiming at the implementation of an egalitarian concept of society. This was the basic underlying theme of a report on our over-all economic relations with the developing countries submitted by my Government to Parliament last year and adopted by an almost unanimous Parliament early this year. The report is based on a realization of the fact that a call for a new and more equitable international economic order has to be combined with calls for new national economic orders on both sides of the great economic divide.\n73.\tThe Norwegian Government looked forward to the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] as an important milestone in the implementation process to follow the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly. We saw the fourth session of UNCTAD as a test case for the ability and readiness of the international community to respond in practical terms to policy guidelines hammered out in difficult but successful negotiations in this Assembly during the last two years.\n74.\tAll the expectations of my Government were not fulfilled in Nairobi. Yet I think we can conclude that the fourth session meant a significant step forward. When the nations of the world agree unanimously on the need for an over-all approach, including an integrated program for commodities, and also agree on a concrete plan of implementation, this represents by itself substantial progress. The consensus of Nairobi is now committing us all. Challenging possibilities are contained in the resolution on that subject adopted during the fourth session.  If we succeed in implementing the main principles of an integrated program for commodities as intended, in which a common fund remains a main element, a more orderly functioning of a key sector in international economic relations will be secured. An integrated program for commodities will represent an important step on the way towards a better regulation of the international economy. It will entail a more stable situation in the field of raw materials. This will be of benefit to all of us but above all to producers of raw materials among the developing countries. The Norwegian Government will work actively for the following up of the. resolutions adopted at the fourth session of UNCTAD. If our countries do not succeed, this will represent a grave defeat for all of us who are looking forward to seeing a better controlled and regulated world economy emerge.\n75.\tPolitics is mainly a question of setting priorities. Good politics is to get one's priorities right. Here a world which is annually spending $300 billion on armaments, while the net flow of official development assistance amounts to only some $15 billion, has still a long way to go. Even the most superficial look at the world of ours must make it clear to any reflective human being that the priority of the hour should be the needs of the poor. It may give us some satisfaction that at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly the needs of the developing countries have been the main focus. The same is true of the many ad hoc conferences of the United Nations on such problems as population, food, human settlements and employment. That goes for the fourth session of UNCTAD as well. This is an indication of a world community-and a United Nations system-on the way towards getting its priorities right. But here again the crucial requirement is that of implementation. It is our joint responsibility to prevent future generations from passing the following judgment on the efforts of our generation: that never in human history have so many negotiated over so much with such meager results. Thus I will make this appeal to the industrialized countries, of which Norway is one: let us through concerted action come to the effective assistance of the developing countries by meeting their legitimate aspirations for a more equitable world order.\n76.\tIt goes without saying that, in order to come to grips with problems like mass poverty in the world, the crises of population growth and mounting unemployment, such far-reaching and basic reforms are needed that nothing short of a new international economic order can be the ensuing result. However, having stated this, I should also like to state that it is urgently necessary that we give consideration to the structural and institutional aspects of this new international economic order.\n77.\tI do not in any way want to distract attention from the problems of substance; but, even if it were to prove possible to mobilize the necessary political will to meet many of the aspirations of the developing countries, we should soon be faced with organizational and institutional shortcomings. The world community of today is far from having developed the necessary institutional framework. For that reason we welcomed the decision by the seventh special session to establish an Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System.\n78.\tWe fully realize that the Committee is facing a difficult task. We would only be fooling ourselves if we were to close our eyes to the fact that vested interests also have developed inside the United Nations system. Thus my Government is not discouraged by the slow progress made so far in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on Restructuring; but evidently more political backing is called for to prevent this important work from ending in frustration. The Committee has a very broad mandate and has itself identified certain priority areas. Perhaps even this program is too ambitious if we want to see concrete results within the foreseeable future. My Government would like the Committee to single out the Economic and Social Council as the priority area. An Economic and Social Council restructured along lines on which I understand there is already a high degree of agreement inside the Committee would be in a position to discharge its duties under the Charter much more effectively and would itself be able to play a main role in a wider restructuring of the system. Thus concrete action in this field should not have to be delayed till agreement has been reached in all the fields covered by the broad mandate of the Committee.\n79.\tI have dealt with the problems of restructuring the economic and social sectors of the United Nations at such a length for two main reasons: first, because I am convinced of the necessity of substantially expanding and improving our means and instruments of international co-operation and, secondly, because my Government wants to see the United Nations system playing a central role in the process leading to the development of a new international economic order. The United Nations system should not only be prepared to adjust to change but should itself be an instrument of change.\n80.\tThere is a need for a rationalization of the work of existing international organizations. There is also a need for such changes in existing institutions and organizations as would make them more capable of coping with the distributive aspects and in this way better reflect basic changes which have taken place in the composition of the world community over recent years. However, there is also a need for new institutions and organizations, and this leads me to the final matter on which I should like to comment, namely, the Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n81.\tThe fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was concluded two weeks ago. My country regrets that greater progress was not made at that session. We note, however, that during the past year the Conference in fact achieved a large measure of agreement in highly important fields. Virtual consensus appears to exist on such major issues as a 12-mile limit for the territorial sea, the sovereign rights of coastal States to the resources of an economic zone of 200 miles, freedom of navigation and rules for the prevention of marine pollution.\n82.\tThe widest disparity of views concerns the international sea-bed area and the common heritage of mankind. Those problems are new, important and complicated. But it is imperative to avoid an uncontrolled race for exploitation contrary to the spirit of the declaration of principles adopted by the General Assembly in 1970. An effective international authority is indispensable if the concept of the common heritage is to become a reality. There is a close connexion between sea-bed mineral mining and general economic issues. The regulation of production and marketing is related to the new international economic order. We must therefore regard the Conference on the Law of the Sea in a broader perspective than before. This will be an important perhaps the most important element in the next, decisive session of the Conference. My country will approach that issue with an open mind. We must all be prepared to avoid dogmatism and insistence on prior positions.\n83.\tThe views of my Government on that Conference are well known, and so is the high priority which it has been accorded. We thus fully subscribe to the assessment made by the President of the Assembly in his acceptance speech last Tuesday [1st meeting] when he stated that this co-operative endeavor is without parallel in history. We, too, feel that a universally acceptable agreement assuring all countries, rich and poor alike, an equitable share would be an outstanding contribution to the just and stable economic and political order which the United Nations is striving to create.\n84.\tIt is the recognition of this fact which has guided Norway's participation during the sessions already concluded; and, based on that recognition, my Government will lend its full support to efforts aimed at leading the Conference to a successful conclusion.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Tunisian delegation sincerely rejoices at your election to head this session of the United Nations General Assembly. The tribute thus paid, through you, to your country is richly deserved. Your role as representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations for many years and your competence and your courtesy, which have been unanimously recognized, in particular in your work as President of the important Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, make you singularly qualified to guide the work of this session of the General Assembly, from which we the third world and non-aligned countries expect much. The responsibilities which Sri Lanka assumed as host of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and the part your country played in the development of its work also means that this honor is conferred on all the non-aligned countries, whose efforts and positions in regard to the numerous problems with which the international community is faced your Government and your Mission will strive to co-ordinate.\n34.\tWe wish at the same time warmly to congratulate Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. The wisdom and skill he displayed have but confirmed the lofty qualities of a statesman which we have always known him to possess.\n35.\tWe are happy once again to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his devoted and sincere efforts in the service of the ideals of our Organization, and we appreciate the effectiveness of his action, which is admired by all peoples represented in this Assembly.\n36.\tA few days ago the General Assembly unanimously accepted the application for admission of a new State, which was already a member of our Organization of African Unity [OAU]. On this occasion I am pleased to address our warmest congratulations to the delegation of Seychelles. The admission of Seychelles is certainly an important event which strengthens the universal character of our Organization.\n37.\tWe would have sincerely wished to have seen the application of this principle of universality, a fundamental principle of our Organization, encompass the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola-two countries which for various reasons are close to Tunisia. We express the hope that these two friendly countries will very soon take their legitimate place in the United Nations and join us in seeking a solution to the multiple world problems which our Organization must face.\n38.\tIndeed, the problems which are of concern to all the peoples of the world have not in the past year found a definitive solution, nor has there been any decisive development. Whether it is in connexion with southern Africa or the Middle East, or whether it is a question of disarmament or the establishment of a new international economic order, we note that our progress, if one can truly call it progress, towards decisive solutions is very slow.\n39.\tThe tremendous hopes that were aroused immediately after that critical year of 1973 that we should see all the countries of the world working together towards a common future within the framework of a recognized and accepted interdependence between large and small States, between the Western countries and those of the East, and, above all, between the industrialized and the developing countries- these hopes have been somewhat dampened. During 1973 we saw first of all the October war in the Middle East, followed by the energy crisis, and shortly thereafter-the overthrow of the Portuguese colonial empire occurred as a result of the strength of African determination.\n40.\tThose are three fundamental events whose impact goes far beyond their geographical scope. After that, and after the emergence of a reunited and independent Viet Nam, it was possible to say that we were witnessing the birth of a new world. The strongest myths had been shattered; the hopes of the weakest had been raised.\n41.\tA new truth was revealed: the interdependence of all countries .f the globe had become a fact. The great problem was how to organize it. On the political level, this implied immediately satisfying the aspirations of oppressed peoples, in particular by the eradication of the colonial and apartheid regime in southern Africa and, in the Middle East, by the total restitution of the Arab territories occupied by force as well as the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to their country and their independence.\n42.\tAt the economic level, this also implied replacing the old international order, broadly marked by the aftermath of the colonial era, by a new economic order based on equality and interdependence.\n43.\tNow, three years later, what progress have we achieved in this direction? Very little, as we are compelled to recognize. We even wonder whether what was evident yesterday is not being challenged today. Does the developed world still recognize the need for interdependence in equality, or does it hope, thanks to the contradictions and conflicts of the third world, to cause the old order to prevail? It would in any case be a great temptation to take advantage of the internal problems of the third world -which at times can be exacerbated-to crush the aspirations of the peoples struggling for the recognition of political rights, which alone can confer economic rights which in turn alone can guarantee a new international order.\n44.\tIn that connexion, perhaps the clearest progress has been seen in southern Africa, where an international consensus is developing more and more in the direction of putting an en<i to the problems of colonial oppression in Rhodesia and Namibia.\n45.\tThere is real hope today that we shall soon see the accession to independence of those two African countries, whose struggle for freedom has been a long one and has entailed much suffering and the loss of hundreds of human lives. These sacrifices could perhaps have been avoided, or at least reduced, if the resolutions adopted year after year by the United Nations in regard to those two Territories had been supported, followed and put into effect by all States, and particularly by those with the greatest responsibilities in the sphere of international peace and security.\nBut the die has not yet been cast-far from it-and all the vigilance of the African States will be required to ensure that there is no truncated independence and that power is transferred to the true representatives of the peoples concerned, in the form of the liberation movements recognized by OAU. We are confident that the international community, and particularly the United Nations, will be able to strengthen that vigilance.\n46.\tWe hope for, we await, this great victory, which in the first place will be a victory of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe, but will also be a victory of Africa and African solidarity and, finally, of the United Nations, whose judgment of the situation in that region of the world has turned out to be the most correct.\n47.\tIt is to be hoped that there will be a unanimous view at this session that those two African nations should attain independence as soon as possible and with the loss of the very minimum number of human lives, and that an end should be put to colonial violence. To that end, we must take up the thorny problem of South Africa itself, where apartheid continues unabated and where the African majority is removed from all real power. The resistance in the region is becoming ever more militant and the explosion that we had foreseen for several years and had wished to prevent has come. A new generation has appeared which cannot and will not ever accept the humiliations of apartheid. The minority Government can do nothing else but make the concessions that are necessary now and thereby preserve some chance of coexistence and peaceful collaboration. Otherwise, if it continues to carry out obstinately in the present policy of segregation in \\\"bantustans\\\", it will run the risk of a terrible confrontation whose outcome can only be disastrous for it. In that connexion we have followed with lively interest the efforts made by Mr. Kissinger in the search for a peaceful solution to this serious problem. We hope that the intervention of the United States, with all its weight, in a matter in which international peace and the most sacred principles of mankind are at stake will be effective and that the efforts undertaken in September last will be continued until justice and right prevail.\n48.\tThe obstinacy of a government imbued with the illusion of racial superiority is to be seen also in the Middle East, where the Government of Israel rejects all compromises that might bring peace and where the hopes that were aroused last year by the Sinai agreements have not been- fulfilled by any other positive measures. On the contrary, the hostility of the Government of Israel continues to pursue the Palestinians, not only inside occupied Palestine but even in Lebanon, where its disguised intervention and its intrigues are contributing to the worsening of an already complex situation, a situation that is all the more dangerous because it involves grave risks and a direct threat to international peace and security.\n49.\tThe Middle East is also more than ever a dangerous volcanic region, and that will remain true so long as Israel continues to occupy the Arab territories by force, to subject their peoples to the most backward and arbitrary type of colonialism and to challenge international morality by denying the Palestinian people the exercise of its legitimate right, recognized by the United Nations, to its homeland and independence. The events in Lebanon prove, if such proof were still necessary, that so long as Palestine has not regained its independence, there can be no stable peace in the Middle East. It is my duty to urge the Arab countries in the region to overcome their divisions and to reach an agreement that will safeguard the sovereignty and independence of a unified Lebanon, without sacrificing the interests of the Palestinian cause, as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization. That will be the role of the Arab summit conference to be held soon in Cairo.\n50.\tThe situation is all the more urgent because Israel continues to be supplied with the most sophisticated and deadly modern weapons, and it is well known today that it is possible that Israel is in a position to use nuclear weapons, directly or indirectly. And yet, as President Bourguiba said here in May 1968, the Middle East \\\"has not been unworthy of mankind, ... that Middle East where once resounded the threefold message of the one God, calling men to peace and brotherhood\\\". \n51.\tWith regard to nuclear weapons, Tunisia is particularly concerned about the proliferation of such Weapons. The dangers are clear. It is high time to halt the chain reaction set off by the accession of an ever-increasing number of Powers to such weapons.\n52.\tIn the meantime, we are witnessing a real armaments race among developing countries, a race in armaments which, although they are conventional, are still highly sophisticated and extremely expensive -indeed, so expensive that those countries' efforts towards development could be compromised. In any case, this is an inadmissible waste of money in a world where so many countries need these wasted resources. It is also a trend which is obliging an ever-growing number of countries to arm themselves, at the expense of their most fundamental development needs.\n53.\tIn those conditions, can we aspire to a new inter-national order without agreeing that such a waste of resources must be avoided?\n54.\tA year has passed since our Assembly held its seventh special session devoted to development and international economic co-operation. The resolution unanimously adopted at that session [resolution 3362(S-VII)J aroused much hope because, after years of confrontation, developed and developing countries were able to agree on a series of far-reaching measures supported by specific undertakings, particularly on the part of the developed countries.\n55.\tThis year was to have marked the beginnings of the concrete carrying out of those undertakings, enabling us to approach the final aim: the establishment of a new international economic order, the principles of which were laid down during the sixth special session of the Assembly and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n56.\tWe are, however, compelled to note that the progress made so far has been insufficient. Thus, the results achieved by the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development [UNCTAD] which had been given the task, among others, of negotiating the methods to put into effect several decisions of the Assembly's seventh special session-were well below what had been hoped for. The Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation -at which it had been hoped that some urgent problems could be solved before the end of this year-has become bogged down in so-called \\\"analytical\\\" discussions and has not achieved the specific results expected of it.\n57.\tIn its resolution 2042 (LXI), the Economic and Social Council at its last session unanimously expressed its \\\"deep concern\\\" at the delay in the implementation of the measures provided for in the resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly's sixth and seventh special sessions. The Council also expressed \\\"deep concern that, during the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade, there have been serious shortfalls ... in achieving the goals, objectives and policy measures specified in the International Development Strategy\\\".\n58.\tThis confirmation of the concern of the developing countries, coming from so important a body as the Economic and Social Council, should lead the international community as a whole to redouble its efforts to accelerate the process that will lead to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n59.\tWe have no right to yield to despair nor to resume the course of sterile confrontation which we unanimously decided to abandon last year, during the seventh special session. It should be possible for the era of dialog we have embarked upon to continue if we are all prompted by a genuine political will to arrive at solutions which take into account the interests of all countries as well as the needs of the developing countries as a whole without any exception.\n60.\tThe General Assembly should be able to contribute effectively in the search for solutions by providing guide-lines likely to facilitate future negotiations not only those to be held under the auspices of UNCTAD but also other international gatherings.\n61.\tIn the same context and within the framework of the economic items on this session's agenda we consider that the General Assembly should attach particular importance to the item entitled \\\"Revision of the International Development Strategy for the Second United,Nations Development Decade\\\" [item 65]. While not excluding the possibility of contributing to the future revision of the document adopted in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)] so as to adapt it more nearly to present conditions, we believe that nothing should prevent the international community from starting as soon as possible its efforts at consideration and negotiation on the adoption of a strategy for the next decade within the framework of resolutions on the establishment of a new international economic order.\n62.\tThe States Members which will be dealing with items on economic and technical co-operation among developing countries will realize that since the last session those countries have made new breakthroughs in the consolidation of their co-operation, since they are aware that their negotiating power to establish a new international economic order depends largely on their capacity to coordinate their means and efforts within the framework of sound and mutually advantageous co-operation.\n63.\tThe Fifth Conference of Heads of State, or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo and, recently, the Mexico Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries have enabled those countries to draft specific programs which they hope to be able to implement by applying the concept of collective self-sufficiency, while relying, too, on the understanding and, in several cases, on the aid of the developed countries. Indeed, the concept of collective self-sufficiency does not preclude that other concept which is a reality today -namely, the interdependence of the interests of all countries within the context of the sovereignty of each. In this respect the developing countries which met in Mexico considered holding a summit meeting of the Group of 77. The Government of Tunisia will not fail to pay all the attention it deserves to the initiative of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in regard to this interesting suggestion [see A/31/208, annex], whose implementation would enhance the value of contacts between our countries and strengthen their effectiveness.\n64.\tAnother particularly important question should be considered at this session, and that is the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations so as better to adapt them to the needs of the new international economic order. The importance of this question, which has been thoroughly discussed in a special committee, should lead us to avoid haste so that our decisions will serve genuinely to improve the effectiveness of the system and in particular that of the main organs of the Organization such as the Economic and Social Council. That body this year enhanced its prestige by agreeing to meet at a high level outside the usual venues, specifically on African soil, in response to the generous invitation of the Government of the Ivory Coast. In order to restructure the system we must, in our opinion, act prudently so as not irreversibly to destroy certain elements the effectiveness of which has been proved.\n65.\tThe economic and social sectors of the United Nations are not the only ones which require restructuring.\n66.\tReconsideration of the role of our Organization and its means of action is also required in other important fields. A study of this kind has been undertaken for disarmament in particular [A/31/36]. We know that a large number of countries, Tunisia among them, would even wish to strengthen the role of the Organization by a series of measures which would not exclude a review of the Charter itself.\n67.\tThese are necessary efforts which must be pursued, but we realize that this is a long-term task, and the problems which the international community faces are for the most part so urgent that the Organization must shoulder its responsibilities without waiting too long. Whether we are dealing with the racial war threatening southern Africa or the worsening of the situation in the Middle East, we must in the weeks and months to come act with vigilance so that the resolutions of the General Assembly will be implemented and so that global bargaining will not jeopardize the truly lasting solutions we hope for.\n68.\tThis is not a question for Africans and Arabs alone. Still less is it a matter for the great Powers alone. These are matters of peace and security, and in a shrinking world in which problems are more and more interdependent we cannot proceed to international peace unless there is a consensus of all nations, and we cannot move towards joint security unless we do so jointly.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to offer our warmest congratulations to Mr. Amerasinghe on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. We are indeed fortunate in having a person of his eminent stature, wide experience and great ability as our President. It is also a matter of special pride for us that he belongs to a country which is not only a neighbor of ours but one with which we enjoy common cultural traditions and close friendship.\n141.\tTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, I should like to express our deep admiration for the impartiality and dedication with which he has been discharging his onerous responsibilities. He is a man whom the international community has come to trust and respect during the nearly five years he has held office as Secretary-General of the United Nations. We hope that he will continue to serve the international community for many more years to come.\n142.\tI should like to express the appreciation of my delegation for the admirable manner in which Prime Minister Thorn of Luxembourg guided the deliberations of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n143.\tWe are happy to welcome the Republic of Seychelles to our midst as our one hundred and forty-fifth Member. We have no doubt that the admission will add further strength and vitality to our Organization. We now look forward to the admission of Viet Nam and Angola to the United Nations, as both of them fully meet all the requirements of membership.\n144.\tMr. President, I have the honor to convey to you and, through you, to all the representatives assembled here today the greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, for the success of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.\n145.\tThe most preying and crucial problem facing the world today is the question of disarmament, not only as a means for relaxing tensions in the world and promoting international peace and security but also for the purpose of releasing much-needed resources for development purposes. It is difficult to justify on any grounds the expenditure of astronomical sums of money on producing and accumulating weapons of mass destruction, when a substantial percentage of the earth's population is permanently on the verge of starvation. In our view, the development of technology, and ever-increasing expenditure on armaments, is a vicious cycle, which is leading mankind ever closer to total disaster. One way, and possibly the only way at present, of breaking this cycle in order to halt the arms race and initiate a genuine process of disarmament would be for the General Assembly, the most representative institution of nations in the world today, to take the initiative in convening either a world disarmament conference or a special session devoted exclusively to problems of disarmament.\n146.\tThe other major issue that is agitating the minds of people all over the world at present is the question of southern Africa. As the result of certain initiatives taken by the United States recently, positive developments have taken place in southern Africa which offer genuine opportunities for just and lasting settlements of the basic political problems affecting the region. We feel that the weight of the entire international community should be placed behind the parties concerned in their efforts to arrive at negotiated settlements. It is our earnest hope that, as a result of these negotiations, an independent Zimbabwe with majority rule will emerge in the near future. We also hope that the minority group will be given a constructive role to play in the building up of the new State of Zimbabwe. An independent State of Namibia as one unified nation must emerge within a short period of time. The attempts of South Africa to grant so-called independence to Transkei and to create similar \\\"bantustans\\\" need to be roundly condemned by the international community. If conditions of peace and stability are to be created in southern Africa, it is essential that the abominable practice of apartheid in South Africa be abolished forthwith, and a new society created with freedom, equality and justice for all persons, irrespective of race, color or creed.\n147.\tIn the Middle East, old crises and new tensions continue to pose a grave threat to international peace and security. The continuing fratricidal war in Lebanon is a tragedy of the greatest magnitude. Israel continues to occupy Arab territories forcibly and illegally. It is our view that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the problem, and that there can be no just and durable peace in the region unless Israel withdraws from all Arab territories occupied by it since 1967,. and unless the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored, including the right to return to their homeland and establish an independent State in Palestine. Any lasting settlement in the Middle East must also ensure that every State in the region has a right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\n148.\tThe other area of concern to my delegation is the situation in Cyprus. We fully respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. In our view, General Assembly resolutions 3212 (XXIX) and 3395 (XXX) and Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) still provide a good basis for a just and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem. We should like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his tireless and unremitting efforts to bring the two Cypriot communities together for talks under his auspices in order to find solutions to their differences.\n149.\tNearer home, the Indian subcontinent to which we belong has been an area of much tension and conflict during the past few decades. Fortunately, there is a glimmer of hope for the future. In reviewing the regional situation,His Majesty the King of Bhutan, when addressing the Fifth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Colombo, observed:\n\\\"In our region of Asia, there have been certain far-reaching developments recently which have undoubtedly strengthened the forces of peace and progress. The normalization of relations between India and Pakistan in the spirit of the Simla Agreement is a positive step forward, and shows great statesmanship on the part of the leadership of the two countries. The normalization of relations between India and China will also certainly contribute to peace and stability in Asia. Living as we do next to India, we are fully aware of the constant efforts being made by India to promote good-neighborly relations among all the countries in our region on the basis of sovereign equality and mutual benefit so that, living in peace, co-operation and friendship among our-selves, we can fully devote our energies and our resources to the urgent and critical task of improving the living standards of our people.\\\"\nWe hope that the momentum towards peace and cooperation will be maintained and that all countries in our region will make determined efforts to promote friendship, understanding and co-operation in order to realize the goal of a brighter, happier and more secure future for all our peoples.\n150.\tThe General Assembly by a vast majority adopted resolution 2832 (XXVI) on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Even after the lapse of five years, we find that the Declaration has in no way been respected by the great Powers. It is our view that the presence of great-Power rivalry in the Indian Ocean will disturb the peace and stability of that sensitive zone. We hope that the proposal recently made by the Soviet Union in this regard [see A/31/232, sect. 7] will meet with a favorable response from the other great Powers. Such a development would go a long way towards making the Declaration a reality, and thereby reduce tension and the possibility of conflict in yet another area of the globe.\n151.\tThe world economic system continues to suffer from serious imbalances and growing inequalities. The ever- widening gap between the rich and poor countries is still one of the major sources of tensions and conflicts. It is evident that the present economic order cannot ensure the progress and prosperity of the developing countries. We are all aware that it is not the fluctuations in the market forces which are causing economic stagnation in the developing countries, but the inbuilt biases of the present economic order itself is to blame. The General Assembly, on the initiative of the developing countries, adopted numerous resolutions during the sixth and seventh special sessions to bring about a new international economic order based on equity and justice for all.\n152.\tWe hope that the appeal made by the Heads of State and Government of the non-aligned movement from Colombo will not go unheeded. During the course of her eloquent address to this august body, the current Chairman of the non-aligned movement, Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, stated:\n\\\"It is not my intention to plead here that the developed nations owe a living to the developing. I do plead indeed, on the other hand, that all nations, regardless of their levels of development, owe it to themselves and to future generations not to throw away the opportunity available today to find timely solutions for the problems of mankind and to establish, through mutual understanding and constructive co-operation, a just and therefore enduring pattern of international relations.\\\" [11th meeting, para. 54.]\n153.\tThere are further disturbing signs on the horizon. The results of the fourth session of UNCTAD, held at Nairobi last May, have fallen short of the aspirations of the developing countries. The negotiations currently being held in the Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation are not progressing, owing to a lack of political will on the part of the developed countries. The implementation of the policy measures embodied in the International Development Strategy is most discouraging, as the developed countries are not fulfilling their international obligations. We are still far from achieving the 0.7 per cent target set in the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade.\n154.\tThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in his opening remarks to Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements,  pointed out that one third of the entire urban population of the third world lives in squatter settlements; a large percentage of the people of the least developed countries have no water within 100 meters of their houses; and that half of these people are without electricity. Those statistics are not pleasant to hear, but they highlight the pitiable condition in which hundreds of millions of people in the developing countries live. The situation is still worse in the least developed land-locked countries. Apart from other factors, their geographically disadvantageous position seriously retards their development. The international community must look upon the special problems of that category of States with greater understanding and sympathy. I wish to submit in all humility that we need to go beyond mere reaffirmation of basic aims and principles. The Manila Declaration provides a comprehensive and realistic strategy for action.\n155.\tThe fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended on 17 September in New York without agreement. My country has always been of the opinion that a just and equitable new legal order to govern the sea and the ocean floor must take into account the interests of all countries, whether coastal or land-locked. We also believe that a just and equitable law of the sea will play an important role in the establishment of the new international economic order. In the case of the land-locked countries, the right of access to and from the sea and freedom of transit needs to be safeguarded, for that is vital to their trade and development.\n156.\tA new phenomenon has emerged in recent times which seriously endangers human lives and the safety of international traffic. 1 refer primarily to the phenomenon of taking hostages by seizing aircraft, although other methods have also been used to take hostages. Surely there are better ways of expressing grievances than by threatening to blow up aircraft, thereby imperiling the lives of innocent men, women and children and holding Governments to ransom. The international community must co-operate fully in evolving suitable measures to curb such cruel and senseless acts. The proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany in this regard /see A/311242] deserves the most serious consideration of this Assembly.\n157.\tIn conclusion, I wish to say that while there are no easy solutions to the world's problems, a great deal can be achieved if all nations join hands and work together with patience and determination, a sense of vision and, above all, a great deal of courage.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, Mr. President, I should like on behalf of the Albanian delegation to express to you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session.\n84.\tDuring the period that has passed since the last session of the General Assembly of the United Nations many events have taken place in the world which bear witness to the continuing aggravation of contradictions and confrontation which exists between peace-loving people on the one hand and imperialism and the forces of reaction on the other.\n85.\tPeace-loving countries and peoples are continually aware of the fact that it is only with a resolute struggle that they can defend their freedom, independence and sovereign rights. They are strongly opposed to imperialism, hegemonism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. In various parts of the world the people who are suffering from imperialist exploitation, colonial oppression and racial discrimination are fighting for national and social liberation. The determination of sovereign States to strengthen their political and economic independence and to ensure their free and independent development has increased. The developing countries are making their voices heard ever more courageously or the important problems of our time. International solidarity is increasing among those countries that are fighting for freedom, among those countries who are victims of aggression and are constantly threatened by the policies of hegemony of the two super-Powers and the forces of reaction.\n86.\tHowever, in spite of the important victories of sovereign peoples and States and the successive defeats of the imperialist forces and other forces of reaction, the situation in the world remains explosive and complicated. Many dangers pose a threat to the peoples, world peace and general security. A number of important international problems have not yet been solved. There are still crises and sources of tension in various areas, and new conflicts are added to old ones. Many countries and peoples are still victims of foreign political, economic and military domination, of imperialist, colonialist and neo-colonialist exploitation and the ferocious forms of racial discrimination and brutal interference in their internal affairs. The economic and financial crises of the capitalist countries dominated by the new revisionist bourgeoisie are increasing. The burden of this crisis is very great on the workers of many countries who are directly concerned, and this is especially true in many developing countries. The aggravation of this crisis is accompanied by a continuing aggravation of the political, economic and military contradictions at the international level, and they create serious possible sources of war, aggression and major conflagration.\n87.\tThe primary source of all the dangers which threaten the people of the world and cause tension and insecurity in the world is the hegemonist aggressive policies of American imperialists and Soviet social-imperialists. The development of events, the complicated situation in Europe and the Middle East, the tragedy in Lebanon, the crimes perpetrated against the Palestinian people, the tense situation in Cyprus and the growth of tension in the Mediterranean and conflicts and quarrels in Africa and other parts of the world show that the two imperialist super-Powers are constantly intensifying their rivalry to dominate the world, to preserve their zones of influence and to maintain areas where there are now sovereign States. The United States and the Soviet Union are trying to camouflage their policies of war and aggression, their methods of violence and blackmail by making a great deal of demagogic noise about \\\"detente\\\", about their \\\"good intentions\\\", about their \\\"efforts\\\" to contribute to the settlement of world problems, to contribute to the establishment of peace and general security and so forth. The two super-Powers speak a good deal about disarmament, about the reduction of military forces. They have much to say about the farce of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, about the Vienna talks and about many other proposals from conferences and international meetings devoted to these subjects. At the same time, though, they obstinately pursue the unbridled armaments race. They increase their arsenals. They perfect their weapons, outrageously increase their military budgets and cover the world with their naval fleets and air forces, their military bases and their troops. The Soviet Union and the United States have become the largest purveyors of weapons that history has known. They have sold colossal quantities of weapons to suck the blood of the peoples of the world and to encourage other countries to wage war; at the same time, they do not hesitate to produce for themselves new modern weapons to preserve their superiority in this area and to implement their policies of aggression and hegemony.\n88.\tThere is no continent or zone in the world where the two imperialist super-Powers have not made their presence felt. There is no conflict nor source of difficulty that they are not involved in. There is no important international problem where they do not try to play the role of arbiter and impose their will.\n89.\tMany fine phrases have been devoted to the results of the conference on so-called European security, and that in spite of the hesitations and skepticism of the participating countries. Those results have been considered as the \\\"beginning of a new period of peace in Europe\\\". Life has shown, though, that the first anniversary of that conference has been celebrated without glory. As could be expected, what had been signed at the conference has remained on paper; nothing, in fact, has been implemented. Nothing has been put into effect, because everything had been worked out disregarding European reality.\n90.\tIn Europe after Helsinki the' dangers for national independence and the security of the European peoples have not decreased but in fact have increased. Insecurity has increased. The military bases of the two super-Powers and the aggressive military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact have remained intact. Each of the two super-Powers, claiming that there is a need to defend itself against the other and to maintain balance, has redoubled its efforts to create new bases to strengthen its aggressive bloc, and at the same time they have endeavored to enlist other States. The military maneuvers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact have become more frequent and more threatening. The military maneuvers of the imperialist Powers have always been a prelude to aggression. It is pure illusion and even a dangerous one to think that it is enough to implement the Helsinki decisions on the prior announcement of these maneuvers and the sending of observers for the danger to be  induced and for there to be no longer any danger of war and aggression.\n91.\tThere is no need for us to dwell on this undeniable truth, that the demagogic noise of the two super-Powers on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is nothing but an attempt to subjugate the European people, to lull them to sleep, to create further possibilities for imposing their will in Europe. Even before the ink on the Helsinki documents had dried the two super-Powers once again proclaimed their reactionary doctrines of dividing Europe into zones of influence.\n92.\tThe position of the People's Republic of Albania on the question of European security is well known. The Albanian delegation wishes once again to stress that genuine peace and security in Europe cannot be brought about unless there is effective action to do away with the dangers for the people of Europe of the aggressive policies of the two super-Powers and to modify the existing situation in that continent. Firstly, that requires the liquidation of the aggressive blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. It requires the withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from the territories of European countries, the dismantling of all the military bases of the two super-Powers, a ban on their military maneuvers near the borders of sovereign European countries and the departure of war fleets from the Mediterranean. Any illusions regarding the value of the decisions adopted in Helsinki, far from serving the cause of European peace and security will be taken advantage of by the two super-Powers to the detriment of the vital interests of the peoples of Europe.\n93.\tThe two super-Powers and other reactionary forces have also striven to exploit propaganda about detente and the documents and the spirit of the Conference on European security as a means of making people forget a number of questions that have been awaiting a solution since the end of the Second World War and to deny the right of the European peoples to demand a settlement of these questions.\n94.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany, inter alia, is trying to take advantage of this situation. Using the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union it is trying to assert itself as a Power of the first rank in Europe. The support and constant encouragement that it gets from the United States and the repeated concessions from the socio-imperialist Soviet Union have only served to en-courage revanchist tendencies in the Federal Republic of Germany. The successive Governments of this country have intensified from year to year their efforts to have the Federal Republic of Germany go down in history without having discharged its obligations as a conquered country in the Second World War after the crushing of Hitler's Nazism by the peoples of the anti-Fascist coalition.\n95.\tThe Government of Albania on a number of occasions in many documents has clearly defined its views on this question and three years ago we stated our views on this question in the General Assembly when the two German States were accepted as Members of the United Nations. The delegation of Albania believes that it is necessary once again to say that the Federal Republic of Germany has major obligations and great debts to the Albanian people for its innumerable barbaric crimes and the damage and devastation caused by the Nazis in Albania during the Second World War.\n96.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Albania recently made a request to the Federal Republic of Germany for war reparations. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has not taken any measures to satisfy the rights of the People's Republic of Albania regarding the question of war reparations but has put forward justifications which are completely unfounded to deny us our rights. That is an attitude which is hostile toward our people and which reminds us of the cruelty and killing of German Nazis during the Second World War in Albania. By pursuing this course of action the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is only assuming an even heavier responsibility.\n97.\tThe People's Republic of Albania will never give up its legitimate claims, which cannot be denied and which are permanent. On no pretext can the Federal Republic of Germany avoid its responsibilities and be freed of its obligations. The Albanian delegation declares that the only just and acceptable way to settle this problem is for the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany to reconsider its position and to begin to pay Albania the war reparations which are our due.\n98.\tThe considerable increase in the intensification of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union for the expansion of hegemony in the Mediterranean makes the situation particularly tense in that part of the world. This year the two super-Powers have in an unprecedented manner increased their war fleets with new aircraft carriers and cruisers, with nuclear submarines and a number of major troop-carrying vessels. The new provocative and threatening maneuvers of these fleets throughout the Mediterranean bear witness to the policies of blackmail which the two super-Powers have been pursuing to frighten and break the will of the peoples of the Mediterranean countries. High-ranking admirals and military men of the two super-Powers have visited a number of the Mediterranean countries, and American and Soviet war vessels under the cover of friendly visits have been entering and leaving a number of ports in the Mediterranean and have tried to remain at anchor as long as possible. And those ports have practically become permanent bases for mooring and resupply. Today there can be no illusions about why the two super-Powers' fleets are in the waters and ports of the Mediterranean and what their designs there are. The just action taken this year by the Egyptian Government, which drove from the ports of Egypt the war vessels of the Soviet social-imperialists, once again confirms that the war fleets of the two super-Powers, even when they arrive in a country allegedly to bring assistance and with friendly purposes, become a constant danger for the freedom and independence of the countries where they are found and other neighboring countries.\n99.\tThe Mediterranean belongs to the Mediterranean countries, and the people of those countries want that sea to become a zone of peace and tranquility. The Government of Albania has stated its view publicly that to achieve that goal it is necessary for each Mediterranean country resolutely to oppose the aggressive policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. The countries where those two super-Powers have established their military bases must see to it that they are liquidated and that no port facilities are given to American and Soviet fleets. Comrade Enver Hoxha, the leader of the Albanian people, has stated:\n\\\"No pretext is valid when it is used to make it possible for the fleets of the two super-Powers not only to have permanent bases but also to moor, to make repairs and to obtain supplies. That is very dangerous not only for the countries making those concessions but also for their neighbors. We cannot agree with anyone regarding those practices,\\\"\nThe visits of American and Soviet war vessels in the ports of the Mediterranean are in no way friendly visits. They are but an expression of gunboat diplomacy. What kind of friendship is it when the so-called friend comes to you armed to the teeth with guns and weapons and ready to open fire?\n100.\tNor is there peace and tranquility in the Balkan Peninsula, and that is due primarily to the policies of hegemony of the United States and the Soviet Union in that part of the world. Those countries have sought to interfere in the internal affairs of the Balkan countries. They have tried to cause conflict there and to pit the people of that part of the world against each other. That situation gives rise to legitimate concern on the part of the Balkan peoples. The higher interests and lofty aspirations of those peoples who wish to be free and sovereign people living in peace and with friendly relations require that there should be resolute opposition to interference in the internal affairs on the part of the two super-Powers, which must not be allowed to trouble the waters of the Balkans and to use one Balkan country as a beach-head and as a tool for their policies of aggression.\n101.\tThe People's Republic of Albania has been consistently pursuing a policy of good-neighborliness with countries near ours and we have not spared any effort to contribute to genuine peace and stability in the Balkans. Through our concrete actions we have shown that we have not permitted and indeed will never permit the peoples of neighboring countries and other Balkan peoples to be the victims of any wrongs on our territory.\n102.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Albania appreciates all sincere efforts to bring about understanding and co-operation of a genuine kind in the Balkans and, on the basis of the present situation in the Balkans, we have openly expressed our views on what course of action should be followed precisely in order to bring about that comprehension and co-operation. Our view basically is that at the present time it is through the development of relations among the countries of the Balkans by bilateral means and within the spirit of a policy of good-neighborliness that the aspirations of the peoples of this peninsula can best be met.\n103.\tA just settlement of the problem of Cyprus is of particular importance for peace and stability in the Balkans and in neighboring areas. The Albanian Government has always been in favor of the existence of a free and independent State of Cyprus. We have always supported respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity and a settlement of the problem of Cyprus by the two communities of the island, who should live in harmony and understanding. We are opposed to any intervention on the part of the imperialist Powers in the internal affairs of Cyprus and we are opposed to the plans and intrigues of the United States and the Soviet Union to exploit the question of Cyprus for their own policies of hegemony.\n104.\tThe events which have taken place this year in the Middle East have had the effect of aggravating and further complicating the already explosive and dangerous situation in that part of the world as a result of the imperialist Zionist aggression against the Arab people. The events that have taken place there confirm once again that the two super-Powers and Israeli Zionists have never abandoned and indeed never will abandon their hostile plans against the Arab countries. At present one may see particularly clearly that American diplomacy and \\\"step-by-step\\\" diplomacy there and the demagoguery of the Soviet socialist- imperialists at the Geneva Conference, the hypocritical smiles and promises of friendship on the part of the two super-Powers toward the Arab countries have been nothing but a smoke-screen to camouflage their rivalry in the Middle East, to cover up their efforts to undermine the positions of others and to plot intrigue against the Arab peoples.\n105.\tThe clearest example of the harmful consequences of their deeds is today the tragedy in Lebanon. The fratricidal war which has been raging for the past few months in\nLebanon and has caused many human victims and incalculable material damage is not the result of the special political and social conditions in the country but is indeed the work of the two imperialist super-Powers and Israel. They have provoked and have indeed cultivated the armed conflict in Lebanon in order to destroy the liberation movement of the Palestinian people and to liquidate the Palestinian question, to divide the Arab people, to bring about war among them and to prevent them from uniting their forces on the main war front to liberate the lands held by the Israeli Zionists and to drive the two super-Powers from the Middle East. The Israeli Zionists are indeed pleased to see the camps of the Palestinians and the cities and towns of Lebanon becoming battlefields for the Arabs and with their typical arrogance they have not failed to threaten the Arab people with new aggression and to undertake themselves acts of aggression and terrorism in the very heart of Africa thousands of kilometers away.\n106.\tIt is not the first time that the Palestinian people have been the object of odious attacks and machinations on the part of imperialist Zionist and Arab reactionary enemies who wish to deny their rights, leaving them without a homeland for ever. But the Palestinian people are with standing these difficulties and they will not be deterred from their struggle for their rights, nor will they ever fall into the traps that have been laid for them. The just cause of the Palestinian people is one that has been supported and upheld by all the peace-loving peoples of the entire world, who condemn those who would subject them through arms or drive a knife into their backs.\n107.\tAs they fan the flames in Lebanon the two imperialist super-Powers are also intensifying their efforts to cause conflict and contradictions among other Arab States, to create difficulties and internal difficulties in one country and then in another according to the theory \\\"divide and conquer\\\".\n108.\tIn the face of all these dangers the Arab people now fully realize that their unity must be strengthened and that they must fight with resolution for the restoration of their national rights. The Albanian people strongly support, as indeed they always have done, the just struggle of their Arab brothers and they condemn the Zionist imperialist aggression and all hostile activities and plots against the Palestinian people.\n109.\tThe year 1976 has also marked the intensification of rivalry among the two super-Powers in Africa. Their intervention in the internal affairs of the sovereign States of Africa intrigues to sow the seeds of discord and undermine African unity, have had the effect of aggravating certain conflicts and sources of tension. They tried to cover up their activities with demagoguery and noisy promises. The high officials of the American administration who have been traveling throughout Africa in all directions and who are planning to pursue their ill-fated \\\"step-by-step diplomacy\\\" in that part of the world too swear that the United States will put pressure on the racist regimes of Salisbury and Pretoria. But it is well known that they are the most ardent defenders of those racist regimes and that they are the enemies of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Azania and Zimbabwe against racial discrimination, apartheid, colonialism and neo-colonialism. The Soviet social imperialists for their part have posed as the \\\"natural allies\\\" of the liberation movements and of the independent African countries and have promised \\\"assistance\\\". They have offered \\\"advisers\\\" and \\\"specialists\\\", in order politically, economically and even militarily to penetrate in the largest possible number of African countries.\n110.\tThe African peoples from their long experience and their long struggle for freedom and independence against imperialism and colonialism are familiar with the flattery and promises of the imperialist Powers. They have had many opportunities to understand the designs of the neo-colonialists and the super-Powers on the African continent. The Albanian people welcome and support the liberation struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Azania and Namibia. They are convinced that the peoples in the sovereign States of Africa will fight resolutely against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism and are convinced that they will defend their national interests and that they will resolve the problems which are of concern to their continent.\n111.\tThe Korean peninsula has been and remains a source of tension and a threat to peace and stability in the Far East as a result of the aggressive policies of the American imperialists which have long been pursued against the Korean people, as a result of the maintenance of American occupying troops in South Korea and the provocation and warlike action of the United States and their puppets in Seoul against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The United States, acting against the will and legitimate aspirations of the people of Korea, continues to undermine a possible just settlement of the Korean problem. It has done its utmost to prevent the reunification of the nation of Korea in a single State and to pursue its \\\"two Koreas\\\" plan.\n112.\tThe Albanian people and their Government denounce the aggressive policies of American imperialism against the Korean people and denounce their provocations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They support the just demands of the Korean people that American troops should be withdrawn from South Korea and that the so-called United Nations Command in Korea should be dissolved, and the right of the Korean people to the independent reunification of the country without foreign interference.\n113.\tThe Albanian people welcome the success of the developing countries and peoples in their struggle to put an end to the plundering and exploitation of the two super-Powers and other imperialist Powers. We support the just demands of those countries that the existing system of exploitation in international economic and trade relations should be changed. We support their efforts to strengthen their political and economic independence and their measures to establish their own control and national sovereignty over their natural wealth and natural resources and we support their free and independent development. Naturally the imperialist Powers are not very pleased with the demands of the developing countries. Time has shown that they obstinately sabotage the efforts of those countries and that they bring pressure to bear and use blackmail in the form of assistance and credits to preserve their position and their ability to plunder and exploit others throughout the world. But the peoples of the world will fight against imperialist exploitation and oppression. They will continually strengthen their mutual co-operation, unity and solidarity. The just struggle of the democratic and progressive sovereign peoples and States of the world for their defense and freedom, independence and sovereignty is supported by the People's Republic of China, a powerful socialist State and a resolute fighter against the aggressive policies of hegemony of the two imperialist super-Powers.\n114.\tThe year 1976 is a year that has been filled with events of political, social and economic importance for the People's Republic of Albania. The Seventh. Congress of the Labor Party of Albania, which will be held in November and which coincides with the celebration of another great event, the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party of Albania, will draw up the balance-sheet of the success achieved in building socialism in all fields in Albania and will open up still greater prospects for the future of the Albanian people.\n115.\tThe fifth five-year plan, 1971-1975, has been an important stride forward in the building of socialist society in Albania. There has been great success in strengthening the material and technical base of socialism and we are continually raising the living standards of the working masses and strengthening the defense of our country. Our country's economy is on a sound, solid basis and we know neither stagnation nor crises. During the fifth five-year plan the social product, the national income and industrial production and agricultural production and investment have increased two or three times faster than the population. Industrial production in 1975 was 52 per cent higher than in 1970. Agricultural production increased 33 per cent, investments for development in the economy in-creased 53 per cent. During the same period the national income increased 38 per cent. The real per capita income in cities increased 8 per cent and in the countryside 20.3 per cent.\n116.\tThe sixth five-year plan for the period 1976-1980 will represent a new phase of economic and cultural progress. During that period it is planned that there will be an industrial production increase of about 41-44 per cent, an agricultural production increase of about 37-40 per cent and an investment increase of 35-38 per cent. National income will show an increase of 3840 per cent, whereas real per capita income will show an increase of 11-14 per cent.\n117.\tThe debate among the masses for a new constitution for the socialist People's Republic of Albania has created a new and exciting atmosphere. This document is of particular importance to the present and future of the people of Albania, and it reflects the major victories and radical transformations of a political and economic and social nature which have taken place in socialist Albania under the aegis of the Labor Party of Albania and under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and establishes a new foundation for continuing and irresistible progress along the path of socialism.\n118.\tThe draft for the new constitution reflects the principles of the foreign policy of Albania, which are the policies of a free and independent socialist State serving the interests of the people and building socialism in Albania, serving the interests of people and international peace and security. The draft constitution clearly establishes that the socialist People's Republic of Albania follows a policy of friendship, co-operation and mutual assistance with the socialist States on the basis of Marxist-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We are for peace and relations of good-neighborliness with all States on the basis of equality, respect for national sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and mutual advantage. We are firmly opposed to any form of imperialist aggression, to all forms of colonial exploitation, hegemony and diktat. We are opposed to all forms of national oppression and racial discrimination. On the basis of the principle of the full exercise of national sovereignty, the draft constitution places a ban on the establishment of foreign military bases and forces on the territory of Albania.\n119.\tIn conclusion, the delegation of Albania declares that, once again at this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, we will spare no effort to make a modest contribution to the consideration of the various items on the agenda.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to express my sincere congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of this historic thirty- first session of the United Nations General Assembly. With my congratulations I bring the brotherly greetings of His Majesty King Sobhuza the Second, and of the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland. We have complete confidence that a man of your caliber, who has already proven his leadership qualities and skills as a diplomat, a statesman and, a symbol of his country's commitment to non-alignment, will successfully guide our deliberations.\n3.\tIn congratulating you, Mr. President, we wish also to express our heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for the efficient and brilliant leadership which he demonstrated throughout last year's session of this Assembly. '\n4.\tMy delegation warmly welcomes the admission of Seychelles to an Organization founded to harmonize the actions of nations\\\", 'and is confident that as a non-aligned nation Seychelles will always prove a worth-while ally of peace. But peace and harmony in the world can be attained only by harnessing the collective will and co-operation of all nations, large and small.\n5.\tMy delegation has confidence, hope and faith that in such an august gathering of peace-loving, peace-seeking and peace-motivated Member States substantial progress towards removing the obstacles that lie in the way of freedom, peace, justice, progress and the pursuit of happiness and international understanding can be achieved.\n6.\tI should like to express my country's condolences to the People's Republic of China, a Member State of our world community, on the death of its great leader, the late Chairman Mao Tsetung. His great achievements are admired and respected by us all. It is now our hope and prayer that the Chinese people will continue to prosper in an atmosphere of peace and stability.\n7.\tAn unfortunate problem concerning our Organization is that some Member States do not seem to take it seriously. Over the last 30 years we have discussed world peace, justice and progress as pillars of a new generation that should \\\"learn war no more\\\", but our world is constantly being racked by war, including local wars, and by division, oppression, poverty, hunger, disease, inflation, unemployment and financial crises. So, at the fifth non-aligned Conference, held in Colombo,  a majority of the nations of the world once again clearly called for a more equitable world order. It is time that call was taken seriously.\n8.\tOur experience over the last eight years since we regained our independence has been that every major social or economic problem is also a political problem, and that the central political problem of mankind is how a balanced mixture of economic growth, social justice and democracy can be achieved.\n9.\tIt is in that context that His Majesty's Government has continued to support and to work for the achievement of a new international economic order, in which power and wealth would be more equitably distributed around the world. Here we should spare no effort to accelerate the balanced transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world.\n10.\tThe past year has taught us that rhetoric is not enough. At present world trade and development is controlled and financed mainly by a small group of privileged countries. The economic fortunes of these nations determine the fortunes of the rest of the world. The past year has been no exception to that rule; growth prospects for the non-oil-producing developing world have worsened, per capita incomes have fallen in real terms, and the gap between rich and poor has widened.\n11.\tIt is for those reasons that the Government has taken special note of the failure of the dialog between the rich and poor nations in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ and in other bodies. Concrete results have yet to be achieved, and until such time as the developing world can be united in common action to achieve a common goal, the meetings and talks will have little effect. Until such time as it is possible for the developing world to confront the developed world on more nearly equal terms the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland will continue to work relentlessly for vital reforms of the international economic and financial systems. Trade flows must be increased; international purchasing power must be created for the use of the poorer nations; debt must be rescheduled; and schemes must be introduced to stabilize commodity prices. We shall strive to achieve these ends through the years ahead.\n12.\tIt is the opinion of my delegation that the third world could normally and more effectively achieve development by the sale of their processed products, in addition to receiving assistance. This would mean that developing countries would increase their exports and rely more on stable and equitable remunerative prices in world markets. It would also mean that collective action would be an indispensable factor in complementing national efforts and bilateral assistance.\n13.\tIn this regard natural resources and permanent sovereignty over those resources are considered to be the highest exponents for development, and Swazi national participation in the development of industries emphasizes this aspect.\n14.\tSince natural resources are not only scarce but also non-renewable, the development of natural resources is based on certain strategies in order to obtain maximum financial and social benefits for the nation.\n15.\tA few weeks ago, when the Swazi nation celebrated its eighth anniversary of independence, my Head of State said:\n\\\"A new and vigorous approach to the problem of peace and war is needed. The time has come when the destiny of mankind should cease to hang so dangerously on the aims and ambitions of great Powers.\\\"\n16.\tSwaziland believes that if people have no stake in a society they can become a threat to tint society. Peace and stability are threatened by divided societies, yet all of us are very much aware that this division continues to introduce into the modern world unnecessary disharmony and conflicts of interest which disastrously divide mankind at a time when unity of purpose and action are so vital for peace, justice, order and progress in the service of man.\n17.\tSwaziland's policy remains strongly that of non- racialist democracy, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, good neighborliness, non-alignment and respect for peace, justice and equality. We practice and cherish these concepts as principles enshrined in both the Charter of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ. These are principles clearly irreconcilable with any form of denial of the fundamental human rights and degradation of the human person.\n18.\tIn this regard my country is greatly distressed and perturbed about the situation across our border in the Republic of South Africa, where recent events have resulted in the tragic deaths of innocent people including children.\n19.\tWe remain more convinced than ever before that racial and discriminatory policies militate against the essential dignity and quality of all human beings, and we hope that efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem of racial discrimination in South Africa will be fruitful.\n20.\tThe people of Namibia, like any other people, are entitled to self-determination to lead them rapidly to complete independence and majority rule so that justice and human dignity can be the elements of peace in that international Territory.\n21.\tAt different conferences the \\\"homeland\\\" policy of the Government of South Africa has been a subject of great concern and debate. Swaziland remains deeply committed, as it must, to the resolutions of OAU and of the United Nations on a matter such as this.\n22.\tIn April of this year my Government, acting as a loyal Member of the United Nations, fought and won a case in the High Court of Swaziland in which an effort was made by a South African firm to obtain an order against the Government of Swaziland and its Commissioner of Police for the return of a consignment of arms which the South African firm had unsuccessfully tried to import into the Republic of South Africa by using Swaziland as an address. My Government took the line that no court of Swaziland would issue an order which would result in Swaziland's being a party, even if indirectly, to a breach of the arms embargo against South Africa imposed by the Security Council of the United Nations. My Government has also passed a law known as The Prevention of the Violation of International Obligations Order, which imposes heavy penalties against any person who in any manner what-soever, inside or outside Swaziland, breaches or is a party to a breach of a resolution adopted by the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations.\n23.\tSpeaking from this very podium two years ago,  my delegation expressed the view that so long as the privileged white minority in Rhodesia was allowed the monopoly of political power it would not voluntarily give it away.\n24.\tIt is the desire for peace and justice that we once again observe in the constructive role being played with regard to a peaceful settlement of the Rhodesian problem. We have not been proved wrong on the inevitability of majority rule there, and we shall not be wrong in our conviction that it is the authentic people of Zimbabwe themselves who must together work out their salvation and shape their destiny in an atmosphere of dedication, unity and reverence.\n25.\tRhodesia must return to legality forthwith. It is with regard to that act that Britain is urged to convene a conference on Rhodesia to deal with the immediate problems of an interim Government and to plan for a constitutional conference.\n26.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security is one of the principal aims of the Charter. My delegation believes in man's vigorous quest for the common ground of unity and peace. Deliberations of this Assembly with that ultimate objective in mind will make compromises possible and so prevent the involved Member State from transferring problems and disputes from the table of detente to the battlefield of despair.\n27.\tAn uneasy calm still reigns over the panorama of the Middle East as an attempt to secure lasting peace in the region is being frustrated by intransigence and narrow vested interests.\n28.\tThe absence of peace in the Middle East means the absence of peace in the world, as the stability of our society is based on reciprocity and interdependence. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like once again to express appreciation and admiration to all the parties concerned in the Middle East conflict for showing restraint and human understanding and for seeking a solution through negotiation. It is the view of my delegation that a peaceful solution in that region will continue to demand political will and commitment and can endure only if the principles of justice, territorial integrity, sovereignty and the right of each State to exist are scrupulously observed.\n29.\tIn the spirit of non-alignment, my delegation applauds the processes whereby the fabric of national unity is being woven and a pattern of national existence developed, though not with ease, in countries still divided and torn by conflicts. In such circumstances my delegation will not take any action that may be seen to prejudice the fuller development of these objectives.\n30.\tPast history reveals that Africa has been a continent of drama and tragedy. The scars of slavery, the wounds of imperialism and exploitation are but too fresh to have been forgotten. But the future is different. It is a future of hope; a future of a socio-political evolution towards a larger community of a united Africa; a future that will ultimately banish big-Power patronage in a continent that is being rebuilt from the ashes of colonialism; a future without the indefensible status quo and white domination; and indeed a future of inspiration that we shall, for certain, triumph at the end of it all and regain our glory as a free continent.\n31.\tIt is for these reasons of hope that my country, together with the non-aligned countries of the third world, has consistently demanded the withdrawal of any naval or military presence from the Indian Ocean by the great Powers because we, who rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on our doorstep, also regard it as a zone of peace.\n32.\tTurning now to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea-a Conference which has benefited greatly from your able and wise guidance, Mr. President-it is our conviction that members of the international community must eschew narrow national interests and exert the necessary political will to utilize this unique opportunity to establish international norms to regulate 70\n. per cent of the earth's surface. We believe that at the last session of that all-important Conference there was some progress in ensuring that land-locked States like Swaziland were granted the right of access to and from the sea and\nthat, together with other developing, geographically disadvantaged States, they would have the right to exploit the living resources of the economic zones of coastal States in the same region or subregion on an equitable basis.\n33.\tMuch, however, remains to be achieved at the next crucial session in May 1977. This is especially so with regard to the establishment of an effective international sea-bed authority to give practical effect to the concept of the common heritage of mankind and the establishment of a comprehensive system for the settlement of disputes. Compromise and a pragmatic approach are essential if a new convention is to be acceptable as it must be to all segments of the international community.\n34.\tThe problems of war and peace are not an adventure. War is our destruction. Peace is our salvation. Let us strive to create a climate of peace in our world, and not of war. Let us build bridges to span the gulfs created by diverse and conflicting interests so that freedom, unity and equality can provide the promise for future prosperity, democracy and justice. Let this Assembly lay emphasis on deeds rather than mere words deeds that are calculated to further the objectives of a durable peace in our tin.e.\n"

        "file_text": "I should confess, Mr. President, that every year that I have approached this rostrum-and I have been doing so, off and on, for 31 years-I have felt increasingly like a defendant about to be asked why judgment should not be rendered against him. I submit that it is of primary importance that we should face up to the growing skepticism, cynicism and even hostility with which our deliberations are viewed by many, and I propose to address myself to this problem in the course of these remarks.\n50.\tNo doubt, Sir, you and the Secretary-General have shared this unease, and it was for that reason that I hesitated to offer you at this time the ritual congratulations upon your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly this year. The controversies and confrontations that marked past sessions did not seem to provide favorable and happy auguries for your incumbency.\n\n51.\tNone the less, I avail myself of this traditional opportunity to extend to you my most cordial and sincere wishes for your success, and indeed to express my confidence that you will achieve it with the personal qualities of leadership which you have more than amply demonstrated in guiding the complicated negotiations on the law of the sea, as well as the devotion and dedication, displayed during your many years of service here, to the ideals and objectives of the United Nations.\n52.\tYet we would be less than honest with ourselves were we not to admit that our Organization is in crisis. That is a hackneyed way of putting it, and it would be even more commonplace to call it a crisis of confidence, even of self-confidence. But the fact is that many-too many- outside our Organization, and even inside it, have lost confidence in it. They no longer believe, as they once believed, in the United Nations, in the way in which it works, in its mission, in its relevance.\n53.\tThis skepticism is focused, above all, on this General Assembly, where it is claimed that a so-called automatic majority imposes its will without rhyme or reason, deaf to argument, contemptuous of compromise, coherent only in cant and prejudice, approving resolutions that cannot be realistically enforced, proclaiming objectives that cannot be reasonably achieved. What is more, it is charged that this majority is not a majority at all, but a conspiracy of willful minorities, each pursuing its own selfish purpose or advantage, or coercing the real majority into a meaningless unity under threats of exclusion and isolation.\n54.\tThere is an easy way to dismiss these accusations. One can reply that the skeptics, critics and cynics come from some of the rich industrial Powers that have seen their own automatic majorities of the past dwindle and disappear, that are frustrated by the united political will of their former colonies and clients, and that fear the end of the old international economic order, whose inequitable privileges and advantages they are determined to defend and preserve.\n55.\tI have said that that is an easy answer. I suggest that it may also be a superficial and even dangerous view: superficial, because it does not correspond to the realities of the world in which we live; and dangerous, because it invites division and confrontation. We are all going through an era of profound changes in international relations, and in a time of change the primordial need is for adjustment and acceptance of that adjustment.\n56.\tThose of us who met in San Francisco in 1945 and who worked in and with the United Nations in the following two decades-personally, I have missed only about five sessions of the General Assembly-look back now and have reason to exclaim: \\\"How the United Nations has changed! \\\" And that is perhaps at the bottom of the disenchantment, even the shock, experienced by many of the present critics of the Organization and our General Assembly.\n57.\tOf course the United Nations has changed. It has changed because the world ha? changed-changed in ways that the United Nations itself helped to bring about. It may be that some of the founding fathers .at San Francisco sought or hoped to immobilize the patterns of power at the end of the Second World War, to-so to speak-stop the world at 1945. If so, such a hope was unfounded and doomed.\n58.\tBut speaking for myself, I must say that that was not my view or expectation when I helped to write the Charter in 1945. I have always had a kinetic view of the United Nations; I have always believed that the United Nations was and should be an instrument of change, that change was its mission: change in the old colonial empires, with the emancipation of subject peoples; change in the structures of racial and sex discrimination; change in the inequitable economic relations between the suppliers of raw materials and the manufacturers of industrial goods; change in a world of unendurable division between rich and poor, starving and well fed, the princes and the potentates managing the future, and the wretched without a future.\n59.\tNow the process of change has reached its critical point and, as in the past, it can best be judged in this General Assembly. If the balance of forces here is what it is, it is because that is what our world is like. We are out of Bretton Woods, thank God, and we have not remained asleep since Lake Success. We cannot keep the calendar at 1945.\n60.\tThat is what I should like the skeptics, critics and cynics to bear in mind when they pass judgment on the work and the workings of the General Assembly. Our task now, as -in my conception- it has always been, is to bring about a better world, and that means necessarily to change the world. Our task here is to voice the demand of the majority, a true majority, of the inhabitants of this earth, for a meaningful change in their lives, to seek and promote that change, to ease the essential adjustments to that change, not through recrimination and confrontation, but through the recognition and reconciliation of legitimate interests,\n61.\tIf we consider the world as it really is today, we shall, I submit, understand that in bringing about the change we covet the arbitrary imposition of the will of one side upon the other can lead us nowhere. The so-called automatic numerical majority in the General Assembly is in real terms matched by what a Spanish wit called the vast minority- the vast minority of wealth and power constituted by the industrial States. Indeed, they have nothing to fear but their own short-sightedness and selfishness.\n62.\tHaving said what I felt needed to be said, allow me now to undertake a brief review of the foreign policy of my Government. We in Manila too, and foremost among us our President Ferdinand E. Marcos, have for the past several years taken a hard look at the world as it really is, now in 1976, and not as it was in 1945.\n63.\tWithout fanfare we have in fact brought about a basic reorientation of our foreign policy as far-reaching in its implications for our foreign relations as those of our revolutionary new society are for our national development.\n64.\tAs recently as 1972 we had no diplomatic relations with a single socialist State. We have since quietly rectified that omission. Our establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China last year, and with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics last June, completed the normalization of our relations with the leading socialist countries.\n65.\tAt the same time, determined to maintain cordial relations with all friendly countries regardless of differences in ideology and social systems, we have steadily expanded our diplomatic links with developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America- most recently with our neighbors Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; with the Somali Democratic Republic, the Central African Republic and the Gabonese Republic, in Africa; and with Cuba and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas in Latin America.\n66.\tTo the newly admitted Republic of Seychelles we extend a warm welcome and the assurance of our readiness to develop amicable and mutually beneficial relations.\n67.\tThe fundamental reorientation of our foreign policy is reflected not only in its enlarged scope but also in its content and direction. We have been moving with deliberate speed towards non-alignment-non-alignment in its true sense-a course made possible by our disengagement from the South-East Asia Treaty Organization, which we have helped to phase out; by the review of our bilateral defense agreements with the United States, in which we have reaffirmed Philippine sovereignty over the military bases in our territory we are seeking to reduce further the period of their occupancy and insisting on strict adherence to their defensive purpose; and by our establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the great majority of socialist States.\n68.\tWe have also consolidated our identification with the third world of developing countries by a series of significant initiatives including the hosting of the Third Ministerial Meeting' of the Group of 77 in Manila last January and February and the personal participation of President Marcos at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi last May. At that Conference, as the chosen spokesman of the Group of 77, President Marcos presented the Manila Declaration and Program of Action  embodying the Group's positions on the great issues pertaining to the new international economic order. He seized the opportunity to speak forcefully on the need for change. He said:\n\\\"The time has come for the dominant powers to renounce their desire for national advantage, to proclaim an end to all unequal relationships which the developing countries have had to accept as former possessions, protectorates or colonies... If the rich do not intervene to hasten the. growth of the tinder-developed countries, they cannot hope to avoid being themselves caught under the weight of those whom they will not help.\\\"\n69.\tEarlier in Manila President Marcos had said in his opening address to the Group of 77 ministerial meeting:\n\\\"Power itself cannot be indefinitely monopolized; it should be shared progressively among nations if we are to inhabit a tranquil and orderly world... And unless there is an equitable sharing of the world's resources, it could not be a question of whether, but how soon, the ever-growing number of the world's poor would challenge the ever-diminishing number of the rich for the just sharing of those resources.\\\"\n70.\tThe Philippine commitment to the new international economic order, be it noted, goes beyond lip service. Out of our modest resources the Philippines has pledged $US SO million to initiate the common fund for the integrated program on commodities, one of the key-stones of the new international economic order. The Philippines has also subscribed to a common fund for the least developed countries with a contribution of $US 500,000 over a three-year period.\n71.\tThese actions reflect our concept of the new inter-national economic order as an edifice with three levels. At the national level each country should strive to put its own house in order, rectifying economic and social inequalities, ensuring a full share for every citizen in the benefits as well as the tasks of national development, improving the quality of life nationwide. This is precisely what in essence we have been doing for the past four years in our new society. We are, of course, doing this primarily for the benefit of our own people, but we are also hoping that our new society could become a microcosm of what the new international economic order should be on a global scale.\n72.\tAt the regional level we are hard at work in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] with our neighbors and associates Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. At an historic summit meeting in Bali last December the Heads of Government of the ASEAN countries resolved to co-operate in accelerating the economic development of the member countries. At the same time the foundation was laid for regional collaboration in selected industries.\n73.\tWe in ASEAN have our differences: religious differences, ethnic differences, differences in political and social systems. But we are united on some things which we consider important: to secure a better life for our peoples; to do everything we can, individually and collectively, to enhance the prospects for peace and to maintain the climate of freedom in our region; to support with our combined strength the concerted efforts of the third world to restructure the world economic order on the basis of justice and equality for all Members of the international community.\n74.\tASEAN is still misunderstood and sometimes maligned and misrepresented. This has not deterred us from extending the hand of friendship and peaceful collaboration to all our neighbors in South-East Asia.\n\n75.\tTo the great Powers, we say simply, \\\"Please leave us alone\\\", Kindly refrain from making South-East Asia an arena of your competing ambitions. All we want is to proceed unhampered with our own development. ASEAN is not an insignificant association. Its member nations, with a combined population of over 230 million people, inhabit an area strategically situated, rich in natural resources, potentially powerful. But our ambition is limited to seeing South-East Asia become a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. In his policy statement on the opening day of the general debate this year, Mr. Krishna Raj Aryal, Foreign Minister of Nepal, correctly described the ASEAN proposal towards this end as: \\\"a constructive effort towards the strengthening of the peace, stability and development of the South-East Asian region\\\" [5th meeting, para. 174]. We welcome with deep appreciation his statement that Nepal \\\"fully and strongly support [s] this effort [ibid].\n76.\tAt the international level the paramount need is for what we may describe as economic decolonization and for the democratization of the world's antiquated and inequitable economic structure. This is the new imperative of our time. The goal would be, in effect, a decentralization of economic power, as well as a fairer and more balanced pattern of consumption and distribution.\n77.\tThe time is past when developed countries could isolate themselves from the problems of the developing countries. That time is past. Like it or not, we all belong to one world, which cannot be half-rich and half-poor, or, to be more precise, one-third rich and two-thirds poor. The alleviation of poverty is a shared and collective obligation of the world community.\n78.\tSo is the liquidation of the remaining pockets of that older and more blatant form of colonialism: the physical subjugation of one people by another. Nowhere is this duty more pressing today than in southern Africa, where rampant oppression and racism have provoked violent uprisings threatening the peace of the entire region. The remnants of colonial tyranny and exploitation have absolutely no place in the new world order now being built.\n79.\tThrough the years, the Philippines has consistently and uncompromisingly supported the righteous cause of the African peoples. We helped write the provision on self-determination in the United Nations Charter in 1945, and have since then faithfully espoused the right of all colonial countries and peoples to independence. With the progress of decolonization elsewhere, our profound concern with the attainment of this major United Nations goal has increasingly focused on Africa.\n80.\tIn the case of southern Africa, the Philippines has scrupulously implemented United Nations decisions, including the application of economic sanctions, the severance of diplomatic and consular relations, and even the observance of sanctions in the field of sports. We dare say that few can match, let alone surpass, that record.\n81.\tIn this context, we welcome the determined ongoing efforts to find peaceful solutions, acceptable to all concerned, to the explosive confrontations in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and we earnestly and prayerfully hope that those efforts will succeed.\n82.\tCare should be taken, however, to ensure that the formulas offered for transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe, or Southern Rhodesia, should conform to the legitimate demands of the African people. Proposed solutions should not be dictated by expediency or solely by considerations for the balance of power. They should first and foremost be just solutions, consonant with the Charter and with the expressed desires and aspirations of the African people.\n83.\tIn the case of Namibia, the right of its people to self-determination and independence should be upheld. The Philippines joins in the demand for the withdrawal by South Africa from Namibia to enable its people to achieve freedom and independence in accordance with relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\n84.\tSouth Africa continues to be a symbol of the travesty of the principles of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By its continued repression of the black majority of South Africa, the white minority regime of that country stands condemned by world public opinion, and becomes subject to the provisions of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)], which came into force last July. Meanwhile, the struggle against apartheid through diplomatic, cultural, economic and other means should be steadfastly pursued.\n85.\tI wish to speak now about two aspects of terrorism, and first, about nuclear terrorism. There is all too little separating the zealot from the nuclear trigger. Adequate safeguards have not been made available to protect nuclear reprocessing plants and transportation facilities. Since nuclear secrets are no longer sEcrets, die danger of nuclear terrorism increases with each passing day. It is no longer a science-fiction scenario to foresee a city held hostage and a nation rendered impotent by the threat of a nuclear explosion.\n86.\tThe second aspect of terrorism-and this I want to emphasize and to refer to now-is the taking of innocent hostages, which has become widespread in the hijacking of airliners. Stringent international measures can undoubtedly be directed toward the protection of the innocent, in addition to those which now exist under the terms of The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, and the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, and through the elaboration of the Standards and Practices Governing Airport Security and Aircraft Safety recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The taking of innocent hostages is a heinous crime, and the Government of the Philippines, itself a victim of several aerial hijackings, will vigorously support the development of legal instruments and measures directed toward its inhibition and suppression. We now have before the Assembly the proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany [A/31/242].\n87.\tI turn now to the vital question of disarmament. We share the general concern over the lack of progress in disarmament. The situation has, in fact, been deteriorating, as the Foreign Minister of Singapore, Mr. S. Rajaratnam, reminded us the other day in his thoughtful and thought- provoking policy statement [10th meeting]. I suggest that that statement be reread by the members of the General Assembly.\n88.\tWe are deeply disturbed by the continuing upward trend in the production, stockpiling and proliferation of armaments and particularly of the means for the production of nuclear armaments. The years go by, but not one plane or missile is dismantled except because of old age, to be replaced by new and ever more destructive models; and although we grow accustomed to their presence, they pose an ever greater threat to the survival of mankind.\n89.\tThe world has become increasingly alarmed-and rightly so-about the spread of the means to produce nuclear weaponry. But the threat inherent in the continued \\\"horizontal proliferation\\\" of nuclear capacity is not as immediate as the continued \\\"vertical proliferation\\\" in the arms race among the nuclear Powers, Their failure to effect cutbacks in nuclear arms, or even cutbacks in ceilings for strategic nuclear systems, is a source of the gravest disappointment and alarm.\n90.\tThe wastage in resources that could otherwise be put to constructive uses is, indeed, staggering. As the Secretary- General has reminded us:\n\\\"Resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the 1976 gross national product of the entire world\\\". [A/31/I/Add. 1, sect. V].That is tragic, indeed.\n91.\tIt is time, certainly, for an act of high statesmanship which can break the vicious circle of action and reaction now spiraling towards catastrophe. An announcement, for instance, ending all nuclear tests and placing a moratorium on peaceful nuclear explosions could break the present deadlock and set in motion the processes of successful negotiations. The renunciation of the most deadly chemical weapons-nerve gases-could also lead to successful negotiations, as a similar initiative did in the case of biological weapons, which are now banned from national arsenals and destroyed.\n92.\tWhat, additionally, can the United Nations do? If a world disarmament conference cannot be held under appropriate United Nations auspices, the Philippines is prepared to support the proposal of the non-aligned group to hold a special session of the General Assembly in 1977, devoted to the problems of the arms race and disarmament.  This is the very least we can do during the so-called Disarmament Decade, now fast running out.\n93.\tThe instrumentalities which we employ to reach decisions and agreements, and to carry out and implement their terms, must be adequate to the task. When I noted on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  that it had proved remarkably adaptable, and its founders unusually prescient, I also pointed out that the Organization was not adequate in all respects to the new requirements confronting it.\n94.\tThis realization was shared by others, and we are gratified that a large majority of Members now agree that a review of the structure of the United Nations, of its Charter and of possible improvements in both is, as I stated during the twenty-fifth anniversary session, \\\"no longer deferrable\\\". We welcomed the establishment by the General Assembly at its; twenty-ninth session of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations to consider the observations of Governments on needed changes in the United Nations Charter, specific proposals for enhancing the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purposes, and any other suggestions for the more effective functioning of the United Nations, whether or not they would require amendments to the Charter [resolution 3349 (XXIX)].\n95.\tUpon the far-sighted initiative of the Government of Romania, this Committee has now become the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, and its membership has been increased a second time, to 47 [resolution 3499 (XXX)]. During its meetings this year, the Special Committee began its substantive work considering item by item the suggestions of members. Many valuable and innovative suggestions were made, and a number of members submitted working papers. We look forward to the renewal of the mandate of the Special Committee with very broad support, and to the continuation of its valuable work in the coming year.\n96.\tWe cannot, and will not, rest in this task until the United Nations is adequately equipped with the machinery and mechanisms it needs in the field of peace-keeping, the peaceful settlement of disputes, decision-making and the promotion and protection of human rights. Whatever the reasons for inaction on the part of its Members with regard to the major problems and tasks facing the United Nations, the excuse of the inadequacy of the world Organization must be removed once and for all by its improvement.\n97.\tWe have the responsibility to assure for present and future generations that the spaceship, earth, has an adequately instrumented guidance center to direct it through the trying, yet creative, days that lie before us. And what is that global guidance center, if not this United Nations?\n98.\tI should like to conclude this statement with a brief tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose term of office ends in December this year. He has done an outstanding job at an extremely difficult time in the life of the United Nations-a time, as I have noted, of disenchantment and even of antagonism towards the Organization, and a time, moreover, of portentous change, marking a far-reaching shift in emphasis from political confrontations between great Powers to an economic dialog between the rich and the poor nations which could shape the future of our world. As he has correctly observed:\n\\\"Although East-West problems persist in many fields, the North-South relationship is in one form or another increasingly the basic theme of our debates\\\". [A/31/ 1/Add.l, sect. II].\nWhile effectively practicing \\\"quiet diplomacy\\\"-he is a quiet man-to forestall violence in southern Africa, to maintain the precarious peace in Cyprus and in the Middle East, and to damp down dangerous tensions in other places, the Secretary-General has also performed invaluable service in facilitating die crucial dialog on the new international economic order. The key office of Secretary-General could not have been placed in better hands during this time of historic change and transition. In our estimation, Secretary-General Waldheim deserves to be highly commended for a difficult job well done.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my privilege today to appear before this Assembly, not merely as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka but also as die current Chairman of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries, which represent more than two and a half billion of the world's population and 86 nations. In accepting the chairmanship of the non-aligned movement, at die Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Colombo a few weeks ago, I have been conscious of the great responsibility which has been thus entrusted to me. I have, however, welcomed it as an opportunity for Sri Lanka to contribute what it can to the success of a movement which is fully committed to the high ideals of the United Nations.\n4.\tI take this opportunity on behalf of the non-aligned nations to welcome with great pleasure the membership of the Republic of Seychelles in the United Nations.\n5.\tWe meet in the shadow of the death of one of the giants of our time, Chairman Mao Tsetung, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his great contribution to the creation of modern China and to the world of ideas in the service of mankind.\n6.\tIt is not always that a head of Government addresses this Assembly with the Permanent Representative of her country in the Chair. It is also, I think unique for the Chairman of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries to present the views of the group before a President who is himself a national of a non-aligned country. I hope I will not be misunderstood if I consider this a happy development for the United Nations, because the non-aligned countries share a deep and abiding commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization.\n7.\tThe delegation of Sri Lanka derives justifiable satisfaction, Mr. President, from your election to this high office. I should like to express our sincere appreciation to all the nations represented here for the honor they have bestowed on you and, through you, on Sri Lanka. I congratulate you on being die recipient of this great trust. I express our confidence that, in carrying out your duties as President of this Assembly, you will maintain the very high standards set by your predecessors in this office, and amply fulfill our expectations through your impartiality, objectivity and understanding. You have our best wishes for your success, and may rely on our co-operation at all times.\n8.\tMr. Secretary-General, it is also a very pleasant task for me, on behalf of Sri Lanka and of the non-aligned nations, to express our appreciation of your dedication to the objectives and ideals of this Organization and your untiring efforts to bring it closer to its goal of a world at peace, based on harmony, mutual respect and trust among nations, and fruitful co-operation for the realization of a fuller life for all peoples.\n9.\tThe Colombo Declarations and resolutions, both political and economic, and the Action program for Economic Co-operation are already before you [A/311197]. We, the 86 nations in whose name I have the honor to present these decisions to you, look upon them as a testament of genuine international co-operation and collaboration, in place of the distrust and recrimination which have characterized international relations in past years. My remarks are therefore addressed principally to die developed nations, because all talk of co-operation would be meaningless if a significant part of the world's population did not understand or appreciate the objectives and motivations of the other.\n10.\tThe fundamental principles of non-alignment can be briefly stated. They are peaceful coexistence and the true independence of States, as distinct from formal sovereignty. The principles embodied in the Bandung Declaration  of 21 years ago and the criteria for membership in the movement \nadopted at Belgrade  15 years ago, are based on these two fundamental concepts.\n11.\tIn our perception, the, polarization of the world around two power centers, as was the case in the immediate post-war years and until very recently, was neither conducive to world peace and security nor beneficial, even for the national or regional interests of the countries which became parties to the military alliances of that period.\n12.\tThis view does not require any elaborate explanation today, as the parties to the alliances have themselves come to the realization that confrontation is futile and polarization invalid.\n13.\tDetente among the great Powers and between their alliance systems does not, however, meet the needs of the smaller and weaker nations as long as it perpetuates rivalry for spheres of influence, or condones manifestations of imperialism, colonialism and outside intervention in the internal affairs of States. It is even less attractive to us if it permits attempts at the domination of some countries by others and lends credence to concepts of balance of power or of unequal relations between States.\n14.\tSuch concepts strike at the sovereign equality of nations, large and small, which is the center and core of the Charter of this Organization. Nor can this detente mean anything at all to peoples suffering for decades, even centuries, under the heel of racism, which has defied all principles of basic human rights enshrined in the Charter.\n15.\tThese concepts and practices are the antithesis of true independence and justice which non-alignment emphasizes, and the movement's mission will not have been accomplished until these remnants of the old order are consigned to the dust-heap of history.\n16.\tIt is against this background of a firm rejection of the outmoded concepts of an ailing order that the Colombo documents can be best understood.\n17.\tThe decisions of the Fifth Conference are nothing but the application of the time-tested principles of non-alignment to the prevailing international situation and a call for remedies for the short-comings and glaring injustices we find in it.\n18.\tIn the nuances of presentation, some of the terminology of the non-aligned countries is certainly emotive, but I do not believe that this calls for any apology. It should not be difficult for this Assembly and the world in general to understand the emotions of a man whose humanity is denied, as under the racist regimes in southern Africa, or of a people deprived of its birthright by decisions imposed on it, as in the case of the Palestinians.\n19.\tI might add that the nations which have tended to resent what they consider intemperate phraseology in non-aligned declarations are the very nations that themselves indulged in the strongest appeals to the human emotions in their own recent histories. The fight against injustice cannot but be emotional, and it will help mutual understanding if this simple truth is remembered.\n20.\tSouthern Africa is one area where the circumstances fully justify resentment and impatience.\n21.\tThe peoples of Africa have many hard-won victories against imperialism and colonialism to their credit. Yet, they have to contend today not only with the outmoded, inhuman and abhorrent practices of apartheid and racism, but with threats to their newly-won independence and their territorial integrity in the form of aggression from the same sources which now challenge their dignity and their self-respect.\n22.\tResistance movements of the oppressed black peoples in South Africa and Rhodesia have now reached the stage of national uprisings. What the Colombo documents seek to convey is that the river of history cannot flow backwards and that the longer the racist regimes take to realize this, the more serious will be the consequences for peace on that continent and elsewhere.\n23.\tThe message from Colombo, as far as it concerns southern Africa, is also directed to the nations which are continuing to collaborate with those regimes, thereby giving them a false sense of security and a semblance of respectability to which they are not entitled.\n24.\tIn the particular case of Namibia, vital principles of non-alignment are involved. It is not only the independence of a country long denied its rights by a usurpation of power and illegal occupation that is at stake here. The rights of a people to self-determination and to the integrity of their territory are also at issue.\n25.\tAll initiatives towards a just solution of these problems are naturally welcome as long as they are genuinely designed to expedite the transition from obduracy to reason. At the same time, I should make it clear from this forum that if reason were to fail and the peoples of Africa were forced to resort to the ultimate solution through armed struggle, every non-aligned nation would stand solidly behind them.\n26.\tThe situation in the Middle East is also a matter of grave concern to the non-aligned. The validity of some of the most fundamental principles of the movement and our commitment to those principles are on trial in the Middle East. No country, even if it has powerful patrons, can today embark on a policy of expansion and alteration of the political, demographic and cultural character of a region or persist in a denial of the inalienable rights of a whole nation without incurring the denunciation and condemnation of human society.\n27.\tIf the non-aligned nations have acclaimed the victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea in their valiant struggles against the forces of reaction and intervention, it is because their success has been a vindication of the basic principles for which the non-aligned movement has fought for over two decades. The call of the non-aligned for assistance to those countries in their task of reconstructing their war-torn economies is, on the other hand, a plea for justice which it should not be difficult for this Assembly to understand. \n28.\tIn the case of Korea, that country remains one of the very few which have continued to pay the price of territorial and national fragmentation for a world war which ended three decades ago.\n29.\tThe aim of the non-aligned in regard to Korea is to create the necessary conditions for converting the present armistice into a permanent peace agreement, in order to accelerate the self-reliant and peaceful reunification of the country -and the withdrawal of foreign troops.\n30.\tIn Latin America, such essentials as self-determination, national sovereignty and territorial integrity are under serious threat. Leaders of non-aligned nations in that region have focused attention on the growing menace of destabilization of Governments and national institutions in that area through techniques of deliberate and organized attacks in the established media, the selective sale of arms and the exploitation of internal problems.\n31.\tThe devices used there by transnational corporations to perpetuate and consolidate their interests are too well known to need description. It is surely our duty as non-aligned nations to support the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Latin America and to express our solidarity with them in their pursuit of sovereign equality, true independence and peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.\n32.\tI came here to the United Nations five years ago  to present a proposal to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. With the support of a large number of non-aligned nations and many others, that proposal became a Declaration at the same session [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], and for five years the Members of this Organization and especially the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean are endeavored to realize the objectives of that Declaration through its early implementation.\n33.\tWe have made it clear on innumerable occasions that the aim of the zone of peace is the extension of non-alignment to a substantial area of the earth's surface with a view to its insulation against great-Power rivalry and conflict, and that, far from circumscribing the freedom of navigation of the high seas, the implementation of the Declaration would ensure the safety of international navigation.\n34.\tWith notable exceptions, the great Powers and major maritime users have treated this worth-while cause with indifference.\n35.\tDetente has been presented to the world as a constructive step towards the promotion of international security through the relaxation of tensions. This has, in fact, been instituted in Europe through the Helsinki agreements,  but the Mediterranean document of the Final Act of Helsinki has yet to be implemented. It is the view of the non-aligned nations that the security of Europe is inseparable from that of the rest of the world, and that genuine peace will not have a chance until this Is recognized.\n36.\tAs long as this detente is limited to Europe, we have reason to ask whether it could turn out to be mutual accommodation between the great Powers. If this were to happen, while it would spare their immediate regions the insecurity and instability of confrontation, it would shift the arena of their rivalries and conflicts to other areas, threatening the security and the peaceful development of the nations in those regions. A universal reduction of tensions based on the active participation of ail nations is the best guarantee of international peace and security.\n37.\tGeneral and complete disarmament has been a declared objective of the United Nations and of the international community for nearly three decades.\n38.\tDespite many initiatives taken by this Organization and by nations committed to the cause of disarmament, the world has witnessed not even the semblance of disarmament but a race for supremacy in destructive power, based on the myth that peace can be preserved only by strident and single-minded preparations for war and the refinement and sophistication of its techniques. It is, indeed, a sad reflection on the moral and intellectual standards of the twentieth century and of its values and priorities that so much of the world's resources, which might have been devoted to the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease and hunger, are being committed instead to the production of monstrous weapons which, we are earnestly assured from time to time, are never to be used in aggression. If all these weapons, on all sides, are defensive, where are the aggressors?\n39.\tThe non-aligned nations, which have consistently rejected the notion that world conflict is inevitable, have no stake in war. On the other hand, they do not accept the thesis that disarmament is the special preserve of Powers that possess the paraphernalia of war. Every nation and every individual has a right to peace, and just as peace is indivisible so is the responsibility for its preservation. Hence the call of the non-aligned nations for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and agreement for a world conference. \n40.\tAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement, the non-aligned and the United Nations are on the same side of the struggle for a better world order.\n41.\tAt the Colombo Conference, as at all previous meetings of the non-aligned, we have reaffirmed our adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we remain committed to the cause of strengthening its role in all aspects of international life.\n42.\tA primary requirement for the strengthening of the United Nations is the universality of its membership. We cannot but express dissatisfaction and dismay at the continued denial, by the use of the veto, to nations which are qualified in every way and have won the recognition of more than two thirds of the membership of this Organization, of the opportunity to share in its endeavors.\n43.\tThe veto was designed to place the primary responsibility for peace in the hands of a few nations which had the potential for waging war, at a time when more than half the present membership of this Organization was not even free. If it is to be used today, when the map of the world and the membership of this Organization have so dramatically changed, to thwart the wishes of the overwhelming majority of nations and peoples, then the time has surely come for a second look at this archaic instrument of privilege. This Organization cannot pay lip service to democratic principles and the sovereign equality of all nations, large and small, and continue to condone concepts and practices which make a mockery of those principles.\n44.\tOne of the important developments at the Fifth Conference at Colombo was the decision of the non-aligned countries to establish their own arrangements for a news agencies pool.\u00ae This is because of the importance w?, attach to giving our peoples access to news free from the attitudes, opinions and prejudices of journalists, however honest or objective they may want to be, who have been schooled and conditioned in an environment which is not only unsympathetic but also unsuited to the hopes, aspirations and preoccupations of the peoples of the developing countries.\n45.\tDuring the first 15 years of its existence, the non- aligned movement had of necessity to concern itself with immediate and pressing political issues-issues of freedom, equality, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Its record of achievement in the political sphere, as this Assembly knows, is substantial, although some of the evils it set out to banish still tenaciously linger on in some parts of the world. Our endeavors in the political field have, therefore to continue into the foreseeable future. However, with the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Lusaka in 1970 and, especially, since the Fourth Conference at Algiers three years ago, economic issues have also received the increasing attention of the movement.\n46.\tIt is widely recognized today that political achievement by itself would be fruitless and meaningless if it did not lead ultimately to tangible gains in the economic sphere. Theoretical freedom and equality and concepts cf sovereignty would, after all, mean nothing to a man if he were only free to starve and sovereign in his poverty.\n47.\tThis increasing emphasis on economic questions does not, however, mean that the non-aligned have accepted the view that political affairs should be left to nations which have the resources to match their political ambitions and that the developing countries should limit their initiatives to the task of their economic emancipation. The Economic Declaration, the Action program for Economic Cooperation and the economic resolutions adopted at Colombo are, therefore, also political.\n48.\tAs do the political decisions of the Fifth Conference, these, too, derive from the same commitment of the non-aligned to principles of equality and sovereignty and opposition to all forms of domination, intervention and unequal relations in the economic sphere. However, the non-aligned have advanced today from the mere exhortations of the past calling for assistance and concessions from the developed countries to devising systems of active co-operation among themselves as a basis for co-operation with developed nations.\n49.\tA constant thread running through all the economic documents of the Colombo Conference is the emphasis on collective self-reliance.\n50.\tI should make it clear that this approach is not one of hostility and confrontation towards any single country or group of countries. It has been the unfortunate experience of the developing countries, however, that, despite two decades of pious promises of partnership and interdependence, no real partnership has been possible; only that the strong have become stronger. Non-alignment has indeed always emphasized global co-operation, and this collective of self-reliance, too, can be global, given the sincerity and the will on the part of all nations to make independence a way of life in the next two decades of this century and thereafter.\n51.\tThe realities of our time demand that genuine cooperation must begin now. The decisions of the Fifth Conference signify* a determination to make that beginning, even if it be among the developing nations, as a first step.\n52.\tThere are indeed some areas in these documents which call for a more substantial contribution from the developed nations to the development efforts of the third world. These calls are made within the framework of co-operation between the developed and the developing countries so that real partnership between them for balanced progress is established as early as possible.\n53.\tHowever, aid whether it is bilateral or multilateral is not, and cannot be, a permanent solution to the world's economic problems. At best, it can only be a temporal palliative, reinforcing the self-reliant efforts of poorer nations for a better future for their own peoples, thereby enhancing their ability to co-operate with other peoples and nations in equality and self-respect.\n54.\tIt is not my intention to plead here that the developed nations owe a living to the developing. I do plead indeed, on the other hand, that all nations, regardless of their levels of development, owe it to themselves and to future generations not to throw away the opportunity available today to find timely solutions for the problems of mankind and to establish, through mutual understanding and constructive co-operation, a just and therefore enduring pattern of international relations. That opportunity would be lost if the developed nations were to look upon the proposals of the developing for genuine interdependence as the importunate clamor of the indigent who must be pacified with grudging concessions and charity.\n55.\tIt is imperative that the world look upon the particular and pressing problems of the least developed countries with greater understanding and treat the call for greater access to the markets of the developed world for the products of the industries of developing countries, and fair\nprices for their commodities, as an indispensable corollary\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nalso require that there should be a realistic appraisal of the steep and spiraling differentials between the prices of the commodity exports of the developing countries and the manufactured goods they import from the developed countries. It is in this context that the performance of the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTADJ in Nairobi this year and the current dialog in Paris  must be measured and evaluated.\n56.\tProposals for the establishment of a council of producers' associations of raw materials, the creation of a special fund for the financing of buffer stocks, contributions to the special fund on a basis of self-help, joint import procurement policies, increased trade exchanges among the developing countries, a countervailing currency backed by the economic potential of the developing countries, the establishment of a bank of the third world, the expansion of resource-based industries, the conclusion of long-term agreements on product specialization and the various other programs for co-operation among the developing countries-all these are a manifestation of the realization on die part of the non-aligned countries that the only guarantee of equal partnership for them with the developed nations lies in their increasing dependence on their own resources and their own efforts. All this has been endorsed at the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries only recently concluded in Mexico.\n57.\tIn all the institutions that either have been established or are proposed for establishment there is a common purpose. They must all ensure an increased flow of real resources to the developing countries. Those countries have accumulated ge external debts owing mainly to world economic circumstances beyond their own control rather than to any economic mismanagement on their part. It is urgent that decisive action be taken by the developed nations to solve this problem without further delay.\n58.\tThe attitude of the developed countries to the question of resource transfers is a great disappointment to die developing countries. Even a simple issue like the replenishment of International Development Association resources which by now should have been automatically resolved as become a subject for detailed and prolonged negotiation. That is a matter of grave consequence to the developing nations. The. developed countries should pledge a continuing and increased flow of resources to that agency.\n59.\tTo peoples which have no experience of real poverty or of the intensity of the suffering of its victims, the call of the non-aligned and other developing nations for a greater awareness of their problems and an acceptance of collective responsibility for their solution might sometimes sound peremptory or strident.\n60.\tIt is true that some of the declarations and decisions of the non-aligned in the sphere of economic relations appear militant and, at times, challenging. They are in fact intended to be a challenge, not to the welfare or the prosperity of the developed nations, but to the conscience and the claim of the world to a commitment to justice and equity. Their intent and substance emphasize international co-operation of a level which has not been envisaged before. It would be easy enough to understand their tone if it was realized that this is nearly two thirds of humanity putting into words its fears and frustrations, not merely over recent decades but through centuries.\n61.\tBefore the peoples of the developed world wring their hands in exasperation at what they consider the incessant and insatiable clamor of those in die developing countries, I would wish that they first consider the justice of the current economic order which has enabled diem over the last three or four centuries to reach their present heights of achievement and affluence, at the same time condemning millions in Asia, Africa and Latin America to a life of dire poverty and hopelessness.\n62.\tWhat is the justice of an economic order in which nearly half the labor force of the developing countries are almost permanently unemployed, while the developed nations panic when a mere 7 to 10 per cent of theirs are seasonally out of work?\n63.\tIs it reasonable to expect 1 billion of the world's peoples, more than one fourth of humanity, to find sustenance on an annual per capita income of a little over $100, while those in the developed world are discontented with $3,000 per annum?\n64.\tIs there any moral or rational justification for the present distribution of the world's wealth, which would condemn 500 million people-one eighth of the world's population to a life of daily starvation and serious malnutrition?\n65.\tIs the world so insensitive that it would accept with nonchalance the fact that nearly half that number are children whose mental and physical development would be doomed to permanent retardation as a consequence of that poverty?\n66.\tIs our collective conscience so impervious to tragedy that we would allow 10,000 men, women and children in the developing nations to die of starvation every day?\n67.\tIs it possible to expect the developing nations, in all honesty, to divert their limited resources to what is extolled as development, and to objective priorities, sacrificing generations to such a fate?\n68.\tIs it fair to criticize developing nations which give priority to those questions of life and death, through their social welfare expenditures, for neglecting textbook prescriptions for so-called development?\n69.\tThe problems to which I have drawn attention are not the product of a vivid imagination; nor are the solutions offered by the non-aligned nations an exercise in detached dialectics or arid philosophical speculation. What I have said here today is based on direct national experience and from personal involvement in the political, social and economic trials, as well as the achievements, of a small nation through nearly two decades.\n70.\tThe accounts for more than 50 per cent of Sri Lanka's\nexport earnings. We have increased our production of tea Digitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nand systematically improved its equality over the years, and in the 14 years since 1962 we have watched its real price, the terms of the prices we pay for our imports, plummet by more than 70 per cent. That represents a loss for Sri Lanka today of $500 million per annum, which, expressed in our national currency, amounts roughly to 6 billion rupees. That is almost the entire budget of my country for one whole year. How long and how far can modem human society, even parts of it, expect to prosper or even survive with such an economic system?\n71.\tIn the 28 years since we attained independence, we have listened to expert advice and diligently applied ourselves to the diversification of our economy. We went into export-oriented industries which were considered appropriate for our levels of technology and our resources. As soon as our manufactures were ready, so were barriers against them in many of the developed countries.\n72.\tThere is, on the other hand, a pleasant side to this picture. When my country attained independence 28 years ago,, it had been a colony of three foreign Powers, in turn, over more than four centuries. With independence, we inherited a society which was divided against itself between a small ruling elite and the masses who had nothing in common with their rulers, except their shared nationality.\n73.\tThe party I represent was in power twice before from 1956 to 1959 and again from 1960 to 1965. During those eight years we were able to remedy the more glaring discrepancies between a colonial society and an independent, self-respecting nation.\n74.\tSince we were elected to power again in 1970, with a popular mandate for fundamental change, we have been largely successful in implementing a policy of social and economic transformation under a constitution committed to the establishment of a socialist democracy.\n75.\tIn the last six years we devoted our attention largely to the establishment of a more just social and economic order within the country, through a more equitable sharing of the nation's wealth. With a ceiling on land ownership, we have redistributed arable land to ensure greater equity and productivity. A ceiling on ownership of houses has brought good housing within the reach of many and freed them from exploitation by landlords. I might add that both of these reforms were carried out on the basis of reasonable compensation to previous owners.\n76.\tWe have had notable successes in income redistribution which have won international acclaim. Li the last 10 years, the share of the national income of the lowest 40 per cent of the population of the country registered an increase of from 13.7 to 19.3 per cent, and the share of the richest 10 per cent fell from 37 to 28 per cent. That was achieved through direct taxation, on the one hand, and food subsidies and other benefits to the non-taxable sector, on the other.\n77.\tDeveloping countries with serious economic problems have often been blamed for their predicament because of the rate of this population growth. In Sri Lanka we have succeeded in reducing that rate from 2.8 per cent in the early 1960s to 1.6 per cent in the last two years.\n78.\tWe have taken measures of nationalization-again, with due compensation-in some areas of economic activity where overriding national interest demanded it. I should emphasize, however, that we do not look upon nationalization c: an end in itself, because in our conception of co-operation for development there is an important role for private foreign and domestic investment.\n79.\tWe have had considerable success in involving the people directly in the planning and execution of development projects, through the decentralization of the national budget and the establishment of divisional development councils in which the administrative officials, the elected representatives and the people themselves participate.\n'80. We have long and rewarding experience of co-operation on a nation-wide scale through multipurpose co-operative societies and we have seen the flowering of rural enterprise and inventiveness through the extension of the co-operative principle to farming and to small- and medium-scale rural industry.\n81.\tI might add, without wanting or appearing to be presumptuous, that some of our achievements in the sphere of reducing inequality and giving the people a direct say and a stake in the development process have earned recognition among many countries, and we believe that what has been proved possible on a national scale can be achieved on an international scale as well.\n82.\tOur experience in Sri Lanka is relevant to other developing countries, particularly in the non-aligned world only because the peasants and workers in all our countries have a shared experience of deprivation, toil and poverty from which they seek emancipation for a better life. For solidarity among the non-aligned is not only the solidarity of our Heads of State or Government, but of our peoples on whose behalf all our efforts are directed.\n83.\tI referred to our national experience for another reason. The choice of non-alignment as a way of international life by the 86 nations representing almost two thirds of the membership of this Assembly has been conditioned both by their national experience and by their conception of not only what is possible but also what is indispensable for the conduct of human relations on a basis of equality, dignity and mutual respect. Our policies and programs, however, cannot succeed in a vacuum of mutual ignorance between the developed and the developing or in an atmosphere poisoned by misunderstanding and distrust.\n84.\tNon-alignment is the deliberate choice of a large number of nations not to be drawn into the policies of confrontation implicit in the system of hostile military alliances of the post-war era. It was for that reason a refusal to contribute to a division of the world into camps, hardening suspicion and distrust into morbid fear, consuming conflict and, eventually, a war of mutual annihilation. To the extent that nearly two thirds of the membership of this Assembly has opted for non-alignment, nearly two thirds of the world has been insulated from the waste and futility of confrontation.\n85.\tA movementwlHahmasfoundbd on a refusal to contribute to a system of antaognistic blocs, cannot itself become a bloc. I have said this before, but it will bear repetition as there are still some nations which look upon non-alignment as a new alignment, a new bloc, even a new threat. The world should not be victim to this fear and distrust of a movement which came into being as a creative alternative to mutual suspicion, recrimination and hate.\n86.\tFar from leading to the formation of a new bloc, the policy of non-alignment attaches primary importance to the freedom of each nation to choose its policies and to decide on its actions without the inhibition and the inflexibility of alignments. I would like to declare unequivocally that, with such an emphasis on freedom, the non-aligned movement cannot and will not allow itself to become an instrument of propaganda for any ideology, system or camp. It is crucial that the world understands this because genuine co-operation can flourish only in an atmosphere of right understanding.\n87.\tNon-alignment is not and was never intended to be, as has been mistakenly thought in some quarters, a neutrality as between ideologies or systems, in the domestic policies of member nations.\n88.\tThis is reflected in the diversity of the patterns of political, social and economic organization adopted by individual members of this movement, each to suit its particular circumstance. The crux of non-alignment is that member nations do not circumscribe their foreign policy options by alignment with any camp or become parties to military alliances and pacts within the framework of power rivalry.\n89.\tNon-alignment was designed as a bridge across the chasm of misunderstanding, suspicion, hostility and confrontation of an artificially divided world.\n90.\tThe basis of its continuation today and its growing appeal is its emphasis on cooperation between nations of different social, political and economic systems, regardless of their size, power or influence. On behalf of the non-aligned, I would like to assure the world that we remain committed to this goal of co-operation.\n91.\tI have attempted in the course of my statement to place the decisions of the Colombo Conference in perspective by explaining the motivations, methods a</d objectives of the non-aligned movement.\n92.\tThe unity which found expression and reaffirmation at Colombo confounded many critics who had expected the movement to flounder in disunity and even break up in disarray. Divergence of opinion is of course natural, and indeed no one in the non-aligned movement expects that 86 nations should think, speak and.act alike on every issue. That would neither be truthful nor in keeping with the perfect independence of thought and response which the movement has always emphasized. But it gives me great pleasure to declare that there was complete unity and unanimity on every fundamental principle which has concerned the movement as a whole.\n93.\tThat unity will continue undiminished in the years to come. After all, it cannot be for nothing that even countries which have been parties to military pacts and alliances in the past are today interested in joining the movement. Regardless of all claims to the contrary, those countries acknowledge the strength of the movement and its potential for productive change in the global pattern of political, social and economic relations.\n94.\tWe have made substantial progress in the last two decades in our united search for solutions to the world's most pressing problems. We view the Fifth Conference as an important stage in our progress towards peace and justice.\n95.\tWe have faith in our potential and our eventual success in establishing a world order of genuine peace, equity and justice, not so much because of the material power we wield but more because of the reasonableness of our proposals.\n96.\tWe cannot, of course, offer eyes to those who would not see, ears to those who refuse to listen, or hearts to those who have chosen not to feel. But everywhere we see the stirrings of a new world, the beginnings of a new revolution of consciousness, awareness and reason, especially among the youth.\n97.\tThere are statesmen and ordinary men and women in all parts of the world, developed and developing, who have the perception and the sensitivity to recognize the new challenges of our time and the new opportunities they present, and are capable of responding to them, creatively and constructively. In their perception of the world, there is no need for confrontation. It is the sensitive, the perceptive, the humane and the responsive who will fashion the new world and inherit it.\n98.\tToday a laissez-faire approach would be irrelevant and out of date. So are concepts of well-being based on the gross national product. Happiness and well-being cannot be measured solely by the yard-sticks to which we have so far been accustomed. In human terms, the face of a smiling child, the look of fulfillment and purpose in the eyes of a man who has not been condemned to idleness, and the repose of a mother freed from fear and uncertainty about her family's next meal, are better indicators.\n99.\tIt has been fashionable to speak and write in terms of three separate worlds on this earth  first world, a second world, and a third world with connotations of comparative accomplishment, as if the human family can be so parceled out into segments, huddled behind defensive barriers, in a state of perpetual confrontation against one another.\n100.\tSuch a view of the world would belie the very civilization of our time when man is more aware than ever before of the unity of his destiny. It is one world which we all inherited and it is in this one world that we have to build our hopes and realize our dreams, or, if we choose wrongly, face our collective failure.\n101.\tFor man, who has displayed so much ingenuity and brilliance in weaving an intricate fabric of technological and scientific achievement in so short a time in terms of his evolution, it should not be so difficult to respond to the call of humanity and justice.\n102.\tI am confident that at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly we shall be equal to that call and demonstrate in the coming years, the courage, the will and the vision it demands.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the current, thirty-first, session of the General Assembly. We greet you as a representative of a country linked with Poland by relations of long-standing co-operation.\n34.\tConsiderable work was done by the previous, thirtieth, session of the General Assembly presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn.\n35.\tWe are happy to welcome in our midst the Republic of Seychelles as a new Member of the United Nations.\n36.\tWe favor the prompt admission to the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which has paid dearly for its right to independent existence. This\nState satisfies all the requirements for membership set out in the Charter and should take its rightful place in the United Nations family.\n37.\tWe also support the admission of the People's Republic of Angola to membership in our Organization.\n38.\tSince the thirtieth session of the General Assembly further progress has been made in restructuring inter-national relations on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems. Poland, together with other States of our socialist community, is taking an active part in consolidating that positive trend through the expansion of bilateral relations, constructive participation in the work of the United Nations and other multilateral efforts aimed at the strengthening of international security, the ending of the aims race, the making of progress in disarmament, the removal of centers of tension and the expansion of all-round international co-operation. Such a policy is in conformity with the vital interests of our people as well as those of all the States and peoples of the world.\n39.\tWe attach great importance to the continuation of the Soviet-American dialog, the results of which are of great significance for the maintenance of world peace. Particularly important in this latter respect are the talks on strategic arms limitation.\n40.\tThere is an ever-growing conviction that situations of conflict in the world of today have to be solved through negotiations. It is through discussions and negotiations, and not through increasing tensions in international relations, that we should seek solutions for the pressing problems of the modern world.\n41.\tThe network of agreements on bilateral and multi-lateral co-operation among States with different social systems is being expanded, thus forming a lasting foundation for peace. The climate of relations has improved, and there is growing understanding of the vital need to respect the interests of all parties.\n42.\tOn the European continent a start has been made on the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe signed by the leaders of 35 States of Europe, the United States and Canada in Helsinki on 1 August 1975. The 10 principles of inter-State relations embodied in the Final Act of that Conference are being consolidated to serve as a foundation of international relations. They are reflected in numerous agreements and statements covering different fields of international endeavor. They have also been reaffirmed in bilateral documents agreed to by Poland with France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal and other countries.\n43.\tThe practice is taking shape of holding regular political consultations pertaining to bilateral relations as well as to matters of a regional and global nature. This is illustrated by numerous meetings at the highest level.\n44.\tAn important contribution to the easing of tensions in Europe has been made by the agreements concluded between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany during the recent visit to Bonn of Edward Gierek, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. Originating in the Treaty of 1970,  the agreements have opened up a new phase in co-operation between the two countries.\n45.\tWe are witnessing a marked expansion of Poland's relations with the Nordic countries, as is shown, inter alia, by the very recent talks of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Poland and Iceland in Reykjavik. We evaluate highly the state of our relations with Finland, Denmark and Norway. We also count on the further expansion of Poland's traditionally fruitful co-operation with Sweden, our partner and neighbor across the Baltic.\n46.\tThe recommendations of the Helsinki Conference are gradually being carried out in different fields of inter-national co-operation. Confidence-building measures, as recommended in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, are taking practical shape.\n47.\tFull implementation of the Final Act ought to be the paramount and long-term objective of all its signatories. The results of the Conference have created a climate conducive to the adoption of all-European initiatives, furthering the continuation of the venture initiated in Helsinki. Of special importance is the Soviet initiative to convene all-European congresses devoted to such matters as the protection of the environment, transport and energy. This, initiative harmoniously combines the strengthening of the climate of political co-operation with the solution of economic problems which are important for all European States and with the expansion of broad scientific contacts.\n48.\tThe socialist States have put forward a proposal designed to provide a solid basis for co-operation between the two big economic groupings of Europe and the respective members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance [CMEA] and the European Economic Community. We hope that, in accordance with that proposal, it will prove possible to begin business-like discussions and without undue delay conclude a relevant agreement. Also, co-operation in the field of culture and education is becoming ever broader in scope.\n49.\tAt the same time, bilateral relations, including those in the economic field, have become wider ranging and richer in content. Trade exchanges have increased. Of growing importance are agreements on co-operation in industry, which, following the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, are becoming a significant stabilizing factor in economic relations. A notable role is played by agreements on scientific and technological co-operation. Yet, in order fully to ensure long-term and lasting foundations for the development of economic relations, there is a need to eliminate, wherever they still exist, limitations and barriers in international trade and to create further conditions for a growth of trade turnovers beneficial to all States.\n50.\tAs one of the signatories of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, Poland is determined to implement its\n3 Treaty on the Bases for the Normalization of Relations, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970.\nprovisions consistently, and counts on a similar approach on the part of its partners.\n51.\tThere are reasons to believe that the Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe will produce results which will take into account the security interests of the States concerned. Poland stands ready to take further joint action towards the prompt conclusion of an appropriate agreement.\n52.\tWe strongly believe, therefore, that we are fully justified in assuming that an historic break-through has taken place in relations among the States of Europe. There are realistic chances that these positive trends will embrace all the regions of the world.\n53.\tWe have studied with close attention the decisions of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.  .We are particularly appreciative of the appeal of the Colombo Conference for \\\"the global relaxation of international tension and for the participation of all countries on an equal basis in the solution of international problems\\\" [See AI31I197, annex I, para. 25].\nBy the same token, the strengthening of detente, and its extension, in all spheres of international relations, to all regions of the world, is in the interest of all States. Consequently, all States must adopt an active stance and be willing to come half way in considering different initiatives for strengthening peace and intensifying co-operation; they must regard the world as an organic community of the destinies of all mankind.\n54.\tThe progress of detente in the world is not automatic. It does not depend on objective conditions alone, but also on specific political actions by the forces which are jointly shaping international relations.\n55.\tIt is with concern that we are following the actions of those who ate bent on reversing the course of history. In an attempt to increase tensions and step up the arms race, they are trying to undermine the process of detente, building up armaments, keeping tensions and conflicts alive, resorting to acts of aggression, discrimination, economic exploitation and interference in the internal affairs of States which are instituting progressive reforms. These circles and their objectives are served, inter alia, by a widely expanded apparatus of Subversive propaganda, such as the so-called \\\"Radio Free Europe\\\" or \\\"Radio Liberty\\\". Their activity, representing as it does a flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of States, is contrary to the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation and universally accepted rules of international relations.\n55. Developments in the Middle East, including the tragedy of Lebanon, pose A direct threat to peace. The only effective way to settle the problem is by the return to the Arab countries of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 and by a comprehensive political settlement which would take due account of the interests and rights of all States and\npeoples of tho reason, including Israel, as well as the right of the Palestinian people to its own statehood.\n57.\tThe removal of dangerous tensions in Cyprus calls for the safeguarding of the independence and territorial integrity of the island and for solutions in conformity with United Nations resolutions.\n58.\tWe lend our support to the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to secure a peaceful and democratic unification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula.\n59.\tThe time has come, in keeping with United Nations resolutions, finally to put an end to the racist regimes in Namibia, Rhodesia and South Africa. The struggle of the people of Zimbabwe and Namibia for independence, the question of the liquidation of all the remnants of colonialism and the elimination of apartheid require the resolute support of the entire international community. The ration-ale of historical justice makes it compelling that the inalienable rights of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe to their sovereign statehood be secured unconditionally and without delay.\n60.\tThe persecution of Chilean patriots by the Fascist regime gives rise to the strongest condemnation. We demand the immediate termination of terror and violence, which extend also beyond the frontiers of Chile.\n61.\tThreats to the peaceful future of nations originate from lack of respect for the principles of peaceful coexistence. Violation of these principles leads to international conflicts. Poland, together with other socialist States and all the forces of peace, will act with perseverance for the removal of such threats, for the further improvement of the political climate and the creation of conditions favoring lasting security and co-operation among nations.\n62.\tThis determination to work consistently towards detente has found its expression in the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party and in the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as in the documents of the Congresses of other communist and workers' parties of the socialist States.\n63.\tThere is every indication that among the important and urgent tasks of our Organization which first and foremost should attract our efforts is the question of eliminating the threat or use of force in international relations, ending the arms race and entering upon the road of disarmament.\n64.\tThe prohibition of the use of force has been embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, Li numerous bilateral and multilateral international documents and in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The practice of international relations reveals, however, that further collective efforts are necessary to turn this principle into a universally binding and practically applicable rule of international law. All this in fact concerns the focal problem of our times: that of war and peace.\ncontinuing faster than ever and becoming more and more dangerous. It is imperative that the pace of disarmament efforts be harmonized with that of the processes of detente. Without concrete progress in the task of disarmament, the process of positive political transformation in the world may become inhibited or. even suppressed. This cannot be allowed.\n66.\tWe welcome the elaboration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament of a draft of an important convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques [see A/31/27, annex I]. This draft convention amply testifies to the existing feasibility of achieving progress in the field of disarmament. It also confirms the fact that the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which through its painstaking efforts has already brought about the conclusion of several important agreements, remains a valuable negotiating forum.\n67.\tWe have welcomed the Soviet-American Treaty of 28 May 1976 on limitation of underground nuclear expositions for peaceful purposes. We hope that this Treaty will bring closer the prospect for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and will help in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy for the benefit of man.\n68.\tI should wish to draw the Assembly's special attention to the proposal concerning the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons [see AI31/27] as a most outstanding and far-sighted initiative. It is certainly by far easier to prevent the introduction of new weapons than to remove them from the already existing stockpiles. Here, too, negotiations can and should be accelerated. Hence, and taking into account the great significance of the problem for the international community, we propose that the General Assembly should call upon the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament iii Geneva to intensify the efforts already initiated with this end in view.\n69.\tWe wish to advance an analogous idea with regard to negotiations concerning the complete elimination of chemical weapons. Poland, as is known, was one of the authors of the draft convention on the matter. Speeding up work on the convention is a vital imperative.\n70. We reaffirm in full our support for the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States and declare ourselves in favor of initiating without delay concrete preparatory work to this end. Previous sessions of the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions also supporting other disarmament proposals. The time is ripe to give the ideas contained in them the tangible form of international agreements.\n65. Putting an end to the arms race is the concern of 5 Sec Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-sixth peoples and the responsibility of Governments. The race is Session, Annexes, agenda item 97, document A/8491.\n71. We have often called attention in this forum to the inseparable relationship between strengthening detente and progress in disarmament, on the one hand, and the acceleration of the socio-economic development of all countries, on the other.\n72.\tIt is correctly assumed that in the world of today war and hunger are the most dangerous enemies of mankind. Peace, as the only foundation of development, is the sine qua non for their elimination.\n73.\tBy strengthening peace and security and consolidating the processes of detente, the international community is building a political infrastructure for the establishment of a new and just division of labor in the world economy.\n74.\tWhat is involved here is the creation of conditions making it possible to implement all progressive and legitimate recommendations of recent important international conferences, particularly the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and the fourth session of UNCTAD. In performing the tasks stemming therefrom, we shall thus be reinforcing the material basis of peaceful coexistence and strengthening international security.\n75.\tAll interested States should participate in solving problems arising along the path towards the establishment of the new international economic order in the world economy. The solutions to be adopted have to take due account of the differences in their socio-economic systems as well as in the levels of their economic development. They ought to include the main flows of international economic relations and areas in those relations pertaining both to the developing countries and to east-west co-operation.\n76.\tWithin the United Nations system, Poland participates in the formulation of new principles and mechanisms to govern international economic relations. Allow me at this juncture to recall the significance of the resolution on the examination of long-term trends in the economic development of the regions of the world /resolution 3508 (XXX)], adopted on Poland's initiative at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We trust that the studies in question will reveal the growing interrelationships in the development of individual regions as well as new vistas for the acceleration and expansion of economic co-operation among all States.\n77.\tThe growing economic potential of Poland and of other members of CMEA favors the expansion of all-round international economic co-operation. This should develop ever more harmoniously, since any disruptions resulting from world market fluctuations and other impediments adversely affect the economic situation of individual countries. Therefore, Poland is vitally interested in the further stabilization of conditions for economic co-operation. Long-term agreements on economic, scientific and technological collaboration represent a valuable instrument in this regard.\n78.\tMy country attaches substantial importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Indeed, its success depends on a readiness to seek compromise solutions which would take proper account of the interests of all States and groups of States in such basic matters as the exploitation of the sea-bed, the status of the economic zone, fishing, and scientific research.\n79.\tThe issues of the contemporary world cannot be solved without creatively tackling questions of social progress and acute social problems, and especially without adopting measures to satisfy elementary human needs. That is why Poland has put forward an initiative in the International Labor Organization for the elaboration of an international convention on the universal right to work.\n80.\tOne of the important premises for the socio-economic progress of each country is that of cultural values which therefore, too, require special protection. As is known, Poland has made a proposal that this important topic be taken up by the United Nations.  We welcome with appreciation the report on the subject submitted by the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [A/31/111], in accordance with resolution 3148 (XXVIII), concerning the initiation of a program of studies in that field. We wish to propose that at the present session the General Assembly adopt a resolution recommending continuation of the studies.\n81.\tIt is not progress alone but the peaceful future of our globe as well that depends upon the upbringing of young generations. The importance of this question was eloquently stressed two years ago from this very rostrum by Edward Gierek, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.  This idea should never escape the attention of the United Nations.\n82.\tDetente calls for persistent efforts by all States Members of our Organization. More concerted action is necessary to achieve its further progress. The first and foremost requirement is respect for the principles of peaceful co-operation between States and a renunciation of all action from a position of strength. This is, in fact, indispensable for equitable international co-operation and the progress of mankind.\n83.\tThe decisions that we are bound to take at the thirty-first session should contribute to the acceleration of the processes of detente in the world and to turning them into durable and universal phenomena. In the new international situation, circumstances are becoming more and more propitious for the United Nations to play its constructive and increasing role. But at the same time the Organization's tasks and responsibilities grow in scope.\n84.\tHence there is a need for a greater effectiveness of the Organization. May we again point out that the strengthening of the functioning of the United Nations does not lie in the revision of the Charter but in a fuller utilization of its provisions, especially with regard to actions for the consolidation of world peace and the establishment of more equitable economic relations and co-operation in the social area.\n85.\tWhile on the subject of the role of the United Nations, I cannot fail to express our appreciative recognition of the activity of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, who spares neither diligence nor devotion in implementing the tasks of the Organization.\n86.\tI wish to reiterate our assurance that Poland will continue its steadfast support for all the efforts of the United Nations, in consistency with its statutory purposes and principles.\n"

        "file_text": "Since he assumed the post of Foreign Minister of Algeria, this is the first time that Mr. Bouteflika has been unable personally to take part in the general debate of the General Assembly. Of course, there were such compelling reasons for this, that Mr. Bouteflika had to break with the tradition that he had always valued extremely highly. Algeria, as representatives are aware, is now involved in an extremely active stage of the political reorganization and establishment of its State institutions. Just a few months ago a new national charter was adopted by the Algerian people; a draft Constitution is now being prepared; and Mr. Bouteflika has highly important responsibilities in the work and discussions made necessary by those preparations. Those are the reasons why Mr. Bouteflika has asked me to be his spokesman here and to express to the President and representatives his regrets for not having been able, as he would have liked, to address the Assembly himself. Consequently, he has asked me to read for him {he text of the statement he had prepared. I shall do my best to carry out that delicate task.\n153.\tI have many reasons for satisfaction at Mr. Amerasinghe's elevation to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. My feelings of personal friendship towards him are one reason, as is the fact that he represents a country linked to mine by so many common concerns and common concepts in our international outlook. But my satisfaction and that of my delegation is based, above all, on our conviction that the abilities he has already so often demonstrated are of themselves a guarantee of the success of the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.\n154.\tMr. Gaston Thorn, his predecessor in this important office, without doubt has earned our gratitude for the way in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirtieth session. The talents he displayed-though, of course, not a surprise to us-have won him our admiration, to which I should like to add an expression of my own personal friendship.\n155.\tThe discreet and silent presence of our Secretary- General on this podium clearly belies the always active, often stimulating and sometimes decisive role which he has played for five years at the head of our Organization. We have all appreciated his tireless efforts to perform a task which at. times has almost been impossible, efforts to ensure that the United Nations enjoys influence and prestige worthy of its mission in the world today. I should like to take this opportunity to extend to him our gratitude and thanks.\n156.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express once again to the representatives of the People's Republic of China our sympathy and most sincere condolences on the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung. His loss has been felt not only by the Chinese people; he is mourned also by all those who have found in the example, wisdom and teachings of Chairman Mao the courage, perseverance and faith to wage their own struggles for a future of justice and dignity. No tribute could be adequate for someone who will remain a giant of our time and whose memory will, I am sure, long illuminate the evolution of our time.\n157.\tI would not wish to continue my statement without first of all extending the warm congratulations of my delegation to the young Republic of Seychelles, which has just become a new Member of the United Nations. To that young African State which has just acceded to independence we wish every success, happiness and prosperity.\n158.\tWe should have liked also to welcome in the same way the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola, to which no one should deny the obvious right of membership in our Organization. The Security Council has, however, not been able to recommend their applications on account of the use of the veto against their admission by the United States of America. As we .did last year, we deplore what we deem to be the abusive and irregular use by a permanent member of the Security Council of a privilege which is itself already difficult to accept. That privilege becomes quite inadmissible when it is used to serve considerations which have absolutely no connexion with international! peace and security.\n159.\tEach session is for us an occasion to look back briefly over the past year, to take stock of the problems that are in the forefront of our concerns and to suggest the ways and means which may lead to their solution. A superficial analysis of the international panorama, as with a review of the agenda of this session, could lead us to believe that today we are faced, as we were yesterday, with the same difficulties, which our efforts seemed powerless to overcome. With regard to most of them, the positions that have been described during the general debate have not adduced any radical change from those positions with which we are already familiar, and they do not give the impression that we are moving towards a solution.\n160.\tOn Lie basis of that observation we might easily allow ourselves to slip into facile pessimism, explaining our past failures and apologizing for our future weaknesses. However, fortunately the situation is quite different and, without trying to provoke any undue optimism, it does nevertheless allow us to see an evolution in thinking and in behavior which can only be seen after a global appreciation of the movement of those past years.\n161.\tIndeed it would appear that we have passed an important phase since the calling into question of the structures of the international community by a third world which is obviously much more aware of its rights, more able to define its aspirations and more skillful in defending its interests. The crisis which was fermenting through the imbalances and the injustices of a world order built up by the major Powers in order to serve and conserve their supremacy  as a surprise only to those who wished to ignore the transformations-slow, perhaps, but far-reaching of international society following the Second World War, or to those who felt secure in the complacency of a fictitious security or those who were too sure of their prosperity to be concerned by their environment.\n162.\tThe last sessions of the General Assembly were marked by the appearance of that new phenomenon which, chipping away some of the old certainties, sometimes gave to our debates the character of a confrontation whose real significance was not always clearly perceived by all. In point of fact we have lived through a period of transition and adaptation which has replaced the former pattern of international relations by a system which takes more account of the preoccupations of all and which gives a more reasonable, if not a more equitable, share to everyone in the settlement of our common affairs. I should like to recall, without dwelling on them, the controversies arising from the spectacular revelation of a new majority in the taking of our decisions. I should also like to remind members of the resistance that was met by our concept of the new international economic order. >\n163.\tThat shock was perhaps necessary in order to awaken consciences and to highlight the true priorities which face us. The acceptance, even the unwilling acceptance, of that new order of affairs is the first condition for a better understanding in relations among members of international society. The discussions at this session undeniably testify to such an evolution, which allows us to believe that perhaps we are using the same language in speaking of the same problems. That, however, does not mean that we have found an end to our concerns or that our misgivings have vanished. The problems are still there, as a challenge to our will, to our wisdom and to our intelligence. But once we cease to try to hide the true facts or to shirk our responsibilities, there can be joint efforts, rather than a stalemate, in the search for solutions.\n164.\tThe credit for this change must to a very large extent be attributed to the movement of non-aligned countries, which simultaneously crystallized the collective awareness of developing countries and led the industrialized world progressively to take account of the new requirements and demands of international life. The pursuit of that dual aim is perfectly well illustrated by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers, which produced a precise definition of the common objectives of the non-aligned countries, and also by the Fifth Conference which recently took place in Colombo, and which traced the major lines for a co-operation that would bring together the developed and the developing partners in the building of a new world order. The decisions adopted in Colombo [see A/311197] demonstrate the willingness of the countries of the third world to participate in constructive action based on the broadest understanding of the painful necessities of an adaptation to the constraints of a new world that is sometimes difficult. In any case, they give the lie to the allegations of those who incorrigibly persisted in seeing in our steps only the characteristics of an aggressiveness to be combated with the blindest obstinacy.\n165.\tThe maintenance of this situation and the pursuit of a fruitful dialog between partners equally interested in going beyond the present-day difficulties demand scrupulous respect for the new rules of the international game, as mutual confidence can be based only on everyone displaying goodwill in the defense of his own positions and in his appreciation of the interests of others.\n166.\tWe have already had the opportunity of expressing our satisfaction at the progress achieved in the relations among major Powers. We would have been even more gratified if the relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had followed the same trend towards normalization and detente, not only for a better international equilibrium but also because of the sincere friendship we have for these two great countries and their peoples.\n167.\tThe many delegations which praised the results of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe could not, however, be unaware of the fact that the policy of detente will be meaningless if it remains limited in geographical application and in scope. Peaceful relations among major Powers ere certainly an essential precondition for international peace and security; they do not, however, suffice to guarantee them unless they are supplemented by peaceful relations between the major Powers and the under-developed world.\n168.\tThis presupposes first of all an end to interference in the internal affairs of our countries, an end to using our countries for strategic purposes in which our national interests count for very little. I should like everyone to share our indignation at interferences aimed at provoking or encouraging internal disorders in certain countries of the third world or at overthrowing their Governments or their regimes. This short-sighted policy obviously does not lead to the establishment of a climate of confidence necessary for any genuine detente; on the contrary, it leads to a radicalization of opposition which would render any peaceful approach in the solution of our disputes even more difficult.\n169.\tIt would be highly regrettable if the willingness of third world countries to curb their impatience and to enter into a frank and sincere dialog with the developed world were to be interpreted as a change in the objectives of our countries or as a sign of the resignation of our peoples to a fate which they would be powerless to alter. It is perhaps clever, or even a good ploy, for some to try to exploit the differences which necessarily appear in the positions of the developing countries and, through the granting of minimal and astutely calculated concessions, to wish to bring about a discussion of our efforts and confusion in our priorities. This would not, of course, be a new tactic. It would also not be profitable, first of all because the developing countries know full well that the stakes are now far too high to sacrifice them for immediate and partial gains but also because it would mean that our partners are not yet convinced of the need squarely to face up to the true problems in order to find satisfactory and lasting solutions to them.\n170.\tNo one could still doubt that the present system governing international economic relations is experiencing a severe crisis greatly affecting the vulnerable economies of the third world and threatening the prosperity of the developed countries themselves. This situation, which is intolerable for all, demands that radical solutions be arrived at by common agreement in order to lay the foundations for a new international economic order better adapted to the requirements of our times.\n171.\tThis crucial task is a matter for all the members of the international community; it requires a global vision which truly takes into account the needs and interests of all peoples! and effective decolonization of the relations imposed by the wealthy countries on the rest of the world. Whereas most of the developed countries have now reached the post-industrial stage, our peoples have not yet seen a technological take-off, because they are subjected by the capitalist countries and the big monopolies to an industrial and technological blockade which condemns them to a dependence that is practically without recourse.\n172.\tThe conduct of the developed countries has not been completely in keeping with the good intentions that they professed during the seventh special session of the General Assembly. That goodwill has been neutralized by the maneuvers designed to turn developing countries away from their essential aims and to weaken their solidarity by creating contradictions among their interests. To realize that that is true one need only note the unenthusiastic reception given the legitimate and reasonable proposals formulated by the third-world countries at the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi or at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, particularly with regard to debt rescheduling and the protection of earnings from the export of raw materials. The industrialized countries do not limit themselves to delaying tactics in connexion with the modest and constructive proposals of the developing countries; they formed an exclusive club and strengthened their position by setting themselves up as an international board of directors during the monetary Conference at Kingston  and the Rambouillet and Puerto Rico conferences. The result has regrettably and inevitably been tension and increased misunderstanding, distrust and confrontation between developed and developing countries.\n173.\tThe countries of the third world obviously must draw the necessary conclusion from that disappointing experience and must be wise enough not to have too high hopes about the true extent of the willingness of the industrialized world voluntarily to agree to the sacrifices necessary to the re-establishment of minimum justice in international economic relations. The Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries at Colombo demonstrated a clear awareness of that situation and, not wishing to get bogged down in useless recriminations about a state of affairs which is regrettable but which must be faced up to, it called on the developing countries to maintain their solidarity by making clear the priorities of their common program and defining the immediate aims of their common action. The Colombo discussions also stressed the importance of a rational management by the developing countries of their own resources and capacities, and the necessity of making the most of the complementary nature of their economies by developing their mutual exchanges in all sectors.\n174.\tIt is thus clear that, while stressing the responsibility of the developed countries and the great Powers in this undertaking to change the present international order, the developing countries have an accurate assessment of their own responsibility and of the obligations they must assume to ensure the achievement of their aspirations. Their achievement of maturity and of a real ability to take part in the settlement of international affairs is in direct relation to their capacity to distinguish what is vital from what is secondary and not to confuse the true problems with their spin-offs/Our sincerity in regard to ourselves and to the principles that we proclaim is the prerequisite to our acceptance as a serious partner on the international scene. More than others, we must be aware of the need to understand that our common good imposes certain limitations on our national concerns. More than others, we must demonstrate our respect for international morality and the rules that we are attempting to impose on the conduct of the most powerful members of our community. Any hope for the triumph of our cause would be irremediably compromised if we were again to witness the re-emergence of that selfishness which in the past doomed all our efforts at common action to failure. This applies not only to economic questions which, despite appearances and the crisis which gives them a character of immediacy and urgency, remain, after all, auxiliary problems within the political framework in which they must be solved. The principle of non-interference in the affairs of other countries must obviously be applied first and foremost in the relations among countries of the third world. Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, which we have so energetically defended against the hegemony of the colonial Powers, must be the corner-stone of our mutual conduct and our attitude of support for the peoples struggling for their liberation. The policy of faits accomplis, which we vehemently denounce in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, must not be excused when it is practiced by countries whose membership of the third world makes such a violation of the most elementary rules of international law even less acceptable. Such deviations do, however, exist. We know of them and we regret them because they are so many additional obstacles to our common progress towards the attainment of our most vital aspirations. Obviously it is up to the third-world countries themselves to find a solution to this dramatic situation and to-become more aware of the price they will have to pay to benefit from solidarity based on free acceptance of a code of ethics we ourselves have clearly defined.\n175.\tI should like to turn to several special problems to which my Government attaches particular importance. The deterioration of the situation in the Mediterranean basin and around the Mediterranean, where conflicts are degenerating or taking on broader dimensions, disturbs and preoccupies us. In particular, the Middle East crisis was already serious and complex enough without the present tragedy in Lebanon, which is so dangerously affecting that country's national unity, its territorial integrity and, perhaps, in die final analysis, its very existence as an independent nation. It is not possible to arrive at a clear picture of the situation there arising from the forces and influences enmeshed there, some of which obviously, bear the stamp of imperialism and Zionism, Efforts are being undertaken, in particular in, the framework of the League of Arab States, at least to bring to an end the murders and the unleashing of violence, while awaiting the moment when the Lebanese, listening to the voice of reason, give up the fatal madness which seems to have taken hold of that people, who were so well known for their peace-loving character, and face the real problems of their common future. We give our total support to these initiatives in reiterating our conviction that no solution imposed from outside will have any real possibility of leading to a just and lasting settlement of the Lebanese drama.\n176.\tAs we are aware, this tragedy is closely linked with the struggle of the Palestinian people, which a particularly cruel destiny appears to have pursued throughout its history. However tragic and deplorable the upheavals in Lebanon may be, they cannot jeopardize the right of the Palestinians to pursue their liberation struggle, nor can they impose on their necessary freedom of action any abusive constraints designed to do no less than thwart their efforts and weaken their ranks. The Lebanese crisis should not lead us to close our eyes to the seal facts of the Palestinian problem, solution of which is inconceivable outside the context of recognition and satisfaction of the inalienable rights which our Assembly itself has recognred as belong\u00acing to the Palestinian people.\n177.\tWhatever imperialist and Zionist attempts are made further to confuse these facts and to confuse priorities, the evolution of the Middle East problem shows without a shadow of a doubt that a global solution is essential, a solution comprising both the total evacuation by Israel of all occupied Arab territories and the satisfaction of the national aspirations of the Palestinian people. This is a truth that has today finally been recognized by the international community. Its implementation, however, is something else again, since it will involve both the determination of the Palestinians to defend their rights and their ability to do so competently and responsibly, as well as the? readiness of our Organization and its Members to give their decisions sufficient force to ensure their execution.\n178.\tStill in the Mediterranean context, the problem of Cyprus continues to resist all attempts to settle it, and the talks between the two Cypriot communities, which have been held'\nhardly\tof them. We believe that the principles contained in resolution 3212 (XXIX) of the General Assembly are still a valid basis for a satisfactory solution which would guarantee the rights, particular requirements and security of each community while at the same time maintaining the political unity, the territorial integrity and the non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. Algeria will continue to make its contribution, particularly in the contact group set up for that purpose by the non-aligned group, in order to investigate, in close co-operation with all parties concerned, the possibilities of effecting a. reconciliation of views and a basis of agreement for the urgent settlement of the primarily humanitarian problems that have been a source of so much pointless suffering, which it is the duty of us all to allay immediately.\n179.\tDespite the importance of the problems to which I have alluded, it appears, none the less, that this session of the Assembly will continue to be dominated by the way the situation in Africa is developing, particularly in southern Africa, where the hour of decision appears to have finally arrived. So spectacular a change is by no means due-to a sudden awakening of international public opinion, since it was already well-informed of events in that region. It is, first and foremost, something which has been wrought by the Africans themselves, who, with the passing of the years, have learned how better to defend their rights in order to regain their freedom in dignity and equality. It is that struggle which is now yielding its fruit, and which shows that the dead in Soweto, Alexandra and elsewhere did not lay down their lives in vain; nor have the sufferings of those who have languished for years in the prisons of Vorster and Ian Smith been in vain. The interest which is now being shown by the Western countries in bringing about a satisfactory solution to the African claims, while at the same time preserving, albeit partially, the privileges of the white minorities, is not based on any humanitarian considerations or on a sudden upsurge of sympathy for the African peoples-not that the African peoples are in any way demanding that. As we know, this interest-and, to a certain extent, we find this quite logical is more aroused by the desire to safeguard economic or strategic advantages, which were linked with the existence of the apartheid regime and which are threatened, as the regime is, by those transformations which are occurring or which are now taking shape in that area. We in Africa would like to be better convinced that the calculations of the Western countries are sufficiently accurate for them to conclude that their interest, properly interpreted their long-term interest does not lie in the survival at all costs of the apartheid system and of the political regime which is the embodiment of that system, but rather in the friendship which they can preserve with the African peoples of the region, which, in the final analysis, are the masters of the future of that part of Africa.\n180. The problems of Namibia, Zimbabwe and apartheid in South Africa are closely interrelated, and the ways in which they evolve must necessarily go hand in hand. This means that any progress achieved in settling any one of them will have its effects on the others, and may well make their solutions easier. That also means that it would be dangerous to tackle these problems in isolation from one another, and particularly to believe, or to give the impression, that the problem of Namibia, or even the problem of Rhodesia, can be settled in order simply to give a brief respite or a certain aura of international respectability to the die-hard upholders of the system of apartheid, when, in the final analysis, it is the survival or demise of the apartheid system which is the very focal-point of the crisis which has for so long now beset all of southern Africa.\n181.\tAt all events, the final decision is up to the Africans concerned themselves. We have confidence in their sense of responsibility and in their awareness that they are passing through a crucial period in the history of their countries. We hope that they will be able to transcend their differences or their divergent views in order to concert their efforts in this ultimate stage of their struggle. The African countries of the region, since they are better aware of the situation and know the people involved, undoubtedly will be able to play a decisive part in guiding the leaders of the liberation movements and in helping them to overcome their difficulties and differences. But there can be no doubt that, as in the past, we will continue to give total and unflagging support to the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa until their aspirations have been completely fulfilled.\n182.\tFinally, I should like to say something about the Western Sahara. This is a problem which has been, and remains one of decolonization, in the same way as those which our Organization has had to settle during the last quarter of a century, and which it has invariably solved by opting for the exercise by colonized peoples of their right to self-determination.\n183.\tThis is by no means a new problem for our Assembly, which, over many consecutive years, has in various resolutions traced the pattern for the decolonization of the Sahara, and which, furthermore, was able to complete its familiarity with the background of this affair through the report of a commission of inquiry  sent by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and also through the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  on this matter.\n184.\tIt is not my intention to hark back to all these facts, which must be quite familiar to all Members of our Assembly, but I would like to dispel certain confusions which have crept into this discussion.\n185.\tIt is, first of all, obviously false to claim that the problem of the Sahara has been solved and that the Saharan people have exercised their fight to self-determination by accepting the partition and annexation of their country. This claim is contradicted by daily events, which prove, on the contrary, that never has this problem been so acute, never has it so completely overshadowed the situation in that region. It would be difficult to make anyone believe that the procedure used at El Aaiun can in any way be regarded as an authentic consultation of the Saharan people. Without even dwelling on the spurious representative character of the members of a Jema'a which was initially appointed by the Spanish Administering Authority, it is quite obvious that the guarantees spelled out by our Assembly have not been respected, nor has there been any guarantee of the presence and supervision which should have been exercised by the Secretary-General. I would add that the Spanish Government itself, although a signatory to the Madrid agreement of 14 November 1975, disavowed its responsibility and clearly proclaimed that the Saharan people could not be considered as having in fact exercised their right to self-determination.\n186.\tThe second element of confusion which an attempt was made to introduce into the discussion concerns the Saharan refugees who are now in Algerian territory in the Tindouf region. An attempt was made to give the impression that these exiles had been detained against their will, Shat they had even been forcibly kept and that they would be pleased to return immediately to their homes if they were not prevented from doing so. I have no doubt of the burning desire of these exiles to return to their country; what prevents them from doing so is certainly not any barriers erected against them by the Algerian Government but rather a situation which was created by the mOitary occupation of their Territory and the threats it has presented and continues to present to their security and liberty. It may be comforting to those occupying a country to believe that those who have been forced into exile by their occupation are ready to welcome them as liberators were they mot in the grip of a hostile foreign Power. It would, perhaps, be wiser for them, and more positive, to come to grips with reality and to realize that absorbing a territory is not that easy without the consent of its population. The material conditions and the morale of the Saharan refugees in Tindouf cannot be a secret to anyone, and the numerous visitors who have had an opportunity to see them, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and journalists of various nationalities, are well aware of the trials that they have undergone with courage and resignation in order to keep alive their ideal and to preserve their identity and recover their freedom. The Algerian' Government is giving this uprooted population all the humanitarian aid that it can afford to giVe, and it appeals to international solidarity to do likewise to improve the lamentable conditions in which the refugees find themselves. This mass of refugees is, of course, not anything directly to do with the Algerian Government, but it is proof, if proof were needed, of the fact that in the Western Sahara there continues to exist a decolonization problem, a problem which, there can be no doubt is far from being solved.\n187.\tThe third element of confusion, which some have tried to inject into this discussion, is the advancing of the view that the problem of the Sahara has been solved but that it has been supplanted by a dispute between the States of that region. Far be it from me, of course, to overlook the tension which in fact exists in that region of ours, but we should not confuse cause with effect. Tension exists because the problem of the Sahara has not been solved, and if it were solved there is every reason to believe that this tension would likewise disappear. To assert, therefore, that the only problem which exists at present is that of the relations among the countries neighboring the Sahara is deliberately to fail to see the central crucial point of the situation and to disguise, by presenting things in this light, the essential and paramount fact, which is precisely that of the military occupation and annexation of the Sahara. The Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity gave a masterly analysis of the situation as.it now stands when they decided to convene a special summit conference, not to study -as has been wrongly stated here the tension which prevails in North Africa but, rather, to consider the question of the Western Sahara and try to find a way to settle it in association with the neighboring countries and the Saharan people themselves.\n188.\tI feel, therefore, that I must reiterate here that the Algerian Government will not let itself be drawn in by these attempts to distort the problem of the Sahara by promoting the idea of some conflict among neighboring countries, because Algeria has continued to state most solemnly that its fundamental position is not inspired by any territorial designs, even less by any feelings of hostilities towards its neighbors. This position of ours is based on the profound conviction that the only guarantee for a true and lasting solution to the problem of the Sahara resides in the exercise by the Saharan people of their right to self-determination on the basis of the territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers and by means of an authentic referendum monitored and guaranteed by the United Nations.\n189.\tDuring this session there can be no doubt that our. Assembly will have to consider how events are developing in the Sahara and to gage, particularly through the report that is to be presented by the Secretary-General, the extent to which the decisions that it took last year have been implemented. My delegation continues to believe that responsibility for the decolonization of the Sahara lies squarely with the United Nations, and we reserve our right to develop the ideas which I have just touched upon during the specific discussion devoted to that item.\n190.\tThe problem that I have just outlined, like the many other questions which require decisions by our Assembly poses in even more acute terms the problem of the responsibility of our Organization and its ability to secure the implementation of its resolutions: I am not only speaking here, of the General Assembly. We know, how limited its powers are in regard to Sanctions. I am also speaking of the Security Council, which the Charter has provided with methods of constraint that allow it to enforce its decisions. I hardly need to stress the extent to which the credibility of our Organization might suffer because of the impotence of its major bodies and their inability to implement their decisions. It is quite obvious that this is a question of authority , and if it is to be solved it means necessarily that every Member State will have to give up a portion of its prerogatives of sovereignty and agree to submit to the higher will, which is that of our Organization. Such accommodations are never easily accepted, but perhaps it would not be redundant or otiose to encourage the widest-ranging exchange of views possible on this aspect of the activities of our Organization.\n191.\tThese somewhat theoretical considerations are intimately connected with the desire, largely expressed here, to strengthen the role of our Organization in maintaining international peace and security and in helping to bring about ever growing co-operation among all peoples. These ideas at least express our attachment to this institution which, despite the weaknesses which still beset it, still appears as the most appropriate instrument for bringing about understanding among men and friendship among nations.\n"

        "file_text": "We, the delegation of the People's Republic of China,\nhave come to attend the present session of the United Nations General Assembly today at a time of immense grief for the people of all nationalities in China. Chairman Mao Tsetung, the most esteemed and beloved great leader and teacher of the Chinese people, passed away on 9 September The passing of Chairman Mao Tsetung is a loss beyond measure to the 800 million Chinese people. But for Chairman Mao, there would have been no victory of the Chinese revolution. But for Chairman Mao, there would have been no new China of today. Without the victory of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao the world would not have changed so vastly as it has. Hie extremely sorrow-stricken Chinese people are determined to turn grief into strength, to carry out Chairman Mao's behests and to carry through to the end the cause of the proletarian revolution in China which Chairman Mao pioneered. The Chinese people's revolutionary cause has worthy successors. Chairman Mao Tsetung has left us forever, but the magnificent contributions he made in revolutionary theory and practice are immortal. The radiance of Mao Tsetung thought will always illuminate our road of advance.\n21\tHere I Wish to express once again, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, our deep gratitude to the representatives of many countries who have at various meetings of the United Nations tendered condolences on the passing away of Chairman Mao Tsetung.\n22\tChairman Mao Tsetung drew a whole series of profound conclusions from the contemporary international situation The complete correctness of these conclusions is being more and more corroborated by the developing situation.\n23. Back in the early 1960s, Chairman Mao Tsetung vividly portrayed the contemporary world situation in these verses:\n\\\"The Four Seas are rising, clouds and waters raging, The Five Continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring.\\\"\nThe world situation has been in a stats of great turmoil. All the political forces in the world have undergone drastic division and realignment as a result of prolonged contests of strength and struggles. On the one hand, there is the rise of the third world; on the other hand, there is the rivalry tor hegemony between the two super-Powers-the Soviet Union and the United States. Countries want independence, nations want liberation, and the people want revolution -this has become an irresistible trend of history. Looking around the globe, one cannot find a single place of tranquility. \\\"The wind sweeping through-the tower heralds a rising storm in the mountains.\\\" The factors for both revolution and war are increasing. As Chairman Mao Tsetung pointed out, the current international situation is characterized by great disorder under heaven, and it is excellent: this great disorder is a good thing, and not a bad thing, for the people. It throws the enemies into disarray and divides them, while awakening and tempering the people, thus pushing the international situation to develop further in a direction favorable to the people and unfavorable to imperialism and social-imperialism.\n24. Making a penetrating analysis of all the basic contra-dictions of our time and the division and realignment of all the political forces in the world, Chairman Mao Tsetung advanced his great strategic concept of the three worlds. He pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union make up the first world; the developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere constitute the third world; and in between the two is the second world composed of Europe, Japan, Canada and other countries. Lenin once said: \\\"Imperialism is the progressing oppression of the nations of the world by a handful of great Powers; it is an epoch of wars among these Powers for the extension and consolidation of national oppression.\\\" At present, the Soviet Union and the United States, the two super-Powers constituting the first world, are the biggest international oppressors and exploiters of our time and they are the sources of a new world war. While the developed countries of the second world oppress and exploit third-world countries, they themselves are at the same time subjected to super-Power oppression, exploitation, control or threats. The numinous third-world countries are most heavily oppressed and exploited by colonialism and imperialism; they are the main force in the fight against imperialism, and particularly against super-Power hegemonism.\n25. Chairman Mao Tsetung pointed out: \\\"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution.\\\"' Chairman Mao s concept of the three worlds provides orientation for the workers and oppressed nations and oppressed peoples of the world in their fight in the realm of international class\nstruggle.\n26 In the past year, the struggle against colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism waged by the people of the third-world countries has made great progress, though it suffered temporary setbacks in individual places These people have further awakened and have strengthened their unity in struggle. The heroic people of Egypt, unable to bear social-imperialist bullying and oppression any longer, resolutely abrogated the Egyptian-Soviet treaty. The Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries withstood outside pressure and maintained the position of opposing imperialism, and particularly super-Power hegemonism. The people of Asia, Africa and Latin America have come to see more and more clearly the true colors of social-imperialism. The great African people are now launching an offensive on barbarous racism, and the handful of colonialists have been cornered m southern Africa. The situation there is complicated owing to the meddling of the two super-Powers. But the long- tempered African people are clear-headed. They do not believe the nice words of imperialism and social- imperialism, nor are they intimidated by their bluster. They will surely win their liberation by relying on their own armed struggle, strengthening their unity and persisting in this course. Chairman Mao Tsetung said:\n\\\"The evil system of colonialism and imperialism arose and throve with the enslavement of Negroes and the trade in Negroes, and it will surely come to its end with the complete emancipation of the black people.\\\"\nThe future of Africa is infinitely bright.\n\n27. Strategically, Europe is the focus of contention between the Soviet Union and the United States for world hegemony. The so-called \\\"European Security Conference\\\" was in fact a \\\"European Insecurity Conference\\\". There are always some people in the West who want to urge social-imperialism eastward and divert this peril towards China, thinking it best if all is quiet in the West. The \\\"European Security Conference\\\" reflected such a Munich line of thinking. After the Conference concluded last year, these people thought that henceforth there would be peace and tranquility in Europe. But since that Conference, the military threat posed by the Soviet Union against Western Europe and its political subversion there have been on the increase, and Europe is not more secure, but in greater danger. The desire of the European people for peace is understandable. But the Soviet Union has played up the \\\"European Security Conference\\\" with ulterior motives. It attempts thereby to put Western Europe off guard, divide and crush it piecemeal and ultimately seize the whole of Western Europe. The fact that strategically Europe is the focus of contention between the two hegemonic Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, is determined by their fundamental interests. Some people take the lead hi appeasing and making concessions to the expansionists, attempting to shift this strategic focus by recognizing their sphere of influence and giving them small favors. But such an attempt cannot be realized. The continued pursuit of such a policy will result in lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet. Forces opposing appeasement are now rising in the West. The unity of the West European countries has made new progress. We support the unity of Western Europe and wish to see Western Europe grow strong.\n28. The rivalry between the two super-Powers, the Soviet Union and She United States, extends to all parts of the globe. The United States has vested interests to protect around the world, and the Soviet Union seeks expansion. This state of affairs is unalterable. In this world-wide rivalry, the expansionist activities of the Soviet Union are all-pervasive. A Soviet leader has openly declared that there is no corner of the earth that is not taken into account by them. Now more and more people have come to realize that the so-called \\\"irreversible process of detente\\\" constantly peddled by Soviet social-imperialism is but a fraudulent and hollow phase; every day it talks \\\"peace\\\" but practices expansion; every day it talks \\\"disarmament\\\" but practices arms expansion. Soviet social-imperialism is the biggest peace swindler and the most dangerous source of war today. The continued fierce rivalry between the two super-Powers is bound to lead to war some day. This is independent of mail's will. The so-called \\\"balance of power\\\" is only a temporary, superficial and even deceptive thing. It cannot be relied upon to maintain peace. As Chairman Mao Tsetung pointed out, in an era when classes exist, war is a phenomenon between two periods of peace. The danger of a new world war is visibly growing, and the people of all countries must get prepared.\n29. There is now a strange phenomenon in the world. Some people are terrified at the mention of the Soviet Union, thinking that it cannot be touched. This is superstition. Soviet social-imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. It is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Alienated from the people, it is essentially feeble, it faces economic difficulties and ever-sharpening class contradictions and contradictions among its nationalities. Carrying out expansion everywhere and committing all sorts of evils, it has affronted the people of the East European countries and of the world. Its offensive posture bears the seed of defeat. Chairman Mao Tsetung pointed out long ago: \\\"All reactionaries are paper tigers.\\\"\\\"The revisionist Soviet Union is a paper tiger too.\\\" All the countries that are subjected to super-Power aggression, subversion, interference, control or threat should unite and wage a tit-for-tat struggle against it. \\\"The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.\\\" The destiny of mankind is definitely not to be decided by any super-Power.\n\\\"People of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. Monsters of all kinds shall be destroyed.\\\"\n30.\tFollowing Chairman Mao Tsetung's teachings, the Chinese Government and people firmly and unswervingly support the just struggles of all oppressed nations and oppressed peoples. Now, I would like to state our consistent position on some of the issues to be considered by the current session of the General Assembly.\n31.\tWe firmly support the people of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania in their just struggle against white racism and for national liberation. We warmly support the relevant resolutions adopted by the recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/311197], We firmly support the people of Zimbabwe in their armed straggle against the Smith white minority regime. We firmly support the people of Namibia in their aimed struggle against forcible occupation by the reactionary authorities of South Africa ai d for national independence. We warmly hail the powerful mass movements of the people of Azania against racial discrimination and apartheid. We strongly condemn the Soviet Union for disrupting the unity of the Angolan national liberation movements and carrying out armed intervention in Angola. We are firmly opposed to the rivalry between the two super-Powers in southern Africa, and especially to social-imperialist attempts to seize the opportunity to sow discord and carry out armed intervention while pretending to support the national liberation movements.\n32.\tWe firmly support the Palestinian and other Arab peoples in their just struggle for the restoration of their national rights and the recovery of their lost territories and against the rivalry between the super-Powers for hegemony in the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the various political forces in Lebanon, together with the Arab States concerned and the Palestinian people, will set store by the national interests of Lebanon and the militant unity of the Arab countries and find a reasonable solution to their temporary differences through peaceful consultations free from super-Power interference.\n33.\tWe firmly maintain that the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus should be respected. We earnestly hope that the Greek and Turkish communities of Cyprus and the countries directly concerned will guard against super-Power meddling and gradually eliminate their differences through patient consultations on the basis of equality and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation.\n34.\tWe firmly support the Korean people in their just struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland. United States aggression and its interference in Korea are the main cause for recurrent tensions in Korea and for the failure to achieve an independent and peaceful reunification. The United Nations Command must be dissolved, and the United States armed forces must be withdrawn from South Korea. The division of Korea must end, and the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea must be realized. This is not to be hindered by any force on earth.\n35.\tWe firmly support the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations. The United States threat to use the veto is utterly unjustifiable. We firmly support the just struggle carried on by the people of East Timor under the leadership of the Frente Revolucionaria Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN] in defence of the independence and territorial integrity of their country chainst foreign aggression. We hold that the position of the Association of South-East Asian Nations for the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from interference by foreign Powers should be respected.\n36.\tWe firmly support the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.4 We firmly support the proposal of the Government of Pakistan to establish a nuclear-free zone in South Asia.s We firmly support the solemn statement of the King of Nepal declaring Nepal a zone of peace. We firmly support the reasonable position taken by Bangladesh on the question of sharing the water of the Ganges river.\n37.\tWe firmly support the just struggle of the third-world countries for the establishment of the new international economic order. To attain this aim, the third-world countries have, since the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, made many efforts at various international conferences. But owing to obstruction by the super-Powers, these efforts have so far not achieved the progress they ought to have. Facts prove that the superPowers will never lightly give up their prerogative of exploiting and plundering the developing countries. We approve of dialogue, but first of all one must be strong. The developing countries can wrest back, step by step, positions on the economic front occupied by the super-Powers only if* they maintain independence and self-reliance, fully exercise their state sovereignty, take firm hold of their national resources, develop and expand their national economies, consolidate and expand the associations of raw material-producing countries and strengthen their mutual help and co-operation.\n\n38.\tAs for the question of disarmament, our consistent position and views are known to all. The Soviet representative puts forward in this forum every year a sham disarmament proposal of one description or another to achieve a demagogic effect. It is not worth while here to comment on such old stuff in new concoctions.\n39.\tThe Chinese Government and people are determined to carry on the cause left behind by Chairman Mao, to adhere to the basic line of our Party and to keep to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and policies in foreign affairs. This has been solemnly declared in the message to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities throughout the country issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, the Council of State of the People's Republic of China and the Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and in the memorial speech by Comrade Hua Kuo-feng, First Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the Council of State, at the mass memorial meeting to mourn our great leader and teacher, Chairman Mao Tsetung. The revolutionary line and policies in foreign affairs laid down for us by Chairman Mao personally are a beacon that has illuminated and will forever illuminate the successful advance of our external work. The Chinese Government will continue unswervingly to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and policies in foreign affairs, keep the people in mind, place hopes in them, uphold proletarian internationalism, and never seek hegemony or to be a super-Power. We will strengthen our unity with the international proletariat and the oppressed nations and oppressed peoples the world over, our unity with the people of the third-world countries and our unity with all the countries subjected to aggression, subversion, interference, control or bullying by imperialism or social-imperialism so as to form the broadest possible united front against imperialism, and particularly against the hegemonism of the two superPowers, the Soviet Union and the United States. We consistently maintain that all countries, big and small, should be equal. The affairs of any country should be managed by its own people; world affairs should be managed by all countries in the world. As in the past, we will establish or develop relations with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.\n40.\tChairman Mao Tsetung taught us that \\\"In our inter-national relations, we Chinese people should get rid of great-Power chauvinism resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely.\\\"  We will follow this instruction of Chairman Mao in handling all our foreign relations. China is still a developing socialist country. However great our future achievements in national construction, we will keep firmly in mind Chairman Mao's teaching always to be modest and never become arrogant, not even after a hundred years, and never become cocky, not even after the twenty-first century.\n\n41.\tChina is a vast and richly endowed country with a population of 800 million. Chairman Mao Tsetung taught us: \\\"China ought to make a greater contribution to humanity.\\\" At present, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are taking class struggle as the key-link, keeping to the Party's basic line and policies for the entire historical period of socialism, persevering in the continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidating the great unity of the people of all nationalities under the leadership of the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, deepening the struggle to criticize Teng Hsiao-ping and repulse the rightist deviationist attempt to reverse correct verdicts, consolidating and developing the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, combating and preventing revisionism, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, working hard independently and self-reliantly, to build China into a powerful socialist country, and striving to make a greater contribution to humanity. Following the consistent teachings of Chairman Mao, we are determined to strengthen our preparedness against war, heighten our vigilance and be ready at all times to wipe out any enemy that dares to invade China. We are determined to liberate Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we Chinese people are fully confident that we will triumph over domestic and foreign enemies, overcome all difficulties and achieve our objectives.\n42.\tSurveying the whole world, we see that there is great disorder under heaven and that the situation is excellent. The way ahead is tortuous, but the future of mankind is bright. The people of China are ready to join hands with the people of all other countries in our common endeavor.\n"

His distinguished career in international affairs, his experience and knowledge are a sure guarantee that the accomplishment of the honorable and delicate task which the Members of the United Nations have decided to trust to him will bring about the desired results.\n190.\tI wish likewise to pay a tribute to Mr.'Gaston Thorn, Prime Minuter of Luxembourg, who presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly with tact and efficiency which deserve the gratitude of all.\n191.\tI wish to convey also my country's condolences to the People's Republic of China on the occasion of the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung, an extraordinary leader of peoples who was of great historical significance in our century.\n192.\tI should also like to convey my most cordial welcome to the new independent State of Seychelles, whose admission brings our Organization closer to the ideal of universality. At the same time I congratulate the United Kingdom on fulfilling its pledge to carry out the process of the granting of independence to this new country. With reference to the admission of other members, it is my hope that the veto will not be used to prevent the complete application of the principle of universality, to which Ecuador attributes a fundamental importance in the implementation of the lofty purposes of the world Organization.\n193.\tWe are participating in the world forum with faith in the ideals of the United Nations, the realization of whose principles continues to be the major commitment of our generation in response to the challenge of national and international tensions, injustice and inequalities. We wish to strengthen this instrument in the sphere of international co-operation in order to achieve the well-being of all peoples and we deem it essential that the United Nations should take vigorous measures wherever its action may be required to settle situations likely to endanger peace. In the circumstances of interdependence characterizing the world in which we live, the Organization is the instrument which can be used in the broad sphere of immediate action with respect to all endeavors aimed at the common goal of promoting, the well-being of the greatest number of people. For that reason we consider that world action on the broadest scale to promote international co-operation and peace should be channeled through the United Nations. To relegate the world Organization to a marginal position would be to weaken it.\n194.\tAt the same time, we are aware that the prospects and purposes of the United Nations of today are different from those of 1945. Today the activities of the United Nations are much broader and more complex with respect to the increasing and almost complete universality of the Organization; the concerns attendant upon the peaceful uses of outer space; the conservation and rational use of the resources of the planet and preservation of the environment as the heritage of mankind; the demographic question and the disturbing equation between population and availability of food, the shortage of which constitutes a potential force of conflict and other problems resulting from the inequality between rich countries and poor countries entailing unsatisfactory trade relations and situations of dependence which must be settled without delay if we all wish to live in a world of peace.\n195.\tNaturally, any solution must be achieved in a manner consonant with man's status as an intelligent being, by dialog, understanding and consensus and not by the unacceptable methods of terrorism which we reject as an affront to every country, every ideology and every civilized human group.\n196.\tTo maintain international peace and security it is necessary to make a decisive attack on the factors which threaten them. This is the fundamental point. Nevertheless, we attribute very special importance to disarmament and we stress the need for disarmament of the spirit in order to open the way to a genuine will to understanding, as called for by the Charter. Upholding these purposes, Ecuador will always be ready to give its support to any initiative in this field.\n197.\tIf political peace is a truce, lasting peace requires a just international organization which will secure a better life for all peoples. It is not logical that countries should continue to invest enormous resources to increase their arsenals of every kind. There is a cry which arises from within the United Nations: the clamor for peace. Responding to that appeal, the Government of Ecuador will welcome any proposal for the prohibition of new weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapon tests.\n198.\tMy country takes this opportunity to express the hope that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament will continue to give impetus to negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement on effective measures for the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of any chemical weapons and the destruction of those already in existence. I address a special appeal to the Soviet Union to adhere to Additional Protocol II of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, because Ecuador is convinced that, for the maximum effectiveness of any treaty establishing a zone free from such means of destruction, the co-operation of the nuclear-weapon States is necessary.\n199.\tThe United Nations must make itself heard wherever human rights are violated; wherever acts of genocide or torture are committed or human lives are sacrificed; wherever populations are displaced; wherever it is sought to interpose curtains of silence and oppression. I wish to reiterate that the Government of Ecuador will lend its support to the exercise of human rights in every country, without any selective criteria. With regard to this matter there can be no preferential policies under which some cases are deliberately ignored and attention is drawn only to violations of human rights in others.\n200.\tRacial discrimination is contrary to the most elementary human feeling and legal concepts and the Ecuadorian Government and people repudiate it.\n201.\tWe have been following with concern the situation in Southern Rhodesia, which has so far made it impossible to satisfy the aspirations of the Zimbabwe people. Ecuador firmly believes that it is necessary to continue working with zeal, decisiveness and imagination to find ways and means of enabling the just aspirations of that people to become a reality. We believe that it is important to continue the efforts which appear to be furthering progress at this time, with a view to a negotiated and orderly transition to government by the majority within a short period of time.\n202.\tThe question of Namibia will brook no further delay. The United Nations undertook a firm commitment to bring that Territory and its people to total and complete independence. Therefore Security Council resolution 385 (1976) of 30 January 1976 should be implemented without any reservation by South Africa. Otherwise, the Council should, in accordance with the Charter, adopt the measures which may be appropriate in the circumstances. This is the last opportunity to solve the problem of Namibia by just and peaceful means; it is a question which cannot satisfactorily be solved if the interests of the Namibian people continue to be ignored.\n203.\tEcuador condemns the killings and acts of violence which have occurred in South Africa and rejects the\npractice of apartheid, which runs counter to all the purposes and principles of the Organization and violates the solemn commitment entered into by all its Member States to ensure universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for all without distinction of race.\n204.\tMy country is concerned about the situation in Cyprus and deems it imperative to make progress towards an agreed settlement. It is our hope that the negotiations which both communities are continuing to carry on under the sponsorship of the Secretary-General will be brought to the successful conclusion which we all desire so that all Cypriots may live together in peace. We are appreciative of the function which continues to be carried out by the peace force sent by the United Nations in maintaining calm and performing humanitarian tasks pending the conclusion of an agreement.\n205.\tWith reference to the situation in the Middle East, I feel it essential that all the peoples of the region, with which my country maintains sincere relations of friendship, should continue making every effort to reach a peaceful understanding. We must recognize that the situation in that area entails a serious threat to world peace and that an over-all solution of the problem, within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, is required.\n206.\tEcuador reaffirms its position on this matter: it rejects and condemns territorial conquests achieved by force; it cannot accept the occupation of territories either as a means of exerting pressure on an adversary or for the purpose of demanding negotiations or with the intention of refusing to return those territories until an agreement has been signed. It recognizes the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to their national self-determination, sovereignty and independence; but it also considers that the State of Israel, which was created precisely by the United Nations, has the right to its existence. The Ecuadorian Government expresses once again its hope that the parties involved in this conflict can find the way to a just and lasting peace within safe, recognized and guaranteed frontiers.\n207.\tThe deplorable events in Lebanon have caused consternation in my country, and it is our hope that the violence will cease and harmony and peaceful co-operation among all sectors of that progressive nation will be re-established.\n208.\tAnother topic of deep concern is that relating to Korea and we trust that the parties concerned will renew their efforts to promote a rapprochement and frank and cordial negotiations.\n209.\tThe world today is fortunately experiencing a phase of relative detente in which the great Powers have begun to make reciprocal concessions in their desire to ensure world peace. Efforts must therefore be made to take advantage of this favorable climate and to seek to eliminate once and for all the problems affecting international coexistence.\n210.\tIn Latin America, problems which compromise solidarity and endanger the peace and development of the region persist-problems deriving from the arrogance of certain countries or involving territorial considerations or vestiges of colonialism which we would like to see eliminated quickly and permanently. First of all, I refer to the problem which affects my own country, which, basing itself on its historical and legal titles and the geopolitical need for harmonious development of the region, reaffirms its right of sovereignty in the Amazon River. Ecuador reiterates in this august Assembly its fervent desire that this question, as well as the others which affect inter-American concord, should find an early and just solution in an atmosphere of mutual understanding. Other important cases include the so-called Canal Zone of Panama, the question of Belize and the Malvina Islands, and problems such as the land-locked situation of Bolivia.\n211.\tThe philosophy followed by the Government of Ecuador in its national and international policy is identified with the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, setting forth the new world consensus and the new task which must be carried out by the United Nations as an organization and by each one of its Members in particular, especially in so far as it is aimed at guaranteeing present and future generations' economic and social development on a basis of peace and justice.\n212.\tWithin that universal context, Ecuador is part of the developing world. It is one of the Latin American countries which together represent Western civilization within the group.\n213.\tIt is a sign of the times we live in that Ecuador is also a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], in accordance with the exercise of the right to freedom of association arising from its sovereignty and the defense of its natural resources.\n214.\tIn the regional context, Ecuador is a member of the oldest international system, the inter-American system, and is fully honoring its commitments in that system. In due course, Ecuador, identifying itself with the other countries of Latin America, sponsored the establishment of the Latin American Economic System, and it also hopes that the Latin American Free Trade Association will be strengthened, together with any other mechanism for regional or subregional integration and development which affects us, such as the Andean Group, which we whole-heartedly support.\n215.\tWe note with particular interest the progress made by the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. At the international level, we should support the promotion of imports and exports on more just terms of trade and transport. To that end, we also believe that the time has come to move towards greater coherence in development plans, for, despite the fact that those plans at present constitute a stage of internal organization, they still form an anarchic and at times contradictory framework when viewed in an international context. Accordingly, we have supported every undertaking and study designed to generate productive and adequate employment in the rural, urban and semi-urban sectors. We are also concerned at the fact that during the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade attainments fell very far short of the established targets, as reflected mainly in the fact that little or no progress was made in the spheres of trade and the transfer of financial resources to the developing countries. The lack of real progress in the implementation of the International Development Strategy and the upheaval in economic relations in recent years, which have had serious repercussions in the developing countries, led the inter-national community to recognize the need to establish a more just economic order that would make it possible to attain development objectives through the elimination of the poverty, misery and hunger affecting the majority of mankind, which has been relegated to a life unworthy of human beings.\n216.\tThe most recent sessions of the General Assembly have afforded the developing countries the opportunity to demonstrate their political will and their desire for effective co-operation in bringing about significant progress in measures to promote the balanced development of all countries. Nevertheless, they have encountered intransigent positions which, during the current year, have eroded the progress of negotiations designed to translate into reality the measures identified by the resolutions of the sixth and seventh special, sessions of the General Assembly, and by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, such as machinery to accelerate the establishment of the new economic order.\n217.\tRegrettably, it can be seen from the results obtained thus far in the negotiations conducted within the United Nations and in other fora between developed and developing countries that, following the adoption at the seventh special session of the resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], no significant complementary measures had been decided upon; accordingly, industrialized States should be urged effectively to co-operate in attaining the objectives established by the United Nations.\n218.\tEcuador hopes that the important initiatives of the North-South Conference held in Paris'? will bear fruit and that an understanding spirit of co-operation on the part of the industrialized countries will prevail to that end.\n219.\tThe Government of Ecuador views with particular interest the new commitment on the part of the United Nations to protect the environment and, in particular, trusts that significant progress will be made in the multi-lateral financing of housing and in the improvement of human settlements, for which purpose the plan of action adopted at the international Conference at Vancouver constitutes an important and commendable contribution.\n220.\tWe are following with keen interest the work of the United Nations on the important question of the analysis of the practices of transnational corporations which have such a severe impact on the weakest countries in particular, and we believe that opportunities for contacts and discussions on these subjects should be widened to cover all constructive aspects and bring about the improvements which the world situation demands. To that end, the Commission on Transnational Corporations, the functioning of which marks significant progress for the United Nations system, must be strengthened.\n221.\tThe United Nations Development Program is the executing arm of economic and social policy in the transfer of technology and is actually the Organization's most substantial presence in the developing world. We are pleased that the Program has overcome its financial difficulties and is progressing under dedicated and effective leadership. We believe that the role of the resident representatives should be strengthened even more than is recommended in the Consensus,  as suggested in the report entitled A New United Nations Structure for Global Economic Cooperation,  and in order to avoid a proliferation of funds and services which should be provided by a unified and co-ordinated system in each country.\n222.\tIn view of the alarming breadth of the gap between the most developed and the least advanced countries, we believe that emphasis should be placed on the transfer of technology as a process which can lead to a reduction of tensions and shortages. Our universities, institutes and laboratories are prepared to cooperate in die international effort to augment existing scientific and technological capacities, and we hope that progress will be made at both the regional and international levels in the various preparatory meetings for the United Nations conference on science and technology for development, to be held in 1979. In particular, we will support concrete measures for the application of science and technology to bring about the establishment of a new international economic order which fully utilizes scientific potential in solving key national, regional and world problems.\n223.\tIn this connexion, we view with interest and will support the United Nations conference on technical co-operation among developing countries, to be held within the next few years in Buenos Aires, for we believe that the time is ripe in the Latin American region for the sharing of experiences and solutions in this interdependent world of ours, in which every country has something to learn and something to teach.\n224.\tAll these topics have a bearing on the important proposals made by the developing countries at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi, the full import of which we hope will be taken into account. In that connexion, we wish to underscore our support for the establishment of a fund for commodities stocks designed to stabilize the export earnings of the developing countries.\n225.\tEcuador has been in the forefront of international efforts to defend the sovereignty of States over their territorial sea and their marine resources, the inalienable heritage of our present and future generations. Since it signed the 1952 Santiago Declaration,  which transformed thinking on the territorial sea, it has followed a long and encouraging course of evolution. For many years, we have been waging an unequal struggle, together with the countries of the South Pacific, against the major fishing Powers, which are determined to deny our sovereignty within the territorial sea.\n226.\tWith regard to the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean gloor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, Ecuador maintains that the res nuliius stage should be superseded by recognition of the principle that the natural resources of the sea-bed are the common heritage of mankind. That principle must be given practical effect and its dynamic and appropriate juridical development must be promoted so as to ensure the attainment of the essential objectives of benefiting all peoples in real and equitable terms, especially those of the developing countries. Ecuador maintains the position that the international regime and machinery must have adequate and exclusive powers of supervision with regard to the exploration and exploitation of those resources.\n227.\tMy country has been defending its well-known territorialist position without prejudice to efforts aimed at strengthening the rights of the coastal State in the so-called economic zone, so that with this strengthening of rights, the sovereignty of the coastal State, which Ecuador proclaims over the whole area as far as die 200-mile limit, will be guaranteed.\n228.\tOur country, like many other developing countries, is especially concerned to ensure the formulation of a new convention on the law of the sea -which should have an appropriate structure and should be as comprehensive as possible- as the sole guarantee of the rights of the developing countries over living and non-living marine resources. The new convention must reflect the just position of the developing countries, whose basic concept -that of the sovereignty of the coastal State over all resources in its waters up to a distance of 200 miles-is finding increased acceptance in the international community. The proper protection of those resources must be \\\"guaranteed for the benefit of the developing peoples.\n229.\tThe time has now come to put forward a new claim inherent in the sovereignty of States, with respect to a natural resource that has recently been explored and has enormous potential for use in our planet: the synchronous geostationary orbit. We agree with other countries which, like ours, are directly concerned, as to the pressing need to establish a legal order with respect to this matter so as to ensure the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, for which a specific international conference is desirable. This subject especially affects Ecuador and about 10 countries in the equatorial region of the globe. Objects such as radio-communications stations belonging to countries or transnational corporations should not be placed in that orbit Without account being taken of the sovereignty of the countries situated thereunder. In addition, that part of the geostationary orbit used over marine spaces not subject to national jurisdiction should be considered a common heritage of mankind and should be used by the latter in accordance with the principles governing the sea-bed and the ocean floor adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. While the international consideration of this question proceeds, it is necessary to ensure that all available technical information concerning instruments placed in orbit above such areas should be immediately brought to the attention of the countries of the region.\n230.\tEcuador is dedicated to peace, liberty and social justice; it believes in the combined will to take joint action for constructive purposes in the interest of the coexistence of all nations. We are convinced of the oneness of the human condition and of the common destiny which we must pursue in harmony and in a constant rapprochement of countries and regions, since the cause of humanity must remain above considerations relating to the circumstantial differences of development, of income and of philosophical conceptions of the State.\n231.\tThe capacity of man's intelligence applied to scientific and technological development has made it possible to land and control instruments at a distance of 500 million kilometers from our planet -a great achievement in the history of our time and one on which we can congratulate ourselves. Yet in the social sphere, in both the theory and the practice of national and international coexistence progress is dangerously slow.\n232.\tWe gather in this world forum with a hope of finding solutions, with a will to co-operate and with a very clear awareness that we may be wasting the last opportunities to solve the major issues affecting all our peoples.\n233.\tA new world order on land and on the seas is a challenge to the intelligence of our species, and the possibility of achieving it is at hand if only we in the United Nations devote ourselves to the task, making a reality, before it is too late, of the common destiny of all of those on this planet.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by congratulating the new President of the United Nations General Assembly, Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe, representative of Sri Lanka, a country with which Portugal has historic and cultural ties of special significance. He is a statesman of international prestige, to whom I pay my sincere respects.\n244.\tI should like also to express my appreciation for the work of the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, a country with which we have come to share responsibilities arising from our recent integration within the Council of Europe and which has always attempted to show fairness in regard to the interests of the numerous Portuguese workers residing there. I have the honor of knowing Mr.Hiorn personally and I am familiar with his lucid intelligence and deep understanding of the political phenomena that interest the community of nations.\n245.\tI greet also the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose actions have contributed so much to an increase in justice and stability in international relations, thereby strengthening the prestige of the United Nations.\n246.\tFinally, I should like to offer congratulations to the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations. In admitting its one hundred and forty-fifth Member, the Organization has once again demonstrated its universal mission.\n247.\tIt is with emotion that, as the representative of a Government freely elected by the Portuguese people, I speak today at this thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am proud to represent here a fraternal and enterprising people that has made and will continue to make a decisive contribution towards the unification of mankind, based on the interpenetration of cultures and respect for all of them.\n248.\tThe liberating revolution of 25 April 1974 in Portugal had as its stated tasks decolonization, democratization and development. Two years later we have concluded our decolonization process, in which we honored our commitments to the United Nations and redeemed relations with peoples we wish to consider as brothers, relations that were unfortunately distorted by the oppressive policies of the previous regime. Two years later it is the representative of a Government chosen by the people in accordance with a Constitution drafted by a freely elected Assembly of Deputies who speaks before you in this tribune. Democracy is thus a fact in Portugal.\n249.\tIt is true that two years after the revolution of 25 April our economic situation feels the repercussions of the profound transformations that have occurred in Portugal, due in great part to our compliance with the United Nations resolutions affecting the territories under colonial administration. We are, however, convinced that by our own forces, and with international solidarity, we shall succeed in overcoming these economic difficulties. Development is within our reach.\n250.\tIn this manner we have proved that it is possible for a people to overthrow an oppressive regime, put an end to colonial domination and effect profound political, social and economic transformations, strengthening the bases of a civilization whose values are the corner-stones of all our actions. We shall thus remain faithful to the values.of liberty and respect for the human person.\n251.\tIt is to tell of the aspirations of the Portuguese people that I am speaking in this Assembly. On the internal as well as on the international plane the Portuguese people aspire to a more just society, a more worthy future. We have struggled a long time for these objectives and feel therefore that our words should be heard in a world that seeks the means of overcoming contradictions and difficulties and shares with us the same hopes.\n252.\tIt is the first time that the representative of Portugal has addressed this Assembly since the approval of the democratic Constitution in my country. This Constitution states the major principles that orient the foreign policy of the Portuguese Republic. Article 7 states that:\n\\\" 1. In its international relations, Portugal shall be governed by the principles of national independence, the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, equality among States, the peaceful settlement of inter-national disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and co-operation with all other peoples for the emancipation and progress of mankind.\n\\\"2. Portugal shall advocate the abolition of all forms of. imperialism, colonialism and aggression, simultaneous and controlled general disarmament, the dissolution of politico-military blocs and the establishment of a system of collective security, with a view to creating an inter-national order capable of safeguarding peace and justice in relations between peoples.\n\\\"3. Portugal recognizes the right of peoples to revolt against all forms of oppression, in particular colonialism and imperialism, and shall maintain special bonds of friendship and co-operation with the Portuguese-speaking countries.\\\"\n253.\tPortugal today is thus actively engaged in the search for ways that would enable the international community to abolish the scourges that afflict it and the dangers that threaten it so that it may reach a state in which violence, hatred, racism, terror, oppression, war and hunger will not be common happenings but, rather, rare and controllable exceptions.\n254.\tTherefore my country dedicates special attention to all efforts that can be made in the search for a new and more just international order.\n255.\tSituated in an area particularly sensitive to inter-national tensions, Portugal necessarily favors the relaxing of tensions between the great Powers as long as this is synonymous with security for the smaller nations. Respect for the dignity and essence of the diverse sovereignties is for us fundamental. The imperial arrogance of certain States today surely constitutes a factor of conflict and is no less lamentable for being almost always counter-productive.\n256.\tSmall country that we are, we are ready to defend the right to establish regional agreements capable of overcoming the persistent misapprehension that only the intervention of the great Powers can solve the most serious international conflicts.\n257.\tRecently Portugal became a member of the Council of Europe and signed the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. We are, as well, intensifying our contacts with the nations of the European Economic Community with a view to full membership in that organization.\n258.\tWe firmly believe in the possibility of constructing a democratic, strong and united Europe which would play a fundamental role in the resolution of world problems and would be a natural ally of the developing countries.\n259.\tSuccess in the construction of a united Europe, it seems to us, will be decisive in the construction of a new international order. Within that Europe we think we shall have a specific and fundamental role in the dialog with the other continents. For this we have unique prospects.\n260.\tThus it is fortunate that recently we attended, as invited guests, the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo, the conclusions of which are of such great importance to this thirty-first session of the General Assembly [see A/31/197J.\n261.\tThe concern to bring an end to colonial oppression and racial segregation, which dominated the work of that Conference, finds a profound echo in the Portuguese people.\n262.\tWith those nations we also share the desire to end the deterioration in commodity price levels and ultimately to create a new international economic order, the fundamental requisite for elimination of the injustices that afflict peoples and the contradictions that divide humanity.\n263.\tLike those nations, Portugal is concerned about the intensification of the arms race so often camouflaged behind pacifistic declarations and, with them, we should like to see consecrated international detente and the existence of zones where there would be no risk of violent confrontations.\n264.\tAlong these lines, Portugal will be especially sensitive to the outcome of the results achieved and enshrined in the Final act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and shares a particular interest in the future Belgrade meeting, where the application that has been made of these principles will be reviewed.\n265.\tPortugal will not refrain from participating intensively in this domain and believes that the small nations can now play a decisive role in the defence of the conditions of their security, so often different from those intended by the great Powers.\n266.\tA profoundly European and Atlantic country, Portugal is a member of NATO, and we are intent on remaining within the political and geographical parameters of !<at alliance, contributing our best. Meanwhile, we have a foreign policy open to other fronts and latitudes, and in the areas not covered by the Atlantic Alliance Portugal will practice its own policies.\n267.\tPortugal has a diverse and necessarily transcontinental foreign policy which is nothing more than the logical consequence of our position in the world, of the existence of Portuguese in the various latitudes and of the very expansion of the Portuguese language.\n268.\tWe express here our satisfaction at the fact that OAU, which maintains with the United Nations a status of frank co-operation, has recently included Portuguese among its official languages. Portugal considers this to be of significant importance. In truth, the fact that Portuguese is now considered an African language creates ties of deep intimacy with that great continent, whose present influence in international relations is clear, and on whose future the full process of liberation of men and nations depends. For the democratic Portugal that I represent here, the qualitative and quantitative transcontinental reality of the Portuguese language must shortly have its official dedication at the United Nations level: not only because of the fact that Portuguese is spoken in Europe, Africa and America by about 120 million people and exerts a cultural influence in Asia and Oceania -which would already be sufficient- but also because we are convinced that the Portuguese language will become progressively more important as a liberating instrument of men and of their ideological, technical, economic, social and political alienations.\n269.\tFor the democratic Portugal emergent from the revolution of 25 April 1974, this dimension of the Portuguese language as an emancipating instrument of humanity is essential to its own destiny.\n270.\tIn this regard, I would like to think I interpret here the desires of the statesmen of Brazil, Guinea-Bissau,\nMozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Angola. We hope besides that the representative of the People's Republic of Angola will shortly be able to speak the Portuguese language from this rostrum of the United Nations, in equality with the diverse States represented here. The Portuguese Government defends and actively supports admission of the People's Republic of Angola as a full Member of the United Nations. When a State remains outside the United Nations, it is always the United Nations that is incomplete.\n271.\tIn the international community, meanwhile, some problems continue to persist, and I would like to refer to them, as I believe they are of extreme concern.\n272.\tFor the anti-colonialist Portugal that I represent here, it would be a tragedy if the decolonization process that has already taken place were to give rise to new conflicts in southern Africa or, worse, if interests outside the African countries should come to dictate solutions to the current problems.\n273.\tIt is the interests of the nations of southern Africa that are in question in the situation that is now becoming critical in that area, and it is those interests, and no others, that must be held paramount in the solutions to be found. The profoundly negative influence of the policy of apartheid, contrary to internationally recognized human rights, shocks our conscience and constitutes a.factor of tension in that region of the world.\n274.\tWe hereby declare ourselves in favor of the independence of Namibia and of the rapid establishment of a majority government in Zimbabwe. We thus support all realistic efforts to bring about the necessary changes without leading to convulsions, whose spread could even aggravate the problems they are intended to resolve.\n275.\tWe also express our concern at the situation in the Middle East, where the Palestinian people continues to see the homeland to which it is entitled unjustly disputed. We support the rapid convocation of the Geneva Conference and hope that it will recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, as well as provide guarantees for the security of Israel.\n276.\tOn the other hand, it is imperative that an end be put to the tragedy in Lebanon, which has resulted in the loss of so many lives and spread so much suffering in a land that had been known for the peaceful and balanced coexistence of its diverse cultural communities.\n277.\tWe place the greatest hopes in the actions of the newly-elected President, as well as in continuation of the efforts of international institutions, particularly the League of Arab States, to restore peace to a people martyred by a violence unbroken by truces.\n278.\tThe question of Timor is, at the moment, before the United Nations, with which Portugal has fully co-operated in the efforts undertaken to apply the internationally accepted principles of self-determination and the right of peoples to determine their own future. The Portuguese Constitution also upholds these principles, specifically in the case of Timor.\n279.\tThe problem is now a matter for the effective application of the rights and duties recognized by the competent organs of the United Nations, it being certain that the Portuguese Government remains indisposed to recognize de jure the integration of East Timor within the territory of another State as a result of a unilateral decision. Meanwhile, we are ready to accept a consensus of the United Nations regarding this matter, for we are sure that it would be in accordance with the principles that have always guided the United Nations.\n280.\tAmong the causes of concern to my country, I would not like to omit reference to those that are related to world-wide economic problems and which derive from our desire to see launched a new international economic order.\n281.\tWe follow with the utmost attention the deliberations of the North-South Conference and hope that concrete directives will result from it so that we may progress along the rough road to more just economic relations.\n282.\tWe believe also that the new economic order to which we aspire should be based, above all, on the distribution and more equitable sharing of wealth, through correct appraisal of the necessities of each people and the internal resources of each country. Despite the progress already achieved, it is with concern that Portugal faces the fact that the fourth session of UNCTAD, which took place this year in Nairobi, was unable to resolve the problems related to the exploitation^ production and trade of raw materials and basic products. We also place the greatest importance on the question of the external debt of the developing countries, for we are convinced that this phenomenon has universal implications that can lead to imbalances incompatible with a harmonious ordering of international economic relations. Portugal, being neither an exporter of raw materials nor a highly industrialized country, is naturally attempting a realistic solution which would unite the various interests in question.\n283.\tI shall now turn to an important aspect of inter-national co-operation with which our President, Mr. Amerasinghe, is particularly involved. I refer to the questions arising out of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n284.\tThe technological advances achieved in the realm of fishing and in the exploration of the sea-bed, as well as the. contingencies of nations' geographic positions, demand that defense of natural resources and the environment in territorial waters be assured in sovereign terms. With respect to the future law regarding exploitation of mineral resources in the ocean depths, we are convinced of the necessity for an attitude of compromise between the differing and as yet immovable positions. Portugal will do everything within the negotiating groups of which it is a part to assist in overcoming the difficulties encountered at the Conference. Thus we understand the appeal of the President of the Conference that unilateral actions should be avoided in the near future. We are confident that the consensus that has already been reached in various areas will, during the sixth session, be extended to others.\n285.\tI would now like to make some comments regarding the role of the United Nations.\n286.\tI belong to a generation of Portuguese who were subjected to propaganda discrediting the United Nations by the dictatorial regime that was overthrown on 25 April 1974. The reasons for the fury against the United Nations are understandable: the principles that guide the United Nations are manifestly opposed to tyranny and the use of force in international relations. The previous regime relied for its support on those two pillars.\n287.\tHowever, the tendency shown at times in this forum to adopt resolutions in clear opposition to world realities solely by the arithmetical exercise of regimented majorities, or by simplistic stereotypes which bring discredit to their promoters, still remains a matter of serious concern. It is no less certain that the repeated use of the veto constitutes an abuse of the Organization by the practitioner. It is pressing, then, to consider carefully the economy of use of these decision-making instruments so as to guarantee for the United Nations the prestige and role that we all wish for it. Otherwise, it will result in a revision of the Charter, of undetermined scope, being imposed, the effects of which are not as yet predictable. We sincerely hope that all will guide their actions bearing in mind that the United Nations is the sole universal forum capable of exercising a pacifying influence upon the international community.\n288.\tThe fact that the politico-military blocs persist and that certain States seek to group themselves in movements pursuing interests that are not universal, based on ideological criteria or degrees of development must, however, be reflected on, although this inevitably means that this Organization, in which we place the best of our hopes, has not yet been able fully to carry out the ends for which it was envisaged.\n289.\tWe believe that in so far as we are able to advance in the concrete realization of the objectives of the United Nations Charter, we shall be contributing decisively to the abolition of the present divisions between peoples and removing the cause of the formation of politico-military blocs.\n290.\tWe think it thus essential to engage in all actions intended to provide effective protection for human rights, and are even willing to see the great moral principles to which we are bound prevail over barriers of national sovereignty.\n291.\tTherefore, we are pleased with the proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany for the drafting of a convention against the taking of hostages [A/31/242J. Portugal associates itself with this initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany in the spirit of defense of human rights and in order to safeguard security and international order. We oppose all forms of terrorism.\n292.\tIt is not surprising that we pay particular attention to matters connected with the protection of human rights. The experience of a dictatorial regime that ignored the most elementary guarantees and individual rights has shown us very well the importance of their recognition; clear and decisive provisions regarding this are enshrined in our Constitution.\n293.\tConsequently, my Government holds as one of its priorities on the international level the acceptance of the principal instruments approved by the United Nations, such as the human rights Covenants, which I have just signed on behalf of my Government. Portugal considers these texts and others wrought in the United Nations-for example, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [resolution 3452 (XXX)] -to be essential for understanding between societies and individuals.\n294.\tWe must seek, then, to act together in those areas which are the common aspirations of all peoples. One of these areas is clearly that of the defense of the dignity of the human person, carrier of the universality that we wish to attribute to the United Nations.\n295.\tThe United Nations represents and symbolizes an ancient dream of humanity, a dream of unity, peace, tolerance and understanding. This dream is far from being accomplished, but my Government and my country will be the last to underestimate the steps that have already been taken here in that direction or to diminish the efforts so that more and more substantial progress can be achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, the last President of the General Assembly, for the skill and patience he demonstrated during last year's difficult session of the General Assembly. It is also elementary justice for me to address to you, Mr. President, the tribute you so richly deserve on the unanimous election which has exalted you to the office of President of the thirty-first session of our Assembly. You are a man of experience, and your numerous qualities as a diplomat will be needed for the conduct of an Assembly which is so distinguished but sometimes so difficult and tempestuous in view of the frequently opposed interests of its members. In addition, we have no doubt that the team assisting you will put at your disposal its experience of international affairs and of debates in this temple of negotiation.\n70.\tLastly, I wish to congratulate Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim on the dedication with which he has carried out the mission entrusted to him by the world community. The undertaking is, of course, difficult, given the constant fluctuations in human affairs, but he has always been aware that we are at the beginning of a world where wisdom is more necessary than ever, a world where we have to surpass ourselves in order to escape from the beaten track of mediocrity and facility, a world where reprehensible greed and mercenary considerations frequently prevail over human logic.\n71.\tOnce again we are gathered in this Assembly in order to debate and find adequate solutions to the numerous problems besetting the world where fear of human folly, and faith in human intelligence are intermingled. In these terms, Upper Volta is prepared to make its contribution.\n72.\tFor decades now, the Organization has been waging its struggle for justice and freedom for mankind, and no one can deny that some successes have been achieved and that the Organization has even become the supreme hope of some. But the successes obtained here and there in the world by struggling peoples, directly or indirectly thanks to our Organization, should not be an occasion for awarding certificates of merit, or for patting oneself on the back. We may certainly rejoice, however, because the victory of peoples, wherever they may be, is our victory.\n73.\tHence we cannot but applaud the great successes of the liberation struggle in Africa and elsewhere. Events of considerable importance have occurred in this field, in which the colonialist forces have been vanquished. In this connexion, we are happy to hail the independence of Seychelles and its admission to the United Nations.\n74.\tThus also we are happy that peace has been restored in Viet Nam and Cambodia, and that those countries have recovered their lost unity. At the same time, we may rightly question the non-admission to our Organization of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola. Those two countries are independent and have all the attributes of sovereignty. In our view, the veto of their admission to the United Nations by a permanent member of the Security Council is an inexplicable abuse of that exorbitant right which certain countries have arrogated to themselves and which is increasingly being questioned because of its misuse.\n75.\tThat is why it would also be dangerous to forget that what we consider to be gains have frequently been achieved outside this Organization, and sometimes in spite of it, because some among us still cling to unjust and dangerous privileges. The task to be performed remains immense, and it may be time we thought about revising our working methods, as well as our thinking methods. In spite of the great speeches that have been pronounced for years, the problems of war and peace, of hunger, of elementary justice and the right of peoples to self-determination still await appropriate solutions. Let me mention a few examples.\n76.\tIs not the constant challenge that the minority regimes of southern Africa have been flinging at our Organization for more than a quarter of a century striking?\n77.\tIndeed, in that part of the African continent, the barbarous apartheid regime, despite the support of Western countries, is beginning to choke within a system that is becoming increasingly unbearable to it. But it would be foolish to believe that it is prepared to make due apology before the international community. Quite the contrary, and as everyone knows, South Africa's racist policy has intensified and consists in aggression against neighboring AM m countries abroad and in force repression of the opponents of apartheid at home, the number of dead in Soweto, Alexandra and Johannesburg, and the relentless attacks against Namibia, Zambia and Mozambique are eloquent testimony to this.\n78.\tWhile Vorster, Ian Smith and. those who support them are ferociously attacking the blacks, we talk here of preserving human rights; we vote with difficulty in favor of resolutions that have been laboriously studied and that remain, all too frequently, unimplemented. Should the situation in that part of Africa remain the living image of the powerlessness of our Organization?\n79.\tHas history not already caught us out on the solution of this problem? In any event, the populations of that region know what they want. Their rebellion, which has only just started, is the natural conclusion of a process set in motion as soon as the policy of apartheid was devised. The maneuvers, the intimidations, the imprisonments, the tortures and the massacres will change nothing therein.\n80.\tThe solution of the South African, Namibian and Rhodesian problems is to be found only in majority rule. If we are far-sighted, and if we act now, that solution may still be a peaceful one. But if some still obstinately cling to their selfish interests in the region, that solution will necessarily be achieved by violence. The alternative is therefore clear: as far as we Africans are concerned, it is our duty to support our brethren fighting for their freedom, regardless of the form of their combat.\n81.\tIn the Middle East, might continues to prevail over right. The Israeli-Arab conflict is going through a period of deceptive calm which is belied from time to time by the demonstrations of the frustrated Palestinian population deprived of its inalienable rights, whereas Israel has established itself unconcernedly, in spite of unanimous disapproval, in the territories which it occupied by force in 1967.\n82.\tSince the disengagement agreement of last year, no notable progress has been made towards peace.\n83.\tMy country's position on this problem is well known: as we said last year,  over and above the evacuation of the occupied Arab territories, the establishment of a lasting peace in that region must include the recognition and, above all, the satisfaction of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This means that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem must be based upon an over-all solution which will take into account all aspects of the problem. In this regard, the report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [A/31/35] ought to be given serious consideration.\n84.\tIn the same region, we are preoccupied with the problem of Lebanon. While it is true that this country has always contained within itself the seeds of confrontation, we are bound to recognize that the international community has not made any appropriate efforts to resolve this problem, which has been complicated and envenomed by interested parties, either near or distant from the conflict, in disregard of peace and of human lives. We express the hope that this great people once again may find within itself the strength to rise above its own internal rivalries.\n85.\tThe Korean peninsula has seen tension rise suddenly in the course of the present year, 1976. While the two parts of this country agree that they have the same objective, namely, the unification of the country, it turns out, however, that the ways and means of reaching that objective are very divergent. There is one thing that is quite certain, namely, that we in Upper Volta have constantly asserted over the years that the Korean problem must be resolved peacefully between the Koreans themselves and without any foreign intervention or rivalry. Our position is based upon the following principles: the non-transferral of conflicts into developing countries; the denial of military bases, wherever they may be; and, finally, the fact that nothing can be solved without the consent of the people concerned.\n86.\tThis is why we believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in this region is necessary, indeed, vital, to peace and that the large-scale introduction of modern weapons there is dangerous.\n87.\tFurther, all the parties concerned should initiate talks to replace the Armistice Agreement, which has lasted for 23 years, with a peace agreement or any other arrangement capable of safeguarding peace in this region.\n88.\tSimilarly, Cyprus has so far not been able to overcome its internal crisis brought about by foreign invasion. In spite of the resolutions of the non-aligned countries and of the United Nations, it seems that the island has been engaged in a process of partition which may bode ill. We reaffirm that the territorial integrity, independence and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus must be safeguarded and that the problems which arise between the two communities on the island must be settled in a spirit of understanding and in the best interests of the country as a whole.\n89.\tLastly, with respect to the Comoros we should reject any attempt that would jeopardize the territorial integrity of this State Member of the United Nations.\n90.\tOn the economic plane the situation is no better.\n91.\tIndeed, over and above the problems to which I have just referred and which are a source of fundamental concern, the changes which have recently taken place in international relations have produced a battlefield where the outcome of the struggle will be just as decisive for the peaceful coexistence which we are trying to install and to safeguard among nations.\n92.\tContemporary economic crises have conferred a preponderant role upon international economic and trade relations, which have become a primary factor in the strengthening of international peace and security.\n93.\tIt is beyond challenge that the achievement of a new, more just and more equitable economic order will call for fundamental changes in the traditional patterns of economic and trade relations.\n94.\tThe crises of the 1970s have forced us to observe that growth theories of the time which so far have determined the overall approach to the problems of development have brought about neither a decrease in the poverty of the masses, nor the end of exploitation, nor social equality, nor the guarantee of the right to work.\n95.\tIt is in order to contribute effectively to the required structural changes that the third world has tirelessly been taking an active part in the various international conferences that have taken place these past years and which have touched upon all fields -the environment and the habitat; population and employment; industrialization; food problems; the law of the sea and other sectoral problems of trade and development.\n96.\tBut while the developing countries are honestly and assiduously looking for negotiated solutions to these problems by means of dialog and consultation, the developed countries are opposed to them and are imposing on them a dialog of the deaf.\n97.\tUpper Volta is open to dialog but will not counte-nance having a dialog used as a diversionary weapon or, in the last analysis, as a means for evading concrete action. All dialog should be based on the real political will of the parties involved to set up just and democratic international economic relations in accordance with the objectives of the new international economic order.\n98.\tUnfortunately, however, certain developed countries are not ready to accept the fundamental structural trans-formations that are called for by the new international economic order. These countries are attempting by all means to block the just demands and rational proposals put forward by the developing countries to put an end to a system which has produced the prosperity of a minority at the expense of the poverty of the great majority.\n99.\tThe developed countries should accept the need for a fundamental transformation at their own levels. Going beyond mere tolerance or acceptance of the proposals of the Group of 77, they should become agents consciously doing everything possible so that we might achieve the objectives which the international community is urgently calling for.\n100.\tUnfortunately, there are numerous important and urgent undertakings which require political will on the part of the developed countries in order to be implemented. As our Secretary-General said at the sixty-first session of the Economic and Social Council at Abidjan:\n\\\"Even though, in the dialogs in progress, the inter-related concepts of a better integrated world economy and a dynamic international division of labor have been gaining recognition and support, the concrete actions taken to ease the entry of goods from developing countries into the markets of the industrialized world have not yet been of such a scope and magnitude as to permit' the developing countries to find their adequate place in a global setting.\\\"s\n101.\tThe developing countries have put forward concrete proposals with a view to achieving solutions of their most important and most urgent problems-commodity trade, the transfer of resources, industrialization, the transfer of technology and increased agricultural production, and support of the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their cooperation.\n102.\tIt would not be possible to say that the developing countries have not displayed the necessary political will in trying to find solutions to the highly important economic problems that affect the international community as a whole either at their level or on a wider scale. Thus the developing countries have held conferences in Manila, in Istanbul, in Colombo and last month in Mexico. The developed as well as the developing countries have also had meetings in Nairobi, New York, Abidjan and Geneva with the purpose of achieving more effective cooperation.\n103.\tWe are still prepared to make the necessary efforts to bring about a consensus through, dialog, and we hope that there is no more undue temporizing.\n104.\tIn spite of all the serious efforts that have been made during the past few years in the work of identifying the fundamental needs of the developing countries in order to enable them to participate in a way that is their due and with equity, justice and mutual respect, in finding a more harmonious mode of life on our planet, the modest goals for growth adopted for the 1970s seem today to be largely jeopardized.\n105.\tThus we have noted that the relative progress of the first few years of the decade is in a phase of dangerous deceleration. The mean growth rate in the majority of the developing countries is barely 3 per cent, and the per capita annual growth in real income is 0.3 per cent, whereas the goal set for the Second United Nations Development Decade is 3.5 per cent. These rates have been reduced by about one third between 1973 and 1975. Worse still, the least developed countries are in a state of net loss, and Upper Volta is all too well aware of this.\n106.\tThe exports of developing countries have increased on the average by somewhat less than 4 per cent per year, which is a figure much lower than the goal of 7 per cent set for the Second Development Decade. In the past two years exports of commodities of developed countries have in-creased by 3 per cent, whereas those of the developing countries have decreased by 6 per cent.\n107.\tThe trade deficit of the majority of these countries has gone from $34 billion in 1974 to $45 billion in 1975. The burden of debt servicing has constantly increased; the external debt servicing has reached 15 per cent of the value of the exports of developing countries.\n108.\tForeign aid received by these countries is not sufficient to cover debt servicing. The deficit in the balance of payments, which stood at $12 billion in 1973, has gone up to $45 billion in 1975. As far as the Africans are concerned, whereas globally there have been surpluses in their balance of payments of the order of $600 million in 1973, these surpluses were converted into deficits of the order of $150 million in 1974, and the deficit for 1975 is to be higher still.\n109.\tTo this already disturbing situation we must add the hardening of credit terms; and this causes us to fear grave difficulties for a number of developing countries.\n110.\tThe financing needs of the developing countries up to the end of the present decade would amount to $60 billion, and yet, paradoxically, the world which allocated only some $15 billion to public aid for development in 1975 is the very same world which every year spends $300 billion for \\\"defence requirements\\\".\n111.\tWith respect to technical assistance, the United Nations Development Program [UNDP], of which we expect much, has not the necessary resources to face up effectively to the new tasks that the States have entrusted to it. The lack of resources explains the drastic revision of the plans and programs for 1975 and 1976 which have affected even such countries as my own, which should have been sheltered from such measures in view of our particular situation. Thus, for countries receiving UNDP assistance, at the end of the first programming cycle the rate of project execution will in terms be lower than what it was at the beginning of the cycle in 1972.\n112.\tWe shall continue to draw the special attention of the international community to the specific situation of the less developed countries and the land-locked countries. The special measures provided for their benefit will not have the expected effect unless the developed countries are moved by the necessary political will to mobilize and combine over the next four years the necessary technical and financial means for the bringing about of the structural transformations that their economic situations require. Without such a surgical operation, we doubt that the palliatives now being used or contemplated will live up to the expectations of the international community.\n113.\tIn this respect, we are pleased with the special efforts made by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and UNCTAD to help the least developed countries in their search for solutions that are best suited to their particular circumstances in the fields of industrialization and trade.\n114.\tThis is also the occasion for us to thank here all the developed or developing countries which, either bilaterally or multilaterally, have spared no effort to help us to solve our structural and current problems. We hope that they will continue their actions so as to make it possible for us to have the assistance that we need to solve our present difficulties and start the subsequent phases of our economic and social development.\n115.\tTherefore we continue to have great need of financial assistance on the most favorable terms possible, since the sectors which receive our investments are not sectors in which the criterion of economic profitability can be rigorously applied. This applies in particular to our investments in the agricultural sector, which are designed to ensure the food equilibrium of our populations.\n116.\tThe efforts of the developing countries to reach a higher level of agricultural production have not been crowned with success. The annual growth rate has reached only 2 to 2.5 per cent, which is less than the rate of 3 per cent achieved during the first decade. The goal for the present decade is 4 per cent.\n117.\tThe result was that there were net imports of cereals of developing countries which amounted to 39 million tons in 1974-1975, that is, approximately 13 per cent of the domestic production; that, in turn, means a percentage twice as high as that at the beginning of the decade. Today the developing countries are more generally dependent on imports of cereals than at the beginning of the decade. This situation is aggravated by a persistent drought that is frustrating the efforts of the countries concerned.\n118.\tIn the light of those considerations, the developed countries should have redoubled their efforts so that the International Fund for Agricultural Development might become operational as soon as possible. Meanwhile, inter-national action should continue, in accordance with the recommendations of the World Food Conference,  in the following way: to aid the countries concerned to face the shortages caused by the drought and by other natural catastrophes; and to meet the requirements of the countries having food deficits.\n119.\tWe reiterate our urgent appeal to the developed countries to provide the additional necessary support so that the International Fund for Agricultural development, which has generated so much hope, can start its primary task without further delay. This is an occasion for us to speak of the United Nations Conference on Desertification, to be held in 1977. We hope most sincerely that the preparatory work and the regional meetings will make ii possible for us to have an action-oriented instrument on the basis of which the international community will find it possible to launch a merciless struggle against this phenomenon whose danger to our planet is increasingly more obvious. It is a struggle which could quite appropriately be associated with the one whose purpose is to intensify agricultural production.\n120.\tIn connexion with this fourth decade of the existence of the United Nations, optimism as we enter it is not exuberant; indeed, the challenges of peace and development have not been taken up, owing to a certain selfishness which manifests itself in international relations. However, we should not lose courage because we have imagination and the human and material resources necessary for our action. But each one of us must resolutely commit himself to wage this noble and ideal struggle to free two thirds of mankind from poverty, exploitation, ignorance and domination.\n"

        "file_text": "The election of Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe to preside over this session of the General Assembly has been a source of satisfaction to the delegation of Costa Rica. The outstanding work which he carried out as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has already established him as one of the most skillful diplomats of our Organization. I am sure that Mr. Amerasinghe will guide the debates of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly with the same skill an d impartiality.\n3.\tI should like at the same time to express my congratulations to Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the outstanding manner in which he presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n4.\tAs in past years, the introduction to the report submitted to this session by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, [A/3111/Add. 1] will serve as a most important guide for our deliberations. I should like once again to pay a tribute to Secretary-General Waldheim and to express my admiration for the courage, intelligence and honesty with which he has analyzed the problems of the world-courage, intelligence and honesty which are in keeping with the admirable manner in which he has carried out his lofty functions. For that reason, Costa Rica wishes his re-election.\n5.\tMy delegation adheres sincerely and without political calculations to the principle of universality of the United Nations. We are convinced that it is fitting that any independent State which undertakes to comply with the Charter of the United Nations should be a Member of this Organization. Our delegation does not believe that the admission of new States should depend upon the sympathy or the antipathy that is felt for the ideology of its Government, or that an affirmative vote to admit it should depend upon the solution of bilateral problems between a State seeking admission and one or several Member States.\n6.\tFor that reason, Costa Rica regrets that the recommendation for admission to the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam should have been vetoed in the Security Council. This new State, which has emerged from the fusion of the two States that were for a time those of North Vietnam and South Vietnam, which for so many years suffered the scourge of a cruel civil war, should not meet with any obstacles to enter an Organization such as ours which has as its first purpose the maintenance of peace and, its corollary, co-operation with the nations which need to recover from the afflictions of war.\n7.\tFor similar reasons, Costa Rica regrets that the Security Council has not recommended the admission requested by the Republic of Korea (South Korea).\n8.\tI wish to extend the warmest welcome to this Assembly to the representatives of the youngest Member, the Republic of Seychelles. This new State was privileged to attain its full independence and sovereignty in peaceful conditions. Although small in area, the Republic of Seychelles has always been a focal point for various civilizations and a land of multiracial harmony. For those reasons, we believe that the Republic of Seychelles, upon becoming the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of the Organization, will inject vigor and flexibility into our Organization.\n9.\tThe United Nations entrusted the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea with the most important legislative task that it has undertaken. To create a harmonious juridical body to govern two thirds of the globe's surface is no easy task. The extensive and complicated nature of the subject, as well as the important interests at play, made the venture difficult.\n\n10.\tThe fifth session of the Conference saw 33 weeks of negotiation and effective work devoted to the formulation of the new law of the sea. But that great effort did not produce complete agreement on such difficult questions as the legal status of the exclusive economic zone, the jurisdiction of the coastal State with regard to scientific research in the seas adjacent to its coasts and, above all, with regard to the system to be adopted for the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor, which are the common heritage of mankind.\n11.\tCosta Rica trusts that when the negotiations are officially resumed in May 1977 delegations will be prepared to reach positive results. To that end they must give up positions that have been described as intransigent and extreme. It must be borne in mind that compromise is the basis for international progress. Those who adhere to their own theses forget that what seems to one country the greatest justice can seem to another the greatest injustice. Relative satisfaction of the theses of each nation and hence relative unsatisfaction is the only way that can lead to progress in negotiations in which each party is a sovereign State.\n12.\tUnfortunately I must repeat this year the concern expressed in the past six years by Costa Rica at the lack of solutions to the problem of the arms race: each day nuclear proliferation becomes more evident; each day there is an increase in the number of tests of nuclear weapons; each day more progress is made in the manufacture of instruments of mass destruction. That is why our Secretary-General states the following in the introduction to his annual report for 1976:\n\\\"I make no apology for restating here the eloquent fact that, while the world spends approximately $300 billion a year on armaments, the net flow of official development assistance amounts to some $15 billion a year. Resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the 1976 gross national product of the entire world.\\\" [A/31/l/Add.l, sect. V.J\n13.\tOur concern about the arms race led us to give warm support to the proposal of the delegation of Sweden for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on the review of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. The General Assembly at its thirtieth session welcomed the Swedish proposal and established the Committee [resolution 3484 B (XXX)]. My delegation has participated with all due interest in the. work of that Committee. We hope that, with the support of all the members, it will be able to attain before it is too late the objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. This international control, which some States fear, is an indispensable guarantee for the progress of disarmament negotiations.\n14.\tThe delegation of Costa Rica has noted with satisfaction the withdrawal of two proposals on the question of Korea,  which were decidedly incompatible. We should like to state that we supported that withdrawal because we believe that it will facilitate the renewal of a peaceful dialog between the parties.\n15.\tI have repeatedly set forth my country's position, which has been constantly in favor of the peaceful reunification of the former Korean nation, today divided into two antagonistic States, and I have maintained that the best path to that goal of peaceful reunification is direct negotiations between the parties.\n16.\tThe history of the United Nations in the promotion of human rights suffices in itself to justify the very existence of our Organization. The San Francisco Charter solemnly and categorically laid down the protection of the basic freedoms of the human being as one of the supreme purposes of the Member States. It therefore gave a legal status to the revolutionary concept that has converted the individual, the human being in each and every country without distinction as to race, religion, sex or political beliefs, into the main subject of international relations.\n17.\tThe upheavals that have led to the violation of human rights in various parts of the world have been coming increasingly before the United Nations. No one can expect that our Organization will remain deaf for ever to this clamor. Thus we have seen the way opened to the concept that the purely moral, normative value of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights within the United Nations should develop until the goal is attained of binding Members to the principle of the mandatory observance of a broad range of basic human rights.\n18.\tThat was the very raison d'etre of the approval by our Assembly of the International Covenants on Human Rights. Those Covenants and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex] entered into effect this year thanks to the ratification by one fourth of the membership of the United Nations. Among those countries that have ratified is of course the country that I have the honor of representing.\n19.\tIt can be stated that, at least in that part of the world which includes the States that have ratified those Covenants, there is already machinery protecting human rights that has the force of law. That is a significant attainment; it is perhaps the most solid achievement of this Organization since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted some 27 years ago.\n20.\tHowever, the \\\"sphere of application of the Covenants is limited to a part rather than comprising all of the countries represented in this Organization. Many States have not ratified these Covenants, and we hope that they will do so soon as an earnest of their willingness to improve their internal situation in regard to fundamental freedoms.\n21.\tWith an annoying and even dangerous frequency, which exceeds the bounds of normalcy, many States are acting in flagrant violation of the human rights that they themselves have proclaimed. This causes indignation and discouragement; it is a flagrant sign of hypocrisy. The very Governments which angrily rise up as champions of fundamental freedoms to speak against real or alleged violations by other regimes sometimes violate human rights in their own countries. Hence, we must urge that the machinery of effective international trusteeship be put into operation.\n22.\tFor that reason, Costa Rica has maintained in the United Nations that we should not fall victim to political games or be taken in by the hypocrisy of false defenders of human rights and that we must create an adequate organization which, in an institutional form, will deal with the violation of such rights in any part of the world. That function will have to be carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, whose appointment we have been requesting in the United Nations for almost 15 years.\n23.\tThe absence of adequate jurisdiction in this respect has led us to mistrust certain initiatives that have gained the approval of various majorities of this Assembly for the investigation of denunciations of violations of human rights in certain countries of the world. This reservation of ours should not be interpreted as an exoneration of those countries against which charges have been leveled. Our reservation is due to the fact that we think there is a lack of sincerity in those who have made denunciations, among which are to be found many Governments guilty in this respect, and to the selective nature of the investigations. There have been established special commissions with the single task of investigating violations of human rights in a given country whose Government has an ideology opposed to that of those making the denunciations. But obviously an investigating committee is not authorized to carry out the same task in the accusing countries or to investigate other countries with whose Governments they sympathize, despite the obvious and flagrant fact that their peoples do not have the basic attributes of freedom. We are thus violating the necessary objectivity with which the Organization should deal with the problem of the violation of human rights, and therefore there may be a distortion of this noble cause of which, I repeat, our Organization may well be proud.\n24.\tWe must recognize that in today's world torture, degrading treatment and cruel punishment, which have been outlawed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, constitute a system of relations practiced by no less than 60 countries Members of this Organization, according to the research that has been conscientiously carried out by Amnesty International.\n25.\tWe have become reconciled and accustomed to fear as a result of the torture and repression of our fellowmen of which not a few Member States are proud. It is claimed that these are appropriate instruments to maintain the established order, whatever maybe the nature of such an order. They are used by the colonizer to prevent the colonized from rising up to acquire their proper rights. They are used by Governments which proclaim themselves revolutionary in order to avoid the replacement of their systems by other ideologies. They are used by conservative Governments to avoid the undermining of the status quo. And thus human rights are flouted in their very essence, and very often in the way most affecting the individual, in the psychological realm of fear and despair.\n26. Official and State torture as an instrument for extracting information and cowing opposition cannot continue to be accepted among civilized nations. Institutional violence must be brought to an end. It is a form of terrorism covered with the mantle of governmental power.\nAs long as a State must use fear, physical violence or psychological torture to maintain the established order, the United Nations will not have erased the ignominy of what today we call \\\"the civilization of the concentration camps\\\".\n27.\tWe must accept as a norm of conduct that to admit one single case of repression or institutionalized torture, whatever its so-called justification, is to accept a gross disregard of human dignity, and to abdicate our own rational nature.\n28.\tLike a lethal epidemic terrorism continues to spread throughout the world, claiming innocent victims in all latitudes.\n29.\tHardly a week ago, terrorism stretched to the very capital of the United States and cut off the life of a great Chilean exile, Orlando Letelier. The friendship which for many years bound me to the former Chilean Minister is not the only thing which leads me to mention his case. Rather, it is the bomb which put an end to his courageous life, the most recent example of terrorist bestiality, it is that bestiality which impels me to condemn terrorism wherever it occurs and whatever may be its motivation. This mixture of fanaticism and cold passion, this temptation to be for a moment more powerful than the most powerful, makes terrorism, as an eminent Venezuelan author has said, the most dangerous of drugs; it is a drug that, instead of creating artificial paradises, creates true hells on earth.\n30.\tThe Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, in 1972 asked our Assembly to study the problem of international terrorism and to propose a formula to combat it.  But the blind passion of a few prevailed over sensible proposals, and a mechanical majority submitted amendments to the item, with the intention of introducing, before the debate began, the idea that a system of terror could be regarded as a plausible political instrument. Costa Rica energetically rejected the attempts to justify the unjustifiable. I maintained then that we have a responsibility to do something effective against international terrorism, but instead we became enmeshed in an almost academic debate about its definition and causes. My words, like those of many others not blinded by passion, were lost in a vacuum and by means of procedural maneuvers all practical action by our Organization against international terrorism was rendered impossible.\n31.\tBut hardly two months ago in the Security Council there was a shudder in the face of the powerful \\\"j'accuse\\\" against these acts expressed by the Ambassador of Israel, Chaim Herzog, a \\\"j'accuse\\\" which recalled the clamor of the Jews in Auschwitz, Dachau or Bergen-Belsen.\n32.\tThe occasion which provoked that outburst is well known to us all. It was the glorious rescue of the Israeli citizens that were kept as hostages under criminal conditions and the unspeakable accusations which were leveled against Israel for having, by a brilliant exploit, encroached upon the sovereignty of a State whose Government had warmly received the hijackers and had illegally retained the innocent victims.\n33.\tThe \\\"j'accuse\\\" of this new Emile Zola of Israel compels us not to forget the Jewish tragedy and the brutality of terrorism. The historic .birth of this Assembly resulted from the bloodshed, grief and tragedy suffered by 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis, as well as the 40 million other human beings who perished during the Second World War. Very many of them gave up their lives in the belief that they were thus helping to preserve the dignity of the human person, regardless of origin, race or religion.\n34.\tIn Hitler's day this Assembly did not exist. Many could hide behind ignorance of the acts to excuse their silence, but religious, political, racial or economic arguments could not excuse their participation in the genocide which culminated in places such as Treblinka and Dachau.\n35.\tBut today it is not possible to justify inaction and silence in the face of murderous terrorism. The action at Entebbe has shown us a new path.\n36.\tAs Ambassador Herzog, exclaimed before the Security Council:\n\\\"... I stand here as an accuser on behalf of free and decent people in this world.\n\\\"I stand here as an accuser against the forces of evil which Have unleashed a wave of piracy and terrorism which threatens the very foundations of human society.\n\\\"I stand here as an accuser of all those ... which in their inherent cowardice and abject craven attitude see blameless wayfarers ... a legitimate target.. .\\\".\n37.\tBefore history and my own conscience I want to make it quite clear that the respect for international law which has traditionally prevailed in my country, Costa Rica, has made us vigorously reject the pretension that force can create law, or that intimidation or indiscriminate violence are suitable instruments of international policy. Today, once again, I refuse to accept that there is any validity to resorting to terrorism, either as a form of protest or to attain justice. On behalf of my country, which prides itself in being one of the most tolerant, I vehemently reject terrorism and its cruel persecution of millions of human victims.\n38.\tMy delegation has always insisted that we investigate' the causes of terrorism in order to seek remedies to them, but we refuse to permit the more than 30 years of humanitarian work of this Assembly to be frustrated by procedural machinations, disputes about terminology or by the outrageous condoning of crimes against humanity when they are directed against certain countries. The protection of future victims and the punishment of terrorist offenders cannot await the solution of philological disquisitions.\n39.\tThat is one of the reasons why our Organization is today in the dock of the accused. Mankind will have to judge it according to its behavior on this occasion. Will this Organization be absolved if it fails to react against terrorism? Can this Assembly go to the extreme of condemning the Israeli action in Entebbe and at the same time refrain from taking measures against air hijackers?\n40.\tI shall not dwell on the legal considerations applicable to the case, as they have already been fully and brilliantly expounded. I wish only to repeat that .Israel had the duty, and therefore the right, to defend its citizens, as long as it acted within reasonable limits. And in the Entebbe action, such limits were respected: there was proportionality between the threat of murder of the hostages and the reaction to prevent it, as prescribed by the universally accepted juridical rules of self-defense.\n41.\tThe fact that the rescue action undertaken by Israel gave rise to a wave of support and enthusiasm in all countries of the world, enemies as well as friends of the Jewish State, reveals the existence of a desire to repudiate terrorism in any part of the world. Free men and women have said: \\\"We have had enough indiscriminate hijackings and murders.\\\" This is the response to a deep conviction of every civilized man that terrorism is bad for everyone, in every case and on all occasions, whoever may be the perpetrator or the victim.\n42.\tNeither this Assembly nor its members will have any excuse if we fail to heed the new appeal made to us in his report this year by Secretary-General Waldheim that effective action against international terrorism be taken during this session [see [A/31/1 /Add. 1, sect. VI].\n43.\tThe issue which should occupy this Assembly is not what happened in Entebbe but our own future in the eyes of history. We must demonstrate to the world that the scourge of terrorism can be halted. It is up to the nations of the whole world irrespective of the political differences existing between them, to unite against the common enemy which is terrorist barbarism to unite as they did against Hitler and his \\\"supermen\\\"; to unite against the terrorist monster which recognizes no authority, respects no borders, which tramples sovereignty and which makes a mockery of basic, elementary human decency with its crude bestiality.\n44.\tI urge this Assembly to declare war on international terrorism, to outlaw it and eradicate it once and for all, wherever it may break out.\n45.\tAs I still have great faith in the United Nations, I do not think it necessary to convene countries that love peace and justice outside the context of this Organization in a crusade against terrorism. The fight must be waged here, within the United Nations itself, and with the consensus of all nations which, in becoming part of the United Nations, subscribed to the noble principles of the San Francisco Charter.\n46.\tIsrael may feel proud of having set a precedent in the fight against international terrorism a precedent applicable against aerial hijackers in any part of the world, irrespective of the victims or the perpetrators.\n47.\tThere is no room in the future history of this Assembly for opportunist, equivocal attitudes, which are amoral because considerations of convenience or cowardice are unjustifiable; nor can there be any without prejudicing the dignity of its Members, whether from north or south, east or west. We have had enough words, and more than enough hesitations. What is necessary is action glorious deeds such as the Entebbe action which would be the most powerful antidote to the poison of air piracy and international terrorism.\n48.\tThe news reaching us from Southern Rhodesia has logically evoked a note of cautious optimism at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The speech of Prime Minister Ian Smith on 24 September has opened the way to the peaceful capitulation of the most racist and aberrant of the minority Governments. If in Rhodesia we manage to achieve an orderly and rapid transition to majority Government, the United Nations will have marked up not only a clear victory against racial discrimination, but also a triumph of diplomatic negotiation as an effective substitute for violence.\n49.\tWe can acknowledge with satisfaction that during the 11 years of existence of the illegal Southern Rhodesia regime the United Nations has not failed for a single instant to exert all of its moral and legal influence in order to put an end to a State which has tried to declare itself independent for the single purpose of maintaining the domination of the white minority over the black majority.\n50.\tIf that regime is brought to an end rapidly by peaceful means, our Organization will have taken a great step forward in the fight for international justice, which will have a decisive influence on the establishment of majority Governments in the whole of Africa.\n51.\tCosta Rica wishes, through me, to congratulate Secretary of State Kissinger, Foreign Minister Crosland and all of the African leaders who have co-operated in paving the way for the success of the peace efforts, which had seemed to be an impossible mission.\n"

        "file_text": "The thirty-first session of the General Assembly is an auspicious occasion for the Commonwealth. It is particularly gratifying to the United Kingdom that the President of this session should be not only a distinguished and longstanding servant of the United Nations but also an outstanding representative of a Commonwealth country. I extend to you, Mr. President, the warm congratulations of my Government on your election. At the same time, I should like to pay my country's tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for his unremitting efforts over the last five years to promote peace and international understanding.\n44.\tI also take pleasure in welcoming here for the first time the Republic of Seychelles, a country whose membership in the United Nations was sponsored by the United Kingdom and by fellow members of the Commonwealth [A/31/L.1 and Add.l and 2]. I take this opportunity to convey my Government's thanks for the kind words of the President of Seychelles in his address to the Assembly last week [1st meeting].\n45.\tIt is self-evident that the British Government's foreign policy should reflect the values of the British people themselves. We in Britain are trying to create a society based on the ideals of morality, equality and justice, the United Kingdom is no less committed to these ideals in its foreign policy.\n46.\tThis is a fundamental fact which shapes my Government's attitude to the great challenges facing the international community today: the search for peace; the establishment of a proper economic balance between developed and developing countries; the promotion of human rights; and the maintenance of the rule of law. It is appropriate that on my first visit to the General Assembly as British Foreign Secretary I should at the outset reaffirm unequivocally my country's commitment to support and sustain the efforts which are being made to meet these challenges.\n47.\tThis is also a pledge of support for the United Nations itself. More than ever before, the problems that confront our societies can be effectively tackled only on a regional, or even a global, basis. \\\"Interdependence\\\" is a fashionable word; it is on everybody's lips these days-but rightly so. There is not a nation represented here today that can confidently assure its security and prosperity in isolation. With universal membership as its ultimate goal, with international co-operation and the peaceful settlement of disputes as its ideals; and with its ability to offer the world's nations a forum in which they can discuss their problems freely and openly, the United Nations is uniquely placed to meet the challenges of an interdependent world. That is why today, as over the last 31 years, support for the United Nations is an axiom of British foreign policy.\n48.\tIt would be invidious to arrange these challenges according to some neat order of priorities. We need to meet them all if we are to create the better world we seek. The deprivation of human rights is just as offensive to human dignity as economic deprivation. The establishment of the rule of law is inseparable from the establishment of conditions of peace and security.\n49.\tBut, this said, the relationship between the developed and developing countries is a matter of particular concern to the international community at the present time. Tue gap between the rich and the poor countries is not just a matter of economics; it is a moral question which requires a firm and principled stand. The United Kingdom's position was demonstrated when, in July, at a time of severe economic pressures, we exempted one programme, and one programme alone, from the widespread cuts in public expenditure-the overseas aid programme. Within this programme, moreover, it is our policy to put increasing emphasis on the poorer countries; and not just the poorer countries, but the poorest people in those countries. For when we say that we want a fair and rational world economic system in the management of which the developing countries will have their proper share, we mean also that the poor countries of the world should obtain a new deal, which enables them to offer their peoples the prospect of lives no longer dominated by hunger and chronic insufficiency.\n50. Now we should not belittle what has already been achieved in the comparatively short time since the seventh special session of the General Assembly last year. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation has now resumed its detailed work in the four critical areas of energy, raw materials, development, and finance; and I hope that this work will culminate in a successful ministerial conference at the end of the year and in a major and positive step forward in the north-south dialogue. The fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in May, for all the initial difficulties which beset it, also marked a significant stage in this dialogue. Eleven out of 13 resolutions  were adopted by consensus and an important programme of work was set in train to which the United Kingdom is determined to contribute positively. There- have also been major international monetary reforms to the benefit of the poorer countries. So something, though not enough, has been achieved in the past 12 months.\n51. It is especially pleasing to the United Kingdom that the European Community has taken effective action in this field I welcome the words of the Netherlands Foreign Minister, speaking on behalf of the Community, when he addressed the Assembly last week [7th meeting]. Of particular significance was his reference to an outward- looking Europe. For Britain, an essential justification for the Community's very existence and for our membership of it is that it should play an active and constructive role in the world, so enabling its member States to contribute more effectively to the solution of international problems than if they were acting on their own. The Community has played just such a role in the dialogue between the developed and developing worlds, deploying its collective economic strength to excellent effect. In his speech, Mr. van der Stoel rightly stressed the importance of the Lome Convention,  which grants, as representatives know, preferential access to Community markets to some 50 developing countries and offers a scheme for the stabilization of export earnings for certain raw materials. In recent years, the Community has also steadily improved its generalized scheme of preferences, a scheme which is revised every year and is now of particular benefit to the poorer countries. And, of course, at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, the Community speaks for all its nine members.\n52. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has an important contribution to make to the dialogue between the industrialized and developing nations. The concept of an international authority to administer the mineral resources of the deep sea-bed for the benefit of all mankind is bold and imaginative. Her Majesty's Government has played a full part in attempting to promote general agreement on the structure of the authority, on the regime itself, and on the many other issues which are currently before the Conference. But while-and you know better than anyone, Mr. President-the Conference has made progress on other issues, we are disappointed by the lack of movement on this basic question of the deep sea-bed. At the fifth session, some States seemed to abandon their previous willingness to consider possible compromise solutions. The United Kingdom was not among these. We shall persist in our efforts to find solutions acceptable to all, and we hope that, before the next session of the Conference, other States will also consider carefully how we might achieve consensus.\n53. It is a measure of the size of the problem that so much still remains to be done before a proper balance is achieved between the richer and the poorer \\\"amongst the nations\\\": a balance which is an essential pre-condition of a more civilized international order. I fully understand the impatience in some quarters: it is, after all, literally a matter of life and death for many people that effective remedies be found for poverty and starvation-and found quickly. But the lesson of the past three years is that no one gains from confrontation: our economies are too closely interconnected. The dialogue must continue, because on its successful outcome depends the ability of the poorer countries to secure the real transfer of resources that they so desperately need. What we are searching for, and must seek with sympathy and imagination, is a new relationship based upon justice and a balance of mutual advantage.\n54.\tHowever, the North-South dialogue is about political as well as economic partnership. This brings me to an area of the world in which we find distilled all the challenges that confront this Organization today. I refer of course, to southern Africa. There the need for international cooperation and peaceful reconciliation is overwhelming if multiracial societies are to be able to live in freedom and prosperity.\n55.\tIn Rhodesia, I believe, the acceptance of majority rule by the illegal regime-a turning point the achievement of which is largely due to the skill and energy of the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger-has given us at long last the basis for a peaceful settlement. That, as Mr. Callaghan, my Prime Minister, made clear earlier this year, was the essential first requirement. We must now seize this opportunity to make real progress towards an independent government that will truly represent the peoples of Zimbabwe.\n56.\tBritain will continue to play a constructive role in this. As you will know, I have agreed, in response to the requests of all the parties concerned, to convene a conference to discuss the early formation of an interim government. I am sure you will agree that Mr. Ivor Richard has all the right qualifications to be chairman of that conference. I may add that his knowledge and experience of the United Nations was an important factor in my choice.\n57.\tI emphasize that, while we are ready to help in whatever way is appropriate, we look to the parties concerned-the parties on the spot-to work out for themselves the best means of achieving a rapid transition to independence based firmly on majority rule.\n58.\tAll of us hope that the threat to peace and stability which Rhodesia has posed for too many years will soon be at an end. Once the interim government has been established, the justification for the various pressures which have been maintained against the illegal regime should fade away. At that stage there should no longer be any reason for the international isolation of Rhodesia. But until that time comes, it would be right for the international community to continue with the enforcement of economic sanctions. We cannot afford to let the momentum of the present initiative be lost.\n59.\tI hope that when I next have the honor of addressing the Assembly we shall have seen great progress. We all look forward to welcoming a truly independent Zimbabwe into the international community and to giving it our full support and encouragement.\n60.\tIn South Africa, the rioting which broke out in Soweto in June and which has since spread widely has revealed-if indeed any such revelation were needed-the strength of black African bitterness against the evils of apartheid. Britain has consistently condemned apartheid; we condemn it now. The violence and bloodshed in South Africa have shown in the most tragic way that apartheid is not only unjust; it will not work. There must, and indeed there will, be change. We have always hoped that such change could take place peacefully. But time is running out. We urge the South African Government to accept the need for a fundamental reappraisal of its racial policies, so that a society can be built in South Africa in which all South Africans, regardless of color, can live and work in peace, equality and mutual respect.\n61.\tIn the past year Namibia has rightly remained the subject of extensive debate, both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council. We were pleased to vote in favor of Security Council resolution 385 (1976) of 30 January. This was a constructive attempt to press on towards the common aim of securing South Africa's withdrawal from its unlawful occupation of the Territory. The United Kingdom has been active in a number of contexts and we have repeatedly make our views clear to South Africa, both in bilateral and in multilateral approaches. We hope that Mr. Kissinger's success in producing movement over Rhodesia will be followed by similar success in producing movement on Namibia. We fully support his efforts and those of the African leaders directly concerned to help to bring Namibia to early self-determination and independence.\n62.\tIf our efforts to achieve international co-operation and peaceful reconciliation in southern Africa fail, we face the prospect of a catastrophic conflict that not only will engulf the peoples of the region but could also have serious results for world peace.\n63.\tWe hear much about the need for detente, in the aftermath of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. But recent history has given a forcible reminder to us all-and particularly to those, like the Soviet Union, who disparage the present attempts to bring peace to southern Africa-that, in the pursuit of detente, the need for a sense of responsibility is world-wide and not confined to Europe.\n64.\tWe cannot limit detente by geography or by subject. More important, if we are to achieve a genuine detente on a world-wide scale, we must all as a first step honor the undertakings which we gave when we pledged ourselves to the United Nations Charter. This requires a high degree of restraint and mutual tolerance between nations. We are a long way yet from bringing these qualities to international life. Nowhere is this need for restraint more necessary and obvious than in the field of arms control. It is crucial that the international community take urgent steps to curtail the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons. Lord Goronwy-Roberts, my Minister of State, will set out the British Government's views on disarmament at greater length in the First Committee.\n65.\tThe concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes is, of course, far older than that of detente. The United\nNations has from its inception seen continuous attempts to apply it in the Middle East. Yet the unresolved conflict there remains one of the great threats to the peace and prosperity of the world. I endorse everything the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands has said on this subject on behalf of the nine members of the European Community. We urgently want to see negotiations leading to a peace agreement supported and sustained by the world community. It is a tragedy that lack of mutual trust causes both sides to adopt so cautious an approach to negotiation when they both stand to gain so much. Of course no one can guarantee in advance that negotiations will lead to a lasting peace but, unless the opportunity is grasped now, the chances of success will surely diminish as time passes,\n66.\tAn enduring settlement must of course be based on compromise; but that compromise must fulfill the basic aspirations of all the parties and leave no underlying grievances to fester and yet again to threaten the peace of the area. On the one hand, the Arabs must accept that Israel is a fact and that its right to exist is not in question. No peace can survive unless the Arab States give Israel formal recognition, within secure, recognized and commonly agreed boundaries, as a permanent feature of the geography and politics of the Middle East.\n67.\tOn the other hand, if Israel is to obtain this recognition, it must, in a settlement, put an end to the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the war of 1967. The nine members of the European Community have declared that that is an essential element in a settlement. On behalf of the British Government I underline that need today. A settlement must also provide a place for the Palestinians, whose fate is at the very heart of the Middle East dispute. They regard themselves and are now generally recognized as a people distinct from their Arab neighbors, with their own strong aspirations towards nationhood. One essential element in a settlement will be a land for the Palestinians, not necessarily a sovereign State, but a place where they will be free to look after their own affairs.\n68.\tThere are things which both sides can do now to help prepare for the negotiations which must come, and I hope will come soon. Above all, both sides must show restraint: the Israelis, by not seeking to change the situation in the occupied territories; the Arabs, by validating their claims that they really want peace.\n69.\tIn the thirty-first year of its existence, the United Nations has come close to its goal of universal membership. The welcoming of new Member States, a feature of past General Assemblies, will become an increasingly rare occurrence as the age of decolonization draws to a close. Universality will not of itself bring greater mutual understanding; the more diverse the membership, the greater the challenge to consensus. The prospect of universal membership therefore obliges us more than ever to ensure that the Organization functions promptly and effectively in the interest of world peace and harmony.\n70.\tThere are surely a number of ways in which we can increase the effectiveness of the Organization. I have already mentioned the Conference on the Law of the Sea; a successful conclusion of that Conference would bring a vast new area of human activity under international regulation and add immeasurably to the Organization's standing. Again, the activities of the United Nations should be more closely harnessed to the promotion of the international rule of law. There are also specific measures that the United Nations could take to tackle international violence. For example, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany has put forward a proposal for a United Nations convention against the taking of hostages [A/31/242]. I strongly support that proposal and hope that other members will do so too.\n71. But I want to sound a warning. Sometimes the work of our specialized conferences and agencies is made more difficult by the introduction of divisive political issues into their proceedings. I believe that the huge majority of professionals and experts attending those meetings are becoming more and more concerned at what they regard as unnecessary obstruction of their work. The British Government shares that concern. We want to make the specialist and technical work of the United Nations as effective as we can. In many areas of our shared concern, we cannot afford the luxury of prolonged political debate when the harsh realities of, for example, water shortages, starvation and waste of resources cry out for immediate joint action. Of course the political issues of the day are crucial to us, and must be debated; free debate is the life-blood of this Organization. But at the United Nations we have plenty of opportunities for the political disputes and issues of the day. We have this Assembly and its Committees and we have the Security Council. But we cannot afford to allow those disputes to reduce the effectiveness of specialist international co-operation. If this trend persists, there will be a growing pressure to achieve results outside the United Nations system. And so I appeal to all Members of this Organization to maintain the effectiveness of our work together in the many fields where joint action is in the interest of us all.\n72. I also believe that we should identify those areas where our aspirations and standards of conduct are not negotiable and should enjoy the full support of the membership of the United Nations. I refer in particular to the question of human rights. The normative work of the United Nations in drafting instruments has, I think, in general been well done. We already have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been the inspiration of many constitutions and conventions, including the European Convention to which the United Kingdom has long been a party. The year 1976 has now seen the entry into force of the two International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXX)]. These give legal force to the rights set out in the Universal Declaration. The United Kingdom's ratification of the Covenants last May reflects the seriousness of its approach. We hope that other States will join us in ratifying and giving full support to the Human Rights Committee, whose task it will be to supervise the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with vigor and impartiality. But vital though it is, legislation alone cannot of course guarantee human rights. We must all approach this question with frankness, with honesty and, where necessary, with self-criticism. Our task is to arrest and reverse the present erosion of human rights in the world. We shall not accomplish this if we allow human rights to become, as is too frequently the case today, a playground for political propaganda, hypocrisy and cynicism.\n73.\tOur task is to create a world in which all men can live in peace, prosperity and freedom, guaranteed by the rule of law. This is an ambitious goal and some may despair of ever reaching it. But I believe that if we approach the problems that beset us in a spirit of peaceful reconciliation, co-operation and restraint-and if, above all, we display these qualities in our dealings with one another in this Organization-the task will not appear so daunting and the goal will not prove impossible of achievement.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, please accept our whole hearted congratulations on your election as Resident of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish you every success in the discharge of these difficult but highly responsible functions.\n94.\tI would also like to congratulate the representatives of the Republic of Seychelles on the proclamation of the independence of their country and on its admission to our Organization.\n95.\tThe attention of world public opinion is once again focused on the work of this highly representative and responsible forum which is the General Assembly of the United Nations. The peoples of the world have good reason to expect that the world Organization will make an ever more tangible contribution every year to efforts designed to translate into practice in international relations the noble principles and lofty ideals in the name of which this Organization was created. We have all witnessed the dynamic and profound positive changes that have occurred in the world in recent years. At the present stage of the development of international relations the struggle for a lasting peace has become a cause of paramount importance for the broad masses of people in all countries and continents. Their peace-loving efforts have led to concrete and lasting results, to a decisive transition from the era of confrontation to the era of detente. This turning-point, notwithstanding the opposition of those who are nostalgic for the days of the cold war, has established itself as the prevailing trend in international life. That is why the nations welcome this turning-point as the most significant achievement of our times.\n96.\tWe harbour no illusions that detente is accepted open-heartedly by all. There ate quite a number of those who are trying to use peaceful coexistence to further their own interests and to distort its essence. According to some, detente should mean that people should renounce their struggle for national and social liberation. Others would like the socialist countries to \\\"pay\\\" for peace by making one-sided concessions. Yet others consider that detente entitled them to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. In essence, these efforts are aimed at reaching by a roundabout way those same objectives which the \\\"positions of strength\\\" policy failed to accomplish in the past.\n97.\tThese efforts, however, are in vain. The facts of life make it clearer with every passing day that the reduction of tension in international relations and the reaffirmation of the principles of peaceful coexistence correspond, to an equal degree, to the interests of all peoples and States, irrespective of their social systems, the degree of their social and economic development, the size of their territory or the number of their population. There is no doubt that the improvement of the international climate achieved so far is a result of the joint action and common will of all peace-loving, democratic and progressive forces, and of all sober, realistic people and statesmen.\n98.\tIn all justice we must emphasize the exceptional-I would even say the decisive-role which the 'consistent policy of the member countries of the Warsaw Pact, primarily the Soviet Union, have been playing in removing the danger of war. To this very day, this policy continues to be the most important factor in the further deepening and broadening of the process of detente, and in promoting comprehensive and beneficial co-operation among all States.\n99.\tThe current year has been rich in events which confirm that the countries of the socialist community will continue to do their best to make detente an irreversible process. In this respect I would like to stress in particular the historic significance of the programme of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples, adopted at the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is no accident that this Programme has met with such wide response and support on the part of all progressive, democratic and peace-loving forces in the world. The Bulgarian Government and people fully support this Programme and will do everything that lies in their- power to have it implemented.\n100.\tThere are more than 120 items on the agenda of the current session. There is no doubt that many of them are very important and necessitate an urgent solution. Their just settlement will be a contribution to the strengthening of peace, understanding and co-operation among nations. There is no doubt either, that today, more than ever before, the problem of ending the arms race and of achieving effective disarmament, occupies the foremost place among them.\n101.\tIf we analyse the reasons which led in the past and are still leading now to intensification of tension in the world, it is not difficult to see that in most cases they are primarily the result of the arms race. It is undeniable that immediately following the Second World War, certain major Western States began feverishly to rearm themselves. They turned the arms race into a basic policy of their own. It is this line of policy which led to the unprecedented piling up in the arsenals of States of a growing number of new types of lethal weapons, including increasingly dangerous types of weapons of mass destruction.\n102.\tNowadays only short-sighted statesmen and politicians could maintain that the arms race might be considered compatible with lasting peace and security. It is hardly necessary to remind ourselves once again of the heavy burden which tremendous military expenditures place upon the shoulders of all States and nations with no exception whatsoever. It is high time to realize that this senseless policy is fraught with danger to peace, and that it is fatal to the vital interests of all countries and peoples, even those States which are not directly involved in the arms race.\n103.\tAs the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, said recently:\n\\\"No one can doubt that a nuclear war on our planet is tantamount to suicide for humanity, and that the only alternative left to this suicidal course is peaceful coexistence. This is not just one of the roads open to man for his future. This is man's only road.\\\"\n104.\tNobody denies that the problems of disarmament are difficult and complicated to solve. This cannot justify, however, the lack of political will to halt the arms race and to begin taking effective measures for disarmament. It would be difficult to dispute the fact that, if it depended only on the countries of the socialist community, the arms race would have long since been ended. \n105.\tThis is shown by the numerous and important initiatives taken by the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries, which have found widespread support among the Member States of the United Nations. World public opinion insists on political detente being complemented by military detente as well. Indicative in this respect are the millions of signatures, collected for the Stockholm appeal of the World Peace Council.\n106.\tThat is why the United Nations must direct its efforts to the implementation of a number of its important resolutions which have been adopted by an overwhelming majority.\n107.\tThere can be no justification for the non-implementation so far of such decisions as the resolutions on the convening of a World Disarmament Conference, on the reduction of military budgets, on the total prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests, and on the prohibition of the manufacture of new weapons and systems of weapons of mass destruction.\n108.\tThe implementation of those and other resolutions is the most effective way to enhance the prestige of the Organization and to strengthen its role in the field of disarmament. It is precisely to this end that our efforts must be bent. The concern of the Soviet Government, reflected in its memorandum submitted to this session [AI31/232J, is therefore fully justified. In essence, this memorandum represents a broad programme for effective action by the United Nations, aimed at curbing the arms race and achieving disarmament.\n109.\tThe Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe are another forum where it is possible to reach agreement on real measures in the interests of peace and security. There is no doubt that fruitful results can be expected only if all participants in the talks adopt the only realistic approach, which is the observance of the principle of equal security.\n110.\tBoth the Charter of the United Nations and a number of fundamental documents of the General Assembly and the Security Council stress the importance of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations. Under conditions of the increasing application of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems, the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations assumes an ever greater importance. With the undertaking of international treaty obligations by all States, including all nuclear States, not to resort to force or the threat of force, new and extremely favourable conditions for the maintenance of world peace will be created. The conclusion of such a treaty will strengthen confidence among States, will facilitate the process of disarmament, and will promote the successful solution of the major and acute social and economic problems which are now confronting mankind.\n111.\tTherefore the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the provisions contained in the draft world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations, submitted by the Soviet Union [A/31/243].\n112.\tThe efforts of the peoples of the world to strengthen peace and reduce tension have brought about deep changes in contemporary international relations. The key task now is to consolidate the results thus achieved. In this respect, a movement forward has been launched in Europe. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe creates the framework for participating countries to develop their relations on an entirely new basis. Faithful to their obligations, the countries of the socialist community adhere strictly to the principles and provisions of this historic instrument. They are putting forward concrete initiatives, the aim of which is to implement the decisions adopted in Helsinki. This is evidenced by the proposals for convening all-European congresses to deal with questions of co-operation in the field of energy, protection of the environment, and transport, as well as the establishment of equitable and mutually beneficial co-operation between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community.\n113.\tDespite attempts in certain circles to distort the results of the Conference, the spirit of Helsinki is already being confirmed in our continent. This, however, is only the beginning. It is necessary for all the 35 States participating in the Conference to show consistency, so that what was agreed upon in Helsinki can be fully implemented.\n114.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is a small country which cherishes lasting peace, security and co-operation among nations. By pursuing an active peace-loving policy, it makes its contribution to the further promotion of die process of detente. Along with the other fraternal socialist countries, Bulgaria works untiringly to turn peace and co-operation into a natural mode of international life. These lofty objectives inspire our policy in the Balkans too. Our policy there is aimed at building this part of the old continent into a region of good-neighborly relations, understanding and co-operation. This has been demonstrated by Bulgaria's latest initiatives.\n115.\tThe positive changes in Europe transcend the boundaries of that continent. It is necessary to extend the spirit of Helsinki to other parts of the world as well. In this respect we are pleased to note the high appreciation accorded to the European Conference by the non-aligned countries, which was only recently reaffirmed at then- Conference in Colombo. \n116.\tIt is in conditions of detente that it has also become possible to bring to the fore the problems of restructuring international economic relations, of doing away with under-development, left by imperialism and colonialism, and of accelerating the development of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. An important prerequisite for the economic and social progress of these countries is the consolidation of their economic independence, the struggle against the encroachments of multinational corporations, the securing of sovereignty over their natural resources and the elimination of all forms of neo-colonial exploitation.\n117.\tThe decisions of the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries  reaffirmed their determination to seek the attainment of the above objectives. These countries can rely on the support of the socialist community of nations, which has always fought for the establishment of just international economic relations and for the eradication of all manifestations of inequality, diktat and discrimination.\n118.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches great importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which is to work out a comprehensive convention governing relations among States in the use of the world's ocean and its resources. The problems which exist in this field at present must be resolved on the basis of the just respect for the legitimate rights of all countries, in the interest of peace and international co-operation.\n119.\tIt is enough to glance at events in recent years to become convinced of the exceptionally beneficial impact of detente in international relations upon the settlement of a number of major problems. Some of these problems have plagued the international atmosphere for years and have seriously jeopardized world peace. In this respect I would like to emphasize the historic victory of the heroic people of Viet Nam and the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea. The triumphant end of the struggle of the people of Angola is a great success for the forces of peace and progress.\n120.\tI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate wholeheartedly, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the representatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and of the People's Republic of Angola. Regrettably, for reasons well known to all, these two countries were unable to take their rightful place in the United Nations, which they won through their valiant struggle against foreign intervention and for freedom, national independence and social progress. I would like to stress our deep conviction that the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola to the United Nations will be an act of wisdom and justice, a confirmation of the purposes and principles of the Charter and of the universal character of the United Nations.\n121.\tThe process of the elimination of colonialism, which has now entered its decisive phase, is also favourably influenced by the positive changes in international life. The victorious course of this process is the result of the struggle of colonial peoples for self-determination and independence, which from the very beginning has enjoyed the unswerving and over-all support of the countries of the socialist community. We are deeply convinced that the eleventh hour is striking for the racists and neo-colonialists in southern Africa. They are sitting on a smouldering volcano which may erupt at any time. This is well understood by their sympathizers and supporters, who resort to last minute attempts and various schemes in order to gain time, to stop the national liberation struggle, to prevent the complete and irrevocable elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism. But they shall not succeed, for the oppressed peoples have already learned how to tell their friends from their enemies.\n122.\tFaithful to its international duty, the People's Republic of Bulgaria supports unreservedly the struggle of peoples for national independence, for the complete elimination of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n123.\tIn the present international situation, the reactionary and aggressive forces find it increasingly difficult to pursue their policy of expansion and to impose such decisions as are profitable to them. The attempts of these forces to preserve their domination, to restore their lost positions, are meeting with a growing and decisive resistance of the peoples. Yet, we note with grave concern that in various parts of the world there still exists the danger of military conflicts with far-reaching consequences.\n124.\tThose who still hope to turn the world back to the days of confrontation spare no effort to thwart the just and lasting solution of a number of acute international issues, which require immediate settlement.\n125.\tOne of these issues is the crisis in the Middle East. In order to settle it, Israel must withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967; the legitimate rights of the. Arab people of Palestine must be fully restored, including their right to create their own State; and the rights of all peoples and countries in the region must be guaranteed to enable them to live in genuine peace and security. As the development of events shows, the establishment of a just and lasting peace in this region can be achieved only by means of an over-all political settlement of the conflict within the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.\n126.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria follows with concern the growing aggravation of the situation in the Lebanon. The developments in this country have resulted in heavy suffering for the people and represent a serious threat to peace in the Middle East. It is imperative to find a political solution of the crisis without delay through peaceful democratic means, without foreign interference, while preserving the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.\n127.\tWe are also concerned over the problem of Cyprus, which generates dangerous tension in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Cyprus problem can be resolved only by ensuring the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, in the interests of the people of Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.\n128.\tFor more than 30 years now, the Korean people have not been able to see their sacred aspirations realized, namely, the reunification of their country. Bulgaria fully supports the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at peaceful reunification, without any intervention by foreign forces. The resolution of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, which provides for the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command and the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag [resolution 3390 (XXX)], furnishes favourable conditions for a political settlement of this problem. This resolution must be implemented.\n129.\tWorld public opinion continues to be profoundly indignant at the brutal and massive violations of human rights by the military junta in Chile. New and energetic efforts are needed in order to put an end to the cruel and arbitrary persecutions of the Chilean patriots and to release all political prisoners immediately.\n130.\tThe capacity of the United Nations to discharge its fundamental mission, which is the preservation of peace and the strengthening of security, is now considerably greater than before. Today, the United Nations can and must become a real unifying center for the efforts of all peace-loving and democratic forces against the attempts of the enemies of peace and understanding to reverse or to stop the development of the positive processes which are taking place in the world now.\n131.\tFor more than three decades our Organization has trodden a difficult path. Hard though it may be, that path is illuminated by noble ideals; it is the path of international co-operation. The Organization's activity has been accompanied both by encouraging successes and by a number of setbacks. There is no doubt, however, that the contribution of the world Organization to the realization of these goals will continue to depend directly on the policies of its Member States and on their adherence to the highly humane principles which inspired the very creation of the Organization. We are deeply convinced that the strict compliance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter is the safest guarantee for the future of this Organization, for the affirmation of its prestige and for the enhancement of its role in the settlement of the key issues of our times.\n132.\tAs for our country, Bulgaria will continue as it has done so far to pursue its fundamental foreign policy line, which is aimed at strengthening co-operation and understanding among nations. This policy was reaffirmed at the Eleventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held last March. We shall continue to work together with the fraternal countries of the socialist community and with all peace-loving and democratic forces, for the full implementation of the noble purposes and ideals of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, which it is my single honor to represent in this General Assembly of the United Nations, welcomes the election of Mr. Amerasinghe to direct our work. We are pleased to join in the congratulations which have been addressed to him and to the other representatives of Member States who have been elected to serve on the General Committee of the General Assembly. We wish them every success in their mission. No one can have any doubt about the skill, experience and selflessness of Mr. Amerasinghe, who has constantly worked for the fulfillment of the noble principles of the great family of the United Nations.\n159.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, the Prime Minister anMinister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn. Mr. Thorn successfully carried out his difficult task in the defense of the supreme and vital interests of our various countries.\n160.\tWe should also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations. We extend to it our congratulations and best wishes and assure it of our fullest co-operation.\n161.\tIt is clear that the work in which the President is now leading us is very important and that the decisions that we are about to adopt on the problems before us will not only affect the immediate future of the peoples of the world but will also have an influence on the march of events, on a world-wide scale.\n162.\tOn this historic occasion, as the thirty-first session of the General Assembly or our Organization gets under way,' it is a pleasure for me, on behalf of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and its Council of State, to thank all the States Members of the United Nations, the Secretariat and the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for their tireless efforts to ensure the survival of this great international body.\n163.\tI should like to pay a special tribute to that dear-minded and lucid diplomat, who has such a penetrating understanding of the burning international problems of the day. Mr. Kurt Waldheim is a great friend of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and a companion in arms of the peoples of the third world. We wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, who has always placed his competence and devotion at the service of mankind. The people and Government of Guinea-Bissau consider themselves his great friends and we wish him every success in his career as a statesman and diplomat. We wish to reassure him of our confidence, our support and our unfailing solidarity.\n164.\tThe United Nations already has to its credit a number of significant changes which have taken place in the development of international relations. The prospects for peace in the world strengthen our conviction that people must come together and talk if they are to fulfill the legitimate aspirations of all the countries of the third world to independence and sovereignty. In the circumstances, we must once again reaffirm our position on certain localized events and conflicts which are absorbing all the energies of the peoples engaged in the struggle and obstructing their normal progress towards peace and well-being.\n165.\tFor a clear definition of the pressing problems of the world whose solutions we have gathered here to seek we must, without delay, but with courage and directness, recall to this Assembly the characteristic features of the international situation today; the intolerable facts and events which disturb our existence and the lives of our peoples and States. Thanks to the determination of the international community, reason has finally triumphed in support of the principle of universality, which is one of the fundamental principles of the Organization.\n166.\tIn considering objectively the ways and means to be adopted to give effect to our action we must try to define a code of consistent, courageous and determined conduct for ourselves if our presence here is to have any positive meaning, a meaning that must constantly be renewed, and if those whom we represent nationally and internationally are to be satisfied of our trustworthiness and efficiency.\n167.\tThe people of Guinea-Bissau, who for centuries suffered under foreign domination and who, in order to win freedom and independence, fought a long war that cost the lives of thousands of their best sons, cannot today remain indifferent to international problems. The commitment of the people of Guinea-Bissau in their struggle to bring peace to the territory allows us to affirm that our country will spare no effort and no sacrifice in making its modest contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of our Organization's Charter.\n168.\tThat is why the people of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, now completely rid of colonial domination, resolutely commit themselves on the side of their brothers in southern Africa struggling for national liberation. In our opinion, there can be no development without liberation and, consequently, no guarantee for world peace. It is the duty of all peoples who love peace and justice, in accordance with the various resolutions of our Organization on decolonization, to give effective assistance to the peoples that are still oppressed, in order to hasten their liberation and to struggle by all possible means against those who have still not accepted the objectives which we have set for ourselves.\n169.\tSouth Africa and Rhodesia, united in their evil scheme to maintain the African peoples under their domination through the disgraceful practices of racial discrimination and colonial oppression, are continuing With impunity to defy international opinion and morality. Nevertheless, we shall not cease to encourage and unstintingly support the struggle of the national liberation movements, which are row the only legal and legitimate representatives of these problems. The significant progress made by the freedom fighters in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa must lead us further to increase again, in a general and concrete manner, our assistance to all those struggling to free themselves from foreign domination and imperialism in all its forms.\n170.\tWe must therefore make clear our active solidarity with the struggling peoples of southern Africa and stand ready to act at any moment upon their request. The unspeakable massacres of the defenseless populations of Soweto, Johannesburg and Cape Town by Fascist forces are a tragic reminder of the urgent need to ensure the implementation of the resolutions adopted by our Organization against the Government of South Africa. No African people, mo peace-loving, justice-loving people will ever tolerate the massacre of black populations in South Africa. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau firmly supports the liberation movement in South Africa in its struggle against apartheid and for social justice, democracy and an end to all racial domination.\n171.\tThe Government of South Africa must not be allowed to continue illegally to occupy and plunder Namibia, that Territory which the League of Nations had earlier placed under its administration. While we hail the earnest efforts of the Secretary-General to bring Pretoria to its senses, we must at the same time continue to encourage the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, to put an end to South Africa's imposture.\n172.\tThe brother peoples of Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana, who are victims of the racist regime of South Africa and of the economic aggression of the Ian Smith clique, must be able at all times to count on our sympathy and our effective assistance in the defense of their territorial integrity and the pursuit of their economic development protected from all criminal threats from Rhodesia and South Africa.\n173.\tThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau wishes, in accordance with its options and commitments to the people of Angola and their pioneering movement, MPLA, to express its indignation at the refusal to admit the People's Republic of Angola to the United Nations. It is inconceivable that the People's Republic of Angola, already recognized by nearly all the Members of this Organization, should not be allowed to participate here as a fully fledged Member in formulating decisions pertaining to the international community.\n174.\tWe are following also with particular interest events in so-called French Somaliland, and we reaffirm our solid support for the liberation movement in that Territory. The results obtained for the decolonization of that African Territory are undoubtedly a victory for the Somali people. Consequently, a solution must be found in the very near future so that the oppressed people may achieve autonomy and national independence.\n175.\tWe could not fail here to refer to the situation prevailing in the independent Republic of the Comoros.\nThat African country, which has just attained national independence, still has part of its territory under occupation, thus depriving it of its territorial integrity, which is in flagrant contradiction with the fundamental principles of our Organization's Charter. The delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau can only reaffirm its unswerving support for the people and Government of the Comoros in their just, struggle for territorial integrity.\n176.\tOne of the regions of the world where tension threatening international peace still persists is the Middle East. The critical situation prevailing there is a source of concern, and it is not without anxiety that we have been closely following events. Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants in the area are experiencing untold suffering as the result of these ravaging conflicts. Haying most carefully considered the problem, we recognize its complexity but we believe, however, that it can be resolved.\n177.\tIn order to arrive at a satisfactory and lasting solution, Israel must recognize the injustice it has committed against its Arab neighbors, especially against the people of Palestine. Israel must be willing to correct the situation in the area, so as to be able to open a new chapter in its relations with its neighbors. It should first of all, and without delay, withdraw from the Arab territories which it occupied in June 1967 and the territories assigned to the State of Palestine by the partition plan contained in the resolution (181 (II)] adopted on 29 November 1947 by the General Assembly by virtue of which the State of Israel was born.\n178.\tIn the opinion of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau, the tension in the Middle East will be finally dispelled only if the people of Palestine have their national rights restored to them. Within this framework, the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in all efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement of the problem remains the sine qua non of the success of this process. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau wishes to express its whole-hearted, solidarity with those fighting in the just cause of the Arabs, in particular the Palestine Liberation Organization, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people struggling for the liberation of their usurped motherland.\n179.\tWe are focusing particular attention on the question of Cyprus. We believe that in Cyprus, as in so many other parts of the world, the tension is caused essentially by interference of foreign forces in the domestic affairs of the country. In those circumstances, it is absolutely indispensable, if the situation in Cyprus is to return to normal, for all the foreign forces to respect the resolutions adopted by the United Nations-that is, by the General Assembly and the Security Council, respectively-and stop interfering in the domestic affairs of the island. The Cypriot community must be free to determine its own destiny and to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its country, in keeping with the policy of neutrality and non-alignment.\n180.\tAlthough we have been gratified to note the success registered in the period that has elapsed in regard to the maintenance of peace and security, we remain concerned by . the problem of an artificially divided Korea. That division creates a threat to international peace and security. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau supports the\u2003Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its just struggle to put an end to foreign interference in Korea's domestic affairs and to speed up the peaceful reunification of the country.\n181.\tWith regard to Viet Nam, today reunified after a long liberation struggle, an exemplary and triumphant struggle, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau from this rostrum salutes that heroic people which not only contributed to the restoration of peace in the IndoChinese peninsula, but was also the symbol of the resistance of the peoples of the third world. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam must take its proper place in the United Nations, in accordance with the principle of universality of our Organization.\n182.\tThe Latin American peoples are increasing their action to strengthen their national independence; they wish to recover their natural resources and play their proper role in international life. The assertion of their independence requires the immediate liquidation of colonialism in all its forms. To that end, the independence movements in Latin America must be encouraged and supported by all of us, through active solidarity with Panama in its struggle for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Panama Canal. We firmly support the Chilean democrats also. It is our duty to help the peoples of Panama and Chile in their struggle for territorial integrity, independence and the restoration of democracy.\n183.\tTwo major problems are of concern to the delegation of Guinea-Bissau: what is happening now in Western Sahara and East Timor.\n184.\tIt is obvious that since the signing in Madrid, on 14 November 1975, of the tripartite Agreement  no solution to the problems of Western Sahara has been found. The Saharan people, who have demonstrated their desire for self-determination, have had no choice but to resort to arms. The situation prevailing today in that part of our continent poses a grave threat to international peace and security. That is why our delegation believes that the urgency of the Saharan problem requires more detailed consideration by the Assembly, in order to avoid the worst.\n185.\tAt the time when fascism was overthrown in Portugal, the Frente Revolucionaria Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN] was preparing finally to assume the leadership of the country and the exercise of national sovereignty. But Indonesia, with annexation as its objective, seized that occasion to jeopardize the independence, territorial integrity and future of the country. We are today witnessing a process designed to eliminate the resistance of the people of Timor. The delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau therefore urgently appeals to the former colonial Power, Portugal, which has the moral and legal duty to ensure the accession of that country to interna\u00actional sovereignty, to discharge all its responsibilities and guarantee independence for the people of Timor. We therefore specifically request that the problem of East Timor be considered at this session of the Assembly, so that we may find solutions that will enable the people of Timor freely to express their views on the future of their country.\n186.\tWe see in the present international situation a crystallization of the efforts of our peoples not only to improve their standard of living but also to establish new bases for closer and more effective economic co-operation among peoples. In that regard our Organization's role is to polarize the solidarity which binds us, so that we may constantly seek new ways of establishing a more realistic and more just, I would even say humanitarian, economic order.\n187.\tThe Colombo Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries took note in its Political Declaration [A/31/197, annex I] of the profound changes in the over-all balance of forces in the world as a result of the development of the forces of peace, independence and progress. At the same time, it welcomed the efforts and initiatives to strengthen detente. The Conference stressed that peace is far from being achieved in the world, because of the persistence of colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid; imperialist aggression and foreign occupation; and the policy of the big Powers, foreign domination and economic exploitation. Furthermore, the Conference declared that peace is indivisible and that it cannot be reduced to the mere transfer of confrontation from one region to another, nor can it resign itself to the persistence of tensions. Detente will be precarious if it does not take into account the interests of other countries. The Conference stressed also that detente must lead to the dissolution of military alliances born of the cold war.\n188.\tThe Colombo Conference once again emphasized the limited nature of the process of detente, although it did welcome the results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It drew attention, also, to the close relationship between security in Europe, in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, and invited the participants in the European Conference to undertake to settle the problems of development in the interests of all countries. It is precisely detente that was responsible for placing on the agenda the reorganization of economic relationships in the world. We have to eliminate inequality and discrimination, and effectively guarantee the sovereign right of all States to dispose of their own natural resources. The seventh special session of the General Assembly called strictly to account those who for centuries have been exploiting the work and resources of others. That session of the General Assembly, followed by the fourth session of UNCTAD held at Nairobi, traced a course for the liquidation of economic oppression. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau firmly supports the claims of the developing and non-aligned countries, a group of which we are an integral part.\n189.\tHaving set forth the views of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on various international problems which are of concern to our Organization, I should like now to make a brief reference to my own country. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau, a member of most international organizations, which has opted for the policy of non-alignment in its struggle for peace and development, is deeply committed to the course of co-operation with all States in the international community without discrimination, except in the case of two States which still pursue the disgraceful policy of apartheid and colonial and Zionist domination. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has established diplomatic \nrelations with almost all countries of the international community, and today has every intention of developing co-operation at all levels with those States without any discrimination.\n190.\tEvery deterioration in the international situation is caused either by blows delivered against the freedom and independence of the peoples or by the unbridled arms race, and that is why we must combine our efforts to consolidate and make irreversible what has already been done for the sake of the independence and sovereignty of all peoples, peace and international solidarity.\n191.\tIn conclusion we should like to reiterate here our firm determination to work tirelessly for the maintenance of international security and our solidarity with those peoples who are struggling for just causes.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend to you on behalf of the Government and people of Malaysia my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election to this high office is indeed a fitting expression of the esteem which the international community holds not only for your people and country but also for the fine qualities and skillful diplomacy you have demonstrated as the Permanent Representative of your country to the United Nations.\n102.\tMy delegation takes special pride that an illustrious son of Asia and one from a Country with which Malaysia has long shared friendly and close ties has been elected to this important office. Under your guidance and wisdom, Mr. President, I am confident that our deliberations in the months ahead will be brought to a constructive and successful conclusion. I would like in this connexion to assure you of the co-operation of my delegation.\n103.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for the skillful and effective manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the thirtieth session. His guidance throughout that session enabled us to preserve the atmosphere of cordiality and the spirit of goodwill so vital to the fruitful conclusion of our far-ranging deliberations.\n104.\tBefore proceeding any further, it is only fitting that I should on behalf of my delegation extend my best wishes to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. The effective manner in which he has shouldered the heavy responsibilities of this high office of this august body deserves our congratulations and deep appreciation. May I assure him of my delegation's continuing support for and co-operation of my delegation in his efforts.\n105.\tI would like to take this opportunity to extend our congratulations and warm welcome to the Republic of Seychelles on being accorded its rightful place as a Member of the United Nations. Its presence indeed represents for us today not only as a further achievement of the universality of membership of this Organization but, more importantly, the triumph of peoples struggling for independence and the assertion of their sovereign right to determine their own future and destiny.\n106.\tIt is also our earnest hope that the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which possess all the legal attributes as sovereign and independent States, will soon gain their rightful places as Members of the United Nations. We in South-East Asia, in particular, attach a special significance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, whose recent reunification is testimony to the determination of a people dedicated to the pursuit of independence, sovereignty and freedom.\n107.\tThe emergence of peaceful conditions for the whole of South-East Asia has been the cherished hope of our peoples for a full generation. Indeed, the positive efforts towards the promotion of regionalism in our part of the world, consonant with the objectives of the United Nations Development Decade are premised upon this proposition. Our region is now at the threshold of a new era where, durable peace and the national aspirations and progress of our peoples are within our grasp. We have a common task to ensure the continued well being of our peoples, thereby contributing towards greater world peace and stability. Malaysia therefore looks forward and hopes earnestly and honestly to working closely with the people of Viet Nam, Kampuchea and Laos towards the establishment of a viable, peaceful, neutral and prosperous South-East Asia free from any form or manner of external interference.\n108.\tThe year 1976 marks the beginning of the last quarter of the twentieth century. As we cross the threshold of this last quarter it is relevant to take stock of our past performance so that we can gain a better perspective of how we are to proceed in the future. We are all familiar with the problems which have claimed the attention of the United Nations for many years. The questions of disarmament, decolonization, apartheid, the Middle East, human rights, development and trade still remain on our agenda. Perhaps a careful assessment of our past efforts in approaching these issues may lead us to discover more effective ways of resolving them. Indeed, my delegation comes afresh to the General Assembly each year with new enthusiasm and filled with optimism that we may achieve what we had failed to achieve in the past.\n109.\tMy delegation is pleased to note that the smaller countries, especially those in the non-aligned group, are beginning to play an increasingly more significant role in eliminating the causes of tension and conflict in the world. However, while some progress has been made in this direction, detente between the super-Powers in our view has not proceeded satisfactorily and has acquired the limited characteristics of a mutual accommodation of big-Power interests which may at the same time prove to be detrimental to the interests of other countries.\n110.\tWe in Malaysia view this development with considerable alarm, particularly since this may hamper the efforts of establishing a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality for South-East Asia as a means of lessening tension and eliminating big-Power rivalry and interference in the internal affairs of the small nations in the region. Surely cognizance must be given to the fact that the proposal of this concept is in line with United Nations support for the creation of zones of peace in different parts of the world because they are a positive contribution to the establishment of international peace and security.\n111.\tThe Prime Minister of Malaysia in his speech at the recent non-aligned Conference in Colombo has said that the creation of zones of peace in strategic areas such as the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia is becoming more relevant and urgent in the context of continuing rivalry and arms escalation among the super-Powers. Malaysia had initiated the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia in order to keep out this big-Power rivalry and competition for spheres of influence and control from the region. This was subsequently translated into a declaration commonly known as the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of November 1971, which was adopted by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\n112.\tIn my submission in regard to South-East Asia, the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality is very relevant and valid at all times, be it in the era of bitter wars or in the era of detente or even in the era of peace. Indeed, it was the intention of the five signatory countries that the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality should cover the whole of South-East Asia. It was envisaged that as soon as peace returned to the region consultations could be carried out with other countries on the details of the proposal.\n113.\tThe situation in South-East Asia since then has changed following the cessation of hostilities and, more recently, the reunification of Viet Nam, as a result of which the prospects of increased regional peace, stability, regional co-operation and harmony in South-East Asia have been greatly enhanced. Certainly, Malaysia believes this development has generated a large degree of confidence and has created favorable conditions to enable all countries in South-East Asia to enter into a dialog among them on the proposal for a zone of peace and to work out a new order of relations within which the countries of the region as well as those outside it could live in peace and co-operation with one another, regardless of their ideology or social systems, and pursue their own destiny and development free of interference from outside Powers.\n114.\tIn February 1976 the Heads of State and Government of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore met in Bali, Indonesia. They signed the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation in South-East Asia and the Declaration of ASEAN Concord, giving their formal reaffirmation to the proposal for the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. The Declaration of ASEAN Concord in particular called for the creation of conditions that would be favorable to the promotion of peaceful co-operation among all the nations of South-East Asia on the basis of mutual respect and benefits.\n115.\tThe motivations behind the proposal as contained in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration are clear for all to see. It was an option for peaceful and co-operative coexistence. The proposal has already received positive support in various international forums including the Commonwealth Conference and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973.1 would like in this connexion to express our deep appreciation to the Honorable Krishna Raj Aryal, Foreign Minister of Nepal, who in his recent statement has expressed Nepal's full and strong support for what he has so aptly described as \\\"a constructive effort towards the strengthening of the peace, stability and development of the South-East Asian region\\\" [5 th meeting, para. 174]. May I also take this opportunity to thank Mr. Chiao Kuan-hua, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, who in his statement yesterday [17th meeting] held that the position of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] for the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from interference by foreign Powers should be respected.\n116.\tLast, but not least, we are optimistic that the big Powers will eventually come round to accept that detente and peace can never be divisible and that it is through the realization of a neutral and peaceful South-East Asia that we shall be able to eliminate the complex interplay of big-Power rivalry in the region, which we are certain will work to the mutual advantage of all concerned.\n117.\tMy delegation is heartened to note that the United Nations continues to provide the forum for us to put our minds together in the search for global solutions to global problems, and even if those solutions have in the past fallen short of public expectations they should not deter us from continuing the dialog which is so indispensable to international understanding and co-operation. The debates in international conferences, as the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, have a very considerable effect in focusing public interest on global problems, in preparing a climate of opinion favorable to their solution and in evolving guidelines for future international and national action.\n118.\tThis is certainly true of our discussion on the problems of disarmament, in which no significant progress has been made in this field in recent years. The escalation of the arms race in many sensitive areas of the world has continued unabated. The proliferation of nuclear weapons has enhanced the specter of accidental nuclear confrontation with all its ghastly consequences. Agreements be-tween the super-Powers on the limitation of strategic arms are not sufficient if they do not include agreements on important qualitative limitations and substantial reduction of their strategic nuclear weapon systems as a positive step towards nuclear disarmament. The prospect of convening a world disarmament conference seems further than ever before. My Government believes that lasting peace could only be achieved through general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, and not through, a mutually agreed balance of armaments. We hope that this session would give serious consideration to the recommendation of the non-aligned countries for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. It is our view that a start has to be made somewhere, so that we can bring together all States, including the nuclear-weapon States, to talk seriously of global disarmament. We also hope that constructive debate will prevail over such other issues as a comprehensive ban on all forms of nuclear weapon tests in all environments, the cessation of the nuclear arms race and the prevention of further proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n119.\tThe Middle East remains another area of conflict. We are concerned that this problem continues to be unresolved. Malaysia firmly believes that any solution to the problem must take into account the rights of the Arab States concerned to regain their lost territories. We deplore the acquisition of territories by the use of force and the changing of the geographical and demographical aspects of the occupied territories, including steps to Judaize the cities of Jerusalem, Nazareth and the region of Galilee. As one of the 20 members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Malaysia fully subscribes to the view that no solution in the area could be possible which does not take fully into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and their inalienable right to return to their homes and properties and to achieve self-determination, national independence and sovereignty. Consequently, we fully support the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing with all the parties concerned, in all efforts, deliberations and conferences on the Middle East to bring about a comprehensive and final settlement of the Middle East issue.\n120.\tThe United Nations during the past decade has played an increasingly important role in hastening the process of decolonization in many parts of the world. In Africa in particular, the momentum created by the emergence of newly independent countries has hastened this process. In South-East Asia, I wish to take note with great satisfaction that the overwhelming majority of the people of the region are now independent and sovereign. However, there still remains an area in South-East Asia where this august body at its last session has called upon the administering Power to facilitate expeditiously the holding of free and democratic elections by the appropriate government authorities in accordance with the inalienable rights of the people to self-determination and independence. I refer to the territory of Brunei. Malaysia would urge the responsible authorities to respond positively as early as possible to General Assembly resolution 3424 (XXX) so that the people of Brunei will not be denied their inalienable rights.\n121.\tWith regard to the situation in southern Africa, there is optimism that acceptance of the inevitability of majority rule by the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia may yet avert the ghastly consequences of a racial, war. It is our hope that the negotiations for a speedy transfer to majority rule can bring about a change is the situation which will prevent the eruption of an explosive tragedy in that part of the world. In this context, such a tragedy is inevitable if the illegal minority regime continues to remain intransigent. Malaysia joins other member countries in reaffirming support for the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle to achieve majority rule.\n122.\tIn Namibia, my delegation fully associates itself with the efforts of the United Nations to put an end to South Africa's illegal occupation of that Territory. We reiterate our support to the Namibian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination and independence, and we deplore any deceitful action on the part of the Vorster regime to delay in restoring Namibia to its rightful inhabitants.\n123.\tAs for South Africa, recent events have served to underscore the barbarity and ruthlessness of the white racist regime. We deplore the Soweto massacre and regret the loss of lives which it has caused. That tragic event and other recent outbreaks of discontent serve to show beyond any doubt that the evil policy of apartheid by the South African regime can have only one inevitable consequence, and that is violence. As a member of the Special Committee Against Apartheid, Malaysia pledges to continue working earnestly with the other members towards the complete eradication of the obnoxious and abhorrent racist policy of the Pretoria regime.\n124.\tIn Cyprus, the situation is both complex and dangerous. It is heartening to note that the non-aligned summit Conference in Colombo has supported the continuation of meaningful and constructive negotiations between the representatives of the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish- Cypriot communities. It is our view that, to succeed, the negotiations must be conducted in the spirit of goodwill and accommodation and must give expression to the rights and interests of both communities on an equal footing, and based on the principle of equal participation on all international forums. We would like to commend the efforts of .the Secretary-General in promoting the inter- communal talks, and hope that his efforts to bring about meaningful and constructive negotiations will meet with success.\n125.\tWe have now entered into the, second half of the Second United Nations Development Decade. The lagging over-all performance of the first half reminds us of the urgent need for improvement and redoubling of efforts during the remaining years of the Decade to. ensure the attainment of the targets set out in the International Development Strategy.\n126.\tThe interdependence of nations and global economic problems are realities that confront the world community; they require no emphasis. The many and acute disparities between the developed and developing countries have long been identified, and the demand for remedial measures has been well articulated consistently by the developing world. The sixth and seventh special sessions of the General\n> Assembly, the adoption of the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J, and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], advanced both recognition and endorsement- of the need to change the existing international economic structure.\n127.\tMore often than not, statements of principle and decisions concerning the. restructuring and creation of a more equitable economic order have been accepted by the developed countries with reluctance, or even without any intention of their pursuit. Let us not deceive ourselves that resolutions and rhetoric at international forums will help to narrow the gap between the developed and developing worlds and move us on the path towards a new economic order. The successful implementation of agreed decisions for the establishment of the new order is a collective responsibility that demands our shouldering with unwavering faith, co-operation and political commitment. Any further delay or postponement of such concerted action would only engender economic tensions detrimental to the interests of all mankind.\n128.\tOver the past few months, the international community has had occasion to meet together to discuss and to seek solutions to pressing economic problems and issues. My delegation views the fourth session of UNCTAD as a key stage in the search for solutions to those crucial economic problems that beset the world, and particularly the developing countries. The-results of that session fell short of our expectations and we too are deeply disappointed at the limited nature of agreements reached at Nairobi.\n129.\tHowever, the intensive negotiations conducted there have stimulated and strengthened the wholesome trend of dialog between nations. Let me take this opportunity to record my delegation's confidence and hope that the positive interaction and continuation of dialog between the developed and developing countries would enhance and accelerate our common endeavors to realize agreed objectives as well as to reach consensus on issues that remain unresolved, including the elimination of restrictive trade measures against exports from developing countries, pro-motion of measures for transfer of technology and reform of the international financial and monetary system.\n130.\tI do not intend to review the decisions taken at the fourth session of UNCTAD, but would like to focus attention on the question of commodities and state once again that Malaysia will not cease to participate in and actively support the quest for a better and satisfactory trading relationship between producers and consumers. We have always regarded the problem of commodities as a matter of crucial importance, the approach to which must be multidimensional. In this regard, the integrated program for commodities, with its core elements of buffer stocks and the common fund, provides a comprehensive approach to commodity problems and merits our particular serious consideration during the forthcoming months. Negotiations on the program provide the international community with yet another opportunity to harmonize their interests in the areas of raw materials and primary commodities. The satisfactory solution to those crucial problems is vital to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n131.\tWe have now before us an opportunity to build a new international economic framework wherein Jill nations might enjoy harmonious and just relations. With renewed determination and in .genuine co-operation, let us, both developed and developing countries, respond courageously and decisively to this difficult but momentous challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "I am greatly honored to transmit to the General Assembly the warm congratulations of His Excellency Jean Bedel Bokassa, the President for Life of the Republic, President for Life of the Movement of Social Evolution of Black Africa, President of the Council of the Central African Revolution and Marshall of the Central African Republic, on its happy choice in electing Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe, Ambassador of Sri Lanka, President of the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Central African delegation, which participated at the fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, has appreciated the tact, wisdom and authority he evinced in guiding the sometimes stormy debates of that Conference, and we note the great sympathy representatives to this lofty international Conference have displayed towards him. We therefore expected him to be promoted to President of this thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly, an expectation which has been fulfilled. His competence and his qualities as a seasoned diplomat presage that the work of this regular session will be successful. My delegation pledges its sincere co-operation during his present term of office at the head of the United Nations General Assembly.\n2.\tFrom this lofty rostrum I greet Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on the exemplary manner in which he acquitted himself of the most delicate task of presiding over the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tI cannot resist the pleasure which I feel in paying a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr, Kurt Waldheim, for his indefatigable efforts to find, in this troubled world with hotbeds of tension throughout, conciliatory solutions for the maintenance of peace and fruitful co-operation among States. If at times because of the difficulties encountered he was able to offer only palliatives, we must nevertheless be grateful to him because so far, through his remarkable diplomatic skills, he has spared the international community the worst.\n4.\tThe Council of the Central African Revolution enthusiastically welcomes the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations. This one hundred and forty-fifth State Member of our Organization has joined us because of the determination, dynamism, courage and wisdom of its leaders and has thus attained international sovereignty with peace and dignity.\n5.\tBefore going further in my statement, I should first of all wish to bow respectfully before the memory of the most regretted Chairman Mao Tsetung, the great helmsman who, because of his courage, his philosophy based on justice and freedom, has succeeded in the task of creating modern China. Our century might be described as a century of contrast because we have had men living who were the forces of evil incarnate and men whose calling was precisely to destroy the forces of evil, to break the chains of oppression and to spread justice and liberty. Chairman Mao was in the second category and his immense political action has transcended the frontiers of great China and made a major contribution to changing the political geography of the world. The oppressed of the world will be forever grateful to him.\n6.\tA prospective analysis of the present political and economic situation clearly proves that mankind is prey to serious difficulties as regards its survival, difficulties which require concrete and urgent solutions.\n7.\tIn fact, we are bound to note that the United Nations, despite its successes here and there, has not yet fully shouldered its mission, which is to establish peace, justice and security and to eliminate hunger, disease and illiteracy throughout the world in accordance with the spirit and letter of the San Francisco Charter.\n8.\tIndeed, while the United Nations has achieved considerable results in consolidating peace and security through-out the world, while it has gained decisive successes in eliminating the colonial system and made important progress in promoting co-operation on a footing of equality among peoples and States, While it has almost attained universality -even though some States have been unjustly prevented from joining it- and while it has made considerable progress in bringing about the relaxation of international tensions, peace and security, unfortunately, are not yet accessible to all peoples.\n9.\tWhat is more, our disquiet about the human species is evident from the fact that, despite the many accords or negotiations on disarmament, the infernal and terrifying arms race in the most sophisticated and deadly weapons engulfs amounts of energy and capital which could have served to nourish thousands of men, women and children who are dying of hunger throughout the world. This arms race is also spreading to other regions of the world.\n10.\tMajor victories have been won, and historical successes achieved in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and all other forms of foreign domination; yet many peoples are still compelled to struggle bitterly for their right to self-determination, independence and freedom.\n11.\tThe Central African Republic through me expresses its condemnation at the persistence and perpetration of these vile and abject forces which run against the trend of history.\n12.\tThe international community as a whole has registered that existing economic international relations cannot be maintained and that the situation of the developing countries has become more and more serious. Nevertheless no substantial progress has been made to speed up.the development and prosperity of these countries.\n13.\tIn accordance with the decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, action to establish a new international economic order was taken and pursued consistently by the developing countries. Proof of this are the conferences held at Manila, Nairobi, Colombo and Mexico. But this action did not meet with corresponding willingness among certain more developed countries which might lead to the adoption of specific measures. On the contrary, we witnessed new attempts to continue to settle international problems at the level of a limited circle of countries so as to preserve the privileges inherited from the past.\n14.\tFaced with these contradictions or paradoxes, my delegation cannot fail to say here that the world is in a state of crisis-a political, economic and social crisis, as well as a crisis of conscience. Yet we do not lose hope, that the United Nations, which has become a regulating organ of our society, will be able to master these calamities; that all the problems of Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East will be resolved; that a new international economic order will be established; and that the world will live in peace with more humanity, generosity and tolerance. It is therefore with this attitude that my delegation will consider with you all the disturbing problems which agitate the international community.\n15.\tBeyond any doubt Africa is a continent which is prey to difficulties the seriousness of which must, once again, demand special attention and which compels us to arrive at the best solution. The total emancipation of Africa, the protection of Africa against the rivalry of external Powers, and international co-operation for economic and social development are so many facts which should receive the most careful consideration by our Assembly. Accordingly, a priori, my delegation is bound to consider the situation now prevailing in southern Africa. In 'that part of our continent tensions and confrontations, of which our brothers in Zimbabwe and in Namibia are the victims, are increasing sharply, while the last stronghold of colonialism in Africa has just recently been defeated. I am speaking of territories which were formerly under Portuguese domination.\n16.\tThe deprivation of the freedom of a people is always a source of struggle and confrontation resulting from a collective rebuff. This axiom is not the result of my imagination; it is universal. Therefore the just struggle of our brothers in Zimbabwe and Namibia proceeds from the fact that they do not have their freedom to put an end to the process of exploitation nor are they able to prepare a development strategy to control their own natural resources and fully attain their dignity as human beings.\n17.\tThus in Rhodesia we are witnesses to stalling tactics by the rebels, who have defied international conscience for more than a decade. Their chief, Ian Smith, using palliatives to lull the African community, tramples underfoot the elementary principles of the civilization which produced him by assassinating thousands of defenseless blacks, whose only original sin is to be black and to aspire to freedom. And this is why we gave our complete support to the efforts being made by the heads of the five front-line States so as to find a humanly acceptable solution to the tragedy of our brothers of Zimbabwe, namely their accession to complete independence.\n18.\tHere in this very hall on 30 September last Mr. Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, stated:\n\\\"Less than a week ago the Rhodesian authorities announced that they were prepared to meet with the nationalist leaders of Zimbabwe to form an interim government to bring about majority rule within two years. That is in itself an historic break from the past. The African Presidents, in calling for immediate negotiations, have shown that they are prepared to seize this opportunity. And the Government of the United Kingdom, in expressing its willingness to assemble a conference, has shown its high sense of responsibility and concern for the rapid and just independence of Rhodesia.\\\" \n19.\tMy delegation therefore supports the initiatives of the United States Government and expresses the hope that the process of the transfer of power to the black majority may be carried out as rapidly as possible.\n20.\tWhile the situation in Rhodesia is one of concern, it is no less urgent for Namibia to accede to independence as a unitary State.\n21.\tAll the political forces, in particular the South West Africa People's Organization fSWAPGJ, must participate in \npreparing for independence through the exercise of the right to self-determination under United Nations control. Here again, the international community is bound fully to assume its responsibilities. It is its duty to bring about detente and to restore peace and security in that part of the world.\n22.\tParallel with the situation in southern Africa there is another problem on which we should not have dwelt were it not jeopardizing peace and security in the area. This is the question of Western Sahara, which is being exacerbated by the champions of disorder and agitation and by those who will never resign themselves to seeing Africa living in concord and brotherhood. On the basis of resolution 3458 B (XXX) of the General Assembly, the relevant United Nations resolutions on decolonization and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice,  the Kingdom of Morocco and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, after democratic consultations with the populations concerned, peacefully settled the problem of the transfer and exercise of sovereignty in the former Spanish possession. We maintain our view that, in accordance with the unanimous decision of the chiefs of State at the summit meeting on the island of Mauritius,  confirmed by the decision taken at Colombo,  only a special summit conference, enlightened by African wisdom, can find a judicious solution to this fratricidal struggle. The Council of the Central African Revolution, for its part, will continue to support the Kingdom of Morocco and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n23.\tThe problem of the Middle East is in every way a permanent threat to world peace and security. The Central African Republic approves all the resolutions adopted on the subject by the United Nations and continues to believe that the solution to the Palestine problem remains the only condition for the restoration of a just and lasting peace in that part of the world.\n24.\tMy country's position, which is well known, has not altered since-namely, that peace in the Middle East is based on three fundamental principles: the right of the Palestinian people to their own homeland; the right of all the States of the region, including Israel, to live within universally recognized frontiers; the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967. As in the past, my country supports our brother Arab countries which spare no effort to recover their occupied territories. Once again we reiterate our appeal to the international community to persevere in its efforts to ensure that, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), a just and equitable solution may be found to the Arab-Israeli crisis.\n25.\t'Close to the Middle East there is another hotbed of tension-Cyprus. Because of its geopolitical situation, Cyprus is and remains the object of greed, of competing foreign interests, and of unwarrantable foreign interference in its internal affairs. It is our hope that this situation may be settled as soon as to stole. It is high time that measures be taken to implement General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975). We fully support continued negotiations on the basis of equality between the Cypriot communities-Greek and Turkish-under the auspices of the United Nations. In our opinion the withdrawal of foreign forces would make it possible finally to arrive at a settlement in accordance with law and justice, that is to say, a settlement preserving the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus that is acceptable to all Cypriots.\n26. My delegation cannot remain silent on the problem of the divided Korean people and the seriousness of the tension prevailing in that peninsula. The Korean people, which for practically 30 years have known only the turmoil and torment of war, aspire to the peaceful and free reunification of their territory. We believe that the inter-national community should again encourage the continuation of the dialog. It should urgently call on all the parties concerned to do everything possible to facilitate a resumption of discussions and the negotiation of lasting arrangements for the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula and the achievement of reunification in accordance with the joint North-South communique of 4 July 1972.4\n27.\tWe are aware of the threat to the security of the States of the region resulting from the concentration of naval and air forces in the Indian Ocean. The group of non-aligned countries meeting at Colombo renewed its appeal that the Indian Ocean be declared a zone of peace [see A/31/197, annex IV, resolution 11]. My delegation, on behalf of the Council of the Central African Revolution, reaffirms its conviction that the implementation of this declaration on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace would be a positive contribution to settling international tensions in that part of the world.\n28.\tMy country warmly applauded the admission of the Seychelles to the United Nations. However, we strongly deplore the rejection by the Security Council of the applications of two brother countries, Angola and Viet Nam, for membership in our Organization. Some will support the legality of this decision, taking refuge in Article 4, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Charter, but the very ones who invoke that argument to justify such rejection must agree that legality is not always the same thing as justice.\n29.\tSince its entry into force on 24 October 1945, the Charter has undergone many amendments, but the right of veto, which has remained unchanged, seems to have lost its original purpose and has become, in the hands of some of those who are authorized to wield it, a power enabling them to make a selection among countries applying for admission to the United Nations solely on the basis of their ideological background. The resultant flagrant injustice must be abolished and accordingly the Council of the Central African Revolution associates itself with the Governments of the very many States who are calling for a revision of the Charter of the United Nations, so as to adapt it to current geopolitical realities.\n30.\tI have just reviewed the political questions which are of the greatest concern to the international community.\n31.\tIt is nevertheless the case that during the Second United Nations Development Decade on which we are embarked, the basic issue, as defined at the seventh special session of the Assembly, is, and remains, the establishment of a new and more just economic and social order. Our planet has heterogeneous socio-political and politico- economic systems which, unless we are vigilant, may bring about very serious, indeed catastrophic, conflicts. That is why, both politically and economically, the international community must avoid confrontation in seeking conscientious and responsible solutions to the problems it faces. This quite naturally leads me to speak with some feeling of the cruel and tragic situation prevailing in our world, in which 70 per cent of mankind share only 30 per cent of world income, while a small group of privileged States lives in opulence and waste. This being so, how can one fail to draw attention to the poverty, disease, destitution, need and illiteracy-with all their socio-economic implications- which constitute the sorry fate of the populations of the third world? We can never say enough to arouse a responsible collective world conscience to this tragedy. But we still have hope because by persistently raising our voices in all international forum, even the most backward nations are beginning to think of the inevitable consequences which may be engendered by such a tragedy. For its part, the third world has chosen the course of agreement and dialog, so as to devise platforms on the basis of which equitable solutions may be found so as to achieve the objective of establishing a new and more equitable economic and social order. Both at Lima, where the non- aligned countries met to consider economic development, and at Manila and Colombo, important documents were drafted which are the warhorses of the third world. Paradoxically, we note that in recent years many resolutions adopted by various international organizations and conferences concerning the establishment of the new economic order have not been followed by practical action, and the socio-economic situation of the developing countries, especially the land-locked and island countries whose geographical situation places them at a disadvantage, is deteriorating further. Most, if not all, of the third-world countries live off exports of raw materials and imports of manufactures, but the deterioration of the terms of trade, aggravated by an imported inflation, constitutes the backbone of a system of trade that has become obsolete. New formulas adapted to the present relations between independent and sovereign States must be sought.\n32.\tBe that as It may, what can we say of all the restrictions in the form of tariff barriers and tariff quotas which restrict opportunities for access to international markets for the developing countries? Of course, the instinct for survival has led certain countries of the third-world group which are by nature favored by the existence of certain raw materials, in this case oil, to set up openly a cartel to defend their interests. This position has unleashed a series of retaliatory measures encompassing the entire monetary and financial system. The low earnings of the developing countries have aggravated their balance-of-payments deficit to a tremendous degree. According to some estimates, this deficit was $US 40 billion in 1975 and may be expected to reach the record figure of $US 112 billion by 1980.\n33.\tThese few examples unequivocally prove to what an extent the economic, monetary and financial system governing trade among industrialized and developing countries is outdated and obsolete, because it was conceived in another era to serve relations among States whose status was based on philosophical concepts which are now outmoded. The third world, when it calls for a review of that system, hopes to see more equitable rules applied under the concept of human solidarity and also by virtue of the fundamental principles laid down by the Charter of the United Nations. This is why the Council of the Central African Revolution, presided over by His Excellency, Jean Bedel Bokassa, President for Life of the Republic, President for Life of The Movement of Social Evolution of Black Africa, President of the Council of the Central African Revolution, Marshal of the Central African Republic, reaffirming its support for the United Nations Charter and for that of the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ; and reaffirming its membership in the non-aligned movement and in the Group of 77, strongly supports all efforts to set up new structures so as to establish a new and more just economic and social order. We accordingly support the following measures.\n34.\tFirst, there should be a re-examination of the inter-national monetary system, developed at Bretton Woods. The new system must respond to the development requirements of the third-world countries; it must enable States, large or small, rich or poor, to participate on a basis of equality in the decision-making process and guarantee the stability of the flow and conditions of international financial aid, recognize the conditions and specific needs of the less-developed countries on the basis of preferential treatment, in accordance with the Declaration and Pro-gramme of Action of Manila,  the Action Program for Economic Co-operation which was adopted by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, which was held last August at Colombo (see A/311197, annex III).\n35.\tSecondly, there should be an integrated program for commodities at remunerative prices.\n36.\tThirdly, a common fund for financing buffer stocks of raw materials, which was advocated by the Group of 77 at Manila, should be established. Concurrently with the solutions to be sought and encouraged within the frame-work of the United Nations, the Council of the Central African Revolution endorses the recommendations to strengthen solidarity among the third-world countries on the basis of the principle of self-reliance. This concept is furthermore in accord with that of \\\"Operation Bokassa\\\" , our national and original development strategy which aims at mobilizing all live forces of the nation so as to bring it out of a state of underdevelopment.\n37.\tFourthly, Arab-African co-operation, which is a concrete contribution to co-operation among the countries of the third world, should be developed.\n38.\tFifthly, an international bank for the third world-an idea stated at Colombo by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Bandaranaike, at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries-should be established.\n39.\tSixthly, economic co-operation among developing countries-the bases for which were established at the last conference of the Group of 77 in Mexico, held last month -should be developed.\n40.\tOther initiatives are also under way, such as the one launched by the founder and President of the Republic of Zaire. The Chief of State of Zaire proposed the convocation, within the framework of OAU, of a special ministerial meeting on economic co-operation among African countries at Kinshasa in November 1976. My country, the Central African Republic, pays a particularly well-deserved tribute to that happy initiative and endorses it whole-heartedly.\n41.\tOn the international chess-board, however, rich and developing countries meet time and time again so as to arrive at a modus vivendi on the important questions concerning raw materials, energy and the monetary system. The fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [ UNCTAD], which met at Nairobi, enabled the world to note that the will to arrive at positive approaches had crystallized, and it is our hope that common sense, universal solidarity and collective goodwill will prevail over selfish interests. We hope that the North-South Conference which has been meeting at Paris since 1975, will lead to a positive and encouraging dialog, because we are grateful to countries which strive to give these meetings a perspective for dynamic co-operation.\n42.\tFrom this rostrum I appeal to the sense of humanity of the affluent countries which prefer to spend vast amounts of money to build engines for the conquest of outer space simply for prestige, while there is so much extreme poverty to be alleviated on our planet.\n43.\tConvinced of the considerable technological backwardness of the third-world countries, we. hope that the industrialized countries will do everything in their power to enable us to accelerate our rate of growth and accordingly facilitate the transfer of technology adapted to the national realities of the developing countries. The drafting of an international code of conduct for the transfer of technology, which is envisaged in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [see resolution 3202 (S-VI), sect. IV], should enable the deprived countries to have access to those modern techniques that are essential for their economic development.\n44.\tThere is still another alarming problem for the survival of mankind and that is the arms race, the economic impact of which is not negligible. That is why the view expressed by most countries, condemning the use of large financial resources to build an arsenal of deadly weapons and to satisfy some kind of thirst for hegemony while at the same time millions of human beings struggle in poverty and die of hunger and disease, is fully shared by the Central African Republic. It goes without saying that the resources thus released would make it possible to supply the International Fund for Agricultural Development, to satisfy the needs of countries such as the Central African Republic, 90 per cent of whose population is employed in agriculture.\n45.\tI feel bound to mention the vital rote played by the transnational companies in the economies of the developing countries. That role, need I recall, in many aspects conceals activities which often run counter to the strategies and development objectives of the third-world countries. Accordingly, my delegation unreservedly supports the development, adoption and early implementation of a code of conduct for the transnational companies.\n46.\tThe problem of the law of the sea is of paramount importance. Seeking a new international economic order based on equity was one of the reasons for convening the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This gigantic legal undertaking-were it to achieve the desired ends-would remain the most grand endeavor of all times, since it is a planetary undertaking.\n47.\tThis Conference is intended, first of all, finally to resolve problems that have been in existence for a long time and then to create new maritime rights. I am not telling the members of this Assembly anything new when I say that the Conference must finally decide on the breadth of the territorial sea, the outer limit of the continental shelf; it must define what is the exclusive economic zone, reaffirm the free use of the international maritime zone, and, particularly, specify the prerogatives of the international authority which will be responsible for conducting activities in the international zone, namely, prospecting, exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and also the settlement of possible disputes among States. For, while every right resulting from law is in essence intended to settle disputes, it is, by its very existence, a source of litigation. In other words, any new right creates a new type of dispute. It might be believed that when exploration is carried out the major problem is resolved. Not at all. Regrettably, we suffer from a chain-reaction system. Any solution to a problem carries within it the seed of a new problem. When the sea-bed is exploited, what is to be done with the products extracted? Among whom, and how, will they be distributed Here appetites are whetted, interests are in confrontation, and the law of the sea could lead to results diametrically opposite to those for which it was established, which was the improvement of living conditions for the \\\"have-nots\\\". For if, out of the net income and I emphasize, \\\"out of the net income\\\"-of sea-bed mining resources, the lion's share goes to those who already have more, because of some special procedure or incongruous criterion, or if the minerals extracted from the sea-bed compete with similar minerals offered on the market by the under-equipped countries, thus disturbing the already shaky economy of the latter, one need not be an expert in economics to conclude that the gap between the rich countries and the deprived countries, far from narrowing, will become greater still, and the economic order thus created by the introduction of new factors of wealth will be but a perpetuation of the economic order now prevailing.\n48.\tIt follows that, to establish a really new economic order which will make a substantial improvement in the situation of the disinherited countries, the international authority which will be the product of this new law of the sea being drafted should constantly be guided in its activities by the spirit of the preamble of the United Nations Charter.\n49.\tLet us assume that the problems that I have high-lighted so far in my statement were to be equitably solved because of the wisdom, indeed, altruism, of certain members of the great international community, the world would not yet be at peace because other key issues will subsist, the settlement of which at present would be a delicate matter. These issues are centered on the geographical position of States in relation to the sea. While some countries have, so to speak, their feet in the water, others less fortunate, can only reach the sea after exhausting use of their legs.\n50.\tThe sea, the extent of which is three times greater than that of the land which has surfaced, will forever remain the surest and less costly means of commercial communication. This is in itself sufficient to show the great commercial advantage possessed by coastal States in comparison with the coastless or land-locked countries and the advantages in mining resources which the coastal States with a limitless ocean spreading out before them will have when the new law of the sea enters into force, as compared with countries with a very narrow coast on which, because they face another State, cannot benefit either from a broad territorial sea or from a continental shelf under the rules which will be adopted.\n51.\tAll States unanimously agree that the international maritime zone and its resources are the common heritage of mankind. This principle has been reaffirmed in the first paragraph of the resolution on the international zone which was adopted by the Council of Ministers of OAU when it met at its twenty-seventh regular session in the capital of Mauritius only three months ago [see A/31/196 and Corr.l, resolution 522 (XXVII)].\n52.\tAn important detail on which States seek consensus is the outer limit of that international zone, that is to say the high seas. Since this will be the same as that of the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone and of the continental shelf, it follows that any change in the breadth of the exclusive.economic zone and of the continental shelf causes ipso facto an opposite change in the extent of the international zone which is to be considered as the common heritage of all mankind.\n488\n53.\tIt will suffice for me to recall here that the Central African Republic, my country, is more than 1,000 kilometres from the coast at the nearest frontier point. The importance my delegation attaches to arriving at a consensus at the Conference on the Law of the Sea which will not be at the expense of the continental States can therefore readily be understood. The distance separating continental States from the sea is already a cause of backwardness in their development and this will only cease to operate when the rights which I regard as natural, because they are inherent in the situation of being land-locked, will be unconditionally recognized.\n54.\tWe all know what these rights are, namely, the right of land-locked countries to have access to the sea and the right of transit through the territory or territories separating them from the sea. Naturally, we do not preclude that transit States may take the necessary measures so that this international service will be as little detrimental to them as possible. But these rights of access to the sea and of transit, the full exercise of which should be left completely to the beneficiary State, should not be subordinated to any right of reciprocity in favor of the coastal States which rendered this service. My country, because of its geographical situation in the heart of the African continent, is both a land-locked country and a transit State, and it is prepared to meet its obligations as a transit State. I cannot but note with bitterness that certain coastal States, although they, too, wish for the establishment of a new international economic order that would alleviate the ills from which the developing countries suffer in varying degrees, have so far proved intransigent in the matter of recognizing the natural right to the sea, without condition of reciprocity, and its corollary, the right of transit, which the land-locked countries wish to enjoy without restriction. Intransigence in this position can only delay the advent of this new economic order and even jeopardize the successful outcome of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. That is why, like Nepal and other continental countries, I urge the coastal States which are still in opposition to soften their positions.\n55.\tI have dwelt on the land-locked status of my country because this problem is at the heart of the concern of the Council of the Central African Revolution. That is why His Excellency Jean Bedel Bokassa, President for Life of the Republic, President for Life of the Movement of Social Evolution of Black Africa, President of the Council of the Central African Revolution, and Marshal of the Central African Republic, in a solemn statement made in January 1974, decided that 1974 should be the year for ending the disadvantages of the Central African Republic's land-locked position. On that occasion he made an appeal to the international community in these terms:\nuWe give our friends our constant political support; in return, we ask them to help us by practical and effective action to solve our problems of economic, technical, cultural and social development, in the forefront of which is the anguishing problem of the land-locked position of the Central African Republic.\\\"\nIt should also be pointed out that the Head of State determined that the highest priority of our five-year development plan, 1976-1980, should be to overcome our land-locked position through the building of a Bangui- Atlantic Ocean railway.\n56.\tActually, this great national project could not have been undertaken if a major step had not just been taken. This was the decision at the summit meeting of heads of State of the Central African Customs and Economic Union, comprising the Congo, the United Republic of Cameroon, Gabon and the Central African Republic, held in Bangui in December 1975, to make the building of that railway a regional project. This is a striking example of regional solidarity and co-operation, and on behalf of my Head of State, on behalf of the Council of the Central African Revolution and on behalf of the Central African people, I wish to pay a sincere tribute to the Heads of State of those brother countries for the remarkable spirit of solidarity and understanding which they have evinced.\n57.\tOnce again my delegation urgently appeals to the international financial bodies, and to countries sympathetic to the Central African Republic, to assist the Central African Customs and Economic Union by providing it with the necessary funds to carry out this railway project. Once completed, and accompanied by the building of the Bangui-Cameroon sector of the trans-African Mombasa- Lagos route, it will certainly lead to a net improvement in the economic and social conditions of the people of the Central African Republic. This will naturally make it possible to exploit enormous agricultural, forestry and game resources, as well as great mining deposits which have recently been discovered by satellite in the Central African subsoil, known since 1975 as the \\\"Bangui anomaly\\\".\n58.\tMy delegation is concerned about the question of the mass media. The developed countries have gigantic means of threat and intimidation to support their political and economic action. As proof, I shall quote from an article which appeared in the monthly publication, Le monde diplomatic No. 269, of August 1976, by German Carnero Roe v entitled \\\"Information in the Third World\\\":\n\\\"The third world, in the specific area of information, and more generally as regards communications, suffers from an acute dependence similar at all points to its dependence in the political and economic spheres. This dependence is an integral and decisive part of the system of imperialist domination. It is also one of the conditions for its survival. It is indeed impossible to conceive of lasting mechanisms of economic and political domination in the third world without the formidable support offered by a system of sophisticated and efficient subjection in the matter of information and communications\t\n\\\"As regards news as such, it is almost totally manipulated by transnational press agencies presented as 'international' agencies. It is through these channels that events in the developing countries are transmitted to the world and that the peoples in those countries are 'informed' of what is happening abroad. But the selection criteria are such that ultimately it is not information but rather systematic distortion-or disinformation- concerning the facts that is presented with particular virulence when it comes to news about peoples who have undertaken a revolutionary course for their emancipation. The most significant aspects of their struggle, and the deep-seated causes of that struggle, are generally not mentioned, or else distorted.\\\"\n59.\tAccordingly, the Central African Republic, my country, is pleased at the recent establishment of a pool of press agencies for the third world so as to modify their situation and to end decolonization in regard to information and set up a new international order in this realm. We are all the more pleased since the establishment of such a press organ will better serve the cause of the developing countries, among them the Central African Republic, which have frequently been the object of systematic denigration, carried to the point of aggression against the authorities and valiant people of Central Africa, who love peace and justice. We believe that such a baseless campaign, that threatens the sovereignty of our States, deserves the full attention of the international community.\n60.\tI should like to recall, in concluding, that man is the purpose of our action and of the United Nations action. Man's progress has encountered many obstacles and many barriers. It will suffice to refer to the reasons that led to the establishment of the League of Nations and of the United Nations and other forms of joint action as evidence of this. How many catastrophes and scourges of all kinds has the human species survived along its course to come today to a stage where everybody agrees that we must live in peace and security with material and moral well-being.\n61.\tAs in the opinion of my delegation, all countries large and small have always insisted that the United Nations is an important factor as an effective instrument to promote international peace and security and to establish a new international economic order so as to reconcile the interests and objectives of States Members. Within this context we consider that the activities of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system represent a co-ordinated attempt to prepare a future providing better living conditions for mankind on our planet.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation had an opportunity earlier during this session to express its congratulations to Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election as President of this august Assembly. I reaffirm what I have said before and express the confidence of my delegation that the deliberations of this august Assembly will receive added meaning under his able guidance.\n297.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has a very heavy responsibility resting on him and who has borne it with fortitude and devotion. The world has benefited immensely from his stewardship of the United Nations. The leadership that he has provided to this Organization through some very critical times will be remembered with gratitude and admiration by the inter-national community for years to come.\n298.\tThe most important challenge facing the international community today is the crisis in international economic relations. The heart of the problem lies in the widening disparity between the rich and the poor nations of the world. Extensive negotiations during the past few years have confirmed the urgent need to establish a more equitable relationship between the developed and the developing countries of the world. Out of this recognition was born the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. To achieve any meaningful progress towards the objectives of this program it was necessary to follow up expeditiously with comprehensive proposals and agreements. A hopeful beginning for initiating necessary changes in the global economic system was made during the seventh special session of the General Assembly. Unfortunately, this momentum has not been sustained. Subsequent negotiations have hardly progressed. Little has been achieved at the fourth session of UNCTAD, particularly on the two most important issues of commodities and debt-liability. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris remains stalled, without making any progress in substantive discussions.\n299.\tThe problems have been identified and remedial action proposed. A restructuring of international economic relations and the establishment of a new and more equitable system remains the only solution of the economic challenge that faces us today. The time has come to break the inertia and revitalize the process of negotiations and consultations in a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation. Real progress can be achieved only if the rich are prepared to concede that economic justice is not a slogan only for the poor but is the only means by which a new and stable world order can be achieved. To deny this would be to reject the established fact of interdependence, which is the corner-stone of contemporary world order.\n300.\tIn working for fundamental changes in global economic relations, both the developed and developing countries have their responsibilities to fulfill. We on our part recognize the imperative need to promote the socio-economic and infrastructural changes necessary for rapid growth. We are also committed to the concept of self- reliance as our ultimate goal.\n301.\tWe have embarked on a series of reforms and a reorientation of our development policy objectives. These have succeeded in creating self-reliance and sustained economic growth. The Government of Bangladesh has undertaken an integrated rural development program with the twin objectives of achieving self-sufficiency in food through increased food production and creating more employment opportunities for the rural poor, who constitute 90 per cent of our total population. Side by side with this, we have also launched a crash program for family planning to control population growth. The two pro-grammes, together, are designed to create a sound basis for future development.\n302.\tIn the brief period in which these programs have began in operation significant results have been achieved -a fact which has been a source of great encouragement for us.\n303.\tMeanwhile we are deeply concerned about the global co-operation required to overcome the economic challenges of our time and the fact that it can be achieved only within an environment of peace. We, therefore, remain totally committed to peace -peace in our region, in our continent and in the world.\n304.\tGlobal concern over disarmament, particularly nu-clear disarmament, continues unabated. The Declaration of the Colombo Conference of non-aligned countries has summed up our position [see A/31119 7]. We are concerned that, unless substantive safeguards are provided to the non-nuclear States, their security will continue to be threatened. Recent developments have highlighted the importance of the relationship between peaceful and military uses of nuclear explosives. The practical value of peaceful nuclear explosions needs to be carefully evaluated and suitable safeguards adopted to avert the inherent dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation.\n305.\tA comprehensive study of the question of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all its aspects has been undertaken by the United Nations. There are also a number of proposals under consideration by the General Assembly on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the world. We support the initiatives for early establishment of such zones.\n306.\tThe Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace adopted by this Assembly sought on the one hand to eliminate great-Power rivalry from the area and on the other to promote co-operation among the regional States to ensure conditions of security within the region. As a littoral State of the Indian Ocean, Bangladesh has supported this Declaration. We consider that the first task before the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean is to evolve a common position on a viable system of security within the region. If we ourselves are not united in our resolve to uphold our collective interest and renounce the threat or use of force against each other, it will not only detract from the morality of our cause but also create practical problems of credibility. We call upon the great Powers to co-operate in the implementation of the General Assembly's Declaration.\n307.\tBorn out of a prolonged struggle against colonialism, the commitment of Bangladesh to the right of self- determination is immutable. The focus of the attention of the international community is now on southern Africa. Recent developments in Rhodesia offer a possibility of ending the illegal minority regime in Salisbury without further unnecessary bloodshed. We lend our firm support to the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle to establish majority rule in an independent Zimbabwe.\n308.\tWe have fully associated ourselves with the unceasing efforts of the United Nations to end the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. The essential conditions for the transition of the Territory from the South African illegal occupation to independence have been stipulated in Security Council resolution 385(1976). Those conditions must be complied with unequivocally and immediately. The recent mass uprising in South Africa is a clear warning that time is running out for the racist apartheid regime. We condemn the violent suppression of this legitimate demand for racial justice and freedom and urge the international community to discharge fully its obligations to end this crime against humanity.\n309.\tThe Middle East question remains unresolved, posing a great threat to international peace and security. The tragic events in Lebanon are a painful illustration of the dangerous consequences that can result from the situation. It is, therefore, essential to resume all efforts for resolving the problem. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be established only on the basis of a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights, including the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State of their own. Continuation of the policy of new settlement by Israel in the occupied Arab territories, with a view to changing the political, social and demo-graphic character of the area, will create further obstacles in the way of permanent settlement of the Middle East problem. This policy of new settlement is also being applied by Israel to the holy city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is one of the holiest places of Islam. As a Modem nation we cannot remain indifferent to the continued desecration of Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalem by Israel and its policy of insidious annexation of the holy city.\n310.\tWe welcome the progressive developments in Viet Nam since the successful conclusion of the long struggle of the Vietnamese people for freedom. The victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people is a source of inspiration for us. The emergence of a free Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has contributed towards political stability and a relaxation of tension in the region. We believe that membership of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in the United Nations will promote the cause of freedom and peace in the world. We eagerly await the day when we shall have the opportunity to welcome them in this hall.\n311.\tThe principle of universality demands that all countries which fulfill the qualifications for membership should be allowed to join the Organization. Therefore we support the immediate admission of Angola to the United Nations.\n312.\tWe should like to see an early settlement of the outstanding problems in Cyprus that would allow the Turkish and the Greek communities in Cyprus to live in safety, dignity and honor. We have supported all initiatives for such an amicable settlement. We believe that no solution of the problem can be lasting unless it takes into account the legitimate aspirations and wishes of both the Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus and respects the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non- alignment of Cyprus. It is also essential that in any deliberation of the issue both the communities should be allowed equal opportunity to present their views in an international forum.\n313.\tFor a country like ours with one of the highest densities of population in the world, the resources of the sea are of crucial importance. We have, therefore, a vital interest in ensuring that these resources are exploited for the benefit of the needy. The international community has accepted the concept of the sea-bed as the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\". We cannot leave the exploitation of its resources to the tender mercies of unilateral appropriation without regard for the needs and rights of developing countries.\n314.\tWe are greatly concerned that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea should adopt provisions for demarcation of a base-line which meets the demands of our special geographical and geomorphological situation. On the question of an exclusive economic zone, we are convinced that an equitable delimitation is the only basis for an acceptable solution. We are in favor of the adoption of a mandatory system of settlement of disputes.\n315.\tIn reviewing some of the crucial political and economic issues that now confront us, I should like to take this opportunity of reaffirming my country's commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Our firm adherence to these objectives has been given vital perspective and strength by our membership in the Islamic Conference, the Conference of Non-Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth Conference. Integral to our policy also are the five principles of Bandung. Our accession to these international associations is based on the firm belief that they reflect the basic aspirations of mankind to freedom from subjugation and exploitation and man's legitimate desire to shape his destiny without pressure or interference.\n316.\tIt is in pursuit of those objectives that Bangladesh has made all efforts to Consolidate relations with countries of the region and the subcontinent in particular. To this end we have consistently pursued and reaffirmed our total commitment to a policy of peace, stability and cooperation with our close neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for equality, independence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.\n317.\tOn the subcontinent our belief that the emergent role of Bangladesh would significantly contribute to the normalization of relations has been vindicated. We have taken important steps to normalize our relations with Pakistan. Our relations with Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal are based on a firm footing and new avenues are being explored for bolstering our existing ties. Our historic relations with Sri Lanka are of abiding friendship. With Burma we have the most cordial and friendly relations based on good neighborliness. We believe that Bangladesh, by virtue of its geographical location as well as its historical and cultural affinities with the people of South-East Asia, stands as a bridge between South and South-East Asia. We attach the utmost priority to the pursuit of all efforts to strengthen our relations with our South-East Asian neighbors.\n318.\tOur affinity and identification with the cause of the Islamic world stretching from Morocco to Indonesia is total. We firmly believe that the 800 million people of the Islamic group can contribute significantly to promoting our common endeavor for a more stable and meaningful world order.\n319.\tIn any review of our international relations, however, we cannot remain unmindful of certain objective realities that pertain to our region.\n320.\tAs Chairman of the Bangladesh delegation, I speak on behalf of the Government and people of a country which is located in an area inhabited by a quarter of the entire human race. The appalling conditions of life in our part of the world are a blemish, a disgrace and a crime in the late twentieth century. We cannot escape responsibility for a total effort to bring about an immediate change in this deplorable state of affairs. When we come to this forum with problems that are described as bilateral and at times even referred to as misconceived, we can say, with all honesty, that we cannot afford the luxury of stalemate nor can we be deterred by verbal gymnastics simply because the limits of patience, forbearance and even resignation have long since been erased. Our people are resolved to secure their legitimate rights and persevere in their determination to carve out for themselves what, even by the most niggardly contemporary standards, can only be termed a very modest improvement in their living conditions.\n321.\tI do not at this stage wish to dilate on the question of unilateral diversion of water at Farakka, since the matter has already been included in the agenda [item 124] and allocated to the Social Political Committee. I would merely stress that we have not come to this world forum to strike a note of discord nor have we come in a spirit of confrontation. Our imperative is one and only one: it is the fact that as a country we cannot afford to leave any stone unturned in seeking redress where the vital interests of our people are threatened.\n322.\tThe Government of Bangladesh sincerely desires to solve the problems. I should also like to reiterate our adherence to a policy of good neighborliness and mutual co-operation on the basis of sovereign equality. We shall continue to support all initiatives for the normalization of relations on the subcontinent.\n323.\tThe regrettable stresses and strains in the affairs of the subcontinent have not deterred us in our resolve to consolidate our state sovereignty, safeguard our genuine and true independence, and uphold the imperative need for peace and stability. We have persisted in this in spite of the loss of many valuable lives and notwithstanding the disruption caused among the inhabitants of our border areas. No country can do more than temper firmness with restraint.\n324.\tIn the three decades since the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco in 1945, the political scene in the world has changed almost beyond recognition; it is not inconceivable that it has changed beyond the imagination of the founding fathers. In the introduction to the report on the work of the Organization [A/31/1/ Add.lJ, the Secretary-General has accurately observed this profound geopolitical change, its implications and the wider scope for the United Nations role it calls for.\n325.\tThe most obvious change has been the disappearance of the old colonial empires. With the near completion of the process of decolonization the number of independent countries in the world has multiplied about three times. Instead of a few world Powers and Territories under their protection, we now have and here I quote the Secretary- General:\n\\\"... an international community of independent States seeking to maintain their freedom and to develop their destiny as sovereign and equal Members of the United Nations. It is impossible to underestimate the importance of such a fundamental historic change and its implications for the world order which the Governments and t\u00a3ie peoples of the world are seeking to build in the United Nations.\\\"[A/31/l/Add.l, sect. II]\nThat transformation in the geopolitical map of the world has produced a concomitant transformation in the world power structure. T!^ emergence of a large number of newly independent countries has led to a significant decentralization of the focus of power. We now have a situation where a number of regional power centers have emerged in different parts of the world.\n326.\tThe contemporary world situation is that of an unequal relationship among countries, in terms of size, population, military and economic strength, in which the strong can dominate the weak. In many parts of the world the security and existence of smaller nations are being threatened by their more powerful neighbors. It will make a mockery of our hard-won independence if we now have to subordinate our national interests to those of our more powerful neighbors or bend our national policies to accommodate their interventionist role. The basic political compulsion facing the world today is the protection of the weaker states from their stronger neighbors. Unless the freedom of the smaller and weaker nations to pursue their own social, economic and political policies is protected, the fabric of international co-operation and development will be jeopardized.\n327.\tThis Organization is based on the principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members, of territorial integrity, political and economic independence and of non-interference in their internal affairs. Maintenance of inter-national peace and security and protection of the equal rights of all nations, large and small, is a fundamental responsibility of this Organization. To perform that duty effectively, it is essential for the United Nations itself to reflect the evolution of the international community. The geopolitical changes which have occurred during the last 25 years call for a wider role for the United Nations as an instrument for dealing with international disputes and for maintaining peace and security. The potentially .beneficial role that the United Nations can play in this respect has not been fully utilized even when the world power structure was restricted. The disparity between the potential and the actual performance of the United Nations has now become more glaring. The short-comings of the United Nations system as an instrument for maintaining world peace and security have constantly engaged our attention. If the United Nations system has to prove its continued relevance \\'L has to demonstrate its ability like all other living organisms to adapt itself to changing conditions. It would serve a useful purpose if we could transform our criticism of the United Nations into a constructive review of its primary role as an instrument for maintaining international peace and security.\n328.\tThe Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo, in reaffirming the dedication of its countries to the principle of the United Nations and its Charter, has confirmed its abiding faith in the continued relevance of the Organization to the future welfare of mankind. The Declaration it issued [see A/311197, annex I] is a tribute of the highest order to this august forum, which in a sense is the embodiment of the conscience and enlightenment of the world community as a whole.\n329.\tThe Conference made specific recommendations of great significance to the future of this Organization. In keeping with the spirit of the Declaration, and with the object of taking one single constructive step forward, my delegation proposes for the consideration of the Member\nStates that the General Assembly include in its agenda an item on the strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. A discussion of the issue should include, in our opinion, the following: first, a comprehensive review of the geopolitical changes that have taken place since the birth of the United Nations and their effects on relations between States; secondly, a study of the wider Tole of the United Nations that is required to meet the changed geopolitical conditions; and, thirdly, specific recommendations for strengthening the role of the United Nations for maintaining peace and security and protecting the equal rights of all nations.\n330.\tIf this proposal commends itself to the members of this Assembly, my delegation will be prepared to submit a memorandum on the subject elaborating the proposal. Alternatively, this proposal could be considered by a special session of the General Assembly. The Fifth Conference has called for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly not later than 1978 on disarmament and security. The agenda of this proposed special session could be adjusted in a suitable manner so that it could also review the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security and for protecting the equal rights of all States.\n331.\tIn conclusion, I would pay respectful homage to the memory of Chairman Mao Tsetung. We convey to the Chinese Government and people our deep sense of loss at his death. Others have spoken eloquently about the greatness of Chairman Mao and the miracle he performed in his own lifetime. The lesson of Chairman Mao and of the Chinese people in modern times is of the utmost relevance to our world. His was the embodiment of that leadership which a united full quarter of the human race and directed its energy in the single-minded pursuit of national development. The history of the Chinese people under his leadership is the history of infinite capacity of human endeavor, and it will remain as a source of inspiration for struggling humanity till the end of time.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please accept my congratulations on your election to your responsible office. We see your mandate also as recognition of Sri Lanka's role in the United Nations and in the group of non-aligned countries. Your country received great acknowledgment recently as host to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, whose constructive activity we value.\n121.\tI also wish to extend best wishes and words of appreciation to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for his successful and untiring work.\n122.\tWe cordially welcome the Republic of Seychelles as a newly admitted member of the United Nations.\n123.\tThe German Democratic Republic notes with satisfaction that political detente continues gaining momentum as the decisive trend in international affairs. Peaceful co-operation for mutual benefit is an objective for which there is growing commitment. In Europe, the Conference on Security and Co-operation has had a sensible effect on the relationship between the States and peoples.\n124.\tIn Asia, the endeavor to achieve greater security has increased in strength due to the successful liberation struggle of the peoples, above all those of IndoChina. Further strongholds of colonialism collapsed during the last year. The people of Angola have liberated themselves. The struggle for equitable international economic relations is unfolding very dynamically.\n125.\tAt the same time, there remain many problems to be solved. The arms race is jeopardizing detente. Serious and armed conflicts are threatening security and peace. In southern Africa, colonialist and racist oppression is raging. Most aggressive forces are even trying to push mankind back to cold war. Therefore, those are well advised who value duly, but without illusion, what has been achieved on the road of detente. Let me express my conviction that the United Nations will make its contribution towards strengthening peace and security as provided for by its Charter, which is, now as before, a tried and tested document.\n126.\tAt the Ninth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in May this year, General Secretary Erich Honecker of the Party's Central Committee reaffirmed the effort of our country for the strengthening of peace and security in Europe and in the world. He expressed himself categorically in favor of the extension and stabilization of the results achieved in the pursuit of the policy of peaceful coexistence and for supplementing political detente by measures of military detente.\n127.\tThe German Democratic Republic allies itself with all those who strive to liberate mankind forever from the scourge of war. War must no longer be a means of settling international issues.\n128.\tProfound changes in the world have created conditions for excluding aggression and the use of force forever from the relations between States. A world treaty on the non-use of force is now imperative. Single-minded action to implement this Soviet proposal would be highly appropriate to extend detente to the world as a whole.\n129.\tSuch a significant move would have a beneficial effect on the international atmosphere as well as on the solution of questions of disarmament, both conventional and nuclear. As a matter of course, the renunciation of force would in no way impair the inalienable right of peoples to resist national suppression and exploitation and to fight for, and achieve, the exercise of their right to self-determination. In addition, it would render imperialist aggression and intervention much more difficult and would help to eliminate them finally.\n130.\tThis initiative has really historic dimensions. Rulers of past times postulated jus ad bellum. The Great October Socialist Revolution abolished it with the Decree on Peace and, as a result of the Second World War, the peoples fighting against fascism compelled its universal banning. And now the noble task is to make non-use of force in international relations an inviolable, sacred law.\n131.\tIn his report to the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, stated that the annual arms spending already amounted to approximately $300 billion.  Meanwhile, this total has largely been exceeded. Immense intellectual and material resources are employed for the development and perfection of weapons and weapon systems and are withheld from the solution of pressing economic and social problems.\n132.\tThose to whom the arms race is a source of maximum profit go to any length to burden their peoples with ever greater arms expenditures. Mendaciously they seek to justify their policy of strength with an alleged \\\"threat from the East\\\". But it is a notorious fact that the fiercest anti-Communist attacks are launched whenever greater funds are demanded for armament.\n133.\tMoreover-and everybody knows-all proposals for arms limitation and disarmament that are now under discussion in the United Nations were made by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, other socialist States, and developing countries.\n134.\tProceedings in the General Assembly, its competent Committees and in the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, and the negotiations in Vienna indicate who is willing to proceed to drawing up inter-national agreements and who is obstructing.\n135.\tThe state of the disarmament negotiations is not satisfactory. Yet we do not share the purposive pessimism of various circles. Given the requisite political will of all sides, practical steps towards arms limitation and disarmament will be immediately possible. For example, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has proved its viability, not least because a hundred States by now have acceded to it. It remains the aim of the German Democratic Republic to strengthen the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons along the lines of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference in May 1975.  Nuclear weapons must be totally removed from the war arsenals- A complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests is no doubt another step towards this end. We deem it imperative that last year's resolution [resolution 3466 (XXX)] be not only reaffirmed but that all States be called on to co-operate in an. active way. We welcome the text of a convention on the prohibition of the misuse of the human environment for military purposes which the Geneva Committee on Disarmament has prepared and which is before this General Assembly for approval [see A/31127, annex I]. We will vote for it. The tails of experts in the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament on the prohibition of the development and production of new weapons of mass destruction and systems of such weapons can expedite the preparation of a relevant agreement. These activities should be continued with priority. Like the majority of States, we also consider that arms limitation and disarmament should be discussed at a world conference. The special session of the United Nations which the non-aligned countries proposed at their Conference in Colombo could gain importance for that. The German Democratic Republic hopes for regulations covering the transfer of nuclear material, equipment or technologies for peaceful purposes. They will have to exclude any misuse. To ensure an even more effective application of the principles of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons it would be good to work out and agree regulations to this effect without delay.\n136.\tSomewhat over a year ago the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was signed by 33 European countries as well as by the United States of America and Canada. Already now we may say that this has ushered in a change in the relations between the European States having different social systems and marked out a broad field for multifaceted, mutually beneficial co-operation. To develop it fully will no doubt require the active co-operation of all signatory States in keeping with the spirit and letter of the document.\n137.\tIt will be to nobody's advantage to question again the European post-war order which was documented and sealed in the Final Act, and to present before the highest body of the United Nations a creation of fancy that has nothing to do with reality. It is common knowledge that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany are two sovereign States independent of each other. Their membership in the United Nations is eloquent evidence of this. In free self-determination, the people of the German Democratic Republic has forever decided for socialism and adherence to the community of socialist States. The western frontier of the German Democratic Republic separates two States that belong to entirely different social systems and alliances. Security of States is and remains, first and foremost, security of their frontiers. To ensure them reliably is an equal obligation for all sides prescribed by the Final Act of Helsinki. Nobody can be discharged from this responsibility. Whoever attempts to deny the international character of this frontier, thus providing irresponsible cover for provocations at this frontier, should bear this in mind.\n138.\tOnly a policy renouncing all arrogation and respecting realities is in accordance with the purposes and tasks of the world organization.\n139.\tAs a socialist State, the German Democratic Republic wants to pursue its peaceful construction work in tranquility and security. It does everything to translate the document of Helsinki into reality, to make it the basis for the conduct of bilateral relations with other signatory States and to implement it multilaterally. On the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and with a view to peace and security, my country maintains mutually beneficial relations with countries having other social systems. We participate in the negotiations on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Remarkable progress could certainly have been made there, were all parties prepared to respect in practice undiminished security for all participants. It has been uncontested for a long time that multilateral arrangements ought to be found concerning problems of energy, environmental protection and transport on our continent. Now the appropriate political conditions do exist. We are in favor of convening all-European conferences for this purpose.\n140.\tThe German Democratic Republic notes with gratification a growth of endeavors to strengthen regional security in Asia. It values lasting, good-neighborly relations between the States as an important prerequisite for converting Asia into a continent of peace and co-operation, and it welcomes what has been accomplished along these lines on the Indian subcontinent.\n141.\tThe founding of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has an extremely favorable effect on co-operation among the States of the region. Hence we expressly demand the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations. Viet Nam's equal membership would not only accord with the Charter, it would indeed enhance the authority of the world organization.\n142.\tWe express our solidarity with the demand, which was recently supported by the Colombo Conference, that foreign troops along with their nuclear weapons be with-drawn from South Korea. The German Democratic Re-public considers the implementation of the relevant resolution of the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 3390 (XXX)] to be imperative. A task of great urgency is the removal of imperialist military bases in various regions of the world. Their mere existence threatens peace, particularly in the regions concerned. We support those States which want a zone of peace to be established in the area of the Indian Ocean, and which consequently call for the dismantling of foreign military bases.\n143.\tThe German Democratic Republic expresses its deep concern about the aggravating situation in the Middle East. We share the view expressed by many States that, in the interest of international security, a political settlement of this problem is necessary and, we believe, possible.\n144.\tThe precondition is Israel's complete withdrawal from all territories occupied since 1967, the fulfillment of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to establish a State of its own, the establishment of international guarantees for the security and for the inviolability of the frontiers of all States in the Middle East, as well as assurances for the right to independent existence and development.\n145.\tThe clashes and bloodshed in Lebanon are a direct consequence of the unsettled Middle East conflict. The resulting dangers necessitate an immediate end to these clashes without outside interference and with safeguards for Lebanon's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. It must not be permitted that the hard-hit Arab people of Palestine suffer further harm. The German Democratic Republic wishes the United Nations to take action to ensure the overdue reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. Any delay will make a comprehensive political settlement more difficult; favor the aggressor and his backers who have ignored the essential demands of the United Nations since 1967.\n146.\tLikewise, the resolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus should be implemented. Their purpose is to ensure, at long last, peace and sovereignty for this non-aligned State.\n147.\tIn Africa, the struggle for the liquidation of the remaining strongholds of colonial exploitation and racist suppression has grown in strength. Denying the right of peoples to self-determination in southern Africa affects security, both regional and international. South Africa has become a source of war. Increasing domestic terrorism combines with constant aggression against free African States.\n148.\tBut regardless of repeated condemnation of the racist regimes by the Security Council of the United Nations, certain circles, only too well known to the world, are continuing their political, military and economic collaboration with the Vorster regime, and are even dangerously extending it to the nuclear field.\n149.\tIn the name of the people of the German Democratic Republic, we protest against the bloody outrages in South Africa against a people that wants, at long last, to be free and to determine its fate for itself. My country will also in the future display solidarity with and render assistance to the efforts of the forces of national liberation. The last strongholds of colonialism and racism will collapse. The peoples do not accept being deprived any longer of their right to self-determination.\n150.\tWe stand firmly by the side of the free African States in defending and strengthening their hard won independence. Our solidarity is with the People's Republic of Angola with which the German Democratic Republic is linked by fraternal bonds. We strongly support Angola's legitimate right to membership in the United Nations.\n151.\tthe total elimination of colonialism and racism is at the same time the condition for many millions of people to exercise their human rights. The United Nations has a remarkable record in this regard. Its Charter declares peace and the right of peoples to self-determination the Organization's main concerns. On the basis of respect for equal rights and sovereignty, the precept of non-interference, and the right to self-determination, it strives for a state of stability and welfare for all peoples. This is the frame where the international protection of human rights belongs. And with this in mind the United Nations has defined the elimination of massive violations of human rights as an area of international co-operation.\n152.\tBut certain circles are eager, under pretexts that are only too transparent, to change the instrument for the protection of humanity as embodied by the Charter of the United Nations into the contrary. They seek to establish so-called supra-national institutions. The intention is always the same: to pave the way for interference in the affairs of other States and to call into question their personal and territorial sovereignty. But it is on record to what an appalling extent these very circles, contrary to the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations, support the regime of apartheid in South Africa in the political, economic, scientific, technological, financial, and even military, fields.\n153.\tNobody can, for instance, relieve a State of its responsibility for all of its citizens to enjoy their right to work and education and to live in secure social conditions, for men and women to be assured of equal rights in all spheres of public life, for so-called guest workers not to be subjected to any discrimination and for nobody to be exposed to political witch-hunting and to be barred from certain types of employment.\n154.\tWe exercise solidarity with the peoples in southern Africa in the struggle for their national self-determination. We vigorously urge the restoration of human rights which are being violated on a massive scale by reactionary and Fascist regimes. In Chile, thousands of upright persons have vanished without a trace behind prison walls and in concentration camps. The world has a right to know about their fate. We demand the immediate release of Luis Corvalan and the other political prisoners.\n155.\tThere can be no doubt that one of the areas of world-wide co-operation vital to mankind is the development of marine resources. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, to which the German Democratic Republic is a party, is called upon to work out regulations acceptable to all sides for a rational use of the riches of the sea. The German Democratic Republic expresses its willingness to co-operate in mutual accord with all the States participating in the Conference in order to achieve this aim.\n156.\tOwing to changes in international life and the degree of present political detente, many peoples have been able in the last few decades to win their political independence. Now they are striving for economic independence and the elimination of all forms of neo-colonialist exploitation.\n157.\tThe sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States as well as a number of other important international decisions are, not least, a reflection of the fact that the Asian, African and Latin American countries have become an important and active force in shaping truly equitable international economic relations.\n158.\tThe German Democratic Republic concurs with the statement of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries that one of the major needs of the present time is to change international economic relations. They are to be placed on an equal and mutually beneficial footing, free from racial discrimination and colonialist or neo-colonialist; exploitation.\n159.\tThe States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance support the developing countries in their struggle for economic independence.\n160.\tTo the German Democratic Republic, detente and development are not incompatible alternatives but inter-dependent sides of the process towards human progress which is palpably taking place in today's world.\n161.\tThe representatives at this session of the United Nations General Assembly have busy months before them. Our delegation expects the thirty-first session to make an important contribution towards the preservation of peace and towards equal co-operation of all States and peoples on the basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the world Organization. May I assure you that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic will co-operate constructively with all delegations to attain these goals?\n"

        "file_text": "It is with particular pleasure that, through you, Sir, I express to Mr. Amerasinghe, on behalf of the Republic of Cyprus, warm congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. It is very fitting that an eminent representative of Sri Lanka, which now chairs the non-aligned movement-to which the majority of the States Members of the Organization belong- should guide our deliberations during a crucial period in international developments. We are confident that, with his rich experience and recognized ability and with his dedication to the principles and ideals of the United Nations, this Assembly will contribute constructively and significantly towards the solution of the various pressing international problems.\n61.\tMay I take this opportunity also to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for the outstanding way in which he successfully guided the deliberations of the last session of the General Assembly.\n62.\tIt also gives me great pleasure to welcome the Republic of Seychelles to the Organization. The admission to membership of yet another State which has just emerged from colonial status constitutes a further step in the irreversible process towards complete decolonization and the realization of the principle of universality of the United Nations. We hope that this process will soon be further consolidated by the admission of Viet Nam and Angola and of the remaining Territories still under colonial or other alien rule.\n63.\tThirty-one years have elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations. Its membership has grown from the original 51 States to the present number of 145, and this fact shows the momentous evolution which has taken place since the Second World War and demonstrates the significance of the Organization in the new era which has since been ushered in for mankind.\n64.\tToday, the outmoded patterns of international thinking and behavior have given place to the new concept that the world is interdependent and constitutes a single community. Technological advance has made the world shrink, and events occurring in one place have global repercussions. In our world of today, peace, freedom, and social and economic justice are indivisible, and co-operation among peoples and nations is an imperative necessity.\n65.\tDespite this new thinking and these realities, however, we are equally faced with the very strong resistance of forces striving to preserve inequitable relations by all means. The international scene still abounds with situations ominously removed from the fundamental principles upon which the Organization is based. This reality should not be glossed over in the United Nations and cannot be ignored by the international community without dire consequences to the further course and development of the world; for we are in a period of a delicate balance between the prevalence of the concept of the use of force and domination-an outdated relic of the past-and that of reason and peace, so necessary for the survival of mankind in the interdependent world of the nuclear age. It is in this context, too, that one should view attempts to bypass or ignore the world Organization and attempts to discredit in various ways the United Nations, or to limit its effectiveness merely by declarations or verbal reports.\n66.\tAs the Secretary-General has pertinently pointed out in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"We have had many recent experiences of the wide discrepancy between the unanimity, or near unanimity, of decisions of the Security Council or the General Assembly and the practical effect which such decisions have on the issues to which they are addressed\\\" [A/ 31/1/Add.l, sect. IV].\nAnd later he stressed:\n\\\"The responsibilities of Governments do not cease when a resolution is adopted; indeed resolutions usually require determined action by Governments, in addition to the parties directly concerned, if they are to be translated into reality\\\" [ibid.].\n67.\tThis is indeed true and touches upon a raw nerve and a fundamental issue: the divergence between what is professed in theory and what is done in practice. If the United Nations is to fulfill its fundamental objectives, this pattern must be corrected. Setting aside the legalisms as to the binding effect of United Nations resolutions-whether they be \\\"recommendations\\\" of the General Assembly or \\\"decisions\\\" of the Security Council and, in the latter case, whether they be made under Chapter VI or Chapter VII-the essential point which emerges from this observation of the Secretary-General which is valid and too true for comfort is that a Member State which has voted for a resolution has an obligation, and is duty-bound, to act consistently with the position it has freely taken, and to do its utmost to fulfill the commitment it has thus made; for the alternative plainly is to demonstrate to all-and not only to the critics of the United Nations-the impotence of the Organization to implement what it solemnly, and after due consideration, decided and the hollowness of its resolutions.\n68.\tIt is significant that the Heads of State and Government of the non-aligned countries pledged in the Political Declaration of Colombo to use their collective weight in the United Nations for the promotion of the purposes and principles of the Charter and, more particularly, for the \\\"full application of the Charter provisions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security and also the effective discharge of the functions of the Security Council through the implementation of its decisions\\\" [see A/31 /197, para. 152]. Such a development would give practical expression to the general wish for the strengthening of the United Nations.\n69.\tMany are the grave problems that are to be dealt with by this Assembly. One, which is of vital importance to mankind, is disarmament. The concept of force and armaments still seems to be the axis around which all notions of security revolve. The effect of this concept is to promote military antagonism and an escalating arms race inconsistent with the Charter and with the basic needs of our times. It should be a source of serious concern to us all that there has been no progress at all towards disarmament since our last session. Indeed, no progress has been made towards defining concepts which could make possible the commencement of negotiations on general and complete disarmament, while the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] has not as yet attained its objectives.\n70.\tIt is with great anxiety that we watch this state of affairs and the recent trend towards the wider proliferation of nuclear weapons which, if allowed to continue, is bound to have the gravest implications and repercussions for the international community as a whole. It is my Government's long-held view that, while all assistance should be given by the nuclear Powers to non-nuclear States in obtaining access to nuclear energy for peaceful uses, the paramount necessity for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should at the same time be safeguarded at all costs. Accession to the Treaty should be encouraged by all means possible.\n71.\tWe believe that the problem of disarmament is closely related to the stand which should be taken for the activation of the Charter in its most essential provisions on the maintenance of international peace and security, namely, for the effective functioning of the Security Council through the implementation of its decisions. When Security Council decisions become effective, the foundation will be laid for collective security and peace in a world of progressive legal order. This development will reduce emphasis on ensuring security through antagonistic military alliances and will contribute significantly to the cessation of the arms race.\n72.\tIn parallel, persistent efforts must be made to find a way out of the increasingly threatening situation that the arms race involves. We support, therefore, the holding of a world conference on disarmament, or the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on the subject, in which all nuclear Powers would participate.\n73.\tColossal sums are annually squandered on purposeless armaments instead of being spent for the well-being of mankind. If only a small part of this wasteful expenditure was applied to the positive purpose of development, the grave economic difficulties facing the world could be overcome, and the existing gap between the developed and developing countries could be substantially bridged.\n74.\tThis brings us to the inequitable economic disparity which exists in the world and which seriously hinders efforts for the consolidation of peace. The establishment of a new economic order which would lay the foundations for bridging the gap between developed and developing countries has become an imperative necessity in our interdependent world. The seventh special session of the General Assembly went a long way towards this end, but much still needs to be done. The general awareness of the importance of the problem, and of the need to deal with it realistically, as shown at the conferences held at Manila,  Nairobi  and Colombo,  gives rise to the hope that more concrete results may be forthcoming through increased solidarity among the developing countries.\n75.\tThe Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe constitutes a landmark in the history of East-West relations. It is the result of the consciousness of the necessity for co-operation and for a common approach to common dangers and problems, the solution of which will without doubt prove to be to the benefit of the whole world. The sincere, full and indivisible implementation of the Helsinki principles and the turning of the Final Act into a standard of international behavior is a moral obligation for the signatories and constitutes an imperative need for the promotion and consolidation of world peace and security. The continuing occupation of my country by Turkey, also a signatory of the Helsinki Act, serves as an illustrative reminder that the principles envisaged by this Act have not as yet been fully respected, nor its fundamental purposes achieved.\n76.\tAt the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, efforts have been under way to deal with the complex legal, economic and political issues involved and to arrive at an orderly, just and equitable system for the benefit of mankind as a whole. Considerable progress has been made towards the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable convention and I would like to pay a tribute to Mr. Amerasinghe for his constructive role in guiding the Conference to this end. Cyprus, an island State located between three continents, has a fundamental interest in the early and successful outcome of this major undertaking in a manner that will safeguard the position of islands and ensure that the delimitation of zones of maritime jurisdiction will be in accordance with clear and objectively ascertainable rules and with the basic principle of sovereign equality. We are firmly convinced that an essential corollary to the substantive rules of the convention is a comprehensive and effective system for the peaceful and just settlement of international disputes arising therefrom, thus ensuring for all States the protection of their legitimate rights through third-party adjudication on the basis of objective legal criteria.\n77.\tPersistence in the anachronistic policies and. attitudes of southern Africa seriously imperils peace and stability in the African continent and threatens international peace and security. The continuing illegal occupation of Namibia, the denial of the right to self-determination and majority rule to the people of Zimbabwe and the racist policies followed by the South African regime are unacceptable situations fraught with grave dangers.\n78.\tThe United Nations is shouldering a special responsibility with regard to Namibia and all Member States must give their full support to this Organization so that the people of Namibia may enjoy their inalienable right to independence. With regard to Zimbabwe, we express the hope that efforts currently under way will lead to positive results and enable its people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and to attain the majority government to which they are entitled. The abhorrent policies of apartheid in South Africa continue to be an affront to the conscience of mankind, inasmuch as they constitute a negation of justice, human dignity and the moral values for which our civilization stands. We emphatically condemn the injustice being perpetrated against the South African people in defiance of repeated United Nations resolutions, and we call for the adoption of effective measures for the implementation of these resolutions; we also denounce \\\"bantustanization\\\" in South Africa, which is aimed at preventing the liberation of its people, while at the same time breaking up the unity of the country. We call for effective and resolute action to combat the designs of the racist regime.\n79.\tRegarding the question of international violence, including that of the taking of hostages - an aspect dealt with in the proposal by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany [7th meeting, para. 113]-there is no doubt that these matters have become of serious concern to the whole world. A real discussion, however, would have to go to the root of the problem in a comprehensive way in an effort to reach an understanding on all its aspects, with a view to deciding, on the basis of consensus, how the problem can be tackled in its proper perspective.\n80.\tGuided by the fundamental and immutable principles of the Charter of this Organization, my Government fully supports Panama's legitimate claim to sovereignty over the Panama Canal. It is our fervent hope that the relevant bilateral contacts and negotiations will soon lead to a successful outcome.\n81.\tIn the Middle East, the crisis remains unresolved and the situation continues to be fraught with grave danger. The absence of war does not necessarily mean the presence of peace. The continuing illegal occupation of Arab territories and the violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people constitute the elements of a human tragedy and are the cause of a serious threat to world peace and security.\n82.\tThere can be no radical and final solution, and there can be no just and durable peace in the region, unless Israel withdraws from all Arab territories occupied by it since 1967 and unless the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored, including the right to return to their homes in safety, in full implementation of \nthe relevant resolutions of the Organization. The effective implementation of these resolutions will greatly serve the cause of peace in this very sensitive part of the world.\n83.\tThe tragic events in our neighbor, the friendly State of Lebanon, are directly related to the Arab-Israeli conflict and should serve as a warning of what could befall the whole region if a just settlement of the Middle East problem is not reached soon. We follow these events with grief and anxiety and it is our earnest hope that hostilities will cease and that a solution safeguarding the country's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment will be speedily reached.\n84.\tClosely connected with the problem of the Middle East-and similar to it in many of its aspects-is the problem of Cyprus.\n85.\tMore than two years since the original aggression and invasion of Cyprus by Turkey the problem of my country remains unresolved and the picture that Cyprus presents today continues to be grim. Its component elements remain: the continued occupation of 40 per cent of the island's territory ; the usurpation and/ or destruction of 70 per cent of its economic resources; the 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, representing one third of the total Cypriot population; and the illegal presence in Cyprus of 40,000 Turkish troops, with the untold misery which they cause to the Cypriot' people, Greek and Turkish alike. Beyond these, the human drama of the thousands of missing and unaccounted for; Ankara's policy of faits accomplis; the turning of the negotiations into a travesty; the daily expulsions of Greek Cypriots still remaining in the occupied area; the colonization of this area by the mass transfer of settlers from Turkey; and the contemptuous disregard persistently shown by Ankara towards the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus-all these constitute the other aspects of the tragedy of the Cypriot people and reveal the true dimensions of the problem.\n86.\tThe United Nations has repeatedly dealt with the Cyprus problem and adopted resolutions providing the framework and the guidelines for its settlement. Even Turkey voted for resolution 3212 (XXIX) on Cyprus adopted by the General Assembly and endorsed by Security Council resolution 365 (1974). These and other United Nations resolutions, notably General Assembly resolution 3395 (XXX), provide for the withdrawal of all foreign troops without delay and for the urgent return of the refugees to their homes in safety. Since the Turkish aggression, a total of 16 resolutions on Cyprus have been adopted by the United Nations; 13 by the Security Council and 3 by the General Assembly. None of these resolutions has been implemented by Turkey, and none of their provisions has it respected. Sixteen United Nations reso\u00aclutions have been treated by Turkey as scrap paper devoid of any value.\n\n87.\tEven with regard to General- Assembly resolution 3450 (XXX) on the purely humanitarian problem of the over 2,000 missing and unaccounted-for Greek Cypriot civilians and prisoners of war, Turkey has taken an arbitrary stand. It bluntly refused to co-operate with the International Committee of the Red Cross and denied the Committee the access to the occupied area which it needed to carry out searches or collect information on the fate of the missing persons. I address an emphatic appeal to this Assembly to assist in this purely humanitarian matter by taking steps towards the urgent implementation of resolution 3450 (XXX), so that an end may be put to the agonizing ordeal of the families of the missing persons.\n88.\tApart from the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and the return of all refugees to their homes- provisions which Turkey has chosen to ignore-the United Nations resolutions provide for the holding of substantive and constructive negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with a view to reaching freely a mutually acceptable political settlement based on their fundamental and legitimate rights. The purpose of the negotiations is clearly and unambiguously stated in the resolutions. The negotiations are concerned with the constitutional issue and not with the withdrawal of the foreign troops and the return of the refugees to their homes, which, in accordance with the resolutions, should precede and not follow the talks; for how could the people of Cyprus of whatever origin, by themselves, bring about the cessation of the aggression and of the occupation of their country by a foreign Power and in what way could they be expected to negotiate freely their future with the presence of a powerful army of occupation on their territory? It should be remembered, that the problem of Cyprus is not in essence one between the two Cypriot communities but one of aggression against the defenseless non-aligned Republic of Cyprus by its powerful neighbor, Turkey.\n89.\tThe inter-communal talks began within the framework of the above resolutions with the reasonable expectation that Turkey, in compliance with the resolutions, would, in a parallel way, set in motion measures for their progressive implementation. Turkey not only failed to take any steps for such implementation but actually violated the resolutions by engaging in faits accomplis directly contrary, to the substance of the resolutions. At the same time, acting through the Turkish Cypriots in the talks, it adopted delaying tactics and persistently failed to put forward any concrete proposals despite its express commitment. The talks were thus rendered practically useless.\n90.\tWe always welcome talks and negotiations a? an effective means of solving say problem. We firmly believe that a well-meaning dialog may bridge opposing views and settle differences. No problem is impossible to solve if substantive talks are conducted with goodwill, a common wish for their success and a common objective. This has been, and still is our view and conviction. Similarly, we have always expressed readiness to examine any proposal for a solution of the Cyprus problem in the light of the provisions of the relevant United Nations resolutions. It is in the sense of this basic position that we look into the views, advanced by the Secretary of State of the United States, before this Assembly, on 30 September 1976 [11th meeting].\n91.\tThe Turkish side, however, has been approaching the talks in a striking different way. Ankara, which, as is well known, dictates the Turkish Cypriot position in these negotiations, considers the negotiating table as a suitable forum for imposing inadmissible terms, relying upon its military forces of occupation. Turkey looks upon the \nnegotiating procedure as a convenient vehicle for an undisturbed passing of time which it uses in order to consolidate its position in the occupied territory through a series of faits accomplis and the colonization of this area. It does not aspire to a just solution of the Cyprus problem through the inter-communal talks, but it does find convenient a semblance of negotiation. Although the Turkish Cypriot negotiator, on instructions from Ankara, does not allow a constructive dialog to develop, yet by futilely attending rounds of talks in Vienna or New York, he tries to mislead the world into believing that Turkey favours the talks and through them is seeking a solution to the Cyprus problem. The aim is obvious. In this way, Turkey is enabled to head off international efforts for a just solution under the pretext that negotiations are in progress while at the same time it consolidates its position in the occupied area by a series of faits accomplis. In this respect, it may be recalled that Turkey, deliberately evading international efforts for the solution of the problem, had rejected outright the Soviet proposal for a wider international conference on Cyprus, which my Government accepted.\n92.\tTurkey has been undermining the negotiations not only by its negative stand on the talks but also by creating further faits accomplis in breach of express commitments which the Turkish side had undertaken during the talks End in flagrant violation of basic norms of international humanitarian law and the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus.\n93.\tAt the third round of the inter-communal talks in Vienna in August 1975, it was agreed that the Turkish Cypriots who remained in the Government-controlled areas would be allowed to move to the Turkish-held areas and the Greek Cypriots who remained in the occupied areas, would be free to stay here and would be given every facility to lea d a normal life. It was also agreed that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus [ UNFICYPJwovld have free and normal access to the Greek Cypriot villages in the occupied areas. Turkey, having secured the implementation of those provisions of the agreement which were to its advantage, chose to throw aside and violate the rest of the provisions. Not only did Turkey prevent the Greek Cypriots who remained in the occupied area from leading normal lives and denied UNFICYP the possibility to exercise its agreed role, but it also embarked upon a process of systematically expelling the Greek Cypriots through tactics of oppression, harassment and brute force. These inhuman expulsions, which are being carried out daily, add to the drama of the Cypriot people and accentuate the tragedy. The wholesale expulsions have been resorted to by Turkey for the purpose of \\\"homogenizing\\\", as it calls it, the occupied area and for the purpose of facilitating it the perpetuation of yet another repugnant international crime, that of colonization.\n94.\tAnkara, not content with the uprooting and elimination from the occupied area of the indigenous majority because of its ethnic origin, has also been engaged in the illegal colonization of the area by the massive transfer of .people from Turkey, who are currently being settled in the usurped homes and properties of the expelled Greek Cypriots. One of the results of the policy of colonization-a paradoxical one-has been that the Turkish Cypriots, for whose protection and well-being Turkey sJIegedly invaded\nCyprus, have also become victims of this policy and suffer greatly from the presence of the imported settlers, who receive preferential treatment from the Turkish occupation authorities.\n95.\tThe purpose of the expulsions and colonization and of Ankara's dilatory tactics in the negotiations is only too obvious. Turkey, as I have already mentioned, is trying to \\\"homogenize\\\" the occupied area and to bring about changes in the demographic character of Cyprus with a view to paving the way for the partition of the island and the de facto annexation of the occupied areas. At the same time, the creation of the faits accomplis enables Ankara to repeat its favorite tune of \\\"new realities\\\" in an effort to avert international pressures for the return of the refugees to their homes and lands and for the just settlement of the territorial aspect of the problem.\n96.\tTurkey's policy over Cyprus consists in the creation, by the use of force, of faits accomplis which it tries to justify to the world by false pretenses and misrepresentations. Turkey calls such faits accomplis \\\"new realities\\\" and asks the Greek Cypriots and the world to accept them. The original faits accomplis are followed by others and the original \\\"realities\\\" become \\\"newer realities\\\", supported by new false justifications and lame excuses. The policy of the step-by-step solution of international problems is in fact used by Turkey in reverse not for the peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem, but for the forced dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus.\n97.\tBeyond the suffering of a people, the situation in Cyprus and its implications pose a grave challenge to the effectiveness of the United Nations and raise fundamental questions regarding the values and the basic principles on which the continued existence of the Organization depends. The present tragedy in my country, of which I have given but a pale picture, calls for urgent and effective action by the General Assembly. The course to be followed is crystal-clear-that of taking such measures as would give effective implementation to the relevant General Assembly resolutions made mandatory by Security Council decisions. This is the logical and appropriate means for the just and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem which my Government seeks from the United Nations, and this is what we have come to request from this Assembly.\n9S. May I, before concluding, avail myself of this opportunity to add a word of praise and deep appreciation for the outstanding work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in promoting the objectives and ideals of the United Nations and at the same time to express to him our gratitude for his untiring efforts to assist in every possible way in the search for a solution of the Cyprus problem in accordance with his mandate and the principles of the Charter. I should also like to highly commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Perez de Cuellar, for the exemplary manner in which he performs his difficult task in Cyprus. May I also record, in this respect, our warm appreciation for the dedicated efforts of the Under-Secretaries-General R. Guyer and B. Urquhart.\n99. We also wish to express deep appreciation to the Commander of UNFICYP, General Prem Chand, and to all the officers and men serving .under his command, who discharge the responsibilities entrusted to them by the United Nations with dedication and devotion despite the many obstacles confronting them.\n100.\tI would be remiss if I did not say how grateful we are to the countries that are contributing military and police contingents to UNFICYP, as well as to those which make voluntary financial contributions to enable the Force to function.\n101.\tOur warmest thanks and gratitude go also to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, for his invaluable humanitarian work in alleviating the suffering of the refugees, as well as to the countries and organizations which contribute for this purpose.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the beginning of my statement on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of the Congo, I would like to bow my head respectfully before the memory of Chairman Mao Tsetung, a man of thought and action who left such 3 profound imprint on the history of our time. The sorrow cf the great Chinese people, our friends, was very much -felt and entirely shared by the Congolese people.\n227.\tI consider it a privilege and an honor to appear here for the first time, in this, the most important deliberative assembly of the world. My first act will therefore be that of conveying to- our President, Mr. Amerasinghe, the warm congratulations of the Government of my country. He has earned the presidency of our Assembly by his long experience of men and the affairs of the world which is in itself sufficient guarantee of the success of our work. It is only natural for me to associate in this act of tribute, his predecessor, Prime Minister Gaston Thom. It is in large measure to his profound knowledge of international problems that we owe the quality of the work of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n228.\tIt is also an honor to express the satisfaction of my Government at the way in which our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, is discharging his important and delicate functions. I have already had occasion to say this to him in the course of his recent official visit to the People's Republic of the Congo. The Congolese Party and State are very appreciative of the efforts made by the Secretary- General and his distinguished assistants to make of the United Nations a heeded, dynamic institution which measures up to the great ideals of peace and international security.\n229.\tThe most notable event in the life of nations since the Second World War has been the rise of the third world, which today is calling for the establishment of a new and less unjust international economic order and for solutions to the critical problems of tremendous importance to the very existence of mankind as a whole: troubled economies, the depletion of natural resources, ecologic catastrophe as the unexpected price of scientific and technological progress, uncontrolled stockpiling of thermonuclear weapons, diplomatic deadlocks with regard to problems of detente, international obligations which have not been honored, the crimes committed against the Chilean people the victims of a bloody dictatorship artificially fabricated interests in the Atlantic or the Indian Oceans, overpopulation, famine and cultural impoverishment.\n230.\tToday, mankind must take bold, enlightened global initiatives to deal with these real international problems. We \nmust begin with the most simple thing, that is to say, with respect for every people, which has the right to live in freedom in a world devoted in principle to peace.\n231.\tIf we analyze matters objectively the Second World War quite clearly appears as a vigorous response to a war of aggression imposed by fascism. Had it not been for the resistance of the peoples mankind would never have been able to rid itself of Hitler's dictatorship. The hot points of the planet in Asia, in the Middle East, in Africa and in Latin America conformed strictly to this same logic. Armed struggles against colonialism, apartheid, foreign domination are here instances of the will to make the ultimate sacrifice, something which has become indispensable for the liberation of whole peoples.\n232.\tConsequently the question of whether national liberation is necessarily to be brought about by violence no longer needs to be discussed in the United Nations for these two fundamental reasons: first, the violence of struggling peoples is nothing but their reaction to the initial violence against them by forces of foreign domination and exploitation. Furthermore, the United Nations recognizes not only the inalienable right of the peoples of the world to self-determination, freedom and independence, but also and above all the legitimacy of the struggle for the exercise of this right in accordance with our Charter. Armed struggle is not a squalid partisan struggle. Armed struggle does not stem from bastard and unmotivated policy which no one ever explains to the peoples. Armed struggle mobilizes to the utmost the energy of the strength required in the course of a liberating struggle. Armed force is the ultimate form assumed by the class struggle. The United Nations at one point shrank before the need for armed struggle in southern Africa in the hope for a final return of the South African racists to reason, to good sense and to repentance, but the results were immediate: a strengthening of the system of oppression to such a point is to render ineffective the measures advocated by the United Nations and thus to discredit our Organization. This material and juridical, the military and cultural strengthening of a system of oppression in South Africa is itself the result of the actions of European and United States diplomacy, which has thus brought to South Africa and Southern Rhodesia all the necessary assistance in thwarting the United Nations initiatives. We have only to look at the last report of the Committee on Decolonization of the Organization of African Unity to realize without any difficulty the underhand stratagems resorted to by the allies of Pretoria and Salisbury to strengthen racial discrimination and exploitation of the black man in southern Africa.\n233.\tAt a time when the objective allies of Pretoria and Salisbury are actively studying ways and means of imposing civil war on Namibia and Zimbabwe, by' setting up puppet governments which are totally committed to them, armed struggle remains the only recourse for the liberation movements in southern Africa. The summit conference at Dar es Salaam earlier this month once again has confirmed the imperative necessity of this, that is, the intensification of armed struggle.\n234.\tHow are we to explain the conduct of certain Powers which are suddenly engaging in feverish diplomatic activity vis-a-vis African countries, at this important stage, where armed struggle has entered such a crucial stage in southern Africa? Africans state that their human status is not negotiable and that is why we are convinced that fighting Africa will remain vigilant in the face of the innumerable attempts of the imperialists to recover lost ground. Fighting Africa will be suspicious of sudden conversions, marks of forced generosity which certain imperialists are lavishing these days, now that they are beginning to realize that final victory is inevitable. In Namibia and in Zimbabwe, men and women are fighting and are not afraid to lay down their lives. They want to live free, the masters of their present and their future. It is consequently right and legitimate that these freedom fighters should be fully associated with all discussions relating to the future of their respective countries. To put the matter clearly, any attempt at resisting the establishment of a majority regime in Zimbabwe should obviously be resisted, and in equally clear terms, if ever a conference in Namibia is to take place, it will be only natural for such a conference to be attended by SWAPO and the South African Government under the aegis of the United Nations. If SWAPO does not take part in such a conference, it would obviously immediately be robbed of its political point. No nation, no matter how rich or powerful, can dictate to suit itself the future of another people. This is a fundamental principle which should constantly guide the actions of the United Nations.\n235.\tLet us further consider reality by looking more closely at the facts. We cannot believe that it is out of humanism or the sudden access of a wish for fairness that certain people are now discovering that it is their duty, more today than yesterday, to take a closer interest in southern Africa. This haste, which is somewhat theatrical, is in substance, a matter of strategy. It results from the need of the imperialist powers to safeguard their interests, which are based on petty-economic calculations. Zimbabwe is the primary world producer of chrome and possesses important copper, manganese and gold resources. It is in any case symptomatic to read in the relevant documents of the United Nations that almost half of United States investments in Africa are actually in South Africa.\n236.\tBehind this haste, too, there are some false political calculations, fundamentally, anti-Communist sentiments: the so-called red peril, which today has succeeded the so-called yellow peril and which haunts quite a number of foreign ministers throughout the world. The Western press is quite prolific in reports of this kind. According to the same press the failure of imperialist countries in Mozambique and Angola now makes it necessary for these imperialists to establish secure bases in Namibia and Zimbabwe with the support of South Africa. Their plan is to do everything in their power to see that southern Africa is not edged into the socialist camp. Such a danger is obviously imaginary, and it is extremely serious to confess that racism is conceived and explained in southern Africa in terms of anti-Communism. Socialism is a liberating phenomenon, and if ever it is to operate in southern Africa it will free the people of southern Africa from racial discrimination and political subjugation.\n237.\tThis anti-Communist behavior, which is supposed to explain racism in South Africa, is something which will be questioned. Imperialists know a great many things. They know that the days of the racist, colonialist and minority regimes are numbered. The imperialists know that the independence in Namibia and Zimbabwe is now a matter of months and no longer of decades. Imperialists are aware of all this and that is why they are trying to devise last-minute solutions either directly or through their men whom they have placed in strategic positions. All the dangers they may imagine are inventions designed to camouflage their sordid designs.\n238.\tOur own experience can be mentioned in this connexion because it is so illuminating. Only yesterday the People's Republic of the Congo was accused of being a hotbed of subversion and a base for Communist infiltration in central Africa. The fact is that the whole of Africa, particularly the neighbors of the Congo, is perfectly well aware of the peaceful intentions and the ambition for concord and fraternity of our country with regard to each of them. President Marien Ngouabi has often said, and I quote:\n\u201cThe People's Republic of the Congo wishes always to have good relations of co-operation with all peace-loving countries of the world, without regard to ideologies\\\".\nBut true peace begins at home. At the present time in the Congo there is not a single political prisoner. I can claim furthermore that the Congolese people is an active factor for peace and co-operation in the world today. The Congo was the first African country to break off all relations with Israel in December 1972. This is practically one year before the October war in 1973. President Marien Ngouabi was instrumental in normalizing relations between Zaire and Angola after the great victory of the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola over the puppet movements which were in actual fact allies of South African fascism. The Congolese people is taking an active part in the work of the Customs Union of Central African States, which is one of the finest expressions of our co-operation at the subregional level. The Congolese contribution to the Conference of Heads of State of Central and Eastern Africa has always been a positive one. Similarly, the Congolese people intends to remain an effective member of the Organization of African Unity, the non-aligned movement and the United Nations, which has just welcomed a new member, Seychelles, and we warmly welcome it.\n239.\tBut despite this inter-African and international cooperation, which we believe to be exemplary, imperialism continues to multiply its attacks against my country, often representing it as a cancer in Africa. The presence of Congolese troops has been alleged in Western Sahara. Quite recently, there was a suggestion that there was a transfer of several thousand Cuban soldiers from Angola to the Congo. The whole truth is that our support for the cause of the Saharwi people stems exclusively from our wish to observe rigorously and to apply in our own way the sacred principle of the self-determination of peoples. We are in favour of international peace and security in northern Africa, and the undeniable truth in fact is that Angola, an independent sovereign State, has now a tremendous role to play in the inevitable liberation of Namibia. Angola is one of the front-line countries because of its geographical position. In all, the most curious feature is precisely the pregnant silence which is being kept with regard to mercenaries, which was exposed to the international conscience by the historic trial in Luanda.\n240. Africa today is nationalist. Its recent history can be summarized as tremendous resistance to colonialism and neo-colonialism. What Africa represents in terms of cultural heritage, moral energy and economic power is considerable. Africa has a number of important trump cards for becoming very instrumental in the third world in a world in movement. The destiny of the new world cannot be adapted or adjusted to the ideas of Hegel with regard to Africa. The immediate weakness of the Nazis, to give one verifiable example, was to claim that the rest of humanity was subhuman.\n241.\tOutside, Africa is pre-eminently described in terms of material, scientific and technological assistance-that is true. But inside, the problem of the security of the African peoples is the central problem and the international community, with all the force of its conscience, cannot ignore the fact that Africa is today the most coveted and at the same time the most crucial part of the world. This problem is genuinely fundamental, connected as it is with the survival of the peoples of Africa.\n242.\tThe African people are today caught between the north and the south of the continent.\n243.\tFor several years now the expansionist State of Israel has created and maintained a situation of conflict in the north of Africa. Our former position remains unchanged, namely, the unequivocal condemnation of Israeli expansionism and the restoration to the Palestinian people of its rights. The Congolese delegation cannot but support strongly all initiatives taken to this end by the United Nations.\n244.\tThe pain of Africa, so evident in the southern part of the continent, is fanned, inflated and instigated by the monstrous collusion of the Zionist authorities with the South African racists. Discrimination motivated by fear is now undergoing a tremendous acceleration, liquidating in cold blood every day tens, hundreds of men, women and children, the African martyrs of Soweto, Alexandra and Kimberley.\n245.\tZionism and apartheid are identical in substance. Information and experiences of all kinds are regularly exchanged between Tel Aviv and Pretoria. This interchange of criminal ideas is in keeping with no kind of international morality. Our Organization, ardent in its defense of human rights, should, to be consistent, condemn energetically such a barbarous interchange, which goes hand in hand with the wretchedness of the racist systems.\n246.\tJust as the West considers that European security is connected with the situation prevailing in the Mediterranean, similarly Africans consider the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Now the NATO countries are today keeping sizable naval forces in the Indian Ocean. Complete mastery of international lines of communication is thus secured. We can only expect a multiplication of zones of tension in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and in the southern part of Asia.\n247.\tAnd above all this there is the possibility that the South African racists and Fascists may well in the next few year use against all of Africa atomic weapons which they will be able to manufacture from plutonium of the reaction sold to them by certain NATO countries. In all probability tactical nuclear, weapons of various power ranging from several kilotons to a demi-megaton will be used which will cause no more than limited fallout.\n248.\tIn the face of such large imperialist repressive forces the problem of the security of the African peoples remains an essential problem and the United Nations cannot entirely disregard it. The United Nations must realize that the problem of the security of the peoples of Africa, now and in the future, is of great importance for the very life of the international community as a whole.\n249.\tThe peoples of Africa are clearly modernizing. Their attitude to things and to life itself is one of respect. With modernism and their own resources the peoples of Africa have everything they need to contribute effectively to the general progress of mankind as a whole-a continent with vast empty spaces, natural resources which are practically inexhaustible, people endowed with gifts of all kinds, and a fundamental cultural unity. But first of all we must secure the military security of the peoples of Africa.\n250.\tThe United Nations should also play a primary role in taking peace initiatives with regard to South-East Asia. Here again our Organization should shoulder its share of responsibility in the decisive problems which affect the very existence of mankind. The essence of the debate is political, juridical, and above all, human. In this instance the United Nations must admit to membership the great VietNamese nation and reject all pretexts for the legitimization of any military intervention on the part of the imperialists in Korea. It is quite clear that the United Nations has no choice. Its only duty is to create right now conditions for peace in Korea by calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the southern part of the country. One could hardly be more explicit in saying that the reunification of the great Korean nation can only be brought about in conditions of independence and free from any influences from outside. Has sufficient thought ever been given to the failure of the tremendous commitment of the United States in Viet Nam? Has sufficient reflection taken place about the victory of the popular forces in Angola? A people determined to live free will always emerge victorious from murder by napalm, phosphorous bombardments and all the other infernal inventions of modem warfare.\n251.\tWorld public opinion has recently become very aware of a tremendous problem which directly affects our mode of conceiving the immediate future of the international community. This is the process of establishing a new international economic order to remedy-toe present economic system which is based on the exploitation of the third world by the capitalist countries. In this regard there has been some very inaccurate discussion of the tactics of the third world. The oil war has not always been understood as an event characteristic of the modem day. In any case the immediate lesson to be learned from this is that henceforth the arbiters of international order are going to be more numerous than has traditionally, perhaps arrogantly, been thought. It is quite clear that the economic and social progress of the industrial civilizations in the northern hemisphere has to rely on the third-world countries, which are rich in primary commodities and energy. Now these third-world countries are countries which are dominated, and very much at the mercy of the whims and caprices of Western cartels. The problem of a new economic order consequently contains within itself the seeds of global conflict between the dominator and the dominated, the latter poor and exploited and the former rich because of the poverty of the exploited.\n252.\tWe are entitled to congratulate ourselves on the fortunate initiatives already taken by the United Nations under the energetic guidance of the non-aligned movement. But the United Nations should produce, with the help of the Vast majority of Members, more dynamic methods of approaching the problem. The third world today is in greater need of a fairer system of remuneration for its primary commodities than it is of assistance, which is becoming everyday more problematical. A detailed examination of the problem of a new international economic order in no way departs from the ideals of our Organization, whose primary task is precisely to ensure equality for all nations, great and small, and to cause to prevail, in so far as is possible, peace and security throughout the world.\n253.\tThis is the occasion to mention the anachronistic institution of the right of veto. It is even necessary to stress this matter. The permanent and irrevocable nature of the right of veto presupposes that the permanent members of the Security Council who have this light are wise enough to guarantee peace and security in the world. But this is by no means the case and history abounds in relevant examples. Three permanent Western members individually were unable to prevent the wars in Indo-China and Viet Nam. These same members sometimes very openly perpetuate the total insecurity represented by apartheid and the illegal regimes in southern Africa. Last year the great VietNamese nation was kept outside the United Nations because of the abuse of the right of veto by one of those who possess this right. It will also be recalled the admission of the People's Republic of China was for a long time blocked by a twofold veto. The status of South Africa in the United Nations exists only thanks to the right of veto of the three Western permanent members of the Security Council. The Congolese delegation finds it repugnant and shocking that a sovereign and independent country like the People's Republic of Angola, which is furthermore a member of the Organization of African Unity and the non-aligned movement, has not yet been admitted to membership in the United Nations.\n254.\tThese facts call for some comment. First, the right of veto seems to be a mutual accommodation, that is, a right which certain Powers have mischievously awarded themselves in order to keep their grip on the affairs of the world. This is clearly an example of authoritarianism in an international assembly which is committed to peace. The right to veto means that the pursuit and achievement of the objectives of international peace and security are not equally incumbent on all Members of the United Nations, in flagrant contradiction with the United Nations Charter. The irrevocable nature of the right of veto contains within itself a potential danger for the universality of the United Nations by seriously calling into question toe principles of equality and sovereignty of all Members of toe United \nNations, great and small. Within the United Nations, each nation has a right only to one seat and one vote, whatever its geographic size or population, its economic power or its military prestige. And, finally, the right of veto today is a pure and simple anachronism. It dangerously obscures the history of the United Nations and hinders the possibility of its becoming universal.\n255.\tIn saying this we do not, however, lose sight of the role played by the United Nations in the maintenance of peace in several parts of the world, with varying success.\n256.\tBefore concluding, we have to recognize the benefits of the multilateral assistance granted by the United Nations to third-world countries. In this regard, the Congolese delegation would like to express its appreciation of the various actions of the United Nations system in the various areas of State enterprises, financial planning, exploitation of coastal fishing industries, rural development^ external trade and reorganization of the Congo-Ocean Railway. It is very much to be hoped that this economic and humanitarian action will be continued on a greater scale in the future.\n257.\tAmong the many burning problems in the world today and in the future, we have quite deliberately dwelt at some length on the need for an intensification of the armed struggle in southern Africa, something which is inseparable'from the whole cast, of South Africa, a case which is itself connected with (he urgent problem of the security of the people of Africa. The problem has been highlighted from all aspects. Something of major dimensions must be done. The new organization of the global world to which we all aspire requires, first of all, a total settling of all this vast nexus of international problems.\n258.\tThe deadline set by the United Nations for South Africa to decolonize Namibia expired just about a month ago. What we now expect from our Organization is immediate and energetic action to put an end once and for all to annexation and to the illegal occupation of a Territory which comes directly under the responsibility of the United Nations.\n259.\tThe United Nations must immediately pronounce the cessation of the de facto occupation of Namibia by South Africa, and we have sufficient power and means for this purpose. Having proclaimed the cessation of this occupation, the United Nations will continue to support SWAPO - to help it in its national responsibilities. SWAPO is the authentic representative of the legitimate interests of the people of Namibia. As to the people of Zimbabwe, they must no longer be allowed to continue being oppressed as they have been for so long in the past by a cynical minority. Zimbabwe must be governed by representatives of the majority of the people in accordance with the principle of universal suffrage. The struggle of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe is inseparable from the struggle of South Africa. The bloody events in Soweto should be understood in their proper context, that of the vast and irreversible national liberation struggle going on in southern Africa.\n260.\tThe United Nations must now talk in terms of the elimination of apartheid and not of softening a system which is wholly based on genocide of the black man. Apartheid and its allies may very well drag Africa and the world into chaos. The danger is a real one. Scientific and technological research in South Africa is totally oriented to military action. However, the global structure of peace in the world is still possible and humanity can achieve higher forms of socialization. What we need for this purpose is to see to it that all the profound actual and potential changes now going on should always be in the direction of benefiting mankind as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "I consider it a signal honor that it is I who today express to you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and people of Mexico, our sincerest congratulations on your election by the General Assembly to guide the work of its thirty-first session. The several years during which we have both been Permanent Representatives of our respective countries to the United Nations have enabled me to assess your exceptional qualities, which not only explain but also fully justify the well-deserved and honorable distinction conferred upon you by the international community.\n5.\tI also wish to place on record our appreciation for the contribution made to our Organization by Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, when he was President of the thirtieth session.\n6.\tLastly, I should like to say to the two Presidents-the outgoing and the present-that we attach special significance to the statements made by them at the opening meeting of this session on several specific aspects. Because of their true vision, correct approach and bold analysis those two statements should be die subject of serious meditation and should serve as a point of departure for deliberations and action in the Assembly with respect to some of the problems dealt with in them.\n7.\tI believe that it can be said without fear of contradiction that the method followed in the statements made year after year in the general debate in the main offer two possibilities: that of speakers who strive to touch, even though fleetingly, on a large number of the more than 100 agenda items, and that of those who prefer to be more thorough, rather than cover a broad field, and concentrate on a review of the items to which their respective Governments attach more importance.\n8.\tMay I state at the outset that on this occasion I shall not follow either of those two procedures; so that when items come up for consideration, whether in the plenary Assembly or in the Main Committees, a statement of Mexico's position will be made on those items.\n9.\tThe reason is that within two short months the six-year period of Mexican administration under President Luis Echeverria Alvarez will come to an end; and, on 1 December, we shall start, on the constitutional mandate of his people, the six-year period to be presided over by President elect Jose Lopez Portillo.\n10.\tGiven the existing parallelism between the purposes of the United Nations Charter and those of the six-year government period which is about to come to an end in my country, as well as because of the continuity which we can foresee in the authoritative statements of both Presidents, it seems to us that it will be more useful and encouraging for the representatives of Member States meeting here- particularly if we bear in mind that the map of democracy in Latin America has been shrinking alarmingly of late- to give a brief recapitulation of the outstanding events of that six year period and choose those that are most relevant to this forum.\n11.\tAs has been rightly said, since the United Nations is but the sum of the States Members and its attributes ultimately depend on the co-operation that they are prepared to give the Organization, it might not be superfluous if we, from time to time, review what bur countries have done or are doing to comply with that fundamental duty.\n12.\tI should like to start by making it clear that the Government of Mexico considers that the purposes of our domestic and foreign policy cannot be separated, but are a part of the same strategy. Hence, the universal concern about the effects of economic colonialism is answered on the domestic front by a striving for social renewal. As the Head of the Mexican State said in his last report to the Congress on 1 September 1976:\n\\\"Social democracy, which is the essence of the Mexican doctrine of development, has been the permanent objective of the nation, since its origin. It combines the need to broaden the system of freedoms with that of guaranteeing them by acting in solidarity. To reaffirm decisively is to show generations to come the course of our history. The mere accumulation of wealth is not development. A society advances when its people advance. To govern is not only to manage goods and supply services: it is to encourage the energies of the community and seek the means that will allow the community to progress morally, culturally and socially. To govern is to co-ordinate the historical tasks of a nation.\\\"\n13.\tThe results of six years of government on this understanding have been innumerable economic, social and cultural achievements, and here I shall mention a few by way of illustration.\n14.\tWe lowered the minimum age for deputies from 25 to 31 years, and for senators from 35 to 30. We lowered the membership requirement for the establishment of new political parties from 75,000 to 65,000 members. Those already registered were given the right to speak and vote in all electoral organizations as well as the right to free postage and telegraph and free access to radio and television.\n15.\tMexico began 1975, International Women's Year, by eliminating, through constitutional and legislative reforms, all existing barriers to the complete integration of women into every activity of national life.\n16.\tMexico made a gigantic effort to improve prospects for economic and social progress. Between 1970 and 1975 annual public investment rose from 30 billion pesos to more than 100 billion pesos.\n17.\tThe State company known as National Financing re-assumed its role as the chief industrial promotion and development bank. The total financing authorized in the six-year period amounted to almost 128 billion pesos, which is equivalent to more than half the total which had been authorized since the company was established 42 years ago.\n18.\tIn the industrial sector we doubled our oil production, which this year will amount to a million barrels a day. We also doubled our installed capacity for generating electric power, which has now reached 12 million kilowatts. In the steel Industry we doubled the 1970 production, which reached 10 million tons of steel.\n19.\tIn the agricultural sector we added more than a million hectares of irrigated land. We enacted a federal law on agrarian reform, established a secretariat for agrarian reform, and distributed to farmers 16,239,428 hectares. Public expenditure on farm land rose from 6 billion pesos in 1970 to a little more than 60 billion pesos, which is to say a tenfold increase. Credits for agriculture in the six-year period amounted to almost 90 billion pesos, which is more than double what had been granted in the previous 35 years.\n20.\tInvestments to expand the transportation and communication systems were triple those of the previous six-year period. They rose from 28.3 billion to 90 billion pesos, so that the network of roads of all grades increased from 70,000 kilometers in 1970 to 200,000. Furthermore, most parts of our national territory have been linked by means of modern telecommunication services as a result of additional investment of 23 billion pesos.\n21.\tSocial security institutions now cover 25,020,000 persons as compared with 11,119,000, which is an increase of more than 100 per cent.\n22.\tThe budget for education, which in 1970 was 8 billion pesos, in 1976 rose to 40 billion pesos, which is five times higher. The national educational system now reaches 27 per cent of the total population. Five hundred and forty-two million school books were distributed free by the Government, which means approximately nine books per inhabitant, an increase of almost 200 million books over the total distributed in the 10 previous years.\n23.\tWe have set up several organizations to meet the demand for adequate housing for a constantly growing population. Thanks to the action taken by those bodies, the principal among them being the Institute of the National Fund for Workers' Housing [INFONAVITJ and the National Institute for the Development of Rural Communities and Housing for the People, it was possible to build approximately 300,000 houses or other dwellings, that is to say more than double the number that had been built in the previous 20 years.\n24.\tWe must not forget that this enormous task of renewal was carried out at a time when the economic and monetary decisions being made in the centers of power as well as an acute inflationary process generated essentially by the economies of the highly industrialized countries were being detrimental to the normal rate of growth and were making it infinitely more difficult.\n25.\tIt is therefore not surprising that, in order to maintain continuity in restructuring the national economy in the vital sectors of our basic infrastructure, agriculture and industry, the Government, on 31 August last, was compelled to decide on a regulated floating rate of exchange for the Mexican peso, nevertheless maintaining without any limitation the traditional free convertibility of our currency to any other as well as the free transfer of money and capital.\n26.\tThe strategy for internal development which I have just outlined had to be tied to foreign policy which, at the same time as it adjusted to the traditional principles which served as its basis of support and which in essence are analogous to those which in 1945 were deemed most appropriate for the San Francisco Charter, opened new horizons for the progress of Mexico a foreign policy at the service of our internal democracy as well as that of democracy among nations.\n27.\tTo achieve this, we added to the permanent vitality of the principles that emanate from our history-the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the self- determination of peoples-other innovative elements such as the broadening and diversification of our international relations, creative and responsible association in solidarity with the struggle of the developing countries that are generally grouped under the title of the \\\"third world\\\" and the campaign to establish and consolidate a new inter-national economic order based on sovereign equality, justice, equity and interdependence.\n28.\tAs regards the first of these elements, I could quote from numerous statements made by the President of Mexico from the very moment when he took office on 1 December 1970. Among them, I shall limit myself to recalling the statement he made in his third government report on 1 September 1973, when he affirmed that:\n\\\"In an era characterized by dialog, Mexico emphasizes its universal outlook. We are an active part of the community of nations and our life is conditioned in many aspects by external events ... We have no prejudices nor fear of their influences. We accept ideological pluralism as an obvious feature of this historical stage. On the basis of a broader perspective, we reaffirm confidence in ourselves and in the course we have selected.\\\"\n29.\tThis position as defined was unchallenging confirmed in practice: in six years we practically doubled the number of peoples with whom we had friendly relations in the world. At the beginning of the six-year period Mexico had diplomatic relations with 67 nations, and at present we have them with 131.\n30.\tThe President of Mexico has visited 36 countries-9 in Europe, 4 in Asia, 9 in Africa and the Middle East and 14 in the Americas. During the same period, M Mexico was host to more than 30 high dignitaries, Heads of State or Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs.\n31.\tAs a result of the President's travels abroad, more than 160 international conventions or agreements were signed, of which approximately one third are for technical and scientific co-operation or in connection with cultural matters and the remainder on economic and trade questions. In the same context we signed the co-operation agreements with the European Economic Community and with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which opened to Mexico the markets and technology of 17 countries of Western and Eastern Europe.\n32.\tAs regards Mexico's solidarity with the countries of the third world, this too has been explained by the Mexican head of State in a number of statements of which, as in the previous case, I shall take as an illustration only one, which appears to me as most significant, that he made on 21 February 1974 upon inaugurating at the Mexican Foreign Office a conference on continental co-operation, when he said, inter alia, that: \\\"Latin America is part of the third world. Its struggles are similar and parallel to those which other nations are carrying out against colonialism, the new attempts at subjugation, the injustice present in international transactions and the concentration of political power, wealth and the means of multiplying it...\n\\\"In seeking factors to promote its moderation, Latin America should not restrict itself to the inertia of its continental relations, which are often an extension of old forms of servitude and which decrease the number of multiple options offered by an open exchange with the world.\n\\\"Let us eliminate certain geopolitical determinisms which are anachronistic hi the complexity of con-temporary economics. On the continent, let us consolidate links based on autonomy, equality and justice. Let us establish the basis for sincere co-operation and, within our own hemispheric home, let us practice militant solidarity with the peoples of the third world.\\\"\n33.\tMexico has always held the belief that theoretical pronouncements must go hand in hand with specific deeds; thus, our affinity for ideological pluralism and our recognition of the need for action in solidarity with the members of the third world has been constantly demonstrated in the most diverse international forums. As an illustration of this, I need only give a very brief account of our action on three questions of vital importance: the new law of the sea, disarmament and the new international economic order.\n34.\tAt the four substantive sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea-which, I would say in passing, were presided over, as is well known, with such exceptional skill by the President of this session of the General Assembly-that have been held since 1974, one in Caracas, one in Geneva and two in New York, the purpose of Mexico's participation has been to protect what we regard as the legitimate interests of the countries of the third world and to 'claim' for them the exercise of what seems to us to be their inalienable rights regarding the benefits to be derived from the natural resources of the sea and the sea-bed.\n35.\tThus, from the outset our endeavors have been directed towards reaching just and equitable solutions to the two questions that undoubtedly are most vital today for our peoples: the question of the so-called \\\"exclusive economic zone\\\" and the question of the regime to govern the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction because the questions relating to the breadth of the territorial sea and the continental shelf have practically been solved.\n36.\tWith regard to the first question-the exclusive economic zone-the competent Commission of the Conference, the Third Committee, was able to formulate a single informal negotiating text representing the common denominator on certain essential aspects of the various points of view expressed by delegations. From that single negotiating text we can already see without any doubt at all that the exclusive economic zone will have a breadth which, combined with that of the territorial sea, will extend to an outer limit of 200 nautical miles and that within the zone itself the coastal State-with some limitations that will have to be defined in the negotiations not yet concluded-will exercise sovereign rights for the purposes of exploration and exploitation of the natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, of the sea-bed, including the subsoil thereof, and over the superjacent waters.\n37.\tWith regard to the second question to which I have just returned, on which, unfortunately, similar progress has not been made, our endeavors have been directed towards a full application of the basic principle adopted at the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly, under which it was established that the area of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as well as their resources, are the common heritage of mankind. That necessarily means that that area shall not be subject to appropriation by any means by States or persons, natural or juridical, and no State shall claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part thereof' [resolution 2749 (XXV)], and that the area dial! Be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n38.\tI turn now to the subject of disarmament. By way of introduction I would recall that the General Assembly has been pointing out for more than IS years now that the nuclear arms race constitutes the most serious danger for world peace and the survival of mankind. It seems fitting to add that it not only involves a threat of mass destruction, but also entails an unjustifiable waste of resources and is a serious obstacle to the functioning of the new international economic order. Indeed, it must be borne in mind that the nuclear arsenals of the two States which are customarily called \\\"super-Powers\\\" have alone been conservatively estimated at the equivalent of 1 million bombs of the type which in 1945 caused 100,000 deaths. That means that those arsenals would be sufficient to annihilate 100 billion human beings -that is, 25 times the number of inhabitants of the earth. Furthermore, the military expenditures have been estimated at the stratospheric figure of $300 billion per year.\n39.\tIn order to assess Mexico's contribution to this urgent task, I should point out that Mexico has participated in one way or another, to a greater or lesser degree, in the drafting of all but a few of the hundred or so resolutions on disarmament items which the Assembly has adopted in the six-year period to which I have referred. That applies, for example, to the subjects of the comprehensive program for disarmament, the reports by the Secretary-General on various disarmament items, the World Disarmament Conference, and several items relating to nuclear disarmament, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the United States and the Soviet Union, the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests, the military de-nuclearization of Latin America and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. The same can be said of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in May 1975, and of the 1976 session of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in connection with the question of a convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment for military purposes.\n40.\tI shall make some brief comments on only five of those items, since it would be impossible to dwell on all of them without speaking at undue length.\n41.\tWith regard to the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, it seems appropriate to recall that it was on Mexico's initiative that during the aforementioned six-year period the Assembly has adopted three resolutions in which it not only has reaffirmed that the continuation of nuclear weapon tests intensifies the arms race and thus will increase the danger of nuclear war, but also and even more important -using terminology it has rarely used-has vigorously \\\"condemned\\\" all nuclear weapon tests, in whatever environment they are carried out, and has reaffirmed its conviction that, whatever differences may exist on the question of international control, there is no valid reason whatsoever for delaying an agreement on the total prohibition of all nuclear weapon tests, in conformity with the provision included more than 10 years ago in the preamble to the Treaty prohibiting nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. \n42.\tFurthermore, at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in May 1975, Mexico submitted a draft additional protocol co-sponsored by many third-world countries and intended to achieve the final cessation of all nuclear- weapons tests as provided for in the tenth preamble paragraph of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons itself [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], and to that end it outlined a simple, practical procedure of automatic application. That draft protocol, later distributed as a document of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, is also available to the General Assembly as a document of the First Committee. \n43.\tAs regards the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms, in which the two supper-Powers have been engaged since 1969, Mexico's action had a special influence because the General Assembly adopted four resolutions having essentially a similar content whereby the General Assembly deplored the absence of positive results in those talks and expressed\n\\\"... its concern for the very high ceilings of nuclear arms set for themselves by both States, for the total absence of qualitative limitations of such arms, for the protracted time-table contemplated for the negotiation of further limitations and possible reductions of the nuclear arsenals and for the situation thus created\\\".\nAnd time and time again the General Assembly has urged those States to broaden the scope and accelerate their talks on the limitation of nuclear strategic weapons, stressing\n.. the necessity and urgency of reaching agreement on important qualitative limitations and substantial reductions of their strategic nuclear-weapon systems as a positive step towards nuclear disarmament\\\".\n44.\tAs regards nuclear-weapon-free zones, it is appropriate to point out that Mexico is the headquarters for the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, a permanent organization for the only one of such densely populated zones in the world. Mexico succeeded in this at the thirtieth session, with the adoption of General Assembly resolution 3472 B (XXX), which contains two internationally authorized definitions of what is to be understood by \\\"nuclear-weapon-free zones\\\" and also mentions the principal obligations of nuclear-weapon States towards the nuclear-weapon-free zones and the States included therein and defines the objective, which is to strengthen the efforts recently undertaken and those already achieved in the establishment of nuclear-weapon- free zones.\n45.\tAs regards the possibility of holding a world disarmament conference-and this initiative has from the outset had the firm support of my country-the Mexican delegation to the Fifth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries  had an opportunity to make its modest contribution to the text of section XVII of the Political Declaration adopted by the Conference [see A/311197, annex I], which recommends convening a special session of the General Assembly as early as possible and not later than 1978, the agenda of which would include, inter alia, a review of disarmament questions and the question of convening a World Disarmament Conference.\n\n46.\tAs a final, though no less important, example of a positive contribution by Mexico in the field of disarmament I shall mention the decision taken by my country regarding the draft convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques, submitted by the Co-Chairmen of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament-that is, by the United States and the Soviet Union [see A/31/27]. In this connection the Mexican delegation to the Geneva Committee submitted a working paper CCD/516 of 1 September 1976 [ibid.]-which explains why Mexico considers it to be \\\"extremely alarming that there can be any thought of legitimizing in an international convention such monstrous actions as... the deliberate manipulation of natural processes to cause earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones of various types and tornadic storms, or changes in the state of the ozone layer or ionosphere or in ocean currents\\\".\n47.\tIf we proceed to consider the co-operation of Mexico in disarmament and its contribution to the creation and consolidation of a new international economic order, there is no difficulty whatever in choosing from among the many available examples the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n48.\tIn this connection, what will always be essential to what I might call an \\\"explanation of reasons\\\" for that far-reaching document are the relevant paragraphs of the statement made before the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] by President Echeverna on 19 April 1972 when he submitted his historic initiative, couched in the following terms:\n\\\"We must strengthen the precarious legal foundations of the world economy. A just, orderly and stable world is not possible until there are created obligations and rights which will protect weak States. If we remove economic co-operation from the field of goodwill, let us crystallize it in the field of law. Let us transfer the consecrated principles of solidarity among men to the sphere of relations between countries ... The solidarity we demand is a condition for survival. If, in the adjustment processes now under way, the developing countries are once again forgotten, then the economic divisions between the world Powers themselves will be greater and the relative international stability we have attained will not last long.\n\\\"Any decision which contemplates only the immediate, even though it may appear correct, is historically wrong. What is really effective is that which transcends incidental interests and looks ahead to the future.\n\\\"Peace is not only harmed by weapons. We shall be preparing for the twenty-first century in so far as we realize that we have a common destiny. The under-developed countries are in the right, not merely in a moral sense. We are right from the point of view of history too, because our vision of the world embraces a real possibility of peace and prosperity.\n\\\"It is up to the present generation to fulfill its task, and there can be no postponement. We are on the threshold of a structural change in human society which can come about only if all nations work for it equally.\n\\\"If the experience of the past decade is repeated in the present decade, perhaps nothing can then prevent an irreparable deterioration- in the relations of the third world with the major industrial nations ...\n\\\"To build an economy for peace is, in our time, the primary duty of the international community. On the other hand, to refuse to co-operate for the reduction of disparities between peoples is to prevent the principles of the United Nations from acquiring real content.\\\"\n49.\tEven though the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, together with the Declaration and Program of Action which were adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], constitutes, so to speak, the corner stone of the new international economic order, it is far from being an end in itself. For the purposes it pursues to become reality, it is necessary that its general principles, norms and other provisions be faithfully applied in practice. That is Mexico's view, and at Manila, at Nairobi, at Colombo, at Geneva, and in our own capital, we have contributed, in so far as we were able, to what has been called the \\\"instrumentation\\\" of the Charter.\n50.\tIn February 1976 the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 adopted the Manila Declaration and Program of Action;* in May, the same countries meeting on the occasion of the fourth session of UNCTAD, agreed to strive to ensure a high degree of participation at the Conference to be held in Mexico and to hold a meeting of experts at Geneva to carry out the preparatory work. In August of this year in Colombo, the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries adopted several decisions [see A/311197] which implied their unequivocal support for the. Manila program. Subsequently, in the early part of September, in Addis Ababa there was a meeting of African ministers on economic co-operation for the' same purpose; and finally, from 13 to 21 September, the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries was held in the capital of my country.\n51.\tAs a result of the last-mentioned Conference there emerged a series of decisions which, no doubt, will have a paramount influence in developing and strengthening the so-called \\\"horizontal co-operation\\\" sought by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States as a means by which negotiations between developing and developed countries can be held on a footing of genuine equality. The objectives of those decisions include, among other things, the establishment of a global system of trade preferences among developing countries; the creation of a reserve fund for the regulation of basic commodities ; the convening of a conference of plenipotentiaries for the approval of the statutes of the Council of Associations of Producers of Raw Materials; the establishment of multinational transport companies; the creation of a united front for the promotion of the urgent restructuring of the international monetary system; and the establishment of a data and information bank designed to stimulate technical co-operation among third-world countries.\n52.\tThe Conference, furthermore, agreed upon the need for adequate global machinery to ensure the prompt and effective implementation of measures for co-operation among developing countries, it having been agreed to entrust to ministerial meetings of the Group of 77 the task of reviewing and evaluating the implementation of the steps contemplated in the Measures for Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries,  as well as the co-ordination and harmonization of the position of the Group of 77 in all international forums of concern to it.\n53.\tThe era of horizontal co-operation begun in Manila has thus been consolidated in Mexico, and great strides have been taken towards the collective economic autonomy which, as is stated in the opening paragraph of the introduction to the report of the Conference, is \\\"an imperative of history to which all developing countries have committed themselves\\\", and which will become an effective instrument for the achievement of the new international economic order contemplated in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n54.\tThere would be serious gaps in this background information if I failed to add a few words about the Centre for Economic and Social Studies of the Third World. Thanks to another fruitful initiative on the part of the President of my country, that Centre was opened in the San Jeronimo Lidice section of the Mexican capital on 14 September last. At the ceremony held on that occasion and attended by representatives of more than 50 third-world States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who had been with us little more than a year earlier, in June 1975, when we had laid the corner-stone of the institution, and who has offered the fullest co-operation of the United Nations, expressed the following ideas, which are an excellent definition of the principal objectives of the Centre:\n\\\"... I feel that this Centre could provide invaluable service. It could develop new knowledge through extensive exchange of experience related directly to third world conditions. Indigenous solutions to such problems as technology, social organization and institution-building can develop, not just as an extension of existing patterns in industrial countries, but as spontaneous creations of third-world thinking and experience.\\\"\n55.\tThe uninterrupted work carried out by the Government of Mexico during the last six years has, as the President of the Republic himself said, been intended to serve both \\\"our internal democracy and democracy among nations\\\", and this cannot but redound to the benefit of this Organization.\n56.\tThat is why, as I indicated at the outset, I thought that the summary recapitulation which I have just given would be an encouragement to anyone who is concerned with strengthening the purposes pursued by, and the principles inspiring, the United Nations.\u2003\n57.\tAnything that is an encouragement and stimulus to us in discharging in good faith the obligations of the Charter and in suiting our conduct to those obligations, both in domestic and in foreign affairs, is, it seems to me, of particular value and relevance at a time when respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is simply a matter of scorn for many and when attempted assassinations involving great distances are on the increase in Washington, Buenos Aires and Rome, to mention but a few which have directly affected Latin America attempts which aim at and, unfortunately, very often succeed in, eliminating excellent statesmen whose only crime has been to reject Fascist authoritarianism and to believe still in government of the people, by the people and for the people. No doubt this was what the 1,600 political exiles, who requested and were granted asylum in Mexico, felt.\n58.\tIn closing, I feel it appropriate to choose two from among the statements made most recently by the present President and the President-elect of Mexico which provide a solid foundation for faith in the continuity of a policy such as that whose internal and external benefits I have briefly reviewed in my present statement.\n59.\tOn 1 September last, before my country's Congress, President Echeverna analyzed the results of the voting of 4 July, in which, out of 17,695,043 Mexican citizens who went to vote on that day, 16,703,801 voted freely in favor of the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and stated:\n\\\"Our country has gone beyond the era of improvisation and 'bossism'. It has refined its democratic institutions and through them forged national unity. It has reached a level of development where only men formed by study and by genuine militancy, thoughtful in decision-making and valiant in action, can aspire to guide it. That is why, with full hope and with full trust as a Mexican, I shall hand over, the supreme office of the Republic to Jose Lopez Portillo.\\\"\n60.\tFor his part, the President-elect, on being officially informed of the results of the elections, on 9 September, made the following solemn declaration before the members of the Chamber of Deputies:\n\\\"It falls to me to succeed the visionary, valiant and creative presidency of Luis Echeverna. I shall take over at a time which is particularly significant in the modern history of a world of which our country forms a part... I receive this notification in the full awareness of the responsibility involved in my assumption, in due course and by the sovereign will personified in you, of the Federal Executive Power, which, in the history of our country, means preserving and constantly renewing our institutions as time goes on without losing the fundamental direction given our country by our forefathers by their words, the blood they shed, their decisions and their will the responsibility of keeping to our course in the pursuit of liberty and of justice, under a democratic regime, the strength and the vitality of whose institutions are a constant, where law rules and where reality conforms to the law\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "103. Mr. President, in electing you President of this General Assembly our Organization could hardly have made a better choice: you represent an exceptional combination of experience and knowledge of the machinery of the United Nations with an outstanding ability for negotiation and conciliation. In you, we also greet the representative of a country with which Austria has always had close and friendly relations. In addition, Sri Lanka plays an active role in world politics manifested this year by being the host of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, in which Austria had the honor to participate as a guest. The Austrian delegation wishes you great success and assures you of its wholehearted support.\n104.\tI should like here to express thanks to your predecessor, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Gaston Thorn, for the tact and great political insight with which he guided us through the often stormy days of the previous General Assembly.\n105.\tAs Foreign Minister of Austria I am particularly pleased to express to Secretary-General Waldheim the thanks and recognition of my country for the permanent effort he has made for our Organization and the community of nations. We extend to him our warmest good wishes for continuing success in carrying out his important and challenging tasks.\n106.\tOne of the first decisions of this General Assembly was to admit the Republic of Seychelles to membership in the United Nations. We welcome the representatives of the new Member State in our midst. Its presence is a further indication of the progressing process of decolonization of Africa and demonstrates how close our Organization has come to the goal of universality. A further contribution to that end will be the admission of those States which have already stated their desire for membership as well as their readiness to accept the obligations under the Charter. Indeed, in the interest of achieving universality, our Organization must be open to all States, regardless of then- political and social systems.\n107.\tAn assessment of the contribution made by our Organization in the past year to the maintenance of peace and security in the world results in self-criticism as well as some measure of satisfaction. We may conclude from such an analysis that the fundamental factors in world politics have remained unchanged.\n108.\tIn the past year the climate of world politics continued to be marked by the mutual desire of the United States and the Soviet Union to pursue their policy of detente. In Europe, efforts were intensified to realize the principles accepted by the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and to carry them into all areas of mutual relations.\n109.\tContinuing success for the policy of detente in Europe will depend, however, on the willingness of all to implement unconditionally the decisions of the Helsinki Conference. These decisions do not concern Governments alone but have a direct bearing on daily life and human relations. In particular they can provide contributions to the solution of humanitarian problems.\n110.\tThe Federal Government of Austria is a firm advocate of the continuation of the policy of detente not only in Europe but throughout the world. Austria will make its own contribution to that end. In the European framework this applies in particular to the Belgrade conference scheduled for next year.\n111.\tWhile certain new positive aspects can be noted in world politics, this General Assembly meets in an international atmosphere which still carries a considerable amount of problems and uncertainties. In fact, none of the major international crises has come closer to a solution: the impasse with regard both to the Middle East crisis and to the question of Cyprus remains unchanged. There was no success in the efforts to reach agreement on new arms control and on new disarmament measures.\n112.\tHowever, in these days, signs of hope begin to appear for the solution of one of the major problems in the world, the situation in southern Africa. After the tragic incidents which began in the suburbs of Johannesburg and which dramatically underlined the seriousness of this situation, intensive diplomatic efforts were initiated a few weeks ago. These efforts have now brought a first tangible result. A conference on Rhodesia has been convened, for 21 October and we sincerely hope that these developments will bring the people of Zimbabwe closer to the goal of majority government.\n113.\tIn Namibia any progress will depend on the inclusion of all parties, specifically SWAPO, in the negotiations. The United Nation? should continue to undertake an important role. We appeal to the Government of South Africa to begin such negotiations for a peaceful and democratic settlement as soon as possible. My country would gladly make its neutral ground available to host the constitutional conference, should the parties so wish.\n114. Despite hopeful developments in Rhodesia and Namibia there can be no illusions about the fact that the most serious problem in South Africa itself is still to be overcome. As long as political and civil rights continue to be denied to the vast majority in the country, as long as the inhuman and universally condemned policy of apartheid is not put to an end, peaceful coexistence between the peoples of southern Africa is impossible.\n115. The international community is now near unanimity on the principles for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Its indispensable elements are: the principle of respect for, and recognition of, the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all countries in the region and the right of all peoples and States to live within secure and recognized boundaries.\n116.\tPeace in the Middle East is also inconceivable without recognition of the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people. It is for this reason that participation of the Palestinian people in the negotiating process seems essential.\n117.\tThe Austrian people is deeply moved by the suffering of the people of Lebanon. The inability to stop civil war in Lebanon is a threat to the balance of a region whose stability is of relevance to the maintenance of world peace. I wish to express my sincere hope that by agreement among all the parties, peace and security will return to this part of the world and the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon be secured.\n118.\tEvents in the Mediterranean area have a direct bearing on the security and stability of the whole of Europe. For this reason Austria is concerned over the situation of Cyprus.\n119.\tFor many centuries Austria has maintained close and friendly relations with the peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is natural therefore that Austria has persistently sought to make her contribution to the solution of the crisis and expressed her firm support for the safeguarding of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. At the talks in New York and in Vienna this year and last, the Secretary-General of our Organization has tried time and again, through his personal efforts, to bring the parties together and maintain the dialog between them. These efforts by Secretary-General Waldheim deserve all our support.\n120.\tToday the United Nations plays an important role in the maintenance of peace in the Middle East as well as on Cyprus. The peace-keeping forces operating under the United Nations flag are the most important element in this regard. However, United Nations troops can never be an adequate substitute for a political solution. May I say in this context in all frankness that the success of the peace-keeping forces depends on appropriate financing. Support for these operations should be expressed also in increased and more general contributions.\n121.\tPermit me to express my personal thanks to all soldiers serving under the United Nations flag in the interest cf peace wherever they may be in the world.\n122.\tThe amount of money spent on armament is increasing year by year. Nevertheless, the United Nations, in the 30 years of its existence, could not achieve much practical success in the field of disarmament.\n123.\tWe have always believed that the policy of detente will only have credibility if it also produces concrete results in the field of disarmament. We therefore note with some apprehension that the negotiations between the States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and those of the Warsaw Pact have so far not produced the expected results.\n124.\tThe complex nature of all disarmament and arms control measures, as well as the close connexion with the question of the security of States, leave no room for overly simplistic analyses. Accordingly, Austria has always attached special significance to the question of the balanced character of the limitation and ultimate reduction of the arsenals of the great Powers and thus has stressed the need for negotiations within a small framework.\n125.\tBut it also is the task of this Organization, as Secretary-General Waldheim stated in the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization, now more than ever before, to stimulate public concern over the arms race and to underline the urgent necessity for disarmament measures as well as their global character and to provide adequate momentum for further negotiations [see Al31(llAdd.l, sect. V]. We can therefore give our full support to the proposal for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament issues, as it was decided, at the initiative of Yugoslavia, by the non-aligned Conference in Colombo.\n126.\tThe feverish arms race is not the only threat to international security. In these past months a new wave of international terrorism has threatened the international community. Together with many other Members of this Assembly we concur in the view that our Organization should devote itself with greater intensity to the task of combating international terrorism. Apart from the attempt to grapple with this intricate and emotion-laden phenomenon as a whole, we must deal, as a matter of special urgency, with the most abominable manifestations of terrorism. The taking of hostages is indisputably one of the most horrifying crimes of our times. Austria will support unreservedly any initiative that helps to combat this international crime. Nevertheless, the United Nations should not overlook the problem of terrorism as a whole.\n127.\tI think this is the place to affirm Austria's profound attachment to the principle of the universal application of the human rights and fundamental freedoms embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n128.\tA just and stable world can exist only if the dignity and worth of each individual are respected, and if social conditions are established which foster the greatest possible development of all mankind. But respect for human rights cannot be the distant goal of a better world in the future. We should not throw it overboard on the voyage to such a world for the sake of short-term fictitious glint. Morality and justice dictate that violations of human rights, wherever they occur, must be the subject of our concern and earnest efforts to eliminate them.\n129.\tIt was therefore with special satisfaction that Austria learned that a further step forward has been taken towards the world-wide application of human rights through the entry into, force of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol and of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We welcome in particular the Human Rights Committee recently set up under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Austria will give the Committee its full support in the performance of the noble tasks assigned to it.\n130.\tWe should not omit to draw the Committee's attention to the valuable preparatory work done in this respect in the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Austria hopes to ratify shortly both Covenants, which guarantee for the first time human rights in a universal legally binding instrument.\n131.\tDespite all the hopes that these recent developments inspire in us, we should like to point out that it would be a mistake to regard as superseded the pragmatic measures taken in the United Nations with a view to promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Until adherence to the two Covenants is universal we must remain alive to the need for the earlier procedures to be retained. Austria is willing to play its part, be it by admitting and supporting refugees or by actively collaborating in the several United Nations bodies concerned with human rights.\n132.\tFrom among the topics that warrant our special attention we must single out here racism and its most loathsome manifestation, apartheid. An exceptional contribution to their elimination is made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, for it is striving, in an ongoing dialog with Member States, to reduce every form of racial discrimination. My Government is particularly gratified that this Committee has accepted its invitation to hold its next session in Vienna.\n133.\tLet us here give voice to the hope that the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, without being disturbed by any extraneous elements that might impede its success, will be able to reach its original goal. In this connexion I would like to express the wish that the Decade would also eliminate the roots of racial discrimination, which are to be found in the hearts of men. Special attention therefore should be given to education towards tolerance and towards the respect of the rights and interests of others. I may refer to article 7 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 (XX), annex] which provides for such education. I hope that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, whose' General Conference will begin in a few days in Nairobi, will also consider this question which is of the utmost importance for the further development of man-kind.\n134.\tAustria supports all efforts to establish a convention on the protection of minorities, complementing the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which would safeguard the existence of ethnic groups. Accordingly, Austria supports the proposal put forward by the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council and\nFederal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia, Milos Minic, before this Assembly [7th meeting].\n135.\tTorture, one of the most barbarous violations of human rights, is still, despite all our endeavors, a world-wide phenomenon. The efforts to combat torture must therefore be continued and intensified.\n136.\tThe growing importance of the relationship between North and South is increasingly confronting the United Nations. The solution to these problems has become a major issue of international politics. In this context, a central role in the reordering of world economic relations is incumbent upon the United Nations. The Austrian Government has pledged to support every endeavor that leads to the building of a more just and stable international economic order.\n137.\tIn the present critical stage of the dialog between developing and industrialized countries Austria strongly hopes that the spirit of mutual understanding, conciliation and co-operation, which manifested itself so clearly at the seventh special session of the General Assembly and which was continued at the fourth session of UNCTAD, will remain a decisive factor in our future negotiations on a new international economic order.\n138.\tToday we are at a transitional stage in our endeavor to build a more just international economic system. On the one hand it is necessary to bring the recommendations and decisions adopted in recent years closer to realization; on the other hand we are called upon to devote ourselves with particular attention to the preparation of an even closer and more effective, but also more comprehensive and far-reaching, international co-operation for the forthcoming United Nations Third Development Decade.\n139.\tThe proper performance of these tasks in the spirit of the forthcoming third Development Decade will require not only an enhanced will for common action but also new forms of international economic co-operation. In this connexion I should like to draw particular attention to the proposal of the Austrian Federal Chancellor, Mr. Kreisky, concerning an accelerated development of the infrastructure of the countries of the third world. We will go into these considerations in greater detail in the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly.\n140.\tSince the beginning of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1973 the Austrian delegation has consistently advocated that the future convention should embody principles of international co-operation, with recognition of the rights of all States to a share in the exploitation of the wealth of the seas. Austria is convinced that a new law of the sea can contribute substantially to the elimination of the economic gulf separating developing and developed countries, which, we regret to say, is growing steadily wider; and that the least developed countries should receive special consideration in this process.\n141.\tIt is therefore a source of great concern to us that the Conference on the Law of the Sea still has far to go before it turns the above-mentioned principles into realities and creates a just order for the world's oceans. After five \nsessions we regret to have to note that the Conference has still not found a compromise formula for the rights and duties of coastal States on one hand, and of the geographically disadvantaged and land-locked countries on the other. It now appears vitally important that when we resume our efforts we should avoid a proliferation of unilateral measures that might cut back the ground for a global convention or lead to the emergence of a treatyless situation on the seas.\n142.\tPermit me, once again, to touch upon the agreement reached by Austria and Italy six years ago, which is concerned with increasing the autonomy of the South Tyrol and lays down a time-table for that process. With regard to this issue, on which the General Assembly adopted resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) I am happy to report that it has proved possible to make further progress, including progress in important areas. However, a number of measures have still to be put into effect. Austria welcomes the statement made recently by the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr. Giulio Andreotti, in this regard.\n143.\tWe expect that the efforts made with respect to this issue, which is being handled on both sides in a spirit of good-neighborly co-operation, will soon produce further results.\n144.\tIn concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to another matter which is of importance to my country. I am referring to the optimal use of the Donaupark centre which is being built in Vienna for the United Nations and made available to the Organization rent-free. Its cost of approximately $US 700 million will be borne by Austria. Work is proceeding as scheduled. It is expected that the entire complex (including office accommodations, an international conference centre and public facilities) will be completed in 1978.\n145.\tIt is obvious that the time has come for a definite decision by the United Nations concerning the optimal use of the premises available in addition to those reserved for the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNIDO. The General Assembly will have before it proposals wMch are being prepared by the Secretary-General in accordance with the request of the General Assembly at its thirtieth session. In the long term the optimal use Of these facilities should produce remark-able financial and organizational benefits for the United Nations. I should like to express our hope that the General Assembly at its thirty-first session will take concrete decisions ensuring both a short-term and a long-term solution of this question.\n146.\tAustria, traditional host of many international conferences, has moreover decided to construct, by 1982. a conference centre near the Donaupark complex. With regard to size and functional capacity it will meet all the requirements of world conferences and will, in addition, be available to the international organizations located in Vienna for their conferences.\n\n147.\tAt the end of my speech I should like to recall that it is now just 20 years ago that Austria first addressed the General Assembly as a full Member of the Organization.\nEver since that statement which was delivered by the late Austrian statesman Leopold Figl, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, my Government has every year presented its views on international affairs and outlined its policy before this august body.\n148.\tI mention this because I wish to convey our feelings of gratitude and pride for having been able to join this Organization 20 years ago and for having been able to participate in its work and to strive for making it an even better instrument for the advancement of mankind. We have tried to do so with consistent resolve and we pledge the unflagging continuation of this policy.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to present to the President, on the occasion of his outstanding election to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, my delegation's heartiest and most sincere congratulations and my own. His lofty qualities as a seasoned diplomat, his experience and familiarity with the work and practices of our Organization are sufficient for him to deserve those functions. I need not recall the tact with which he conducted the work of the Committee on the sea-bed and subsequently the work of the sessions of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is thanks to his efforts and talents in particular that that session proceeded normally, without the clashes some had feared. When it is known that he is also responsible for presiding over the Co-ordinating Bureau of the movement of non-aligned countries, then it becomes evident how great is his personal merit as well as that of his country, which only a month ago was the capital of non-alignment when it successfully acted as host to its fifth summit.  Those are responsible tasks and we are fully aware of their scope and intricacy, but we have no doubt that he will be able to carry them out efficiently and competently. In these decisive moments our Organization is in dire need of persons of his experience and competence in order to work out its destiny.\n190.\tI should like to add my voice to that of previous speakers at this rostrum in expressing my great satisfaction, as well as that of my delegation with respect to the former President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a country with which Zaire, my country, maintains excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. The distinguished and dignified manner in which he conducted the debates of the last session of the General Assembly confirm the judiciousness of the choice which our Assembly made of him.\n191.\tIt is my honor to present to this Assembly the revolutionary greetings of the founding President of the\nPeople's Revolutionary Movement, the President of the Republic of Zaire, and of his people, as well as all the wishes they express for the success of this session.\n192.\tI must also pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization, our friend Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the sustained efforts which he has constantly deployed in the defense of the great humanitarian principles which have made the Charter of our Organization the ideal platform for international co-operation, justice and world peace. In the opinion of my delegation, Mr. Kurt Waldheim has provided us with confirmation of his outstanding moral and intellectual qualities- qualities which have opened the door for him to a highly promising second term. We must pay a tribute to his self-denial, his dedication, his discretion and the sharp sensitivity with which he has always tackled the problems that are rending our world.\n193.\tBefore continuing this statement, I should like, on behalf of the founding President of the People's Revolutionary Movement, the President of the Republic of Zaire, citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, on behalf of my delegation and in my own name, to pay a heart-felt tribute to the memory of the late great helmsman of the gallant Chinese people, that great statesman of our century, Mao Tsetung. Chairman Mao Tsetung is dead, but, as was so well expressed by the Chinese people, his work will remain in the memory of mankind as an example of courage, fearlessness and abnegation in the conduct of the public affairs of our States.\n194.\tThe Republic of Zaire, which has had occasion to appreciate the beneficial action of our Organization, re-mains firmly attached to the fundamental principles of its Charter and reaffirms its support for the ideals of justice, peace and concord which it considers to be the fundamental elements of its domestic and foreign policy. The Republic of Zaire places special emphasis upon a policy of good neighbourliness, of concord and co-operation with all States which prize peace and justice.\n195.\tWe are convinced that all the countries which are gathered and represented here in this hall will give their assistance and support to the President, which he so urgently needs in order to fulfill his task. The Republic of Zaire assures him that it stands always ready to work within the framework of the ideals of the United Nations.\n196.\tIn connexion with this help and assistance which must be given the President, if it is true that people play the most important part in the functioning of institutions, it still remains that the structural and institutional framework itself must be adequate. Now, there is no doubt that the documents which at present govern our Organization are inadequate, since a majority of countries are calling for a revision of the Charter in order to adapt it to the present world situation and the true state of affairs.\n197.\tZaire, for its part, calls for this revision and has been doing so since 1971. This has been once again solemnly confirmed by the most authoritative voice, that of citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, our President.\n198.\tAmong the most criticized sections is, in particular, that which concerns the membership of the Security\nCouncil in the distribution of the permanent members by continent.\n199.\tIt is not inappropriate to recall also the way in which the veto is used in the Security Council. That organ, whose primary purpose was to safeguard peace, appears more and more today as a forum for the settlement of scores. The principle of the veto and its excessive use should therefore be considered afresh in the interest of the Organization as a whole, since this would then enable it better to serve its vocation of universality.\n200.\tThe very spirit of the United Nations has remained dependent upon the concept which prevailed at the end of the Second World War, in other words, that of a club of victors, resolved to take as much advantage as possible of their victory in order to punish the vanquished by making them pay for their crimes. Finally , the spirit of revenge and domination still tends to prevail over preoccupations with peaceful co-operation in equality and with equity.\n201.\tLastly, within the Organization itself we see the need for a rationalization of a certain number of mechanisms, of committees and of subsidiary bodies in such a way as to simplify the overall machinery.\n202.\tThe revision of the Charter must not appear as a loss of privileges but, rather, as the pursuit of greater harmony and greater justice and equity. Moreover, an organization having a universal character such as ours can find no foundation in the nest of privileges or of whiffs of domination, exploitation and opposition.\n203.\tIs this the reason why the work of the Committee responsible for bringing together all these suggestions relating to this reorganization of the Charter  has bogged down? It is difficult to say. But we must hope JJiat appropriate and adequate solutions will be found so that the United Nations might the better respond to its ideal.\n204.\tIf we cannot be too hasty in this task, neither can we accept lamentable delaying tactics whose origin is simple selfishness and the atavistic refusal to accept change.\n205.\tThese appear to us to be the prior conditions which form part of the encouragement and the support to be given to the President and the Secretary-General for the total success of their mission in this sphere. The goodwill of each cannot be questioned, but it would be insufficient without an adequate institutional and structural framework and without a change in mentality.\n206.\tAccordingly, it is in this constant spirit of equity and self-denial, which is necessary for any dialog, that I would wish to deal successively with the most important problems before our world community, the solution of which calls for our reflexion and our concerted action.\n207.\tBut first I should like to say that, in responding to the universalist vocation of our Organization, we are pleased to note that our family circle is constantly growing. Et is in this spirit that we wish a cordial welcome to all countries which have since the thirtieth session enriched the great United Nations family.\n208.\tThis particularly applies to the young Republic of Seychelles, with which my country is already maintaining fruitful relations of productive co-operation marked by understanding and solidarity.\n209.\tTo conclude on this subject, my delegation earnestly hopes that the countries which have knocked at the door of our Organization and which in spite of their endeavors have so far been unable to assume their places in this forum will join us in the very near future.\n210.\tHaving made these preliminary remarks, I should now like to deal with the problems relating to disarmament, international terrorism, Korea, the Middle East, the new international economic order, the Conference on the Law of the Sea and, lastly, the situation in southern Africa.\n211.\tI believe I am expressing the general feeling when I say that the greatest concern of mankind at present is fear for its destiny. Will mankind survive, given the terrible means of destruction that it has accumulated and, if it meets this challenge, what will be its condition -that of a mankind free and liberated from the material fetters and the domination and exploitation of man by man or not? I believe that, in the final analysis, this is the equation to which all the problems with which we are going to deal are reduced.\n212.\tSince the appearance upon our planet of the terrible means of destruction accumulated by the nuclear Powers, mankind has become fearful for its own survival, for the massive use of these terrible means of dealing death would result in the immediate or early demise of biological life on this planet.\n213.\tSome optimists consider that it is necessary to continue to have faith in man who, they hope, will retain sufficient lucidity and commonsense not to bring about irreversibly his own destruction. I should like to associate myself with this view in thinking that hope is not the science of idiots, for, according to the paradox, the progressive accumulation of the forces of the apocalypse will deprive their holders of any desire to use them through fear of reprisals.\n214.\tHowever, as they are drawn into the spiral of fear by the magic of deterrence, all the nations which have the means to do so are joining the folly of the frenetic arms race, because in view of the values and the interests involved, and considering quite rightly that one is best qualified to look after one's own defense, everyone tries to enter the club only to attempt immediately to prohibit entry to others.\n215.\tIt appears logical to us to believe that men would not continue to manufacture these weapons without the hope of using them; and the consequences that such a prospect causes to weigh upon mankind mean that disarmament must be the business of everyone and not the business of some.\n216.\tThe solution to the question appears quite simple, because the prohibition of nuclear weapons should be addressed to all the nations of the world. The term \\\"non-proliferation\\\" contains a certain discrimination by virtue of the fact that it confirms hierarchies and the existence of protecting Powers. In so doing, the danger is not eliminated; on the contrary, it is confirmed and sustained.\n217.\tYet, it is in this Utopian dream that the real survival of mankind resides. This dream is based upon the consideration of the requirements of universal solidarity. Indeed, the savings that could be achieved here could be applied to more useful projects for man, such as the struggle against poverty and disease.\n218.\tIf we depart from this view of things, then we have to subdue altogether the concept of disarmament, abandon our poor world to its lamentable destiny, admit our own powerlessness, and wait for the powder kegs of the various crises rending the nations of the world to explode.\n219.\tOne powder keg, according to what we hear, is the situation prevailing with regard to relations between the two Koreas. Yet, we wonder whether the Korean question, which is a fundamentally simple one, is not singularly complicated by the different presentations of it nourished by the propaganda of either of the parties involved. What exactly are the issues at stake?\n220.\tThe two parts of the divided people have allegedly together displayed their intention to be reunified and, consequently, have published in 1972 a communique to this effect.\n221.\tIt seems that since then the process leading towards reunification is marking time, to the great dissatisfaction of all concerned, if one considers the increase in communiques and counter-communiques, aide-memoires and counter- aide-memoires, putting the blame on the North or the South or vice versa.\n222.\tLastly, the version that is spread about attributes the present failure of negotiations to the presence of foreign troops which are in the South, either under the United Nations flag or as a result of bilateral agreements signed with the United States, in particular.\n223.\tWe are told, moreover, that the presence of these troops in the South is aggression against the North and that by virtue of this fact it is a miracle that war has not again broken out. And we are led to conclude that it is necessary to withdraw the foreign troops stationed in South Korea because of the danger they represent for the North. The picture thus painted obviously leaves shadow areas on which light has to be shed. In particular, one may well wonder who in the South or in the North really desires this reunification. One of the two, or both together? Otherwise, is reunification being urged by the United Nations or by certain of its Members?\n224.\tThose are so many questions which, although naive in appearance, have not so far been replied to unequivocally. For, after all, North and South Koreans are all adults,\nand it is inconceivable that, having officially and publicly assumed the undertaking to reunify, they feel once again a need to be pushed into it by resolutions.\n225.\tIt cannot be repeated too often that this problem of the reunification of the two Korean entities is a matter for the Korean themselves who must settle it in complete independence and away from any foreign pressure one way or the other.\n226.\tIf the United Nations or some sincere friends have any advise to give or any considerations to voice on the subject, the two parties must be clearly heard, to the exclusion of any partisanship based on belonging to this or that trend or on personal sympathies.\n227.\tUnfortunately, we are bound to note that draft resolutions and counter-draft resolutions on the Korean question are the results of the subjective elements to which I have just referred. There is a tendency to agree with the thesis of one's friends. Some support the departure of foreign troops because they see in them a reflection of the American demons. Others, regardless of the subtlety of their position, are opposed to that departure because they see looming on the horizon the shadow of the Soviet, or simply the Communist, ogre. In a word, the positions of all sides have as their main foundation not the primary consideration of the interests of the Korean peoples, but the triumph of trends and blocs.\n228.\tFor our part, we continue to maintain that the reunification of the two entities must be brought about peacefully by the Koreans themselves, under the conditions and the methods which the two parties concerned agree to freely. The United Nations, which is responsible for the command of the troops stationed in South Korea, obviously has the power to dissolve that command.\n229.\tThe risk of war, about which we hear so much, must certainly be among our concerns, and it would seem to be both wise and honest to assess the possible and real causes in order to find appropriate solutions. For if we really wish peace, we cannot reasonably claim that the 1950 war, which crystallized the present divisions, was the result of aggression by foreign troops stationed in the South. Hence, the solution of the Korean problem must first and foremost take into account the real will of the parties concerned, and not that of prompters who wish to lend their allegedly well-intentioned good offices.\n230.\tThe problem of the Middle East-I was going to say \\\"the Palestinian problem\\\" - which appears regularly on our agenda, arises in different terms, because in this case it is not an internal Palestinian question calling, in the first instance, for an agreement between Palestinians. On the contrary, we are faced with a question that is highly international in its essence and in its manifestations.\n231.\tThe position of the Republic of Zaire with respect to this tragedy has not altered since it was clearly set forth from this rostrum by the President of the Republic, citizen Mobutu Sese Seko.  It may be summed up, first, by the fact that all the States of the region have a right to an existence within recognized and guaranteed borders. The problem of reliable borders depends upon an unquestionable paralogism, because no border can be a sure border except as a result of the will of those guaranteeing it.\n232.\tHence, the State of Israel must evacuate the territories that it is still occupying as a result of war. Otherwise, we would be giving legitimacy to a policy of the fist and the fait accompli, which is unacceptable in international relations.\n233.\tOn the other hand, we reaffirm the principle that the people of Palestine, which has suffered only too much, is entitled to a country. It is profoundly unjust that that people should continue to live in a diaspora like that which marked the Jewish people so deeply for centuries. There is no reason for us to refuse a country to the Palestinian people when we have given one to the Jewish people. Our good conscience must be more attentive to the tragedy of that people, so little loved despite appearances and statements. In that connexion, it is unquestionable that since the development of the Lebanese tragedy in particular-a tragedy that we all hope to see.ended soon our collective responsibility towards the Palestinian people has become more acute.\n234.\tFirst of all, it is a matter of restoring a certain confidence within that people, because the more than cynical comments by most Palestinians show the extent to which their faith has been shaken.\n235.\tWho is now their true friend, and in whom can they have trust, without expecting disappointment in the future? It is not sufficient, indeed, to proclaim one's friendship for the Palestinian people. That was the song of yesterday, and it was easy and without cost. But now the real practice and the hidden intentions must coincide with the declared intentions and, in any event, the mote in the eye of others must not make us overlook the beam in our own.\n236.\tThe despair which can result from the incomprehension displayed towards their problems and the feeling of being the outcasts of society or instruments of propaganda may be at the origin of some extreme acts that we sometimes have to deplore. These acts are, in that case, designed to catch our imagination and draw our attention to their tragedy, Thus, they find themselves in a sort of state of necessity, which excludes a choice of means.\n237.\tWith regard to the thorny problem of international terrorism, in July of this year the Security Council had to deal with a matter that highlighted two aspects of terror-ism: the hijacking of aircraft with the taking of hostages, on the one hand, and the violation of the territorial sovereignty of a Member State by another Member of the United Nations, on the other.\n235. During the debates, the majority of speakers who expressed a position condemned all forms of terrorism, whether on private or on State initiative. Indeed, the\nOrganization of African Unity adopted a resolution condemning acts of piracy, and in particular the hijacking of aircraft and the taking of hostages. These practices must be condemned, and it would be desirable that, in addition to adopting appropriate international legislation, States took measures to discourage this type of activity. A fortiori the international community must condemn and censure in the same manner State terrorism, regardless of the reasons that might cover up such acts. The concepts of self-defense and State needs, however valid they may be, must be considered with circumspection, especially when, in addition, they come from those who have weapons and are therefore all too inclined to use them against the weak.\n239.\tIt was therefore wrongly that the Security Council, paralyzed by the machinery we denounced at the beginning of this statement, found it necessary to declare itself powerless by adjourning without pronouncing a condemnation even in principle. There is no need to be surprised that acts of piracy, either individual or on a State level, are encouraged thereby. As proof of that, and as an echo of the Israeli operation at Entebbe, two weeks later it was learned that South Africa had committed aggression against Zambia in a raid which resulted in more than 40 dead-and that raid was condemned by the Security Council. Nevertheless, as regards these acts of piracy it is not sufficient to consider and condemn the acts themselves, which, in the majority of cases, are merely the consequences of dramatic situations which we must solve before it happens.\n240.\tAfter those few considerations, I now wish to examine what I consider to be the most urgent problems of the moment -namely, the establishment of a new inter-national economic order, together with the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, on the one hand, and the situation in southern Africa, on the other.\n241.\tIt may be asserted that the establishment of a new world economic order is one of the great themes of the moment. It is sufficient to cite some of the international gatherings devoted to this crusade: the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly; the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi; the meetings concerned with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States; the North-South dialog and there are so many more.\n242.\tIs this not evidence of the importance of the question? The peoples of the world expect to see established a new philosophy and new concepts in economic and trade relations between States, and these relations should be marked by greater justice, greater equity and greater humanity.\n243.\tIf we are to be pleased at the size and frequency of these meetings, should we not, on the other hand, show considerable reserve as to the results obtained so far? These are mountains which have labored and brought forth mice.\n244. Whereas the developing countries pose the problem in terms of justice, equity, equilibrium, solidarity and co-operation, one gets the feeling that the developed countries see in it a dangerous encroachment upon their privileges, and therefore they tackle the problems brought up with condescension and without any warmth.\n245.\tWe have, however, been greatly edified by the highly humanitarian and balanced statements on this subject at this rostrum by Mr. Thorn, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and the President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, even if we do not fully share his optimism on the results obtained.\n246.\tThe well-equipped countries must admit that our world, which is in a state of imbalance because it is based on privilege and the domination of some by others, is bound to be a world of division and hatred, a world charged with fear which excludes any possibility of genuine co-operation. We are not asking for pity but for justice, and our negotiating partners must accept the intolerable fact that their privileges are frequently based upon an accumulation of injustices which must disappear.\n247.\tThe most typical case is that concerning the primary products of the developing countries, whose export prices are set by the purchasers-in other words, by the well- equipped countries. The constantly fluctuating nature of these prices is very harmful to our economies, which sometimes have to compensate for sudden simple or multiple downward fluctuations, whereas at the same time prices of the capital goods imported from developed countries are constantly increasing. If you take into account the fact that the currencies in which the sales of our primary commodities are carried out have been strongly eroded by galloping inflation, you will realize all the better the tragedy of our countries.\n248.\tDuring this year of 1976 the under-equipped countries have taken part in decisive gatherings of great moment for the current Second United Nations Development Decade. Among those gatherings, as everyone knows, are those of Nairobi, Colombo and Mexico, which have been important centers of concentration and cohesion in the struggle of the developing peoples to reclaim from the technically developed peoples their share of the fruits of their natural resources.\n249.\tThere is no need regularly to return to the themes that have been debated at those various gatherings. Collective development will have to be conducted without discrimination, and we believe that the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation will in turn offer hope, although so far nothing has given us cause to hope for genuine success.\n250.\tThe importance and diversity of the natural resources of the under-equipped countries should be the keystone of their solidarity in the course of the present year.\n251.\tWe must recognize that at the fourth session of UNCTAD the political will for genuine economic co-operation with the under-equipped countries which had been so sorely lacking took concrete form through the announcement of contributions to the common fund for commodities not only by the poorer countries but also by those of the equipped countries which have wished to echo the daring initiatives of the developing countries.\n252.\tThese initiatives had already come to light in the adoption of the Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], as well as at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, the General Conference in Lima,  and in many other ways.\n253.\tThe co-operation between developing countries is in our opinion a sine qua non condition for highlighting once and for all the concept of self-reliance. In Mexico the first step was taken, and we hope that this pace will be continued in other \\\"Mexicos\\\".\n254.\tIn order to infuse into international economic and trade relations a spirit of justice and equity, in Nairobi we agreed in the course of the present year to proceed with negotiations relating to the establishment of an integrated program with a common fund tied into it. We also decided to proceed with the negotiation of international agreements on a number of products.\n255.\tThe commitments of Nairobi having been confirmed at the sixty-first session of the Economic and Social Council, we venture to hope that all the under-equipped countries and the equipped countries will take part in these negotiations with a genuine desire to achieve success.\n256.\tI take this opportunity to recall that the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Port Louis, Mauritius, from 2 to 5 July 1976, decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of African Ministers of Foreign Affairs in order to deal with the important subject of development. That meeting will take place from 5 to 10 December 1976 at Kinshasa, the capital of the Republic of Zaire. We in Zaire sincerely believe.that Africa, which has suffered so much from military interventions from abroad, is more in need of tractors and lorries for its development than of tanks and missiles.\n257.\tIt is with the same aim of establishing a new international economic order based on greater justice and equality that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was convened. In negotiations of this kind, where so many partners have so many, at times divergent, interests to defend, it is, of course, not possible to expect easy and quick successes; but we are at least entitled to expect some progress, even if slow, and not retrogression. Yet, as compared to the sessions held in Geneva and Caracas, the session just held in New York appears, in the view of certain observers, as a step backwards in the slow development which had started.\n258.\tThe Conference on the Law of the Sea comes in response to the preoccupation that the growth in the world population and its constantly increasing needs will cause a depletion of the available resources of our continents; but the sea-bed, which comprises three quarters of the surface of our world, seems to offer immense possibilities which would delay that depletion of our continental wealth. In these circumstances, the exploitation of the sea-bed emerges as the great chance of tomorrow of which mankind must take full advantage. But precautions must be taken to ensure that this common heritage does not fall into the hands of a minority of the strong to the great detriment of the others, because there would then be a repetition of the same injustices and the same mistakes as those which we are denouncing and combating now.\n259.\tThere are so many problems which arise within the framework of that Conference that I am sure we will not be criticized for dealing with the political aspects of the question, because therein, indeed, resides the substance of the problem. In any event, the new law of the sea cannot go on ignoring the land-locked, semi-land locked or geographically disadvantaged States. Similarly, the future exploitation of the sea-bed must respect ecology, which has suffered so much from pollution.\n260.\tOnce these precautions are taken, here are some basic principles which, in the opinion of my delegation, should guide future negotiations.\n261.\tIt is necessary to establish, within the framework of this new law of the sea, an international organ, which would be called \\\"Authority\\\" or the \\\"Commission\\\". That international body must have a minimum of prerogatives, administrative as well as jurisdictional, in order to settle disputes between Members and verify any possible violations of accepted rules in the new law of the sea; because if the authority to be created does not have this minimum of prerogatives to maintain order and discipline, we will once again be faced with a vacuum which we are even now obliged to fill.\n262.\tWith regard to the actual exploitation, it is essential that it should not have either as its main goal or as a consequence to hold back, handicap or compete with the production of the same raw materials by countries in the process of becoming equipped. Exploitation must, on the contrary, be designed to deal with the shortages suffered by all, and must meet the following requirements.\n263.\tFirst, in spite of the anarchy which prevails with regard to the determination of the breadth of the territorial sea, it should be possible to develop a trend towards avoiding excessive disparities.\n264.\tSecondly, the exclusive economic zone of the continental shelf must necessarily be within the exclusive purview of the coastal States, without in any way affecting the navigational right or rights of access to the sea which we advocate for the land-locked and semi-land-locked countries.\n265.\tThirdly, we cannot subscribe to the principle of automatic free access to the wealth of die sea-bed, because then what we would see would be the establishment of the law of the jungle, where the stronger would mercilessly crush the weaker. Indeed, under cover of free competition, it would be a fool's bargain where the State-owned and private companies of the technically advanced countries would alone have all the rights.\n266.\tOutside economically contiguous zones, the designation of exclusive zones on the high seas appears to us to be dangerous, because the techniques of detection by satellite or by any other means are in the hands of the developed countries, and it is to be feared in this case that the better zones would be assigned solely to companies of those countries.\n267.\tWe should not confuse progress in negotiations with haste in coming to the conclusions which must emerge from the debates. As the goal is to permit the exploitation of the sea-bed, and the private or State-owned companies of the developed countries have adequate financial and technical means, only three solutions can be contemplated. They are as follows.\n268.\tThe first consists of the establishment of an enter-prise to which all States members of the Conference would belong. The enterprise would thus be responsible for the exploitation of the sea-bed. This certainly is the best solution, in theoretical terms. It remains to be seen when that enterprise could see the light of the day, and especially what means would be at its disposal in order for it to carry out its mission. With that expressed reservation, there is no doubt that we would lean towards such a solution because it tends to guarantee the common interest.\n269.\tThe second solution would consist in leaving to private or State-owned companies automatic free access to the exploitation of the sea-bed, without any possibility of control, in view particularly of the security requirements connected with technical secrets and invention patents. Such a hypothetical solution appears to us to be unacceptable because the sea-bed would in fact be given up to exploitation by only a limited number of developed countries. Nor can we subscribe to the solution of allowing those firms to pay a percentage of their production to the authority or enterprise, because that would be a free-lance, non-institutional solution, and one tainted with condescension.\n270.\tThere remains the third solution, proposed by our brothers from Nigeria. Roughly speaking, it involves the establishment of a firm or association in which those private and/ or State-owned companies that possess the technology for the exploitation of the sea-bed would take part equally .\n271.\tActually, the last proposal is a variation of the first and, in addition, the obstacles to the establishment of such an association are similar to those in the case of the first proposal. If the enterprise has the necessary financial means, it could, while remaining in charge, engage the services of an operating company which would serve as a subcontractor. This, as a matter of fact, applies to the third solution. Indeed, it goes without saying that an enterprise or association as previously defined can resort to the use of subcontractors.\n272.\tThe difference might perhaps reside in the single fact that a firm would be more willing to be the subcontractor of something of which it is already a part. In any event, the two solutions are not mutually exclusive, and it is in this direction that, in the opinion of my delegation, an approach should be sought.\n273. My analysis of this subject may have seemed lengthy, but it is an indication of the interest and importance that- we attach to the establishment of a new world economic order based on justice and equity. A suitable solution of this question is one of the tests that would show whether this order is a mirage or whether, on the contrary, it is in fact likely to lead to world solidarity.\n274.\tI should now like to deal with the last important and urgent subject whose solution can no longer be postponed. I am speaking of the situation at present: in southern Africa.\n275.\tPerhaps our conscience is lulled by the honors of war which have already marked our century, which is surely not privileged in this respect. Accordingly, it may be that our conscience is unable to be moved extremely by the fearsome tragedy that is now being enacted in southern Africa. Every day brings fresh sorrow, desolation and rancor. Perhaps Buchenwald and Auschwitz are already too far removed.\n276.\tA minority of settlers without morality or law, in the name of the shameful principle of superiority based on skin pigmentation, are trampling underfoot the fundamental elements of a civilization from which they derive by pitilessly assassinating thousands of defenseless blacks whose sole crime is to aspire to the estate of manhood and to freedom.\n277.\tThese murders cannot make us forget that long before, and even after, Peter Abrahams, red already was the blood of these brave blacks which flowed so freely.\n278.\tThe tragedy of southern Africa did not begin yesterday. At each session of the General Assembly and of other political organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the question has been raised under various circumstances, but always with the same intensity. Voluminous reports have always been devoted to this in the purest tradition of our Organization, provoking, unfortunately, indifference and amused smiles. As far as Africa is concerned, we can only be pleased with the fortunate process of liberation which has made possible over the last two years the accession to independence of former Portuguese colonies and other Territories. Nevertheless, the process of decolonization in Africa and throughout the would will not be complete so long as Zimbabwe and Namibia remain under colonial domination and apartheid continues to prevail in South Africa. Freedom and independence are indivisible and are part of the common heritage of mankind. As long as peoples are deprived of it, our freedom will always be in jeopardy. The liberation movement constitutes an irreversible historical trend which only anachronistic and corrupt mentalities may feign to ignore for a while.\n279.\tSo far as Zimbabwe is concerned the situation is very clear. Great Britain, the administering Power, still retains its responsibility for bringing this Territory to independence. The international community cannot accept the unlawful proclamation of independence of the settlers.\n280.\tWithin the framework of African unity, Zaire has morally and materially supported the struggle waged by the people of Zimbabwe against the colonialists. For its part, the Organization of African Unity has appealed to the universal conscience. But the adherents of the Pretoria regime have long remained insensitive and have scornfully rejected all appeals addressed to them by the international community.\n281.\tThe time has, therefore, come to recall the words of the President of the Republic when he addressed this august Assembly on 4 October 1973. This is what he said: \\\"A fruit falls only when it is ripe; but in the storms and the tempests of history the fruit falls, whether ripe or not\\\". \n282.\tThe process of liberation is irreversible. Nothing, neither violence nor deceit will stop it. On the contrary, the world is witnessing a radical transformation of the struggle in this part of the continent. The black people of South Africa are organizing themselves and even waging an increasingly incisive and decisive struggle.\n283.\tThe wheel of history is turning in southern Africa at a rate that is increasing every day. This universal historical truth has long been understood by the peoples in this part of Africa, and, moved by an inexorable confidence in the future, the crowds of Soweto, Alexandra and elsewhere have hurled their cry of refusal and. defiance. They are braving the repression of the racists, and their revolt has spread like a train of gunpowder all the way to Johannes-burg, attacking all the symbols of oppression.\n284.\tSince the crumbling of the Portuguese empire in Africa which served as a rampart for those favoring segregation, nothing will be as it was and the various uprisings in South Africa these past few months have accelerated the tempo of history.\n285.\tAnd now, suddenly the eyes of the unbelievers are opened and the myths cast aside.\n286.\tNo, southern Africa is not a paradise for the blacks. No, the conditions for blacks in southern Africa are no more enviable than in the rest of Africa, as malevolent propaganda would have us believe. No, the African countries and the other nations of the world which love peace and freedom are not exaggerating in describing the situation in southern Africa.\n287.\tDefinitely, the matter would have had more impact if the blacks of Africa had the magic weapon of petroleum or if they were able to raise the threat of an embargo on food products.\n288.\tBefore the calamity of southern Africa, we independent countries of Africa had always rejected the solution of dialog with the racist regimes of southern Africa, believing, quite appropriately, that dialog would have to be established in the field itself because nothing of any value can be done without the assistance of the populations concerned, and any solution imposed from without is necessarily doomed to failure.\n289.\tIn this sense the contemplated dialog would have been a disappointment because the minority and racist regimes were going to grant outside what they refused to grant within to their own fellow citizens.\n290.\tLastly, and here is the decisive consideration, the racist authorities have so far given hardly any sign of goodwill. Of course, they may have to water down their positions from time to time but they immediately return to their former ones,\n291.\tBefore this dialog of the deaf and before so much display of ill will we had no alternative but to resort to arms, endorsing a truth already taught by Chairman Mao Tsetung, namely, that victory comes out of the barrel of a gun.\n292.\tYet, it is not exactly in terms of victories, bitter ones, indeed, that the problem should be stated but in terms of justice and of the democratic majority. The armed struggle, inevitable as the history of liberation teaches us, is a last resort.\n293.\tIn the short run, violence does not serve the interests involved, and in the long run the minority regimes are doomed unequivocally because they will have lost everything and will have been swept aside by violence in their turn.\n294.\tThere is no doubt also that the majority of tomorrow will stand to benefit to the maximum from the infra-structure that is available to it.\n295.\tThe revolution in southern Africa is not an internal matter or a matter of only a few States, but is a matter for the world community as a whole, particularly the African community. It cannot be diverted under cover of demagoguery and political oneupmanship for the benefit of political personalities.\n296.\tWe are faced with a terrible test of strength whose final result, although it may be far off, is nevertheless in no doubt.\n297.\tThe ball is now in the court of Vorster and Smith. The black majority has shown much too much patience, and the decisive hour for an unequivocal choice has arrived. Pretoria and Salisbury can no longer lull us with promises and false statements. We are expecting positive and sincere acts which will bring the majority to the government of their countries, and the first stage is Namibia, to say nothing of Zimbabwe.\n298.\tIn this display of goodwill and self-denial, the West has an immense role to play, unless it wishes to be politically blind, even though it has so far neglected it.\n299.\tHowever, it has not very much time to succeed, because in terms of the ties which bind it to the racist minorities-trade and economic ties, ties of blood and of strategy-the West can and must influence South Africa to change policy both as regards Namibia and within South Africa itself. The case of Zimbabwe is, of course, more flagrant.\n300.\tThe minority racist authorities are not as short-sighted as they seem. If so far they have been forced into the present course, it is precisely because of the support they could expect from their allies. If you speak the language of strength, reason and firmness, Vorster and Smith will abandon their intransigence.\n301.\tIn these circumstances we have taken note of the mission of Mr. Henry Kissinger in that part of Africa. We think in Zaire that to oppose in principle and a priori a mission of this kind, as some have done, is demagoguery. It is on the basis of results that his mission must be appraised, as one judges a tree by its fruit. History does not like losers. If this mission is successful, the United States Secretary of State will have come out with greatly increased prestige. When public opinion has been inflamed to white heat, it cannot be put to sleep by soporifics; thus the prospect of losing face gives the mission of the United States Secretary of State an element of courage that ennobles it. In any case, no one outside of Africa has done better before him.\n302.\tBut, if there are real signs of goodwill, if South Africa resolutely embarks upon the course of ^independence for Namibia, if Ian Smith unswervingly starts the process leading to government by majority, if there is a real evolution in the situation, then we must have the honesty to recognize this change and to act in accordance with the new course of events-without, however, losing our vigilance, because they can continue to kill defenseless populations, but the final victory is unavoidable. Time is on our side. No regime of iniquity and usurpation has succeeded in maintaining itself indefinitely. Moreover, who cares about death if one is fighting for freedom and dignity and if tomorrow it opens the door to dignity and freedom?\n303.\tI can do no better, in conclusion, than to quote the words of a popular song of Venezuela, and I shall quote this, however imperfectly, in the original language, Spanish: \\\"They can kill the man but they cannot kill the way in which his soul rejoices while dreaming of freedom.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to greet and to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his election and to wish him every success in the deliberations over which he will preside. I should also like to call to mind the excellent presidency of Mr. Gaston Thorn, who very remarkably guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.\n86.\tA new country-the Republic of Seychelles-has joined the United Nations. With it, the number of States\nMembers of the Organization has risen to 145, which is not a mere numerical fact but also reveals essential qualitative changes in the world political order. The sum of countries which make up the United Nations in the post-colonial era implies adjustments, reviews and corrections, not only as regards the structure and functioning of the Organization, but also as regards the basic direction of some of its fundamental activities.\n87.\tDecolonization is one of the most important achievements of the United Nations; it likewise shows how the context of political and legal relations created by the United Nations has a sound effect on international relations and is an unquestionable advance of culture and civilization.\n88.\tI should like to say to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, that I have read and studied his annual report on the work of the Organization [A/3111 and Add.l] with keen interest. This report reveals not only his personal concern and the loftiness of his purpose, but, furthermore, points of view which are essential to the future destiny of the Organization.\n89.\tThe year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been a period of hope and of frustration. Both the seventh special session in 1975 and the regular session of the General Assembly which followed it have required that attention be paid to matters which are indispensable to the stability of the international system and to the future of the world.\n90.\tSome of the difficulties which arose during the last year have put to the test the intentions of States and Governments. There is impatience and expectation with regard to the decisions which must be taken, as well as with regard to the application of those already adopted. One of them is international detente. There are skeptical and pessimistic attitudes throughout the world which see detente as a remote possibility that is difficult to attain. Efforts for peace and purposes which inspire detente cannot be weakened or abandoned. In the face of every difficulty which arises hope and will must be held high so as not to alter the essential tendency which inspires.this policy of detente. However, this must not be designed solely for the benefit of relations between the Powers or super\u00acPowers; it must also spread its effects to all countries. Detente cannot be reserved exclusively for prevailing relations of power and force; it must benefit poor countries and favor the new developing nations which have no reason to suffer the heritage of any conflict but can and must exercise fully their right to join a peaceful world based on the use of reason and serious thinking.\n91.\tIt should be pointed out that East-West relations, which oversimplified world politics for years, have changed the points of reference which prevailed after the Second World War. The country which I represent here is one of those which realize and believe that international relations must be placed above ideological positions in order to give impetus and concrete movement to purposes and projects for co-operation and specific understandings.\n92.\tEast-West relations must develop further in years to come. This will be the best proof of psychological disarmament, which is just as important as military disarmament, and is intended to maintain among peoples and nations a positive and growing flow of links and exchanges.\n93.\tNorth-South relations require priority attention. There has been a widening of the areas of understanding between the industrial and non-industrial countries; nevertheless it is still not possible to say that concrete results have been achieved. It will be basic and fundamental for the dialog between the industrial and non-industrial countries to be held, not only in good faith by the participants, but with a willingness to find positive formulas which will gradually solve short-term, medium-term and long-term problems.\n94.\tSome areas have been singled out for the negotiation of consensus and this, of course, is a process which must be carried out with a view to applying and implementing the formulas arrived at. The North-South dialog must find tangible form in the adoption of a program which will represent a real and positive advance in international economic co-operation. The second phase of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which is action-oriented, could be an important step in this direction. It must be proved that the political will is there, beyond doubt, to set a new direction for international economic relations. This is a question of moving forward and promoting a change in course, and not of maintaining the previous status, which has proved to be insufficient and incapable of overcoming present injustices and imbalances.\n95.\tHuman rights are undergoing one of the most severe and impressive crises in history. There is a growing trend to ignore, to fail to respect or to neglect the philosophy and practice of human rights. As the representative of a democratic country, which has assimilated the basic values of culture and civilization, I should like to express the concern of the Government and of my country to contribute, within the United Nations, to formulating practical means to define, defend and guarantee the full exercise of human rights in all parts of the world.\n96.\tOne of the most important tests this Organization will have to face in the years to come is in defense of human rights. We must reject the idea that human rights can be entrusted exclusively to the circumstantial, temporary and momentary political interests of a Government or nation. The global meaning which human relations are acquiring, the increasingly more universal perspective in which we, the men of this generation, move, requires that human rights be world-wide in scope and their defense fully supported by international institutions. To make a more effective adjustment between the scope of national and international jurisdiction is a task which commits the United Nations to preferential attention. Reconciling international and national jurisdiction implies risks and requites permanent as well as effective institutional procedures.\n97.\tNor can we continue to accept that the defense of human rights only applies in the event of a given political interest. No matter what the regime, the ideological inspiration or the social tendency of a Government, it would not be possible to point out something as a violation in one country when it is accepted in another. In this case, it becomes necessary to invoke the basic principle of good faith in international relations. At the Conference on Co-operation and Security in Europe, held at Helsinki, the need for good faith in international relations was specially stressed. Without it no significant step forward can be taken on the major issues of today.\n98.\tAnother fundamental subject which must be borne in mind at this time is the fight against corruption. The world order must provide rules of conduct accepted by all States so as to prevent a rise in international corruption. Corruption is eroding international relations, with negative effects on both morality and economic affairs. It happens in the large industrial countries as well as in small nations, with both internal and external effects, and a serious effort must be made to fight it at both levels.\n99.\tIn the final analysis it was an ethical inspiration which brought the United Nations into being. Corruption is fed by anti-ethical forces, which are more of a threat to culture and civilization than the firing capability of many weapons of aggression.\n100.\tIt must be possible to arrive at effective measures to fight corruption in a short time. But what matters now is to start, to set points of departure and to agree on action by consultations among States and initiatives taken within the United Nations directed towards this end.\n101.\tThe post-colonial era is characterized by the emergence of new political and geopolitical factors with, in turn, many important effects and consequences. It may be that some of the disarray the United Nations is now experiencing is due to the fact that the Organization tailored its programs to a different set of realities. In the last 30 years the international political order has become broadened, relations have expanded, and the world political space has grown larger.\n102.\tThe United Nations must have an immediate response to the growth of world political space. That is the question. The period we are living in could be interpreted as a moment of transition between the old order and the new.\n103.\tWe live in a time when every nation must know exactly what it is after, what it can and what it cannot do. A shrewd sense of realities and of limitations is essential to provide an atmosphere of constructive moderation for United Nations activities and for the dynamism of inter-national relations.\n104.\tThe present international economic order not infrequently lacks an over-all view of various subjects. Over-simplification of some criteria precludes a study of facts and situations within their natural contexts. No progress can be made within the world economic balance unless the respective contexts are used with wisdom and in proportion. This over-all view is the framework within which a productive confrontation of ideas intended to seek results and offer solutions can be developed.\n105.\tThe United Nations setting is the natural and historic environment in which dialog and consultations among peoples and Governments should take place.\n106.\tSeparating short-term from long-term solutions, and possibilities within reach from distant prospects, is part of a methodology of means directed towards a rational and pragmatic context. This action, with the impetus of systematic efforts, should lead along a secure and firm road to attainable goals.\n107.\tSome matters upset the international environment. The question of Panama, the Middle East conflict and the problems of southern Africa are facts which must be approached with growing boldness and decisiveness. Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa require compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions. In all these conflicts, it is the hope of my country that, with greater boldness and decisiveness, it will be possible to arrive at early solutions, just formulations and balanced responses.\n108.\tAs a Latin American cannot fail to mention the commemoration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama, which met on the initiative of Simon Bolivar in 1826. This Congress was an historic event which for the first time collectively defined the political strategy of the Latin American continent. It not only sought a hemispheric context for Latin American relations and international strategy but also aspired to much more. It was an inspiration intended, among other things, to strengthen the then nascent ideas of freedom and democratic principles. Political values of the utmost importance were expressed at the Panama Congress. Simon Bolivar sought a new balance in the international context of the epoch and aspired to dealing with many problems in their entirety and jointly.\n109.\tToday there are new nations, as there were in 1826. Then, with a universal vision, we were readying ourselves to enter history. The same is happening today. New factors represented by the third-world nations are claiming their share of and presence in the world political space. This is why the Panama Congress is an important lesson.\n110.\tAt present there is some defeatism and frustration in the process of the negotiations for disarmament. One cannot be unaware that it is a singularly delicate, complex and difficult subject. But there can be no doubt that this problem is vital and cannot be abandoned. We, the developing nations, stand to lose a great deal because of the increasingly definite tendency to augment world weapons. It is not only the great Powers which could be affected by the arms race. The battlefield in our days is not on the soil of the developed countries. The nature and scope of conflicts have changed substantially. This is why disarmament is not a conventional subject which can be dealt with separately, a subject of interest to some countries and not to others. Not only is it the corner-stone of world order but the question of security is an integral one affecting the entire planet. It would be impossible to conceive of conflicts or confrontations which are not linked to areas elsewhere. World stability is also an integral concept. Disrupting factors can exercise influence and have effects on the most remote sites from the place of origin. We must learn the lesson early: limited conflicts become less and less limited; they inevitably tend to become confrontations at different latitudes.\n111.\tArms expenditures must be looked at carefully. There tends to be a growing disproportion between the means of a country and its outlays for weapons. In this respect all I need to do is to recall the dramatic figures quoted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization. He said:\n\\\"... while the world spends approximately $300 billion a year on armaments, the net flow of official development assistance amounts to some $15 billion a year. Resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the 1976 gross national product of the entire world.\\\" [A/31/1/Add. 1, sect. V.J\n112.\tMy country's Government is concerned at the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The existing treaties have not been fully subscribed to and it is disturbing to note that the provision of nuclear installations for peaceful purposes can be converted to the use of nuclear energy for war purposes. It is unacceptable that such situations should be beyond the reach of international control; they must not spread the risks which now tend to proliferate.\n113.\tDefeatism and, to a lesser degree, the skepticism which may now be felt in world public opinion regarding United Nations action, are caused in part by the growing violence which is developing. Growing violence at the domestic level of States can be fought only with inter-national measures. Crime has become organized on so vast a scale that it is inconceivable to think that exclusively national provisions, which end at the domestic level, can be enough. International measures will of necessity have to be adopted against organized crime. A singular form of this violence is the kidnapping of, and threats against, persons. The Presidents of Venezuela and Colombia emphasized at a meeting held at the end of last year the importance that United Nations action would have in this respect. The subject has been discussed for some time in the Organization. But now the time has come not to postpone further a program of concrete realizations which will enable joint action to be taken that will paralyze or demolish the rise of violence. Private action by Governments, co-ordination and intercommunication among States could go a long way in this direction. However, beyond ail that, what is required is an international conviction that violence does not deserve respect, regardless of its sponsorship or its inspiration-a conviction that no way of death represents life; that it is untrue that freedom is won by death; it is won with life. World insecurity must not increase and there is no country, whatever its political or social system, which is free from this risk.\n114.\tIt is only the international community which can combat violence. It is time, therefore, to know and to be convinced that the global nature of certain problems means that it is only the international community which can deal with them. And that is why my country and Government condemn any form of violence, whoever inspires it and from whatever source it comes.\n115.\tViolence can be fought if all States begin by adopting the necessary internal measures. In that respect, it is inadmissible for peoples to be denied the legitimate right to self-determination and independence, as well as the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. A threat or act of violence which endangers innocent human lives, or causes the loss of human life, jeopardizes fundamental freedoms and is an offense to the dignity of every nation. Physical injury, assassination, torture, the taking of hostages: all these are acts incompatible with the legitimacy of the international order.\n116.\tPerhaps the world has been too indifferent to the means of the international community. We must start with the conviction that the United Nations constitutes a viable organization that is impossible without the faith in the prospects and means of the international community which the United Nations represents.\n117.\tThe effectiveness of the United Nations depends, not on practical deeds alone, but also on confidence in man's possibilities. There will be measures which can be implemented within a short time; others will take more time. But here, as in other matters,-what is important is to begin. The question of violence is not a theological or a metaphysical problem. It is a complex question, built up by diverse inducements and sheltered in distinct and heterogeneous justifications assuming actions which, however, can be met with other actions. Violence cannot be curbed unless there is co-ordination among States.\n118.\tThe attitude and the firmness of the United Nations in the coming years will decide its destiny. The arithmetical growth of this Organization is of extraordinary significance. As I said earlier, it is not merely a question of an increase in the numerical volume of the Organization's Members and components. It is something more than that. It is a qualitative transformation of the world order. The political space of the world has grown. That is an extraordinary historical circumstance which should be taken advantage of, in a positive sense, to build and not to destroy, to make life on our planet fuller and more complete, to make its resources more usable.\n119.\tOuter-space technology is making ancient flights of fancy or legendary illusions likely to become real. In practical terms interplanetary flights are opening prospects whose consequences cannot be assessed at the moment. However, there is no doubt that, whatever may be the characteristics of outer space, it offers alternatives of various kinds which will mean unifying concepts, principles and rules of conduct on a planetary scale.\n120.\tThat fact gives the measure of the worth, the importance of the United Nations, because this planet must in the future conduct itself as one unit, conscious of its position in space but as yet unable to perceive the choices which this situation may offer.\n121.\tEverything implies the improvement of the United Nations. Yet this is not a rhetorical question. To consider it in whimsical and superficial terms would not solve any problems; rather, it would aggravate all of them. Changes in the structure of the Organization, without any knowledge of where they would lead, would be more hazardous. The Organization must acquire the face of an adult, showing the level of maturity of the international order.\n122.\tThat leads me to another problem of paramount importance: the credibility of the United Nations. It is in an atmosphere of uplifting thought and lofty serenity that complaints ought to be aired, just as opposite points of view ought to be set forth in a climate of constructive and edifying moderation, however firm and vigorous the positions taken might be.\n123.\tWe would not get very far if the resolutions adopted were left unimplemented, to become part of a lengthy compendium of frustrations which, far from clearing the horizon, would disturb and darken it. United Nations resolutions which are not complied with will destroy the Organization's credibility, its seriousness and its future.\n124.\tThe international order is inseparable from an ethical system of conduct. And it will be necessary to insist on this time and time again because we would otherwise forget that life among nations, like life among men, is nourished by one s values. Practical action is also sustained by values. It is only in so far as, and to the extent that, the United Nations acts in accord with the basic values of human conduct that its strength and respectability will increase.\n125.\tLately the discussion of and quest for peaceful ways of coexistence have brought about a sounder inter-relationship between the West and the East. The ideological dispute, without having lost its original basic importance, has allowed for a more rational exchange of goods, services and technology, which can bring about an atmosphere propitious to a more sound understanding in international relations. The legitimacy of East-West relations is perhaps no longer in doubt in any intellectually and politically responsible sector. This seems to be the final cancellation of the simplistic slogans prevailing at the time of the cold war, which reduced the world to a futile and permanent confrontation between models much inclined to abstraction and ambiguity. The cold war was identified with elementary motivations and a priori judgments, all of which narrowed prospects and fields of vision and reduced opportunities for reciprocal understanding.\n126.\tThe new East-West relationship, now expressed in terms of detente, with sights set more concretely on peace, offers greater opportunities, not only for the legitimacy of the international order, but also for the width of the political space of the world.\n127.\tThe stability of the world order, once East-West relations are rationalized, must be completed by having the third world join in.\n128.\tThe historical significance of the generic name \\\"third world\\\" assumes the coming together of countries, societies and nations which are distant and distinct, willing to agree, despite their essential diversity, in seeking a political and historical level which will bring them into the active context of international relations. The world order cannot be governed by a club of countries with economic, military or political power that excludes all others; rather, it must be governed by a total and universal consensus expressed through the United Nations.\n129.\tIt is a mistake to think that the historical prospects of the third world end solely with the attainment of goals to correct economic injustices. There is no doubt that the revision of the international economic order is an initial 56\ntarget in the rectification of the prevailing arrangements. But it would be a grievous error to reduce the question of world balance to simple economic terms. It is not only a matter of the value of natural resources and raw materials. At times there apparently predominates a tendency to consider that the only claim of the developing countries is better prices for their products. That is a basic issue, no doubt, but it is not the only one. There are other still broader issues the implications of which are no less fundamental, and they concern political participation.\n130.\tAs regards economic development, the tendency to attribute value only to primary commodities might lend one to think that the countries of the third world have no right to industrialization and nor should they think of it. According to this line of thinking, the developing countries would at best be the suppliers of the products which industrial societies need to set in motion the world economic machinery. In fact, the value attributed to natural resources is a factor which has its complement in the economic processes inherent in harmonious and integral development, to which all countries are entitled. Simplification of this concept would bring harmful consequences which must be rejected in advance.\n131.\tAs regards the international economic order, there is a question with dramatic implications, How many benefit from the present international economic order? The international economic order has so far been based on the exploitation of the poor nations. The transnational corporations have not offered a valid response to the problems of the developing countries. Seeking a more rational balance in what they can contribute with know-how and technology is an essential task for the immediate future. Prior to that we shall have to know the direction economic activity is to take. Will it be exploitation or development? In terms of exploitation, there can be no international dialog. It is not proof of great skill for prosperity and profits to be based on exploitation. In developmental terms, a dialog is possible, but not without a previous definition of what development is, what it is looking for, what it consists in and who it is to benefit.\n132.\tThe power of poor nations has increased, and their arguments have acquired value not only because they are just but also because they are strong. The experience of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has proved the negotiating power of nations producing natural re-sources. Negotiating power, by nature and by definition, is a peaceful, conciliatory means, one of co-operation.\n133.\tWe, the developing countries, know little about one another, the deficit in world information seriously hampers us, not only because the industrial societies are frequently unaware of our motivations and intentions, but also because the members of the large traditional family which today forms the area of solidarity called the third world lack the means to inform one another and to exchange messages of mutual understanding which would enable them to overcome differences in language, culture or historical background and to place ourselves at a high level of mutual, constant and dynamic communication. Misinformation, regardless of its causes, is harmful to all nations whether developed or undeveloped. World understanding is, inter alia, information.\n134.\tAll this enhances the role and the importance of the United Nations. The distribution of world political power and the management of world wealth are a joint responsibility of all nations. We must hold very strongly to our faith but we must also remain very rational in any opportunities for understanding we may obtain through the United Nations.\n135.\tVenezuela attaches great importance to the United Nations. As proof of this and of our faith in peace and international understanding, President Carlos Andre's Perez will shortly visit the United Nations. Venezuela is nourished by the values which gave birth to the United Nations. With his visit and his presence in this forum, the President of Venezuela expresses our position as a democratic country with a constructive international policy.\n136.\tThe United Nations faces, among others, a fundamental challenge: the use often resources of the mind. This means that we have not yet exploited in the world that natural force which is not always renewable-to wit, the capacity of human beings to be rational.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me first to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The respect you have already earned as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, where you have shown both wisdom and statesmanship, certainly gives good promise for your success as President of the current session of the General Assembly.\n74.\tMay I also express our profound thanks and appreciation to our former President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who discharged his heavy responsibilities as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly with his well-known tact and skill.\n75.\tLet me also at the outset express my respect and that of my delegation for the determined and unselfish efforts made by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim and his staff in order to implement the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. I suspect that few positions demand as muck patience and perseverance. The Secretary-General has amply demonstrated both these qualities during the years he has served in his important post. I hope that he will make his services available to this Organization for many years to come.\n76.\tWe are very happy to welcome the Republic of Seychelles as a new Member of the United Nations and we look forward to its co-operation and contribution to the work of our Organization.\n77.\tA continuous effort is being made by the United Nations to attain its main goal of securing peace in the world. More than three decades have elapsed since the end of the Second World War without a disaster of comparable magnitude. However, peace efforts have in the same period of time met many defeats in almost all parts of the world and in many places uncertainty still reigns. This is of grave concern to us all and shows that the nations of the world must put in greater effort than ever before.\n78.\tAt times the blame for this situation is placed on our Organization-the United Nations. Indeed, the United Nations has its limitations, but the fact remains that no organization is greater than the individual members that compose it. Therefore, when in the years to come we continue our efforts to improve the world situation, each must look closely at himself. If no Member of the United Nations neglects to do so, and if chauvinism and suspicion are set aside in international relations, the problems now being dealt with, some of which have been on the agenda for decades, will certainly be solved more easily.\n79.\tThe increasing arms race in the world is a matter of concern everywhere. I feel certain that those present here today agree with the opinion which Secretary-General Waldheim recently expressed that the arms race is among the world's most critical problems. The great arsenals of nuclear, chemical and conventional arms are terrifying and increasing every year. I am informed that international arms sales now total about $20 billion a year, not counting what nations produce for what they consider necessary for their own needs, which amounts to a far greater sum.\n80.\tThis international traffic in armaments clearly demonstrates that weapons continue to be spread around the world and that new markets for weapons have opened up in parts of the world where none existed before. The increasing seriousness of these matters should encourage nations to make greater efforts to find means to guarantee their security and at the same time to reduce arsenals. Iceland, as is well known, has no armed forces of its own and Icelanders do not carry weapons. We sincerely hope that those who are not so fortunate will some day be able to share our position. It is essential to reduce the nuclear arms arsenals, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms and to stop nuclear testing. The production and use of many other modern weapons, among them biological and chemical weapons, should be halted immediately. This, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important task of the United Nations today.\n81.\tA reduction in arms production would make enormous resources available for nobler goals, for example, to improve the conditions of life in developing countries. Although some progress has been made in this respect in the past few years, greater efforts are still needed.\n82.\tWe must work towards economic justice in the world as well as increased social and political freedom. In this connexion it is gratifying to see the progress which has been made by the World Food Program, and the United Nations deserves praise for the recent Habitat Conference, which will, it is hoped, benefit developed and developing nations alike.\n83.\tSteady and important progress has been made during the past three decades as far as the solution of colonial and racial issues is concerned. However, the problems that remain are very acute. The situation in southern Africa is more serious than ever and no one can foresee the consequences if white minority governments in the area do not alter their policy. The Government of South Africa still uses brutal methods to deny basic human rights to black Africans. The same is true of Southern Rhodesia, Where the actions of the white minority Government day by day make the situation more dangerous. The latest efforts to find a peaceful settlement must succeed, and it is to be hoped that the parties involved will let reason govern. All foreign military intervention would be a serious threat to world peace and should be avoided by all means. In the same sense, the Namibia question will, it is hoped, be settled to the full satisfaction of its people.\n84.\tIn that connexion I wish to stress that the United Nations should be constantly vigilant against mistreatment of minorities all over the world.\n85.\tThe full attainment of human rights in the world is an ever important issue. The International Covenants on Human Rights are a remarkable accomplishment, but further steps must be taken in the field of human rights, and all proposals which would enhance the efforts of the United Nations should be carefully studied and implemented.\n86.\tInternational terrorism and the hijacking of innocent men, women and children is a problem which touches all nations of the world. These acts are blatantly contrary to rational human behavior. All Member nations of the United Nations should join together in condemning international terrorism and hijackings and should obligate themselves to bring to justice all persons who commit such acts.\n87.\tA new war zone has opened up in the Middle East. It is indeed sad to see the peaceful land of Lebanon turn into a battlefield where none is spared. The situation in other areas of that part of the world is still a matter of grave concern. All possible efforts should be made to find a lasting and just peace in that area, and my Government reiterates its position that the basis for accommodation should be Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973). The sovereignty of all States must be respected, as well as their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, and the national rights of the Palestinians must be given recognition.\n88.\tWe have lately been witnessing ominous signs of heightened tension in the Korean peninsula. The Korean problem continues to pose a serious threat to the maintenance of peace and security in the area. The joint communique of 1972 agreed on by the two Korean States raised hopes for a peaceful reunification of Korea through negotiations. These negotiations were started but now remain suspended. The two Korean Governments should be urged to resume their dialog. In ,the view of my Government such direct negotiations are an essential prerequisite for a peaceful settlement and the reunification of Korea. My Government is greatly satisfied that the proposed agenda items on the Korean question have been withdrawn; that raises hopes that some progress is in sight.\n89.\tThe Secretary-General has continued his mission to conduct negotiations between the representatives of the two communities in Cyprus. In spite of determined efforts by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in Cyprus, progress has lately been limited. We are convinced, however, that negotiations between the two communities, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, must continue since they constitute in the present circumstances the only real hope for a just solution. The General Assembly is obliged to work for maintaining the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus plays a vital role in facilitating a settlement, and again amply proves the value of the peace-keeping forces.\n90.\tAgain I wish to declare Iceland's full support of the rule of universality concerning membership of the United Nations. The Icelandic delegation will vote against any draft resolution designed to prevent a nation or nations from participating in the work of the United Nations if they are entitled to do so on the basis of the Charter. Furthermore, we oppose the use of the specialized agencies of the United Nations as a base for political debates and believe that these agencies should be permitted to carry out their professional functions free of political bias.\n91.\tThe fifth session of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, over which President Amerasinghe so eminently presided, concluded its work a few days ago. The task of the Conference was not fully accomplished and the sixth session will be convened in New York on 23 May 1977. Whether that session will be successful in concluding its substantive work cannot be predicted at this moment. It is, however, clear that the most important unsolved issues are in the field of the international sea-bed area. It is therefore urgently required that priority should be given to those problems at the next session and also that all possible progress be facilitated through intersessional work. Indeed, that procedure was emphasized by the President at the last meeting of the fifth session, on 17 September. If such a procedure is followed, the next session should be able to make considerable progress towards the completion of the work of the Conference.\n92.\tIn the meantime, it is a source of satisfaction that the Conference has succeeded in bringing about substantive agreement in many other areas. Thus, a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles and an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 nautical miles have the support of the overwhelming majority of the States participating in the Conference. The inclusion of these concepts into an overall convention on the law of the sea has for some time been more of a formality than a matter, of substance. The exclusive economic zone is here to stay and there can be no turning back. That in itself is a tremendous achievement, upon which the Conference is to be congratulated, and I do not hesitate to offer my Government's congratulations in that connexion. We must all realize that the Conference has been entrusted with a formidable task, and even if less progress is made in some areas than in others that does not at all mean that the Conference is a failure. On the contrary, what has already been accomplished is of great value, and we have to show patience with regard to the rest. With an adequate mandate from our Governments the delegations at the next session should be able to proceed along the lines envisaged by the President of the Conference and bring the task to a successful conclusion in the near future.\n93. Many of the representatives here assembled may be aware of the fact that from the very beginning of the settlement of Iceland 1100 years ago, the history of the nation was kept in recorded annals. In these old annals many things are found which might apply to those who are present here today. Human nature, after all, has not changed very much through the ages in spite of so-called progress.\n94.\tOne of these old sagas relates that once a renowned hero was engaged in a battle against many of his enemies. He was supported only by one other man, who stood behind him and defended him from attacks coming from that direction. When he was later asked how this man had helped him, he replied with the following sentence, which ever since has been preserved in the hearts and language of the Icelandic people: \\\"Bare is the back of him who has no brother\\\".\n95.\tI want to say in conclusion that participation in the work of the United Nations has been the corner-stone of Icelandic foreign policy for the past 30 years. That policy will remain intact, because we should all realize and in particular those who are small and weak-that \\\"Bare is the back of him who has no brother\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that as an eminent representative of friendly and non-aligned Sri Lanka, he will, with his vast experience and dedication to the United Nations, greatly contribute to the successful work of this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n265.\tI welcome the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations, which constitutes a further step towards the realization of the principle of universality.\n266.\tThe present session is being held in a crucial period characterized by an irreversible process of democratization of international relations. No nation is any longer willing to let others take decisions bearing on its fate, nor to reconcile itself to anyone's monopoly of decision-making concerning major issues affecting the international community. The peoples of the world are no longer satisfied with merely identifying and defining problems, but demand their substantive solution as well.\n267.\tWe can be successful only if we firmly orient ourselves towards taking decisions and formulating guidelines that will be in keeping with these demands.\n268.\tThe United Nations has obtained significant results in consolidating peace and security in the world; it has achieved decisive successes in eradicating the system of colonialism and it has made great strides forward in creating conditions for the development of co-operation among peoples and States based on a footing of equality and in the solving of other pressing international problems. The Organization has almost reached universality, even though Viet Nam and Angola, notwithstanding the widest support, continue to be unjustly prevented from admission to membership in the United Nations. This session of the General Assembly should declare itself emphatically in favor of the admission to the United Nations of these two countries, whose peoples have by their heroic struggle for freedom and independence deserved well of mankind and made an invaluable contribution to the principles towards the realization of which the United Nations is striving. Today the United Nations is engaged in an historical mission of changing the existing inequitable international relations and building new international political relationships and the new international economic order.\n269.\tThe United Nations is still faced with the very strong resistance of forces striving to preserve inequitable relations by all means. Attempts at bypassing or ignoring the world Organization continue to be made, while the right of veto is abused with a view to blocking even actions that enjoy the broadest support of the international community. We also witness attempts to discredit in various ways the United Nations in the eyes of one's own public opinion or to extend to it only declaratory or verbal support.\n270.\tThe basic question today is in what way to ensure the translation into practice of the decisions of the United Nations, since nothing is so damaging to the role of the United Nations as disrespect for, or the flouting of, the decisions adopted by our Organization.\n271.\tThe Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo stressed the importance of the role of the United Nations and strongly emphasized the demand to initiate without delay direct and concrete actions and measures aimed at resolving the pressing and most important problems facing mankind by relying first and foremost on the United Nations.\n272.\tThe salient feature of the period following last year's session is an ever sharper discrepancy between profound changes in the world and the obsolete system of international relations.\n273.\tSignificant steps forward have been made in the sense of relaxation of international tensions; nevertheless, peace and security are not yet within the reach of all peoples. Of particular concern is the fact that, in spite of numerous negotiations on disarmament, the arms race not only is being accelerated, but is also being extended to other regions of the world, engulfing an ever larger number of countries. In the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, hegemony and all other forms of foreign domination and against the use of force and coercion, great historic victories and successes have been achieved, but even today many countries and peoples are forced to defend, at the cost of great sacrifices, their right to self-determination, independence and freedom. Many countries are still subjected to continued actions of pressure, outside interference in their internal affairs, the undermining and breaking up of their political and national unity and territorial integrity-all this for the purpose of imposing new forms of dependence, patterns of internal development, changes in foreign policy orientation and a slowing down of the economic and political emancipation of countries. In the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on crises and hotbeds of conflict, we have adopted principles for their solution. However, these resolutions are not being implemented, while many crises are being exacerbated and new ones created.\n274.\tThe international community as a whole has recognized that the existing international economic relations are untenable and that the situation of developing countries is becoming ever more difficult. Nevertheless, there is no substantive progress in the direction of changing these relations or creating conditions for the more rapid development and prosperity of developing countries. On the basis of the decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the action for the establishment of the new international economic order, along with the increased solidarity of developing countries and their readiness to achieve progress through negotiations, has continued to make progress, as evidenced by the Conferences in Manila, Nairobi and Colombo. This action, however, has not met with adequate readiness on the part of some of the most developed countries to proceed to the undertaking of concrete measures. Instead, attempts are being made to solve problems of universal interest at meetings of a narrower circle of countries with a view to preserving inherited privileges.\n275.\tThe Colombo Conference adopted decisions of far- reaching importance, decisions which provide a strong incentive and a basis for the United Nations to proceed resolutely along the road leading to the establishment of new, equitable international relations [see A/31/197J. The Conference has strengthened non-alignment as an independent global factor of international relations, firmly resolved to continue the struggle for changing the world through equitable co-operation with all international factors willing to engage in such action. Critical remarks about so-called \\\"aligned non-alignment\\\" or expectations that non-aligned should become an appendage of someone else's policy are absurd and pointless. The non-aligned movement has never been uncommitted or neutral on questions of peace, the liberation of peoples, the defense of the independence, security and unhampered development of every country, resistance to the policy of blocs and division into spheres of influence, and opposition to every form of aggression and domination. As President Tito stated in Colombo:\n\\\"Non-alignment has, indeed, become a world policy today because it proceeds from the integral interests of the world and because it strives for universal solutions, under conditions when ideological and many other divisions are still a reality.\\\"\n276.\tThe non-aligned countries will continue to engage in constructive co-operation wherever this is possible, and we hope that other international factors too will respond to such co-operation based on equality.\n277.\tMy country has always pledged itself, even during the most difficult days of the cold war and block confrontation, to genuine relaxation of international tensions. As early as the Belgrade Conference in 1961, the non- aligned countries came out resolutely in favor of a relaxation of international tensions and negotiations between the great Powers. However, we must observe that we are actually still in the initial phase of such a process, which has remained limited both geographically and in substance, because contrary tendencies towards rivalry and the exacerbation of existing crises and the provoking of new ones continue to gain strength in many regions of the world.\n278.\tThe relaxation of tensions has neither embraced all areas of international relations nor led to the solution of \nkey international issues. To be for or against a relaxation of tensions: that presents no dilemma to us. What we are concerned with is what the term actually stands for. If dStente is to be understood as a synonym for relations among the great Powers and blocs or as an easing of tensions in restricted areas only, then it becomes understandable why non-aligned countries cannot accept it as a basis of peaceful coexistence or of lasting peace for all countries and peoples. Only a universal relaxation of international tensions-with the participation of all countries on the basis of equality in coping with problems of general interest and in the spirit of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence, rather than bloc rivalries, arms race and struggle for spheres of influence can bring about a radical change in the international situation and the elimination of aggression or the use of force and every form of foreign domination from international life.\n279.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is one of the most important achievements in the relaxation of international tensions however, its decisions are being implemented slowly and are meeting with obvious difficulties,\n280.\tNext year Yugoslavia will act as host for the first follow-up meeting of the representatives of the countries participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held in Helsinki. We believe that the first follow-up meeting will afford a favorable occasion not only for reviewing the extent to which the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference has been implemented, but also for exerting efforts for its comprehensive application and for encouraging further promotion of intra-European co-operation. In that respect, special attention should be paid to the necessity of making a positive contribution to the settlement of problems in regions in the immediate proximity of Europe, in particular in the Mediterranean, as well as to the solving of problems of development, decolonization, disarmament and other issues of interest to the whole world.\n281.\tProgress in the relaxation of tensions will depend on when and how the Middle East crisis will be dealt with, when colonialism in southern Africa and in other remaining colonial enclaves will be terminated, how quickly we shall advance towards a peaceful reunification of Korea, when progress towards the solution of the Cyprus crisis will at last be made, when the Indian Ocean will be transformed into a zone of peace, when and how outstanding problems in the region of Latin America will be solved and how other problems will be handled-that is, problems whose solution is sought by the peoples fighting against all forms of dependence and subjugation, for independence, unimpeded development and equality. Whether any advance will be made with regard to the question of halting the arms race and resolving disarmament problems, whether an end will be put to pressures and interference in the internal affairs of individual countries, whether the urgent solution of international economic problems will be approached in a fully responsible manner through the building up of the new international economic order-all this is of crucial importance to the easing of international tensions.\n282.\tThe Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries, recently held in Colombo, adapted clear positions on all those matters. My country participated actively in the adoption of those decisions and will strive for their implementation, since non-alignment constitutes its national foreign policy, which it has been pursuing consistently.\n283.\tThe Middle East crisis has been further aggravated primarily because of the developments in Lebanon, which are being exploited by Israel to prolong its occupation of Arab territories and to delay the solution of the crisis, at the core of which is the Palestinian problem. The responsibility for such a state of affairs rests both with Israel and with those forces which make it possible for Israel to behave in such a manner.\n284.\tThe General Assembly has on several occasions reasserted the principles constituting the basis for a lasting and just settlement of the crisis and has, in particular, supported the realization of the national rights of the Palestinian people and the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, its sole legitimate representative, in all phases of settlement. We feel that the resolution of the non-aligned and other countries of last January  - which obtained wide support in the Security Council but was regrettably vetoed-constitutes the most acceptable platform for further actions in seeking a way out of the crisis. At the current session of the General Assembly a further step should be taken towards an early solution of the Middle East crisis. It is high time for the Palestinian people, whose fate has become a matter of conscience for mankind, to achieve its rights as other peoples have done and to establish a State of its own. No lasting solution of the Middle East crisis is possible, nor can the independence and security of all peoples and States of the region be ensured, unless those rights are achieved.\n285.\tThe successes of the liberation movements of Namibia and Zimbabwe, the growing wave of demonstrations, resistance and the struggle of the African majority in South Africa itself, and ever widening international pressure demonstrate that the day is not distant when these last strongholds of colonialism, racism and apartheid will be eliminated, At the same time the South African colonialists and racists, relying on foreign military and economic assistance, do not hesitate to resort to the most ruthless terror against the African population and are attempting in various ways, such as \\\"bantustanization\\\", to prevent the liberation of these countries, to break up their unity and to deceive world public opinion. We consider that the United Nations should denounce all such attempts most resolutely and should do everything in its power to compel South Africa to comply with the decisions of the United Nations as soon as possible.\n286.\tA complete and unconditional withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia, which should finally attain its independence, should be carried out without delay. The United Nations, which has the obligation to take care of the interests of Namibia until it attains independence, should lend maximum assistance to the people of Namibia in its struggle for independence.\n287.\tIn Zimbabwe power must be transferred to the African majority. The United Nations should take concrete measures and, in particular, extend effective support to liberation movements in southern Africa in order to help them to accelerate the process of the attainment of the objectives of their just struggle. We hope that even those Western countries which are still providing extensive support to the racist regime in South Africa will finally come to realize that their true interests cannot be opposed to the yearnings of the whole of independent and free Africa, which is bent on eradicating colonialism and racism from African soil.\n288.\tMy country is also deeply interested in the solution of the Cyprus crisis as early as possible and feels that it is high time for measures to be taken for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX). My country fully supports the continuation on an equal footing of negotiations between the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish- Cypriot communities under the auspices of the United Nations as well as the preservation of the territorial integrity and independence of non-aligned Cyprus.\n289.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Helsinki and the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo devoted due attention to the problem of the Mediterranean in the context of strengthening peace and co-operation in that region and in the world. As a Mediterranean country, Yugoslavia is vitally interested in seeing started the implementation of the documents on the Mediterranean adopted by those important conferences. We feel that the moment has come for the United Nations too to give consideration to the question of transforming the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and co-operation, since today the Mediterranean is an area of grave international tension and of great, acute and potential dangers to peace in the world, a region where the process of detente is not yet felt.\n290.\tThe situation in Korea constitutes a dangerous focus of tension. The United Nations should act more resolutely towards securing the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea, the dismantling of foreign military bases, the dissolution of the United Nations Command and the replacement of the Korean Military Armistice Agreement by a lasting peace treaty and towards enabling the people of North and South Korea to effect a peaceful reunification of Korea on the basis of the joint North-South communique of 4 July 1972. \n291.\tThe efforts exerted by the United Nations and the results so far achieved in the field of disarmament are so modest that we cannot be satisfied with them. Yugoslavia, like the other non-aligned countries, has for years been drawing attention to the ever more serious and dramatic situation created as a result of the failure to solve essential problems of disarmament. Durable peace cannot be safeguarded on the basis of a balance of power and of blocs as central factors of security. Moreover, the influence of the world Organization in this sphere of the settlement of the disarmament problem has been diminished, while this question is being gradually withdrawn from the competence of the United Nations. Even the initiative for convening a world disarmament conference has met with almost insurmountable difficulties in spite of the broad support it commands.\n292.\tIn such a situation the non-aligned countries at the Fifth Conference in Colombo launched an initiative for convening not later than 1978 a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to disarmament [see A/31/197, annex I, para. 139], convinced that it would thereby be possible to provide fresh impulses and to open up new prospects for a genuine solution of priority disarmament problems, such as the banning of the use, production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, the reduction and halting of the race in conventional armaments, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the elimination of foreign military bases from foreign territories as well as the undertaking of other measures designed to contribute to the reinforcement of peace and security in the world. We are profoundly convinced that a thoroughly prepared special session devoted to disarmament would contribute to the broadest involvement of the international community and of all States in this field. Hence we feel that during the present session a decision should be adopted on the convening of a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1978 so that preparatory work may commence as soon as possible.\n293.\tIt is quite certain that there is general agreement today on the need for a complete restructuring of the entire system of international economic relations regardless of the differences of position and the difficulties encountered in this sphere.\n294.\tThe international community has embarked irreversibly on the road of the establishment of the new international economic order, which represents an important gain in the ineluctable process of the democratization of international relations on the basis of equality and respect for the interests of all countries. Our principal task at present is to proceed, on the bases we have jointly laid down, to the adoption of such measures and actions as will enable us to make further progress in implementing the decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions.\n295.\tI should like to emphasize that constructive negotiations are one thing while attempts at using them as a pretext for perpetuating existing relations are another. The developing countries cannot accept further delays in finding adequate solutions to the individual problems facing them, If it becomes evident that the negotiations do not serve their purpose, the developing countries will be compelled to re-examine their positions regarding the ways and means of solving international economic problems.\n296.\tThe establishment of the new international economic order to which the Colombo Conference devoted exceptional attention is of the highest political importance and should be dealt with as a top-priority question at the present session of the General Assembly. A clear distinction must be made between the objectives to be reached through negotiations and the instruments and mechanisms through which these objectives should be attained. Developing countries, for example, are prepared to discuss no longer the need to protect their purchasing power on the basis of their raw-material exports, but only how and in what way this should be achieved, This session of the General Assembly should reach political decisions on these and other objectives and thereby contribute to the overcoming of difficulties in all current negotiations, particularly those within UNCTAD and at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n297.\tIt is very important to ensure the implementation of the consensus reached at the fourth session of UNCTAD regarding the fulfillment of the integrated program for the settlement of raw materials problems, as well as regarding the external debts of developing countries.\n298.\tThe continuation of negotiations at the Paris Conference is a sign of a growing sense of responsibility on the part of its participants for the fate of these negotiations. However, the success of the Conference will depend on the political will to arrive at agreed solutions.\n299.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] was formulated in essentially different conditions. Therefore, preparations should already be started for elaborating the international development strategy for the third United Nations development decade, with a view to having it entirely geared towards support for the establishment of the new international economic order.\n300.\tFor further accelerated development it is indispensable that the developing countries should rely increasingly, and above all, upon their own individual and collective forces. With this purpose in mind, these countries are taking important initiatives for the development of mutual economic co-operation.\n301.\tWe attribute great importance to the safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are a component of the struggle for the elimination of all forms of dependence, exploitation and foreign domination. Human rights cannot be exercised in conditions of the use of force, the persistence of colonialism and neocolonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid, as is best illustrated by the situation in southern Africa, in Chile, in the occupied Arab territories and elsewhere.\n302.\tThe protection of individual human rights in inseparable from that of the rights of peoples to self-determination, freedom, independence and sovereign economic and social development, since an individual may exercise his rights only as a member of a broader community. This applies also to the rights of persons belonging to ethnic, national, religious or linguistic minorities whose members, according to article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex]:\n\\\"... shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language\\\".\nIn view of the frequent occurrence of non-respect for the rights of minorities, which cannot but affect relations among States and peoples, it is our opinion that the United Nations should devote due attention to this problem also, and undertake a detailed formulation of the obligations of States with the aim of adopting an international instrument for the protection of the rights, and promotion of the status, of minorities. The United Nations would thus make an important new contribution to the consolidation of peaceful coexistence, co-operation and rapprochement among States and peoples.\n303.\tThe entry into force of the International Covenants on Human Rights constitutes a success for the international community and provides the basis and framework for a more comprehensive treatment and a more effective implementation of human rights. However, all States should accede to these Covenants so as to ensure their universal application.\n304.\tThe numerous and complex tasks facing this session of the General Assembly show how great and difficult our obligations are. However, we can be fully confident of the capability of our Organization to stand up to them since, in this respect, it enjoys the support of the overwhelming majority of mankind. We can only feel encouraged by the fact that countries and peoples wishing to take a direct part in, and to make their concrete contribution to, the progressive development of the international community have become exceptionally active. Without underestimating all the difficulties, we must not allow the existing opportunities to be wasted and the trust we enjoy betrayed.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Hungarian delegation, may I whole-heartedly congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his election as President of the General Assembly during its thirty-first session. I am pleased to see this high post occupied by the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka, a country with which Hungary maintains friendly relations and which has recently acted as host to the Fifth Conference of non- aligned countries.\n62.\tMay I welcome, on behalf of my Government, the representative of the Republic of Seychelles on the occasion of his country's admission to membership in the United Nations. We wish this young State success in its pursuits within our world Organization.\n63.\tToday it is clearly realized by all that the practical implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence and the extension of detente create favorable conditions for social progress and peaceful construction, while increasing trust among peoples. That is why the foreign policy initiatives of the socialist community are directed towards extending the process of detente and making it irreversible. The proposals of the socialist countries, particularly of the Soviet Union, give constant impetus to the struggle for peace, security and fruitful international co-operation.\n64.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, like those of the other countries of the socialist community, actively contributes its part in joint efforts for the strengthening of peace and security and for developing co-operation among peoples and . nations as well as in further developing detente. Lasting peace and stable security are the central goal of our foreign policy. We are convinced that this policy is, at the same time, fully in keeping with the vital interests of the Hungarian people.\n65.\tThe development of bilateral relations between socialist and capitalist countries is of great importance to the strengthening of peace and security. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic has already done a great deal in this domain. We have wide-ranging political, economic and cultural relations with capitalist countries. Exchanges of visits by statesmen are frequent. The ex-change of goods and co-operation in the field of industry are widening in scope. We have accomplished a great deal towards enabling our people to become acquainted with the true cultural values of the countries in Western Europe and North America. The development of personal contacts between peoples is greatly facilitated by our flexible practice in the granting of visas. In 1975 our country, with a population of 10 million, was visited by more than 9 million foreigners. In the spirit of the 10 principles endorsed in Helsinki at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe we stand ready to develop interstate relations with other countries, broaden the scope of political, economic and cultural co-operation, improve the exchange of information and widen human contacts.\n66.\tWhen we speak of progress made in the cause of peace and security we must not overlook the fact that the adversaries of detente in certain Western countries have recently come to intensify their efforts, casting absurd slanders at the socialist countries, blaming detente for specific political and economic, problems in their own countries, coming forward with trumped-up \\\"problems\\\" and making renewed attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries. In a word, by using political means combined with propaganda campaigns, they are seeking to disturb the peaceful co-operation of countries with different social systems. There is mounting evidence that what the extremist circles are seeking is to destroy not only the results of the Helsinki Conference but detente in general.\n67.\tHere in the forum of the United Nations let me voice my conviction that those who support peace and inter-national co-operation will be able to thwart the attacks on peaceful coexistence, uphold the achievements of detente and create the conditions for further progress.\n68.\tDetente has emerged as the result of the joint activity of countries with different social systems. We are all aware of the outstanding role played in bringing this about by the joint efforts of the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States. We for our part are hopeful that this constructive co-operation will continue to prevail and will make it possible to achieve still more significant results.\n69.\tMy Government believes that in the period ahead we shall be faced with major international tasks, the accomplishment of which is likely to give a new impulse to the process of detente; tasks such as that of giving full effect to the provisions of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, achieving further results in tackling the problem of disarmament and liquidating the still existing hotbeds of crisis.\n70.\tThe year following the Helsinki Conference bears witness to the viability of the recommendations contained in the Final Act. That document reflects the contemporary reality in Europe and corresponds to the interests of the peoples living there. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic attaches great importance to the performance of tasks arising out of the Final Act. We are of the view that the provisions of the Helsinki document should be implemented in full, bearing in mind, of course, that the Final Act offers a long-term program to work for. We look on the Final Act as an organic whole and we are not prepared to accept a selective approach to its different parts. We find it essential that reciprocity should prevail in the application of the provisions of that document.\n71.\tThe provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe can be implemented most effectively in the framework of bilateral relations between the participating countries. Imbued with this spirit, we have presented concrete proposals to the Governments of many countries of Western Europe during the past, few months.\n72.\tMultilateral co-operation could be an important vehicle for the implementation of the Final Act. My Government agrees with the idea of holding congresses to discuss questions relating to environmental protection, transport and energy. The implementation of this Soviet proposal would considerably enhance the cause of pan-European co-operation. Similarly, we actively support efforts to establish an institutional framework for relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community.\n73.\tWe consider that the consultative meeting to be held in Belgrade next year will be an important landmark in the promotion of peaceful co-operation in Europe. That meeting, should, in our view, be prepared in such a way as to allow it to accomplish constructive work, strengthen mutual understanding and good relations among the participating countries and make for continued advancement in the implementation of the Final Act and the expansion of co-operation among the countries of Europe. My Government wishes to work in this spirit.\n74.\tThe requirements of international peace and security call for the extension of political detente to the military field as a matter of increasing urgency. Some steps have already been taken in this direction, but it is now time to make still greater progress.\n75.\tA central issue of present-day international life is that of curbing the arms race. Military and economic circles in some countries are exerting growing pressure on their Governments to keep military spending soaring, justifying this intention by phrases culled from the time of the \\\"cold war\\\". We believe the United Nations cannot remain inactive in the face of such developments.\n76.\tI should state that my Government fully shares the view, expressed by the Government of the Soviet Union in its memorandum of 28 September submitted to the General Assembly on ending the arms race and disarmament [Aj31/232]. We think that the implementation of the ideas contained in that memorandum would largely contribute to the solution of that important set of problems.\n77.\tThe Soviet-American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] are followed by the Hungarian Government with due attention. We hope that the conditions will soon emerge for reaching the SALT II agreement, which would exert an exceedingly positive influence on both the relations between the two great Powers involved and the international situation in general.\n78.\tIn the context of disarmament, reductions in military forces and armaments in Central Europe are a question of the greatest timeliness. The proposals of the Warsaw Treaty countries seek to ensure that none of the countries concerned will see its security prejudiced by a mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments and to preclude the possibility for either side to obtain unilateral military advantages. We hope that, instead of trying to gain unilateral advantages, the NATO countries will in future seek a mutually acceptable arrangement by engaging in an activity similar to that of the socialist countries.\n79.\tMy Government has warmly welcomed the Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes, signed between the Soviet Union and the United States of America last May. That is another step towards nuclear disarmament. The Soviet-French agreement on the prevention of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons\\\" is an added contribution to the reduction of international tensions. May I express my hope that similar agreements will be reached between all nuclear States?\n80.\tThe initiatives for the general and complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests equally enjoy the support of my Government. Such proposals and their implementation would serve to reduce the danger of nuclear war.\n81.\tWe welcome the fact that the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has drawn up a draft convention on the prohibition of military or other hostile uses of environmental modification techniques, and we are hopeful that it will be given final shape and be approved by the General Assembly at its present session.\n82.\tAs far back as the twenty-first session of the General Assembly in 1966, my country was one of the initiators of action to ban chemical weapons.' Today, with 10 years behind us, we believe the time has come to take a concrete stride towards the conclusion of a convention banning chemical weapons.\n83.\tMy Government places great emphasis on adoption of the Soviet draft agreement on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons [see resolution 3479(XXX), annex]. We are gratified to see a growing number of countries showing interest in having that problem solved.\n84.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic invariably favors the earliest possible convening of the World Disarmament Conference, but it would have no objection to such interim stages of the consideration of the problems of disarmament as the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on this question.\n85.\tReal headway in implementing the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, solving certain problems of disarmament and achieving still closer co-operation among peoples cannot be made unless the requirements of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems are met to the fullest in international relations. Therefore, my Government regards the non-use of force in international relations as being of outstanding importance. We are convinced that the adoption and practical implementation of the draft treaty submitted by the Soviet Union in its memorandum of 28 September would greatly increase confidence among peoples.\n86.\tThe acute hotbeds of tension in the proximity of our continent are a source of particular concern for the Hungarian people engaged in peaceful, creative work. The Middle East crisis, the tragic events in Lebanon and the delay in finding a solution to the Cyprus problem are all fraught with the danger of a broader conflict.\n87.\tThe liquidation of the Middle East crisis is a primary task to be solved in strengthening international peace and security. My Government deplores the increasing complexity of that situation.\n88.\tIt is now evident that secret talks, separate agreements, and the slackening of relations between the socialist community and the Arab States obstruct the achievement of a durable peace in the Middle East. The unilateral attempts have not achieved their publicly stated purpose of stabilizing the situation in the region. They have only resulted in the perpetuation of Israel's occupation of the Arab territories, the division of the Arab forces seeking a just settlement, the strengthening of the positions of Israel and its supporters, and the postponement of a solution to the crisis.\n89.\tMy Government maintains that a comprehensive settlement is possible only if the Israeli troops are withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied by aggression in 1967; if the rights of the Palestinian Arab people, including the right to establish a State of its own, are enforced; and, lastly, if the security of all States in the Middle East and the inviolability of their frontiers are guaranteed under international safeguards.\n90.\tMy Government is deeply concerned over the developments in the Lebanese crisis. The tremendous losses in human lives and the devastation in consequence of the armed clashes only play into the hands of the enemies of the Arab countries and the Palestinian Arab people. Further delay in having the situation settled is likely to conjure up the danger of an escalating conflict. We continue to hold that the Lebanese crisis can be solved only by the Lebanese themselves and that any foreign intervention cannot but aggravate the situation. My Government stands for preserving the territorial integrity of Lebanon.\n91.\tMy Government invariably supports guaranteeing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and eliminating all kinds of foreign intervention. We maintain that the internal problems of the island country are for the Cypriots alone to solve, taking account of the interests of the Greek and Turkish communities.\n92.\tTurning now to Asia, my delegation is pleased to note that the conditions for a lasting relaxation of tensions in that part of the world are gradually emerging. This process is largely enhanced by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which, established in July last, is a stable factor of peace and security in South-East Asia. Unfortunately, the admission of that country to the United Nations has so far been blocked. The interests of international peace clearly demand that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam should, at this very session, occupy its rightful place among the States Members of our Organization.\n93.\tMy Government welcomes the active participation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and of Democratic Kampuchea in international political life.\n94.\tMy delegation feels that the United Nations and the specialized international organizations should assume their appropriate role in the reconstruction of Indochina. The States bearing primary responsibility for the suffering caused to the peoples of Indochina should comply with their obligations undertaken in international agreements, and should provide assistance in healing the wounds of war.\n95.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic continues to support all efforts by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula, consolidate the peace of the region, and attain the peaceful reunification of Korea. We deem it necessary that the relevant resolution adopted by the United Nations last year [resolution 3390 (XXX)] should be carried out.\n96.\tFurther changes of importance have taken place in Africa since last year's session of the General Assembly. The proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola, the victory of the Angolan people over foreign intervention and internal reaction, has been an event of historic significance in the disintegration of the colonial system. The Hungarian people is in sympathy with and gives support to the Angolan people in its efforts to rebuild the country, revive the national economy, and establish a progressive society. In common with the overwhelming majority of Member States, we stand for the admission of the People's Republic of Angola to the United Nations.\n97.\tThe African patriots can count upon the solidarity and support of the Hungarian people in their just struggle against the illegal minority governments and the policy of apartheid. We are convinced that the circles obsessed by the ideology of racial superiority will not be able to prevent much longer the people of Zimbabwe from the exercise of its rights. We are confident, too, that the people of Namibia, now under occupation by the South African racists, will accede to real independence in the near future.\n98.\tThe actions that are encouraged from abroad to turn back the clock of history in Latin America induce world public opinion to be vigilant. There is ample evidence to show that the rightist, Fascist Governments, which assumed power through conspiracy, are no advocates of detente but, on the contrary, direct their activities against peaceful coexistence and co-operation among peoples.\n99.\tHungarian public opinion follows with unflagging attention and firmly condemns the terror by the Fascist junta in Chile. The Hungarian people, at one with the other progressive forces, demands the release of Luis Corvalan and all Chilean patriots.\n100.\tGood relations between the socialist and the developing countries are an important factor of the world situation today. Accordingly, the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is striving to have its relations with the developing countries become more substantial.\n101.\tMy country attaches great importance to the international activity of the non-aligned countries. We warmly welcome the positive results of the Colombo Conference and are convinced that the implementation of the Colombo resolutions [see A/311197, annex IV] will result in stronger co-operation between the socialist and the non-aligned countries.\n102.\tWe understand and support the endeavors of developing countries to bring about mutually advantageous international economic relations free from discrimination and based on equality. The position of Hungary on the establishment of a new international economic order was extensively explained by the Hungarian delegations to the sixth and seventh special sessions and the twenty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly. We deem it necessary that the principles laid down in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States should be implemented as soon as possible.\n103.\tIt is our conviction that any notable progress in the economic prosperity of the developing countries can only be made under a favorable international climate. We take satisfaction from the fact that the resolutions adopted at the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries in Colombo also reflect a growing awareness of the interrelationships existing between detente, disarmament, and the economic advancement of individual countries.\n104.\tWe attach great importance to the provision of international assistance to the developing countries. We ourselves are trying to contribute our share, commensurate with our means and possibilities, to the development programs of these countries.\n105.\tNevertheless, we are also of the view that the fundamental guarantees for the economic advancement of the developing countries lie in progressive socio-economic measures to be carried out at national levels. The correctness of this approach is also vividly shown by the accomplishments of socialist Hungary in the rapid increase of industrial and agricultural production, the flowering of cultural life, and the marked improvement of living standards.\n106.\tAn important basic condition for increasing the effectiveness of the activity of our Organization lies in a more consistent practical application of the spirit and letter of the Charter. During the past 30 years the Charter has withstood the test of time and its application has contributed to the maintenance of peace and security, to the development of relations among nations, to the solution of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian tasks, and to the expansion of international co-operation. Hence there is no need to amend the Charter.\n107.\tDuring the last five years our world Organization has furthered the settlement of several international issues and has taken a number of initiatives. For the results achieved thanks are due also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, with foresight and inexhaustible energy, has promoted the cause of friendship, co-operation and peace among the peoples. I should like to assure the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, of my Government's high appreciation of his noble activity and of its readiness to lend him continued support.\n108.\tI should like to conclude by assuring the President that the Hungarian delegation will also at the present session do its very best to ensure the successful conclusion of the work of the General Assembly.\n109.\tWe believe that this session of the General Assembly can also make an effective contribution to solving the important questions on the agenda.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should like to offer my congratulations to Mr. Amerasinghe upon his election as President of this Assembly. This is a tribute to his great personal qualities, as well as a recognition of his many services to the ideal of international co-operation and of his experience and his talents.\n156.\tIt is also with pleasure that we greet the admission to the United Nations of a new Member-the Republic of Seychelles, which has just acceded to independence within the framework of the historic process of decolonization. Its admission reinforces the concept of universality of our Organization. We wish to express to the new Member our most heartfelt congratulations and our most sincere wishes for the happiness and prosperity of its people.\n157.\tThe introduction to the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the United Nations deserves the special attention of the General Assembly, and is a measure of the lofty and dedicated spirit with which Mr. Waldheim carries out his functions. The comments and observations of the Secretary-General are distinguished by their realism. It is all too true, indeed, that 30 years after the formation of the United Nations, we are still in a period of transition marked by the erosion of the rules upon which the present system is based. We are witnessing a resurgence of anachronistic chauvinism and a relapse towards a stage where might makes right and where there is a lack of respect for the resolutions of the principal bodies of the United Nations and especially of the Security Council.\n\n158.\tThe system of international security provided for by the authors of the Charter, still remains to be set up. If, in \nour nuclear age, holocaust was avoided, it is nevertheless also true that a feeling of insecurity weighs upon the peoples of the world. Thus, in spite of the doubts and hesitations that the concept of detente can give rise to, our peoples have no other choice than to hope that it will take root and that it will gradually lead to the elimination of fear and anguish. That is why the policy of detente should not serve as a screen for the pursuit of particular interests. It should sincerely strive towards a better future, a future of co-operation between all the peoples of the world, because we cannot contemplate the selective application of detente, just as there cannot be any selective application of the concept of freedom.\n159.\tIn European terms, the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975, was designed, as is known, to reduce tensions and promote a climate of detente in Europe. Considerable steps have been made since then towards the strengthening of peace and the expansion of economic and cultural exchanges to the benefit of all our peoples in Europe. Next year, at Belgrade, the signatory countries will have occasion to review the progress made since the signing of the Final Act in Helsinki, and to study the measures to be taken for the total application of the principles adopted by the Conference and for the strengthening of cooperation on the multilateral plane.\n160.\tGreece has made its contribution to this effort, particularly since the principles stated in the Final Act are those of the United Nations Charter. We have made efforts to promote bilaterally and, so far as possible, multilaterally as well, progress which would be in step with the implementation of the various chapters of the Final Act. Our bilateral relations with our neighbors to the north have seen a new resurgence. Multilaterally, we have convened in January of this year a meeting of government experts on economic and technical co-operation between Balkan countries. We hope that this initiative will have constructive consequences for the greater benefit of the peoples of the region. We remain convinced that, parallel to the efforts which are designed to promote bilateral relations between Balkan countries, their multilateral co-operation is equally desirable, where favorable and realistic conditions for it exist.\n161.\tAlso, by common agreement with countries of the European Community, we have commenced procedures aimed at the adherence of Greece to the European Community. It is quite natural that the Greek people, animated by the European ideal, should wish to take part in the construction of the united Europe of the future, a Europe freed of the antagonisms of the past and going towards its destiny as a factor of peace and co-operation.\n162. As to our relations with the Arab countries, with which so many ties bind us, they are becoming closer in all sectors, and this gives me an opportunity to stress once again that the position of Greece on the problem of the Middle East is based on the principles of the Charter and first and foremost upon the principle of self-determination, as well as upon the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly. This policy is not dictated by circumstances; it is based upon immutable principles, the primacy of law over lawlessness, the right of all peoples to an identity of their own and of all States to a peaceful life behind inviolable frontiers.\n163.\tIt follows, therefore, that we are against the acquisition of territory by force and therefore we are in favor of the evacuation of all the occupied Arab territories. We also consider that any solution to the problem of the near Middle East must take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n164.\tAs to the immediate future, we strongly hope that the tragedy which the friendly Lebanese people is living through will come to an end and that peace will return to this tormented country.\n165.\tIn Africa we are following with the greatest interest on the one hand the substantial progress of the countries which, once having acquired independence, are now trying to consolidate it, and on the other hand the evolution of the situation in southern Africa.\n166.\tIn this latter region the problems are of such complexity and gravity and give rise to such passions that they deserve a special place in our deliberations.\n167.\tWe have always vigorously condemned apartheid and all other forms of racial discrimination and we support all efforts to ensure that human dignity, equality, security, and progress for all might prevail in this region. The blood which has flowed these last months was not only a call for our compassion; the danger of an escalation is too real not to cause the gravest concern. The time has come for radical solutions. Namibia should accede to independence and the people of Southern Rhodesia should be given the great benefit of the democratic principle of government by majority.\n168.\tAnd now I should like to deal with our relations with our neighbor to the east-Turkey.\n169.\tThe General Assembly is only too aware of the fact that at the time when Greece, two years ago, was restoring its democratic institution, Cyprus was invaded by the armed forces of one of the Powers despite the fact that that Power had guaranteed its independence and its territorial integrity. The fact that to this day the situation in the island remains unchanged underlies the crisis that prevails in our region.\n170.\tIn turning to bilateral problems I did not intend to go into them in detail, but the statement made the day before yesterday before this Assembly by my Turkish colleague [8th meeting] obliges me to refer to some of his assertions if only to rectify certain errors of interpretation and certain omissions which have dipped into his presentation.\n171.\tThe Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Caglayangil, has dwelt, in particular, on the re-militarization of the Greek islands of the Aegean and on the question of the continental shelf and emphasized that in both cases it was the attitude of Greece that caused the present tension. As for the islands, he invoked existing treaties, but what he did not mention was that these treaties do not require Greece to abandon its natural right to the defense of its national territory. What he failed to say is that the elementary defensive measures taken on some of these islands were adopted after the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in violation of the United Nations Charter.\n172.\tWell before the strengthening of the defense of the island, Turkey had systematically proceeded to the establishment of a landing-force, which is essentially a force of aggression, and it has used this force, with the results that we all know, against Cyprus, thereby posing a constant threat to the security of die Greek islands.\n173.\tMy Turkish colleague has made reference to the threat to the security of Turkey by the defensive measures adopted by Greece in the Aegean Sea. He said that the militarization of the islands is \\\"a serious threat to the security of Turkey\\\" [8th meeting, para. 221J.\n174.\tThis statement is contradicted by the statement of the Prime Minister of Turkey who, in an interview reported in the newspaper Le Monde of May 1975, affirmed that the Turks do not fear that the Greeks, by strengthening their islands will be able to invade Turkey. Mr. Demirel was right.\n175.\tWith regard to the continental shelf the Turkish Minister laid stress on two points: first of all he asserted that the Aegean Sea is a sea where only Turkey and Greece have coastlines, and therefore, he said, this was a \\\"common sea\\\" [ibid.,para. 223J.\n176.\tThis theory will surely surprise the members of the international community. The idea of the Aegean Sea as being the common sea of Greece and Turkey runs counter to the principle one as old as the world and still valid that no one can dispose of what he does not own. This is a sea which, beyond the territorial waters of the coastal countries, is a free sea governed by the international status of the high seas. The Aegean Sea is open to international shipping, and other Powers are interested in having it remain an open sea and would certainly oppose the idea that the Aegean should be a Greekian-Turkish lake.\n177.\tMy distinguished colleague then set himself up as an international legislator to tell us that the legal arguments of Greece concerning the continental shelf are not valid and that the law of the sea had to be tailored to suit Turkey. To hear him speak, what was important was population. Here also we have a new theory which will certainly not be appreciated by States which are less populated than their neighbors.\n178.\tI think that we owe it to ourselves and to this Assembly to remain aware of the seriousness and gravity of the situation when we discuss the problems affecting the destinies of our people.\n179.\tOn one point, however, we agree with Turkey, namely, that on the eve of negotiations which we are trying to conduct we must not embark upon any unilateral actions which would be incompatible with Security Council resolution 395 (1976) and which could undermine mutual confidence. Since Greece has not engaged in actions of this kind I hope that Turkey will follow its own advice.\n180.\tI have already mentioned Cyprus. This is a problem which the United Nations has been dealing with at several levels. The General Assembly and the Security Council have already sketched out, by means of successive resolutions, the major lines of a just and equitable solution. The Secretary-General has employed all his efforts and skill to ensure the success of the talks between the communities. Unfortunately, as Mr. Waldheim observes in the introduction to his report, no progress towards a settlement has been accomplished so far. The Turks continue to occupy 40 per cent of the territory of the Republic. Thousands of Greek Cypriots-one third of the population-are living as refugees far from their homes, deprived of their property and despoiled of their goods. Other refugees, expelled from the occupied area, have fled to the south. The large-scale systematic colonization of the north by Turkish nationals is continuing. The new settlers are establishing themselves on the properties of the Greek refugees in violation of the most elementary rules of human rights. In these circumstances one can realize why the Turkish Cypriot side refuses to help negotiations by submitting concrete proposals concerning the territorial aspect of the problem and is considering new faits accomplis, encouraged perhaps by the saying \\\"beati possidentes\\\". When the General Assembly examines this problem once again it will, I am sure, wish to consider the comments of the Secretary-General, who emphasizes that this problem has implications far beyond the immediate area concerned and involves the delicate balance of relations between a number of other States. It is for that reason, Mr. Waldheim tells us, that this problem, like that of the Middle East, occupies such a prominent place on the agenda of the Organization of which we are all Members and that the effort to find peaceful solutions must be persisted in at all costs [A/31/1 /Add. 1, sect. Ill J. We are convinced that this solution can be found and the principles stated this morning by the Secretary of State of the United States [ 11th meetingJ have certainly engaged our attention.\n181.\tIt is not possible to conclude an objective analysis of the role of our Organization without recognizing the very important contribution of the United Nations in the fields of decolonization, the progress of the developing countries, the establishment of a new international economic order, respect for human rights and so on.\n182.\tIn the field of human rights we ourselves have taken certain action at the thirtieth session and we shall support any measures which will strengthen the protection of human rights.\n183.\tAmong the activities of the United Nations on a World-wide scale, I would wish to refer to the setting up of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has entered, after its recent work, into a decisive phase. Important difficulties remain, but no one questions the fact that this Conference must ultimately draw up concrete rules for the law of the sea. In order to do this, it is essential that the final text contain specific rules which will not give rise to contradictory interpretations, because the progress of technology, as it opens up great possibilities for the development and economic progress of States, has at the same time created delicate situations which may degenerate into inter-State conflicts without the presence of positive and concrete law. It is equally necessary to indicate the mandatory international authorities who will resolve any disputes in the interests of international peace and security.\n184.\tAnother great design on a world-wide scale to which our Organization has been called upon to make its contribution is the establishment of a new economic order based upon the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States and on the Program of Action elaborated at the sixth special session and on the results of the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n185.\tIt is also necessary to emphasize the importance of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, known also as the \\\"North-South dialog\\\" which is attributable to a French initiative, as well as the fourth session of UNCTAD which took place in Nairobi. Lastly, it is significant that the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Colombo has devoted a great part of its work to the problem of the establishment of the new economic order.\n186.\tThis activity reflects more than a growing awareness of the great economic and social problems which have to be resolved in order to raise the standard of living of the poorer countries and thereby to ensure world-wide political and economic stability. It is evidence of the will of all of us to give these problems concrete, fair and practical responses within the framework of the interdependence of nations.\n187.\tThe problems that we shall have to deal with before achieving this objective are great and varied. But we shall know how to resolve them if we are determined to put an end to the wretched poverty which persists in various parts of the world.\n188.\tAs far as Greece is concerned, it has always been in favor of the establishment of a more equitable economic order and it will give its support to any initiative aimed at achieving the aspirations of the peoples of developing countries, because it is difficult to claim progress as long as crying inequalities subsist between countries of the world and as long as human beings are deprived of the necessary minimum to an extent which affects human dignity and degrades our civilization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the high office of President of this General Assembly. Your election is a recognition of your qualifications and it also does honor to Sri Lanka, a nation which has always been in the first ranks of the developing world. In this connexion I would especially like to refer to your presidency of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, during which you demonstrated your outstanding talents in the field of modem multilateral diplomacy.\n151.\tI am also pleased to express my deeply felt appreciation for the excellent guidance of Mr. Thorn, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Mr. Gaston Thorn will always be remembered by the Government and people of my country, since Surinam was admitted to membership in the United Nations during his presidency of the General Assembly.\n152.\tI also wish to transmit to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, the gratitude of my people for his tireless efforts to achieve peace and international co-operation in this troubled world.\n153.\tWe welcome with enthusiasm the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to our Organization. The admission of the Republic of Seychelles is yet another proof of the continuing process of decolonization and its entry into the Organization is a further step towards the goal of universality. My Government looks forward to fruitful co-operation between our two nations and extends its best wishes to the new Republic.\n154.\tIt has often been said that the United Nations has lost its original vigor and that the world Organization cannot achieve its principal goals as contained in its Charter: the achievement of international peace and security, the development of friendly relations among nations and the promotion of international co-operation.\n155.\tIn the opinion of those pessimists, international problems such as the arms race, the prohibition of nuclear arms, population growth, the problems of international economic relations, and others, could be dealt with better within the framework of closed international forums, limited in scope and membership. That rather gloomy view does not, however, take into account the growing inter-dependence of the nations of the world, whatever the ideological differences in their political systems. Further-more, it does not pay a tribute to the fact that the United Nations has played an important and constructive role in various conflicts which threatened or are still menacing international peace and stability.\n156.\tThe United Nations, based on the principles of equality and universality, is in our opinion the most adequate instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the solution of the complex problems of the world economy. Certain undeniable short-comings are not inherent in the bask structure of the Organization, but are primarily the consequence of the refusal of some Member States to act in harmony with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, and their refusal to implement the decisions of the organs of the Organization, thus undermining confidence in its effectiveness. We wish to state emphatically that we do not believe that the problems which keep haunting mankind problems of war and peace and the safeguarding of the national sovereignty of smaller nations can be solved through big-Power policy or through the establishment of military blocs. Despite all its short-comings, we firmly believe that the United Nations offers the best safeguards for the maintenance of international peace and of the sovereignty of nations, particularly the small and medium-sized countries, and for the handling of international economic problems.\n157.\tFor the United Nations to function effectively, all independent States which subscribe to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations should be Members of our Organization. The principle of universality on which our Organization is\\\" based necessarily implies a politically pluralistic structure for our Organization: it implies an organization consisting of all independent nations, whatever their economic and political structure. For these reasons, we are in favor of the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the two States of North and South Korea- pending their peaceful reunification under a single Government and the Republic of Angola.\n158.\tAlthough the threats to international peace have been somewhat diminished since the termination of the Viet Nam war and the adoption of the policy of detente, certain areas of the world continue to be a cause of grave concern. The conclusion of an agreement between Egypt and Israel for the disengagement of troops in the Sinai has avoided the outbreak of another military confrontation between the two nations. There can be no doubt, however, that the positive results of the Sinai Agreement should induce the parties concerned to direct their efforts towards reaching a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem as a whole. Piecemeal agreements, however gratifying they may be, carry the danger of intensifying frustrations which will eventually lead to further upheavals. This was clearly demonstrated by the violent confrontation between the occupying Israeli forces and the inhabitants of the West Bank, and also by the outbreak of open warfare in Lebanon. The Government of the Republic of Surinam endorses: first, the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), supplemented by Security Council resolution 338(1973), and will support a solution based on a withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the territories occupied during the 1967 war; secondly, the security of the State of Israel, within secure frontiers negotiated by the parties concerned; and thirdly, a solution of this problem based on the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n159.\tWith regard to Namibia, it is the view of the Republic of Surinam that the United Nations has an obligation to put an end to Namibia's illegal occupation by the Pretoria regime. The United Nations should provide the people of Namibia with the opportunity to determine their own future and it should prevent the Balkanization of Namibia into \\\"bantustans\\\". The Government of the Republic of Surinam fully endorses Security Council resolution 385 (1976), which declared that, for the people of Namibia to freely determine their own future, it is imperative that free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations be held for the whole of Namibia as one political entity and that South Africa should urgently make a solemn declaration accepting the holding of these elections. The Government of the Republic of Surinam, however, rejects recent South African proposals for leading Namibia to independence by the end of 1978. These proposals are, in our view, the latest in a series of deceptive devices to circumvent the implementation of United Nations resolutions, since they do not mention the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. We are in complete agreement with the statement made by the Secretary-General on Namibia Day, 26 August, that the proposals of the South African Government do not constitute an adequate response to the needs of the situation in Namibia and that South Africa must abandon its unilateral approach and recognize that co-operation with the United Nations is indispensable to solve this matter to the satisfaction of the people of Namibia and the international community.\n160.\tRecent disorders in South Africa are the logical and inevitable result of the oppressive and repugnant policy of apartheid on which the South African Government continues to base its political system, in defiance of universal condemnation It is to be expected that these disorders will increase in the future, and so will their intensity. The South African Government and the illegal regime of Salisbury did not heed the wind of change blowing in the southern part of the African continent even after the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire, and time is rapidly and inexorably running out for them. The Government of the Republic of Surinam will give full support to the oppressed peoples and their liberation movements in that region of the world, in their just and legitimate struggle.\n161.\tDevelopments in southern Africa during the last few weeks seem to indicate that there is some movement in hitherto frozen positions, which could conceivably spell the beginning of the end of minority rule and racial oppression in the whole region. There is some hope that the oppressed majority will finally be able to reach their goal and attain \nfreedom and human dignity without having to sacrifice their lives in a protracted war of liberation. Long and bitter experience has, however, taught the suffering people and the international community that not much trust can be placed in the oppressive regimes in southern Africa. The situation, therefore, calls for the utmost watchfulness on the part of the United Nations against any maneuvers which might frustrate the awakening hopes for a peaceful and genuine transfer of power. At the same time, the international community must throw all its weight behind those who are trying to advance the cause of freedom. The pressure on the two Governments in southern Africa must be kept up. My delegation considers the recent acceptance by the illegal regime in Rhodesia of majority rule as a possible first step towards a final solution and supports the call by the Presidents of the five front-line States to the United Kingdom to convene a constitutional conference outside Rhodesia. We sincerely hope that this conference, to the convening of which the United Kingdom has agreed, will result in the achievement of the goals for which many of the freedom fighters in that Territory have given their lives.\n162.\tDuring the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade, there have been serious short-comings in achieving the goals, objectives and policy measures specified in the International Development Strategy as envisioned by General Assembly resolution 3517 (XXX). The hope that those measures would result in effective and concrete international economic arrangements, benefiting both toe developed and developing countries and closing the gap between those nations, has not in the least been fulfilled.\n163.\tIn our opinion the results achieved up to now are only a first step towards the restructuring of existing inequitable international economic relations.\n164.\tWe are, however, seriously concerned about the fact that no concrete results were achieved at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which has consequently led to a deadlock.\n165.\tWe do not want to dwell on all the underlying causes of this disappointing situation. We are of the opinion that the existing international social and economic injustices will ultimately result in a political confrontation: a confrontation which we do not Want and which can only result in the destruction of international peace and security. The solution of long-ranging problems of international economic co-operation should be found in a constructive dialog between both groups of nations.\n156. In this context we particularly welcome the adoption of the Declaration of Abidjan  at the meeting of the Economic and Social Council at its sixty-first session in the Ivory Coast. In the Declaration of Abidjan the Council declares its adherence to the principles of national independence, sovereignty and self-reliance and its faith in co-. operation, dialog and negotiations between developed and developing countries, based on a real political will to promote an equitable and just system of international economic relations in conformity with the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. We strongly support this declaration and my Government will participate actively in all the activities leading to the implementation of its contents.\n167.\tIn a number of areas our Organization provided both an instrument for negotiations and a forum for the formulation of political guidelines. Despite fundamental conflicts of interest, developed and developing nations generally negotiated in a spirit of co-operation.\n168.\tThese negotiations led to the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States in 1974. The Government of the Republic of Surinam will base its future policy on these instruments which, if fully implemented, will give a most important impetus to terminate the inequity which characterizes the distribution of the wealth of the world.\n169.\tIt should be pointed out, however, that the reluctance shown by some developed countries to harmonize their national interests with the needs and just wishes of political instruments and the attainment of positive and concrete arrangements. We do hope that these nations will broaden their views and the future will give evidence of a less rigid position. Reconciliation is not a one-way street and can only be realized through concerted efforts by all parties concerned.\n170.\tAt the fourth session of UNCTAD, held in Nairobi this year, a program to restructure global commodity trade in order to stabilize and increase earnings of developing countries, was launched. UNCTAD, inter alia, agreed on the establishment of a common fund for the financing of buffer stocks. The operation of buffer stocks, which could be held or sold if conditions so require, would help to end the fluctuations in commodity prices that have chronically plagued developing countries which depend on their commodity exports. My Government will actively participate in the negotiations relating to the establishment of this fund.\n171.\tIt would be a grave omission on my part if I did not express my country's appreciation for the assistance which we have received and continue to receive from the United Nations Development program [UNDP]. We are aware of the fact that rapidly improved rates of program delivery, combined with cost inflation and a shortfall in expected resources,, confronted the program with a severe liquidity problem and we are glad that the Governing Council of UNDP took major substantive decisions about the program's liquidity problems.\n172.\tMy country supports the efforts of UNDP to promote the technical co-operation among developing countries; This should, in our opinion, not merely consist in the exchange Of experts and equipment among the developing countries but should in addition seek to strengthen the technological capacity of those countries and their scientific and technical institutions.\n173.\tThis year a number of other important United Nations conferences on global issues have been convened. I \nam referring in particular to the Habitat Conference in Vancouver  and the United Nations Conference on the Establishment of an International Fund for Agricultural Developments Furthermore, next year the United Nations Water Conference will take place in Argentina. These events are also within the purview of international economic co-operation and the work of these conferences proves the close and strong interdependence between social and economic development at both the international and national level.\n174.\tMay I say a few words about the recent session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea, the outcome of which is a matter of the gravest concern to my country.\n175.\tWe are of the opinion that a continuation of the existing impasse, which was created as a result of disagreements on crucial issues, can only play into the hand of the industrialized nations.\n176.\tIf compromises cannot be reached soon between developing countries and industrialized nations on the one hand and between developing nations among themselves on the other hand, this will irrevocably have the devastating effect of placing the industrialized nations in a position of utilizing their technology and capital to execute a unilateral policy of exploitation.\n177.\tWe, as developing countries, must prevent at all costs that the colonial policy of the industrialized nations with regard to the natural resources of the continents be repeated with respect to the resources of the seas.\n178.\tSurinam remains prepared to participate actively in the search for a just solution and hopes that the international treaty on maritime law will be concluded within the foreseeable future. Some specific issues, such as the exclusive economic zone, are of eminent importance to my country.\n179.\tIn the absence of an international treaty soon to be agreed upon, Surinam will find itself compelled to confirm its right in this zone. In this connexion my Government wishes to state that serious damage has been caused to its fishing industry by the ships of several nations that, during the past years, have been plundering its fish resources in an indiscriminate way. It is clear that the Government of the Republic of Surinam will not tolerate this behavior in the future and that it will protect its national interests regardless of the outcome of the negotiations on the establishment of an international treaty on maritime law.\n180.\tIt is almost one year ago that Surinam became independent after having been under colonial rule for many ages. During the past year we made a start towards ending the isolated status in which we found ourselves as a former colony. We are new in the process of integrating ourselves into the region to which we belong, namely the Latin American continent and the Caribbean area.\n181.\tSurinam has already established embassies in two countries that are very dear to us, Brazil and Venezuela. In addition, we have established diplomatic relations with various other countries in the region. Furthermore, Surinam has joined the Economic Commission for Latin America and soon hopes to apply for membership of the Organization of American States and the Latin American Economic System. As far as the use of nuclear arms is concerned, one of Surinam's first acts after its independence has been the signing of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco).\n182.\tThe integration into Latin America is the more fitting, since this year we will commemorate the fact that 150 years ago the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama was convened by the liberator Simon Bolivar. The Liberator once stated that the new world should consist of free and independent States bound together by a system of mutual regulations which would govern their foreign relations. It is in the spirit of this declaration that we shall establish, maintain and intensify our relations with other nations of the Latin American region.\n183.\tIn this respect the Government of the Republic of Surinam sincerely hopes that the negotiations between the Government of Panama and the Government of the United States will in the near future result in the conclusion of a new agreement between the two countries, safeguarding the just and sovereign rights of the people of Panama.\n184.\tBesides our policy leading to integration of Surinam within the American continent the Government of the Republic of Surinam has also established relations with countries in other regions of the world.\n185.\tOur membership in this world Organization implies that we actively participate in international affairs, thereby observing binding international regulations. It is on these foundations that we shall base our policy as a member of the international community and we give the assurance that we will, in doing so, conduct ourselves in conformity with the sacred principles of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to express my warm congratulations to Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe on his election as President of this Assembly and to extend to him every good wish for the success of his noble mission. At the same time, I should like to extend my greetings and my thanks to President Gaston Thorn for having carried out such excellent work in this capacity at the thirtieth session.\n134.\tUruguay also would like to extend a friendly and cordial welcome to the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to our Organization and on having attained full participation in world affairs.\n135.\tJust as at the last session I intend to give the general lines of my country's thinking about international economics and politics without entering into detail about the numerous items on our agenda. These general lines describe the foreign policy of Uruguay, which remains unchanged in accordance with the traditional principles which constitute its essence and in accordance with the deep-rooted feeling of its people.\n136.\tIt is a commonplace to say that modern weapons technology has created special conditions in international politics which are very different from classical concepts. Hegemony cannot be acquired through traditional means, except on very rare occasions and in very limited ways. Therefore, an attempt is made to try and achieve this through new means which in substance pursue the same end, domination. Thus the conquest of countries is sought by means of subversion and guerrilla warfare; constant agitation to destroy the economy; external selective support (from the supplying of money to the sending of weapons and combatants); infiltration in countries' institutions; campaigns of international deprecation with a view to isolating the country; all this in close connexion with the various subversive movements, at both the operative and ideological levels.\n137.\tAll those actions, therefore, are instruments or means placed at the service of one sole objective, namely, to impose upon countries radical changes in their political, economic and social systems as well as the very characteristics of their national identity.\n138.\tWhat cannot be attained directly, because of conditions of strategic equilibrium, are sought to be obtained indirectly. The battlefield, so to speak, has moved within countries, thus giving rise to violence and agitation. What is involved is a real war within a purely formal peace.\n139.\tIn this context the relaxation of tensions among great Powers is, in the view of my Government, one aspect- obviously a very important one, but nevertheless a partial aspect-of the question. It avoids atomic crisis and brings about forms of co-operation between those Powers, but it is not comprehensive in providing moral, political and practical assistance to each country in achieving its own national life, safe from interference and aggression.\n140.\tThe fact of the relaxation of tension, therefore, is insufficient, and does not create either the appropriate atmosphere or conditions for security. Reality shows that the current and concrete threat for most nations does not come from any possible atomic holocaust or any conventional invasion; that threat consists in the utilization of certain of the instruments of struggle which I have mentioned and which could be referred to generically as organized subversion. These instruments are implanted in and made part of any of the many motives and causes of domestic conflict and tensions which are inherent in the internal life of countries and which cannot be eradicated completely. Thus in this way those motives, those causes, lose their original characteristics when injected with an ideological content. They are used as pretexts for the true purpose of violently imposing on countries radical changes in their systems. Conflicts and local tensions are in this way brought into a field of outside forces, thus forming part of an alien universal strategy in the midst of ideological confrontation. Tensions and local conflicts become part of the world situation and of the balance of power.\n141.\tConsequently, it is clear that until such time as covert policies carried out in new forms of struggle are ended, conflicts will continue, since an extraneous element, political and ideological in nature, is added to their original factors, preventing them from being resolved. Then insecurity and violence will continue gaining intensity in the world. It is even possible to foresee that the various disarmament initiatives will lack any scope as long as this situation persists, because if the conquest of countries through indirect means persists the necessary basis of confidence to achieve this will be missing.\n142.\tIn this context, if the relaxation of tension between the great Powers is to be complete and benefit all, it should also include the rapid reduction, leading ultimately to the complete elimination, of the new forms of struggle and conquest. This is the major issue to be solved.\n143.\tMy country hopes that an increasing effort made by all countries in this connexion, together with a constant policy of international security, will enable self-determination to acquire real effectiveness as an expression of the freedom of peoples and the creative capacity of the human mind.\n144.\tUruguay for its part is carrying out in this connexion a political process of development and institutional restoration which is truly its own and has a national character free of any extraneous influence, in order to give new juridical forms to its continuing ideals of freedom and democracy in an integrated and just society.\n145.\tAs my country scrupulously respects the path chosen by every other nation, by the same token it demands equal respect in turn. The respect for national personality is the true and only path towards international peace. Until such time as this principle is firmly established in the international community my country, resolved to defend its national individuality and the free development of its political processes without interference, will assume, as it has done thus far, full responsibility for that defence using the resources available to it and, under domestic and international law, will prevent the occurrence on its territory of the phenomena of violence to which I have referred.\n146.\tThe initiatives announced for joint action to combat terrorism can therefore count on the resolute support of Uruguay, which for many years has been vigorously pressing, both in this Organization and elsewhere, for action on this matter, in line with the thoughts I have just expressed, inasmuch as we reject all forms and pretexts under which this manifestation of violence appears.\n147.\tTherefore I cannot fail to express the pleasure with which the delegation of Uruguay welcomes the comments in this connexion contained in the Secretary-General's introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A131/1 Add.l, sect. VI], as well as all initiatives taken on this matter. My delegation trusts that these will be given specific form during our present session.\n148.\tHowever, I should like to draw attention to the fact that such initiatives are limited to one aspect of the situation and do not cover the whole problem. In actual fact the terrorist phenomenon of our day generally occurs not as an irrational action of a few isolated individuals, but as a method of struggle adopted by vast and complex subversive organizations with an ideological motivation, which are very closely interrelated, giving each other mutual support at the international level. Therefore these are, I would say, the multinationals of violence.\n149.\tThis necessitates concerted and far-reaching action, in keeping with the nature of the challenge, which will disrupt their operations. Otherwise we would be attacking only one aspect of the phenomenon, leaving all the others intact, as well as the real inspiration of this activity. That is to say, it is not enough to focus attention on the terrorist agent and leave aside all the organizational structure of a subversive nature which makes the terrorist action possible.\n150.\tInitiatives with regard to terrorism are usually presented in conjunction with others relating to human rights. The link between the two topics, in my Government's view, deserves very precise comment.\n151.\tFirst of all, it is necessary to distinguish between concern with human rights as such and the use of this subject as an indirect way of attacking countries which resist the new modalities of struggle and domination.\n152.\tWith respect to the substance of the topic of human rights, in its internal aspects, my Government attaches priority attention to this and reaffirms its continuing efforts to maintain and improve the high levels attained throughout the history of Uruguay. This does not stem from circumstantial motivation nor from rhetorical declarations of the moment, nor does it come from external or international factors. It results from the existence in my country of moral and political patterns which are very demanding and which stem from a free, civilized and cultural society.\n153.\tWith regard to the international aspects, my Government rejects beforehand and with equal resoluteness the use of any mechanisms in this connexion aimed at interfering in its domestic political processes or favoring the forces of subversion and intervention under the pretext of protecting human rights.\n154.\tInternational activity, if it is sincere and Motivated by genuine feeling, cannot be discriminatory and concentrate almost exclusively on a few countries, which happen to be the same which, through their own efforts, have succeeded in checking the action of internal and external factors threatening to corrode and destroy its national personality. Such international action should be extended simultaneously everywhere, with equal intensity and depth, and include in its investigations similar and comparable periods, so that it will express true humanitarian concern free of political or ideological colouring. Greater demands should not be made of one than of another. Otherwise, all international machinery in this matter would fall into increasing and wide-spread disrepute which would inevitably render them practically powerless.\n155.\tFor this reason, my country, consistent with its traditions, considers it necessary to bring about a far- reaching change in the approach and in the means used up till now at the international level. It proposes, for our joint consideration, a new approach in order to free the concern for human rights from any trace of political or ideological purposes which perturb judgement: instead of concentrating on the formal defence of partial aspects, this new approach should assume a positive role in promoting the true substance of human rights, encompassing all their aspects.\n156.\tThe community of nations should, therefore, embark upon a far-reaching process of review with regard to the status of human rights throughout the world in each and every country and carry out a mature and meaningful analysis of the real effectiveness of these rights everywhere. This review, however, should not be limited to a few isolated cases of presumed violations. In the present circumstances of tensions and struggles in which slandering countries is a political instrument for undermining their progress, an analysis of isolated cases, in only a few countries, lends itself to political manipulation or publicity or as an instrument of coercion to bend the will of States. The approach is fragmented, with events disconnected from the real context in which they occur and which frequently reveals their true causes. We lose sight of the general level of the effective observance of rights in a given society and are implicitly making over-all judgments on the basis of partial samples. Therefore this review should cover the totality of human rights in its broadest meaning and be carried out according to models and methods which are comparable in both time and space. What should be determined is how in fact the men and women of all our countries live; whether they are members of free societies in which each human being is of value per se, or if, on the contrary, they are members of totalitarian societies in which everything is regimented; even the most intimate aspects of human life and in which personality disappears, dissolved into abstract categories; what inter alia are the conditions in which the members of those societies work, whether they can choose or change their jobs,-what social protection they have against abuses; whether they have free education and access to higher levels of culture; what is the degree of their social mobility and their real possibilities of acceding to key positions in the various fields of endeavour, including political affairs; whether they have freedom to obtain information and to express their views; how public power is really obtained; what are the conditions in prisons and of prisoners; whether the death penalty or life imprisonment is meted out; what are the general conditions of health, hygiene and life expectancy, the level of nutrition, the absence or lack of absence of discrimination as to sex, race or religion, the way in which wealth is distributed, the existence of conditions of security and tranquility for the life and honour of persons, or the degree of violence which prevails in a community.\n157.\tAll of this, however, should not just be the letter of the law but should be a living and concrete reality in the daily acts of life. This is a matter which concerns, whether we are capable of collectively assuming an attitude of self-analysis and examination without exceptions or concessions, without hypocrisy and without any political use being made of human rights.\n158.\tAs long as this path is not embarked upon, my country will, within the frame of international law, continue to exercise, in this field as well as in others, all its attributes as a sovereign State, without permitting any interference or directives and without accepting or tolerating distortion of international mechanisms by political factors.\n159.\tThese considerations and these rules of conduct are surely applicable to international relations; they are a fortiori applicable to the unilateral conduct of countries. Thus, it is inadmissible for a State or an organ of a State to go beyond the sphere of action defined by international law and to claim, for itself and on its own, the function of judging other countries or Governments on the-sole basis of its material power, or in other words to assume, for itself and on its own, a supposed universal code of the political and moral values without any validating international title.\n160.\tStill less admissible, if possible, is that such an attitude should be used to bring to bear selective and discriminatory criteria of evaluation or arbitrarily to choose a target for attacks in the light of circumstantial political sympathies, disregarding the real levels of the over-all effectiveness of human rights.\n161.\tI am, of course, referring to the measure which was taken against my country by the United States Congress this week. In this case or in any other similar case, relating to my country or other countries, Uruguay will systematically oppose decisions such as the one I have just mentioned which, aside from the undeniable internal authority of a national organ to dispose of funds as it sees fit, means in its international projection an offence to national dignity and interference which is totally unacceptable and which my Government rejects sharply and vehemently.\n162. Therefore I say, repeating what has been said on numerous occasions, that these or any other actions from wherever they may come, will not change the path followed by my country in pursuit of its national objectives. On the contrary, such actions will be a reason, as in the present case, for greater consideration and unity against this interference.\n163. In the context of these various aspects which I have just mentioned it is quite clear in the world of today, and perhaps more now than ever before, that the maintenance of international peace and security depends basically on full respect of the principle of non-intervention and rejection of the use of any coercive measure, including economic measures, which would tend to induce any State, unlawfully, to adopt a given political conduct. These two principles are binding on all States in the international juridical order but in the order of ideas to which I have referred they should constitute the point of departure in relations between the most powerful and the less powerful.\n164.\tWe cannot attain in an effective way an order of peace based on law for the achievement of values of justice as long as interventionist practices continue, whatever their purposes or the pretexts used to justify them.\n165.\tWe will not attain a real policy of security and the relaxation of tensions as long as we continue in the attitude of wishing to impose in an exclusive and intolerant way concepts and points of view which for some may have the virtue of truth but which for others give rise to the exercise of the inalienable right to hold a different view.\n166.\tIt is therefore in adherence to the principles and norms of international law that we must seek the solution to disputes as the only valid path towards international justice, peace and security.\n167.\tPermit me now to refer to certain economic aspects of the present world picture.\n168.\tA brief analysis of economic developments over the past year shows that the forecasts made by my country during the thirtieth session of the General Assembly  have been fulfilled and the trends outlined at the time have persisted.\n169.\tThe measures undertaken to alleviate the crisis of 1973-1974 proved to be inadequate to help the oil- importing developing countries, which are affected both by the increase in import expenditures and by the drop in their export earnings. The deficit in the current account of those Countries, according to the International Monetary Fund, went from $10 billion in 1973 to $37 billion in 1975. Those nations have participated only in a very limited way in the so-called recycling of the greater part of the earnings from increases in the price of oil. They have encountered very serious obstacles in commodity trade owing to the\nprotectionist measures adopted by the industrialized countries.\n170. The developing countries with medium income have not been given adequate attention, since they have been left out of the emergency plans devised by the United Nations and the \\\"third window\\\" of the World Bank. The trade prospects for those countries have been limited by the protectionist policies of the industrialized nations.\n1-71. The economy of the Industrialized countries, as was to be expected, reacted more rapidly than that of other countries. Thus, for example, in Latin America 16 countries showed lower growth rates in 1975 than in 1974 and only two showed any increase. The rate of growth for the whole of Latin America was over 3.5 per cent, as compared to 7.3 per cent in 1974. In the main industrialized countries the estimated gross product for 1976 showed an increase of 5.5 per cent, which is markedly higher than that for 1975, which was negative.\n172.\tThe attempts to overhaul the international economy are far from their attaining their objectives. The various forums in which the main international economic questions are discussed have still not made any significant progress. Therefore efforts must continue to bring into operation such machinery as the integrated commodity programme, the common fund for buffer stocks of commodities, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\n173.\tThe picture that I have just described shows clearly the lack of specific solutions for the situation of medium- income developing countries which do not export oil. Uruguay has faced this adverse situation by opening up its economy, liberalizing its system of foreign trade, diversifying its exports through internal efforts, seeking new markets for its traditional products and adjusting its currency in realistic terms. It has compensated for the inadequate response from the international community as a whole by an active policy of regional ties.\n174.\tNow I should like to outline my country's position with regard to the picture that I have just described.\n175.\tUruguay will continue to co-operate constructively in the various forums in efforts to devise global solutions through negotiation and accommodation, and it will be glided by the following criteria: first, it will seek preferential treatment for developing economies in all existing machinery, including the middle-range economies'; secondly, it will promote understanding and progressive association between the developed and the developing countries in respect of constructive and mutually advantageous solutions, taking account of the difference in their levels of development and seeking consistently the growing expansion of their economies and trade; and thirdly, it will seek the opening of markets generally, including rectification of protectionist policies in developed countries and the quantitative and qualitative expansion of preferences for developing countries.\n176.\tThere is no doubt that the reality of interdependence at the world level necessitates global situations which must also be adopted at the world level. However, the search for joint over-all plans should not interfere with the solutions that must be found immediately to certain problems.\n177.\tIn this connexion my delegation suggestions are focused on two aspects, namely the promotion of regional agreements which progressively will cover the fabric of international relations and the intensification of efforts on certain subjects or sectors which, because of their nature or the urgency of the problems they involve, should be given priority.\n178.\tUruguay wishes once again to stress the important role which regional efforts can and must play in the task of organizing and rationalizing the relations of interdependence. Naturally, I should like to stress in particular the position of Latin America, where most countries are at an intermediate stage of development with special features. The main economic and social indicators and the growth rate of the Latin American economies show levels which, generally speaking, are higher than those in most developing countries. However, on the whole Latin America is still far from attaining the higher stages of dynamism and strength. This region has old economic relations with the developed countries and in recent years we have begun to discern a very intense interregional economic activity, which thus is added to the old cultural and historical ties of the continent.\n179.\tThis singular set of circumstances places this region in an exceptional position to achieve great advances in the formation of more orderly and more advantageous mutual relations and to contribute to a greater understanding at the world level between the various areas of development -that is, between the developed and the developing world.\n180.\tMy Government considers that this outstanding role in the building of a more co-operative and stable world is consonant with the traits that characterize America and is consistent with its contribution to the Charter of San Francisco and its participation in much of the work of the Organization. I offer Uruguay's willingness to co-operate with the other nations of the American continent with a view to reshaping the area's function in the world context and its constructive and independent support, seeking, not confrontation, but agreed formulas and a balance in these main topics of international economics.\n181.\tThis morning, at the 13th meeting, we could discern the spirit which inspires Latin America in the comments and exchanges of view between the Foreign Ministers of Peru and Ecuador, who dealt with very delicate subjects for their countries and their mutual relations in a cordial, constructive and balanced way. This confirms my optimism about Latin America's ability to make, together with other nations, an important contribution to the building of a more co-operative and peaceful world.\n182.\tI should like now to indicate the second direction: solutions for priority matters.\n183.\tSpecial reference should be made to agriculture and food, two subjects that are closely interconnected with the problems of population. In the opinion of my Government, this is one of the most critical areas not only in economic terms but also from the political and moral points of view. No system can indefinitely support a situation in which many lack food-stuffs vital for survival, while others face serious difficulties because they cannot find a market for\nthese same products. In the face of this contradiction, any agricultural development programme to increase world production of food loses all effectiveness. This dramatic vicious circle causes more suffering and death than any other factor. This criterion will continue to be the pillar of international economic policy.\n184.\tIn this connexion, I should like to pinpoint certain aspects which we think might guide us in solving this dilemma.\n185.\tFirst of all, a financial mechanism which will stimulate the production of food-stuffs and simultaneously make them available to peoples with lowest incomes must be established. This point is what Uruguay calls a food bank and which I would like once again to put forward for your consideration.\n186.\tIndeed, I must lay special emphasis on the fact that the agricultural programmes and the funding to support them will not be effective unless mechanisms for stable marketing can be found for the increased production. Otherwise, we may find paradoxically that these surpluses will give rise to economic and financial disaster for their producers, while failing to reach the people who need, but lack the means to acquire, such products.\n187.\tIn the second place, upsets in food-stuff production and trade must be avoided. I am referring now to the agricultural policy of the developing countries, and, in particular, of the European Economic Community. It is obvious that the protectionist policies followed, with their restrictions on trade, subsidies and dumping, disrupt the market and discourage agricultural production in developing countries. This results in a drop in the over-all world supply of its products because it eliminates all incentives and even minimal security for farmers. In the case of Latin America, these practices disrupt the formation of the regional agricultural market, substituting subsidized and uneconomic production for regional supply at competitive and efficient levels.\n188.\tThe adoption of unilateral policies is inadmissible because this would bring about tremendous disruption with far-reaching consequences for the economy and for man-kind. We must therefore all look at this problem together. In a joint approach, we must make appropriate proposals to try to reconcile the social interests involved with the principles of sound economy, making a comparison of the relative advantages. My country is prepared to discuss this problem as part of its policy of co-operation. We are sure that a similar spirit also inspires other developing countries and we hope that this position will find an equally constructive echo in the developed countries so that the present unjust unilateral policy will be transformed into a constructive association beneficial to the lofty values involved.\n189.\tWith regard to energy, I should like to reiterate that which I have repeated on several occasions since 1973. It is certain that developing countries which do not produce oil have had to face a rise in energy prices that has entailed greater indebtedness and internal upset in their fledgling productive structures.\n190.\tThe international community must devise special measures to alleviate the burden of indebtedness already contracted in order to mitigate the cumulative effect that this phenomenon will continue to have on weaker economies. The resources devoted in the past to this emergency have been insufficient and, with regard to my country, have been limited to facilities formerly offered but now discontinued by the International Monetary Fund.\n191.\tThe topic should be looked at as a whole: not solely as a temporary emergency, but as an ongoing factor permanently affecting development.\n192.\tI believe that the United Nations can play a very significant role in the co-ordination and promotion of projects and proposals emanating from the various international agencies with regard to the priority topics of food-stuffs, agriculture and energy. This would represent a specific step forward along the road towards world co-ordination.\n193.\tI have referred to the political and economic aspects of the world as seen by my country. We ;are obviously living through an era of threats and hopes, of violence and of achievements. It would be easy to give way to the temptation to bend our efforts in one direction only: to concentrate on the task of building and achieving in accordance with aspirations and hopes, or to concentrate on defence against the threats and attacks which surround us. To do so, however, would incur great risks and the result would be negative. If we were to opt exclusively for vigilance and the prevention of attack and aggression of any kind, development and levels of living might suffer irreparably. But if we opt solely for the promotion of economic and social expansion, we risk the loss of our freedom in the context of power politics.\n194.\tThe road to follow is not easy, but it is clear. The characteristics I have described of politics in our time impose on us the immense task of doing both things at the same time: to defend ourselves from attack and to find the answers to economic, social and human development. We must balance the exigencies of an undeclared war against the growing requirements of our peoples. Uruguay is willing to do this at both international and national levels, in the context of its policy of development in security.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with genuine feeling that I return to this podium where I first came when I addressed the eleventh session of the General Assembly as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Panama on 27 November 1956.4 At that time we supported the right of the Egyptian people to nationalize the Suez Canal and we indicated the similarities between the Suez and Panama Canals. Today, 20 years later, we corns before you after the liberation of all the African continent to prove to you how mistaken the United States continues to be by insisting in perpetuating its presence in the colonial enclave known as the zone of the Panama Canal. \n79. For all this, however, no substantive progress has been . \t\nachieved in the economic and social advancement of all 4 ibid., Eleventh Session, Plenary Meetings, 598th meeting. \n87.\tMany events have occurred in the world and there are many things which God and fate have allowed me to witness at this rostrum where I have .served my country as permanent representative during 13 years. So it is with happiness and a little nostalgia that I address myself to so many friends with whom I have had the honor to share the major international responsibilities entrusted to us by our Governments throughout the years.\n88.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Panama I wish to join my colleagues who, when speaking, started by congratulating Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Everyone present here knows the important part you played as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and we know well, too, the lofty intellectual and diplomatic qualities that will enable you effectively to lead the work of its next sessions. We are particularly happy at the selection because we have recently returned from your beautiful country, Sri Lanka, where we enjoyed so much courtesy and the warm hospitality of a fun-loving and hard-working people whose memory will stay with us for fever.\n89.\tWe share with the Secretary-General his conviction that by working together with courage and persistent constancy we shall move forward along the course which leads to the major objectives of peace, justice; human dignity and equity which have for centuries been a legitimate aspiration of mankind.\n90.\tIt is inconceivable as was rightly pointed out a few days ago [1st meeting/ by the President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly and Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, that $300 billion are spent every year on the arms race and at the same time not one tenth of that amount is allocated to fighting under-development, which condemns to the most wretched poverty 1.2 billion people, many of whom are totally destitute.\n91.\tIn welcoming the Republic of Seychelles as a new Member of the United Nations family, we wish to place on record that we would be pleased if shortly the People's Republic of Angola and the united Socialist Republic of Viet Nam were to occupy their lawful places in this hall.\n92.\tOn behalf of the Revolutionaiy Government presided over by Mr. Demetrio B. Lakas, and whose head of State is General Omar Torrijos Herrera, we cordially greet all States Members of the United Nations attending this session and we thank them for having elected Panama as a Vice- President of this session of the General Assembly.\n93.\tWhile it is true that detente has brought about a relaxation of tensions among the great Powers which removes the possibility of an atomic crisis, we cannot affirm that mankind has been freed from armed conflicts and threats to international peace and security which are potential crises unless they are resolved.\n94.\tPossibilities for the developing countries to share among themselves their capacity for development has increased in the last years. We now have unprecedented opportunities to achieve the scientific and technological breakthroughs which are vital for development. Therefore technical co-operation among the developing countries could be an important contribution to their development and to achieve economic independence and everybody recognizes that the needs of the developing countries are a joint responsibility of the entire international community.\n95.\tTechnical co-operation among the developing countries is one of the mechanisms basic to the establishment of the new international economic order and it is also an instrument which contributes to changing the structure of international relations. In our region, the Latin American Economic System, known as SELA, offers new perspectives for co-operation.\n96.\tWe have attentively followed the discussions at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund which were held in Manila. Panama agrees with the Managing Director of the Fund that both the developing countries as well as the industrialized countries should find a solution to the continuous use of high-interest loans which are requested to cover deficits in balances of payments so as to eliminate those perpetual deficits resulting from the unjust interactions which now prevail in international trade.\n97.\tOur delegation joins others who have preceded us in affirming that Panama will spare no efforts in seeking a remedy to the deterioration of the international economic situation. The picture is a sombre one and it is the duty of every nation which is financially more solvent to raise the availability of development loans with less harsh and burdensome conditions for poor countries.\n98.\tAt the same time efforts must be made to set up on a universal level a policy to control inflation which is the scourge of all countries and devastates the less developed countries.\n99.\tPanama is undergoing an economic crisis similar to that occurring in the vast majority of the developing countries. This year more than ever before we have felt in my country the effects of unemployment, inflation and recession.\n100.\tAt the same time the United States continues to delay a solution to the problem of the Panama Canal, which is closely connected with our economy since it is the most important natural resource we have. We do not believe it is just that the most powerful nation in the world should continue fully to exploit this resource while the majority of our people lacks the most elementary needs of a dignified life.\n101.\tFor the economy of Panama to be reactivated and for us to come out of the present economic crisis within a reasonable time, we have to make a better use of our geographical position so as to attain the degree of economic growth and stability which will enable us equitably to participate in the new international and economic order which we advocate.\n102.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Panama, even though it respects the system of free enterprise, has through labor laws and taxation attempted a more equitable distribution of our national wealth among all our inhabitants.\n103.\tOur country has at all times regretted, while totally condemning, the ever-spreading practices of international terrorism and we have so stated energetically on repeated occasions.\n104.\tThe social phenomenon of terrorism which has affected different countries on different occasions has always been condemned by all States. In most cases, it strikes innocent victims and affects fundamental values such as human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.\n105.\tSince 1973 when this item became a burning issue in the debates of this Organization, Panama has been out-standing in its co-operation and endeavors in this field. Panama had the honor and the responsibility to be Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism established under resolution 3034 (XXVII) of the General Assembly and has always based its arguments condemning such a practice on some fundamental premises which in substance mean that the United Nations must intensify its efforts to eradicate the causes of international terrorism.\n106.\tPanama will at all times endeavor, as it has in the past, to assist in formulating measures which might constitute a real barrier to or brake on the continued practice of international terrorism.\n107.\tThe fighting in Lebanon is of the utmost concern to us. With profound sadness we witness the pain of the internal tragedy of civil war in Lebanon, which has brought death to thousands of human beings and incalculable material losses. We hope that the groups involved in the present conflict, the leaders of all sectors and, in general, the population of Lebanon will help to halt this fratricidal struggle and strive to re-establish peace and order. We are pleased to have heard the news this morning that a meeting will be held in a few hours to that end. We hope that this friendly country will maintain its unity and territorial integrity so that all will respect its rights as a free, independent and sovereign nation.\n108.\tIn order to arrive at a just and lasting formula for peace in the Middle East we reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war. We support the idea of implementing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), taking into account that the Palestinian problem must be resolved on the basis of the establishment of a Palestinian State which will include Gaza and the West Bank of the Jordan, and we consider that Jerusalem must be given a special international status. At the same time we believe it is vital for the Arab countries to accept the right of Israel to live within secure and recognized frontiers like all the other States in the region.\n109.\tIn the case of Cyprus we advocate the withdrawal of the occupation forces as called for in the resolution adopted by the General Assembly two years ago [resolution 3212 (XXIX)] as a point of departure, so that later through negotiations an agreement may be reached to preserve the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus so that all its inhabitants may live in peace and the country can return to the prosperity to which it is entitled.\n110.\tThe Republic of Panama fervently hopes that through responsible negotiations an agreement will soon be reached which will be satisfactory to Guatemala and at the same time will respect the principle of self-determination and independence for the people of Belize so as to guarantee peaceful coexistence within the Central American isthmus.\n111.\tPanama reiterates its support for the just claim of the Argentine Republic regarding the Islas Malvinas and we hope that soon a formula will be found which will make it possible to restore that territory to the sovereignty of Argentina.\n112.\tPanama reiterates its hope that the negotiations which would give Bolivia an outlet to the sea will advance in a positive direction until the desired objective is obtained.\n113.\tThe constitution of Panama of 1972 provides fundamental guarantees protecting nationals and foreigners under its jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to the sacred rights to life and liberty and indicates a revolutionary concept on the scope and vastness of the human rights enjoyed throughout the entire Republic.\n114.\tParticipation in the government of my country through mechanisms of people's power which function from one end of our national territory to the other is a right and obligation of all Panamanians.\n115.\tIn a dynamic and tangible manner, which is shared by all sectors of the Panamanian community, we apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights which we have ratified, as well as the Optional Protocol. In this respect all that remains for us is publicly to declare our hopes that the 38 States which are now parties to the Covenants will by joined by many others so that this system of protecting human rights will soon attain the desired goal of universality.\n116.\tWithout leaving the context of human rights we wish to emphasize here that we are offended and afflicted by apartheid and rampant racism which white minorities have imposed on the indigenous majorities in southern Africa in bloody defiance of the clear-cut provisions and mandates of the international community and of the historic transformations which are inexorably advancing throughout the entire world.\n117.\tWe are encouraged by the latest diplomatic initiatives undertaken by the Western Powers with a view to achieving political independence in Namibia and majority Government in Zimbabwe. The struggle for liberation which has been intensified by the heroic people of Zimbabwe in recent months with the support of OAU so as to achieve genuine independence on the basis of majority government has the total support of Panama.\n118.\tWe hope that the transfer of power from the racist minority of Ian Smith to the majority of the Zimbabwe people will be carried out rapidly so as to prevent more sacrifices by that heroic people. We appreciate the efforts made to that end by the Secretary of State of the United\nStates and we hope that the conference to be held shortly at Botswana, under United Kingdom sponsorship, will overcome every obstacle and difficulty so as to prevent the sufferings of a long war, the inevitable result of which would be the triumph of the 5 million people who have been suffering the indignities of the racist regime for more than 11 years.\n119.\tTo make majority rule viable with a low cost in human life the Secretary of State of the United States has offered the United Kingdom considerable economic assistance in order to compensate the white minority in Rhodesia which wishes to emigrate.\n120.\tTaking note with satisfaction of this generous plan of the United States to relocate more than 200,000 white Rhodesians, we cannot fail to remind the leaders of North America that they could do the same to relocate the 3,000 North American Zonian families resident in the Panamanian territory known as the Panama Canal Zone so as to facilitate the negotiations on the new Canal treaty and eliminate once and for all the primary source of conflicts which perturbs relations between the United States and Panama.\n121.\tRepeatedly we have said, and we say again, that we welcome North Americans and in general all foreigners who wish to adjust to the atmosphere and customs of Panama and we reiterate that we are prepared to give them the same cordial treatment which our people has always given once we have eradicated from our territory the colonial enclave known as the Panama Canal Zone.\n122.\tWe are please to note that, in United Nations bodies, Africans and Latin Americans have made common cause to condemn every kind of colonialism.\n123.\tIt was the privilege of my country that its capital was chosen by Simon Bolivar, the Liberator, as the venue for the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama, which met on our isthmus from 22 June to 15 July 1826, and we were particularly pleased to note that, on the initiative of the Latin American group of States, we have on the agenda of the present session an item entitled \\\"One hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama\\\" [item 117]. The Foreign Minister of Venezuela, Mr. Ramon Escovar Salom, quite rightly said in this hall: \\\"This Congress was a \\\"historical event which for the first time collectively defined the political strategy of the Latin American continent\\\" [6th meeting, para. 108], At that Congress Bolivar aimed at setting up a league of Latin American nations to be a spokesman for the colonial peoples of the world in opposition to the imperialist claims of the European Holy Alliance.\n124.\tWe are therefore certain that the special plenary meeting which will be held by this General Assembly to celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama and to pay a tribute to liberator Simon Bolivar, will have the enthusiastic support of all States Members of the Organization. This celebration is of singular importance for the Latin American nations and for the non-aligned countries. For the former, the genius of Bolivar converted into continental doctrine the feeling and thinking of unity which was common to the heroes of the emancipation of the Latin American nations. For the latter, Bolivar, with his far-sighted thinking, opened up broad ways and means of achieving the fundamental objectives of defeating imperialism, colonialism, racism and foreign domination.\n125.\tMy delegation shares the view of the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, in his last speech here [11th meeting], regarding what hemispheric relations should be. Panama, which is the geographical and sentimental center of the Latin American continent and which is both the window and the mirror of the hemisphere, is where the United States should show mankind a good example of what a mutual conception of relations between North, Central and South America should be.\n126.\tThe negotiations between my small country of Panama and the great North American super-Power on the question of the Panama Canal, which were started 12 years! ago after the violent events which endangered peace in the region in 1964, are still awaiting a solution. We trust that Mr. Kissinger, despite the rhetoric of the political campaign in North America, will not leave this task unfinished, and we hope that, with the assistance of other open-minded statesmen, we will reach an agreement which will satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Panamanian people before the end of next spring.\n127.\tThe so-called Panama Canal Zone, 10 miles wide and 50 miles long, which cuts and fragments the central part of the Panamanian isthmus and makes of the Republic of Panama a divided nation, is today an anachronistic colonial enclave. There is no justification for its existence and it must disappear so as to restore the territorial integrity of the State of Panama and promote relations of peace and friendship in the region.\n128.\tThe brotherly and unanimous support of the Latin American countries, as well as of the United Nations, the third world and other States Members of the United Nations, has given renewed impetus to the cause of Panama.\n129.\tAmong the manifestations of international public opinion in favor of Panama made with growing intensity after 1973, we must emphasize the statement of the Secretary-General of the Organization. On 20 March of that year, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, urged that the burning issue of Panama be considered in accordance with the spirit of our times and within the present historical context. He said:\n\\\"The problem awaits a solution which can only be based on the respect for law and the search for justice. A solution will have to take into account the basic principles which are enshrined in the Charter such as the principle of territorial integrity, sovereign equality, the obligation to settle all international disputes by peaceful means and the principle which by now has become an accepted common standard, namely, that any State is entitled to put to full use and for its own account all its natural potentialities.\\\" \n130.\tAs I said earlier, in April 1964 the Governments of Panama and the United States, after the violent events which disturbed peace in the region, signed, through the Organization of American States [OAS], a Joint Declaration in favor of a new Panama Canal treaty, which includes the words: \\\"to seek the prompt elimination of the causes of conflict between our two countries without limitations or pre-conditions of any kind.\\\" \n131.\tAs part of the agreement at that time the President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson, after consulting former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, committed the honor of his country to the negotiation of a new treaty. For 12 years we have been negotiating with three different United States administrations for a treaty which will be reasonable and just for Panama.\n132.\tOn 21 March 1973, when the Security Council met in Panama, the United States vetoed a resolution which took note of the willingness shown by the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Panama to establish in a formal instrument agreements on the abrogation of the 1903 convention on the Isthmian Canal and its amendments and to conclude a new, just and fair treaty concerning the present Panama Canal which would fulfill Panama's legitimate aspirations and guarantee full respect for Panama's effective sovereignty over all of its territory; it further urged the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Panama to continue negotiations in a high spirit of friendship, mutual respect and co-operation and to conclude without delay a new treaty aimed at the prompt elimination of the causes of conflict between them.7 This resolution won the affirmative vote of all members of the Security Council with the exception of the United Kingdom, which abstained.\n133.\tWe are particularly pleased to place on record that on 17 September Mr. Edward (Ted) Rowlands, member of Parliament and Minister of State of the United Kingdom, after a meeting held with myself to deal with Anglo- Panamanian affairs, agreed to a declaration which states in part:\n\\\"Mr. Rowlands emphasized that, since Great Britain is one of the main users of the Canal, Her Majesty's Government is most desirous that the present negotiations should lead to a prompt solution acceptable to both parties which would satisfy the needs of the negotiating parties by eliminating the causes of conflict among them. This treaty would naturally restore to Panama jurisdiction over its entire territory.\\\"\n134.\tOn 15 May 1975, OAS unanimously adopted the following resolution:\n\\\"THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,\n\\\"HAVING HEARD the report on the negotiations concerning the Panama Canal question made by the representatives of the United States and Panama; and\n\\\"CONSIDERING:\n\\\"That the Meetings of Foreign Ministers held in Bogota, Tlatelolco, and. Washington proclaimed the Panama Canal question to be of common interest for Latin America;\n\\\"That on March 24, 1975, the Head of the Panamanian Government and the Presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela signed in Panama City a Joint Declaration concerning the Panama Canal question; and\n\\\"That the Declaration has as antecedents the Joint Declaration signed by the United States and Panama in the Council of the Organization of American States on April 3,1964, and an eight point agreement signed by the two countries on February 7, 1974, known as the Tack-Kissinger Statement,\n\\\"RESOLVES:\n\\\"1. To note with satisfaction that on February 7, 1974, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Panama and the Secretary of State of the United States signed an eight-point Statement setting forth basic principles that will serve as a guide for the negotiators of the two countries, in which it is stipulated, inter alia, that the Panamanian territory of which the Panama Canal forms a part will soon be returned to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama, and that the Republic will assume total responsibility for the inter-oceanic canal on the termination of the new treaty.\n\\\"2. To note with satisfaction the report represented by the Delegation of the United States and of Panama, which records the progress made.\n\\\"3. To express the hope that a prompt and successful conclusion will be reached in the negotiations that the Governments of the United States and the Republic of Panama have been conducting for eleven years for the purpose of concluding a new, just and fair treaty concerning the Canal, which will definitely eliminate the causes of conflict between the two countries and be efficacious in strengthening international co-operation and peace in the Americas.\\\" \n135. On 9 June 1976 at the sixth session of OAS General Assembly held in Santiago, Chile, I had the honor to read the joint report presented by the Government of the Republic of Panama and the United States of America, which in part states:\n\\\"... both governments are in agreement with the concept expressed by General Torrijos that we are not simply seeking any new treaty-we are seeking a treaty that will fully meet our common goals in the future and be seen by our sister republics as reflecting a new era of co-operation in the Americas.\\\" \n136.\tAfter reading this joint report the General Assembly of OAS at its sixth session, in a resolution which was unanimously adopted,  reiterated with renewed emphasis its hope that during this year, the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama and the bicentennial year of the independence of the United States, we would see the final impetus to the negotiations for this new Canal treaty.\n137.\tThe present negotiations for the agreement are based on the Joint Statement signed by Foreign Minister Tack and Secretary of State Kissinger on 7 February 1974, which as you know, contains the eight points which are to serve as a guide for the new Canal treaty. \n138.\tOn the occasion of the ceremony held in the city of Panama to sign that agreement, the Secretary' of State of the United States declared: \\\"On behalf of the President, I hereby commit the United States to completing these negotiations successfully and as early as possible.\\\"\n139.\tWe in Panama wonder what degree of credibility there is in the words of the Secretary of State when he expresses his concern for world problems in other areas and engages in much diplomatic activity in southern Africa to ensure that a minority will accept the principle of non\u00acdiscrimination and of political equality for all the inhabitants of Rhodesia, when at the same time it seems to be difficult for him to prevent the paralyzation of all diplomatic activity aimed at solving similar problems in Panama. Can the interest expressed by the United States in South Africa's compliance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council on Namibia be genuine when at the same time it ignores the contents of 'many resolutions on respect for the territorial integrity of countries, the right of all countries to exploit their own natural resources for the benefit of their peoples, and so forth, regarding Panama? What can we in Panama think of all this activity and leadership displayed by the United States to achieve decolonization in other areas of the world when it persists in maintaining a colonial situation in the very heart of our country?\n140.\tThe greatest difficulty regarding the new treaty resides in finding an acceptable duration for the parties. While the United States expressed the opinion that the duration should be 30 to 50 years, that is to say during the remainder of the useful life of the Canal, Panama considers that, for all effective purposes, we would be prepared to accept a reasonable duration not going beyond the year 2000. So far the United States has confined itself to emphasizing that all issues are negotiable, and that is why we have expressed cautious optimism.\n141.\tThe Political Declaration adopted on 18 August 1976 by the Fifth Conference of' non-aligned countries in\nColombo, Sri Lanka, reads as follows regarding the question of the Panama Canal:\n\\\"The Conference noted with satisfaction the unanimous Latin American support for the legitimate aspirations of the Republic of Panama, and associated itself with the desires expressed by the countries of the Western Hemisphere that a settlement of this question be achieved during this year of the celebration of the sesquicentennial of the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama convened by the Liberator Simon Bolivar.\n\\\"The Conference reiterated its firm support and solidarity with the Government and people of Panama in their fair struggle for their effective sovereignty and total jurisdiction over the so-called Panama Canal Zone.\n\\\"The Conference reaffirmed the support of the Nan- Aligned countries for the Panamanian control of the Panama Canal and reiterated their firm support for all efforts that the Republic of Panama will make before international forums, in particular the United Nations bodies.\n\\\"The Conference praised the progress made by the Panamanian people under the Revolutionary Government headed by General Omar Torrijos Herrera, offering any support that they may require when facing any action which may cause its destabilization.\\\" [See A/311197, annex I, paras. 110-113. J\n142.\tWe have been scrupulous in transcribing literally the above pronouncements in favor of the Panamanian cause made by the vast majority of States Members of the United Nations because we consider that these documents express the feeling of the international community with regard to the new Canal treaty. This will also make it easier for delegations represented here to have all the facts which may be useful in forming their opinions in the event that, as our Head of Government has announced, we should feel compelled formally to submit at the next session of the General Assembly in 1977 a new item entitled \\\"The question of the Panama Canal\\\".\n143.\tDuring the debates of candidates Ford and Carter on Wednesday, 6 October on matters of foreign policy and defence, the Head of Government of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, made the following statement:\n\\\"This superficial approach to the most explosive subject in the United States' relations with Latin America is extremely irresponsible. President Ford claimed credit for having no young American fighting in any part of the world. But in Panama, 20,000 soldiers of the Southern Command of the United States Army each night sleep on alert with combat boots, rifles and water bottles within reach, ready for the contingency of Latin America's claiming the sovereign rights of Panama denied to it in negotiations.\n\\\"As regards Mr. Carter, I should like to remind him that the word 'never' is one that has been deleted from the political dictionary with the era of the struggles for liberation.\\\"\n144.\tWithout wishing to interfere in the internal policy of another country, I should like at this point to say that after Mr. Gerald Ford was chosen as the candidate for the presidency of the republic of the United States by the Republican Party on 18 August and after Mr. Jimmy Carter was proclaimed candidate for the presidency of the United States by the Democratic Party, there are no serious reasons for not renewing the discussion which had been held uninterruptedly until May last, when the present North American electoral campaign brought the negotiations to a standstill.\n145.\tIn the meantime we believe that the announcement made yesterday by the Secretary of State of the United States was a timely one, namely, that negotiations are to be resumed within the next two weeks.\n146.\tBoth the Democratic Party platform and Mr. Ford under the Tack-Kissinger agreement, as well as the military authorities of the United States, affirm that they agree with the idea of a new Canal treaty. We therefore affirm that if the United States genuinely wishes to negotiate seriously and in good faith, this is the time for the North American Government to return not only towards Panama but towards Latin America, the third world, and the vast majority of the countries that are a part of the United Nations.\n147.\tPanama believes that between now and 2 November, election day in the United States, there is time to move forward considerably in the negotiations and we should not lose such precious time.\n148.\tNow I should like to refer to the problem of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. Mr. Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, in his speech before this forum filth meeting] rightly insisted on the danger of armed intervention to economic and social progress and, above all, to world peace. But he limited his apprehensions to the particular situation of southern Africa. He was, in fact, speaking of military forces exclusively in the immediate, obvious and violent form of intervention.\n149.\tMy country believes that the principle of non-intervention should be extended to all forms of intervention, regardless of semantic disguise, because there are other forms of intervention-far more effective than the armed variety that are carried out surreptitiously at economic and social levels.\n150.\tWe must therefore insist on the validity of the principle of non-intervention not only when it refers to aimed struggle in southern Africa, in the. Near East or on the Asian continent, but also throughout Latin America, including the Caribbean. We do so because foreign intervention in almost every case is contrary to international law, to the principles of self-determination of peoples, of national sovereignty, and, it should be emphasized, to the very principles of the United Nations Charter that is the origin and justification for this Assembly of the nations of the world.\n151.\tFor all these reasons, Panama declares its unflagging faith in the United Nations and reaffirms its desire for effective sovereignty and independence which, when achieved, cannot be pawned in the interests of any given Power or group of Powers, but, free from political commitments, will serve Panama and all its friends among the peoples of the world.\n152.\tWe agree with the statement made by the Major of Miami, Mr. Maurice Ferre, at the Democratic Party Convention that we must put an immediate stop to the political maneuvers that have blocked the course of positive action on behalf of a new Panama Canal treaty.\n153.\tThe New York Times was emphatic in its editorial of 27 September 1976:\n\\\"It would be an unspeakable tragedy if a new Panama Canal treaty -an imperative for future United States relations with Latin America -should become a casualty of the American Presidential campaign... It is up to President Ford to send Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker back to Panama ...\\\"\n154.\tThe Washington Post of 3 October 1976 said:\n\\\"Gen. George S. Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, publicly urges the President to get on with negotiations. Otherwise, he warns, there could be trouble. 'You'd be lighting men you can't identify at a time and place of\ntheir choosing\tThat's not the way, in my judgment,\nto assure the continued maintenance and operation of the Canal.'\\\"\nElsewhere, the editorial states:\n\\\"In fact, Panama has been remarkably patient and understanding. It merely wants to negotiate the treaty that the U.S. has solemnly promised to negotiate.\\\"\n155.\tThat negotiation is essential to put a peaceful end to the lacerating colonial situation which exists in the heart of Panamanian territory before the national feeling of our people wrests the solution to the problem from the hands of the diplomats.\n156.\tGiven the vacillation and the confusion of the two North American presidential candidates on the question of the Canal, I am certain that in Panama my fellow citizens will present a united front so that the world will continue to support us in our inflexible will to recover effective sovereignty over all our national territory.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure, on behalf of my delegation and myself, to extend to the\nPresident our warmest congratulations and best wishes on his election as President of the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly. We are fortunate indeed to have the benefit of his outstanding ability, wide experience and dynamic leadership in directing our deliberations. His election is also a tribute to his country and its people.\n273.\tI should like to take this opportunity to extend to his predecessor, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, my delegation's admiration for his able direction of the last session of the General Assembly.\n274.\tWe should also like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his dedication to the principles and goals of the United Nations Charter, and his persistent efforts in drawing the attention of the Member States to fundamental problems facing mankind. In extending our continued support, we wish him every success in discharging the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him for preserving international peace and security.\n275.\tWhen directing our deliberations to issues related to the preservation of international peace and security, and expressing appreciation for efforts made in this direction, we cannot fail to observe that there are manifold problems in our troubled world that constitute grave and serious challenges. It is indeed a source of great disappointment that in view of the bitter experiences of the First, and particularly the Second World War, representatives of Member States who have assembled here every year since the establishment of this world Organization have not been successful in seeking the means of realizing most of the high ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n276.\tLet us then, as Members of this world body, be united in examining and evaluating the underlying factors of these challenges, and show determination in overcoming them without bias or discrimination and resolve to free both our own and future generations of such threats. This is the cardinal duty of this world Organization and of each of its Members.\n277.\tContradictions prevailing in our world are contrary to our expectations and most certainly to those of its founding Members.\n278.\tWhen we examine the tragic situation in southern Africa and observe that the indigenous population of those territories, in no manner different from us in being entitled to basic human rights, is deprived of its individual and political rights by illegal minority regimes under the obnoxious policies of apartheid and racial discrimination, it is difficult to believe that this is happening in an epoch that considers respect for human rights and the rights of individuals as primary and essential obligations. Such policies remind us of medieval times, and eras of class exploitation when one class or group of individuals claimed superiority over their fellow men. It is even more disappointing that the world Organization has continued to remain helpless in the face of such injustices and has failed to put an end to such acts of discrimination and violation of fundamental human rights. We earnestly hope, however, that such a state of affairs will no longer prevail and that these evils of discrimination will be brought to an end, and people under foreign and alien domination fulfill their hopes and aspirations.\n279.\tOn the other hand, crises in the world economic situation give rise to worry and anxiety. If a new economic order is not established, the confrontation between the \\\"haves\\\" and \\\"have-nots\\\" will place our world in two conflicting groups, which in itself constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security.\n280.\tWith these few remarks for a general introduction, I shall now outline the views of my delegation on some specific items on our agenda for this year.\n281.\tAfghanistan feels immense satisfaction whenever the struggle for national freedom gives birth to new sovereign States. It is therefore with joy that we welcome the newly independent Republic of Seychelles as a Member of this world Organization, and we look forward to co-operating with it.\n282.\tWe are following with keen interest the recent developments towards the achievement of a just and final solution of the existing problems in southern Africa, to which my country has always attached great importance. As a staunch supporter of the principles of freedom, nationalism and respect for the rights of nations, Afghanistan hopes that these efforts will eventually enable the peoples of southern Africa, who have suffered under the oppression of the privileged classes, to attain their ideals and aspirations.\n283.\tIn pursuit of its foreign policy based essentially on non-alignment the Republic of Afghanistan has maintained the best of relations with all the peace-loving nations of the world and with its neighbors. With regard to Pakistan, with which we have had and still have a long-standing political difference, which was brought to the attention of this Assembly last year and in previous years, I am happy to state that a thaw has occurred in our relations and that dialog between the leaders of the two countries has begun. We hope that, as a result of these contacts and future talks between the two leaders, our political difference will find a just and honorable solution.\n284.\tI was encouraged to heat what the Minister of State for Defense and Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, Mr. Aziz Ahmed, said yesterday [8th Meeting} regarding relations between our two countries. I should like to take this opportunity to express the hope that the only political problem existing between us will find a final settlement. My fellow representatives, the only way in which all of us can resolve our differences entirely is through peaceful negotiations. I can assure this world body that we are looking forward to an honorable solution of the political difference between Afghanistan and Pakistan, based on realities and through peaceful negotiations.\n285.\tIt is satisfying to note that since the historic Algiers Conference  the triumphant victories of liberation movements have given new impetus to the struggle for freedom and justice in Africa and elsewhere. Afghanistan has consistently supported the complete elimination of alien domination, colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. My delegation reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Namibia to self-determination and independence. We also support the legitimate cause and inalienable rights of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence based on majority rule. Similarly, my delegation supports the legitimate struggle of the national liberation movements of Azania for the eradication of apartheid and the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination.\n286.\tThe situation prevailing in the Middle East still remains a dangerous focus of conflict, thus posing a great threat to international peace and security. This state of affairs is due to the persistence of Israel in its aggressive, expansionist, racist policy of occupation, its flagrant denial of the national rights of the Palestinian people as recognized by the United Nations and its contempt for the principles of the United Nations Charter, the resolutions of this Organization and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n287.\tAs repeatedly stated by my Government, the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem. There will be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinian people exercise all their legitimate rights, particularly the right to return to their homeland in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, and fully enjoy their right to self-determination, including the right to establish their independent State. In this respect my delegation strongly supports the recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [see A/31/35] and regrets that the Security Council was not in a position to endorse them.\n288.\tMy delegation is gravely concerned at the tragic situation of human suffering and material loss prevailing in Lebanon and appeals to all the parties concerned to resolve their differences through peaceful measures as soon as possible and to re-establish conditions of peace and security by respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon.\n289.\tWith regard to the situation in Cyprus, Afghanistan supports the territorial integrity, sovereignty and non-alignment of that Republic and regards the principles set forth in General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) as still valid for the solution of the Cyprus problem. We believe that negotiations between the representatives of the two communities conducted under the auspices of the Secretary- General of the United Nations ought to lead to a mutually satisfactory and freely accepted agreement for arriving at a just and lasting solution that would enable the two communities to coexist in peace and harmony.\n290.\tMuch has been said about detente and we are all agreed that much can be done to spread detente to all comers of the world. Distinction must however be made between detente brought about by foreboding and the dark, shadows of the forces of fear and detente arising from a respect for the principles of peaceful coexistence. The former is foredoomed; the latter is of a lasting nature and provides more fertile and sound ground for international peace and security. It is being increasingly recognized that, without universal implementation of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence and a spirit of true co-operation, detente would be an impossibility and the destiny of mankind uncertain.\n291.\tIn this context allow me to quote from the statement delivered by the Head of State and Rime Minister of Afghanistan at the recent Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Colombo:\n\\\"Of late we hear of detente. We have to say that it is good. But we cannot ignore the fact that detente resulting from respect for the principles of coexistence differs from detente brought about by fear. What is more important is that ddtente must be universal. What can be the most important factor of world peace and security is world\u00acwide coexistence which can emanate from a spirit of sincere co-operation for the balanced improvement of the human race in all parts of the world in the interest of world peace and security.\\\"\n292.\tWith regard to present issues related to disarmament, my delegation reiterates its policy for general and complete disarmament and, in particular, nuclear disarmament. To this end we fully support the convening of a world disarmament conference or a special session of the General Assembly as soon as possible. Within the context of the current economic crisis, any international agreement for a reduction in the enormous armaments expenditure could make additional resources available for the social and economic development of the international community as a whole and the developing and least developed countries in particular. We also support the peaceful use of nuclear energy for the development of all nations and of the developing countries in particular.\n293.\tMy delegation supports the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], and calls upon all States to implement its provisions. TTiis would undoubtedly contribute to inter-national peace and security in the area.\n294.\tTo. this end, and in pursuance of the relevant resolutions of the Colombo Conference [see AI31/197, annex IV] my delegation supports the idea that the necessary consultations should take place to lay the groundwork for the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean with the participation of all States to adopt measures for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\n295.\tThere is a growing awareness of the inseparable link between economic development and the maintenance of international peace and security; indeed, the struggle for political independence and sovereign equality cannot be separated from the struggle for the attainment of economic emancipation. The historic resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions, based on the fundamental principles of full, permanent and unreserved sovereignty over natural resources, a fair price for raw materials and primary commodities and the reform of the international monetary system, including a new and realistic approach to the debt problems of the developing, and especially the least- developed, countries heralded the dawn of a new global system and a new international economic order.\n296.\tIn spite of these momentous events and although significant progress has been achieved in certain sectors, an over-all appraisal of achievements in real terms is rather limited.\n297.\tThe unique and distinct disadvantages of a geographically land-locked position, compounded with developing problems and geophysically built-in obstacles and impediments to economic development, especially the lack of direct access to and from the sea, is so self-evident that it hardly requires reiteration or further elaboration. The fundamental right of free transit essential to the economic and social development of the land-locked countries has been reiterated and reaffirmed at various international forums, and more recently at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.\n298.\tMy delegation earnestly hopes that in view of the inseparable link between the right of free access to and from the sea and development, necessary measures will be adopted by the world community towards the expeditious and practical implementation of this vital right.\n299.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, under its Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)], accorded full recognition to the various problems confronting the land-locked least-developed countries, including measures to be taken to compensate them for their additional transportation and transit costs, through the creation of a Special Fund. It was only during the seventh special session and the thirtieth session of the General Assembly that finally, on the initiative of the delegation of Afghanistan, a Special Fund was established under resolution 3504 (XXX) to compensate the land-locked countries for their additional transportation and transit costs. Based on this mandate and the relevant provisions of the Manila Declaration,  and on the decisions of the fourth session of UNCTAD, necessary steps must be taken towards making the Fund operational as soon as possible.\n300.\tSimilarly, my delegation fully supports all special measures in favor of the least-developed and land-locked developing countries. Taking into account the urgent needs of those countries and the fact that their enormous difficulties constitute a heavy burden and, directly and indirectly, have far-reaching negative ramifications on their development efforts, we hope that this session of the General Assembly will energetically pursue the translation into action of the various recommendations and resolutions adopted in this field.\n301.\tThe prevailing monetary system needs a radical overhaul and reform to ensure an increase in the role of special drawing rights in international reserves and parity in decision-making between developed and developing countries. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund should not restrict itself to purely monetary problems, but should be ready to extend balance-of-payments support and developmental assistance to the developing and least- developed countries.\n302.\tIn the field of transfer of technology and know-how, my delegation fully endorses the proposals and recommendations contained in the Manila Declaration, and we hope that appropriate measures will be taken by the responsible United Nations organs, especially UNCTAD and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, towards adopting comprehensive and effective measures to enable developing and least-developed countries to have access, on favorable terms, to technological know-how and expertise at a cost commensurate with their financial ability and in accordance with their respective national goals and available resources.\n303.\tIt has been only a few weeks since most of us gathered in your beautiful country, Mr. President, to deliberate on pressing social, political and economic issues. The economic resolutions adopted' at the Colombo Conference laid sound ground for international co-operation in offering tangible solutions to these problems. It is our earnest hope that the decisions adopted at that Conference will receive the strong support of this great Assembly.\n304.\tWe have sighted our common challenges and common destiny in a determined effort to seek solutions to present conflicts and to find better prospects for the peace and progress desperately required in our troubled world. We must take a realistic approach to bridge the great disparity between the affluent and the developing nations through the establishment of a new economic order, deploy ceaseless efforts to eliminate the last remnants and vestiges of colonialism, and ensure respect for human rights and the right to self-determination and independence for all peoples of the world. Let us live in peace and harmony and give expression to our resolutions to achieve our common destiny and purpose by striving harder to translate these objectives into realities and, in doing so, to give greater meaning and significance to the principles of our Charter by achieving a better and more durable atmosphere of peace conducive to the progress and development of our ailing and trouble-stricken planet.\n"

        "file_text": "It will be exactly one year on 12 November next since this Assembly, almost unanimously, admitted the Comoros to membership in the United Nations.\n2.\tThese 11 months have enabled us to appreciate both the stature of the institution and the value of the men who bear responsibility in the Organization. For this reason, I should like to express to Mr. Amerasinghe the satisfaction of my delegation at seeing him presiding over this session of the Assembly. In a world where covetousness and unfulfilled ambitions hold sway, how can we fail to appreciate highly the judicious choice that has been made by our Assembly? For this forum, where the most authoritative voices of our planet speak out, needs to be imbued with the wisdom and philosophy that characterize the peoples of the Asian subcontinent, which the President represents so well. Mr. Amerasinghe may rely on the co-operation of my delegation to ensure that the work of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success.\n3.\tWith the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung a great figure of contemporary, history has passed away. The Comoros associates itself closely with the well-deserved tribute paid by our Organization to the man who placed the whole of his life at the service of those who fight for freedom and dignity.\n4.\tMuch has often been said about the non-viability of micro-States, including the Comoros. My delegation wishes to express its sincere and warm congratulations to the Government and people of Seychelles, which was admitted to membership in our Organization on 21 September and with which we maintain the best possible relations. On this occasion, I should like to convince Member States that the elements which define a nation are not the same as those which characterize an economic Power and, still less, those which characterize a military Power. First of all, every people has a right to existence and freedom; every people has a right to dignity and respect; and every people has a right freely to choose its political and economic destiny.\n5.\tThe wisdom and efficiency, like the grandeur of a people, can no longer be measured by taking into account only its reserve of nuclear power megatons or the number of its military victories. Henceforth we must establish a new criterion: that of proven respect for the principles of our Charter.\n6.\tBy establishing a hierarchy and entrusting roles to one and to another, we are in the process of converting our Organization into an instrument at the service of the most powerful; hence we are in the process of betraying the commitments undertaken at San Francisco to which we all subscribed.\n7.\tBy virtue of those commitments and to expedite the process that should lead to the universality of our Organization, the Comoros unreservedly supports the admission to our Organization of the brave peoples of Angola and Viet Nam.\n8.\tThe anguish that besets the whole of mankind, like the uncertainties surrounding the future of peoples, finds its sole source in the egocentricity of States in a universe where the interdependence of nations is a reality that can no longer to denied.\n9.\tMy delegation wishes the greatest success to the thirty-first session of the General Assembly and nurtures the hope that in the course of the current session wisdom will prevail and international peace and security will triumph throughout the world.\n10.\tIt is in this spirit of peace, security and progress which governs all our decisions that I shall now go on to speak of the problems which torment mankind.\n11.\tToday we could have witnessed a happy ending to the process of decolonization as advocated by our Organization. But at a time when the nationalist forces in southern Africa, have unleashed a valiant offensive, unique of its kind, to obtain the! right to self-determination and independence, the champions of colonialism and all the forces of evil have rallied to place: themselves at the service .of Vorster.\n12.\tThe sale of nuclear power plants, and the delivery of weapons to South Africa have no other meaning for Africa \nthan the will is strengthen, the military potential of the Fascist regime of Vorster and consequently to encourage it to commit massacres and to hinder the progress of the struggle for liberation.\n13.\tWhat happened in Soweto and in other places in South Africa is a clear-cut crime that we should all condemn with our last breath.\n14.\tVorster intends to grant so-called independence to the Transkei. The main object of that farce is to undermine the national unity of the Azanian people and must be strongly rejected. We must embark resolutely upon the course of the total isolation of the minority regimes in southern Africa.\n15.\tWith respect to Namibia, we note that in flouting all the resolutions adopted by the international community, South Africa continues to occupy that Territory and persists in applying there its laws and practices of repression, the basis of which is the policy of apartheid. Confronted by this denial of the fundamental principles of human rights, our Organization cannot look on as powerless spectators of the drama of the.Namibian people. The policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\", which is a defiance of the sacred principles of our Charter, seeks only to violate the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.\n16.\tThe Comorian State, faithful to the principles which govern States, is particularly attached to the principle of respect for the political unity and inviolability of the frontiers of States and cannot at this point do more than address an appeal to all Members of this Organization to put an end to those deliberate acts of violation of our Charter.\n17.\tSouth Africa must return power to the Namibians. In order to do so propitious conditions for true independence must be created. The Comorian State subscribes unreservedly to the idea of convening, under the aegis of the United Nations, a constitutional conference with the participation of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the legitimate representative of the Namibian people.\n18.\tMy country believes that prior to the convening of that conference the flowing must be done: all discriminatory laws and measures must be abrogated; all political prisoners must be released; all Namibians at present in exile for political reasons should be allowed to return to their country without risk to themselves; the conference entrusted with the creation and legalization of \\\"bantustan homelands\\\" must be dissolved; and all South African military troops must be withdrawn from Namibian territory. The Comorian State considers that those minimal conditions, once fulfilled, are the only.ones capable, on the one and, of proving the sincerity of South Africa, and, on the other hand, of instituting the necessary political climate for the success of the conference.\n19.\tWith regard to Zimbabwe, since the declaration of the independence of Southern Rhodesia in 1965 by the white settlers living in that Territory, we must note with sorrow that certain countries, among them the most powerful, continue to maintain the best possible relations with the racist regime of Salisbury, providing it thus with the means of resisting the assault of the Zimbabwe nationalists. It is worthy of note that despite that active complicity, the resolution of the freedom fighters and of the aroused masses is stronger than ever and we are convinced that their victory is close.\n20.\tBy reason precisely of the pressure of the struggle and the opening of new avenues of confrontation throughout the country, and thanks to international opinion, which is increasingly in favor of the cause of liberation, the shameful regime of Ian Smith has had to face up to the exodus of the whites and the slowing down of immigration, which renders even more fragile the already precarious position of the white minority in Zimbabwe.\n21.\tWe must reaffirm the inalienable right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence as well as the legitimacy of the struggle that they are waging to obtain the enjoyment of that right. This whole process can be achieved only in so far as a transitional blade majority government has full and complete responsibility for the management of the country's affairs.\n22.\tWe sincerely hope that the constitutional conference convened by Great Britain, the administering Power of Rhodesia, will comply with the legitimate wishes and aspirations of the African peoples, and in particular of the people of Zimbabwe.\n23.\tMy Government follows with interest the actions undertaken by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, in southern Africa, the objective of which is to create the conditions for a peaceful settlement of the problems arising in that region.\n24.\tWith respect to Djibouti, it would appear that the process of independence has already been triggered. It is up to us now to demand here of the administering Power that it expedite the process, and we must warn it against its well-known methods of seeking to divide the people and to violate the integrity of the Territory as it did in the Comoros.\n25.\tThe world is concerned today with the serious situation which prevails in Korea, a situation which places the region in a state of crisis which could lead to a confrontation. We must encourage the efforts made by the two Koreas towards the peaceful reunification of their country.\n26.\tIn the Middle East, the situation has remained the same since the last session: Israel persists in its obstinacy, in its intransigent attitude and in its resistance to any peace initiative, thus showing the international community its expansionist aims.\n27.\tAny solution to the Middle. East problem necessarily involves the withdrawal by Israel from the. occupied territories and recognition, on the one hand, of the national rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the principles set forth in our Charter, and, on the other hand, the right to existence of all the peoples in the Middle East in territories with secure and guaranteed boundaries.\n28.\tWith respect to Cyprus, we must apply General Assembly resolution 3395 (XXX) and above all seek to ensure respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that country.\n29.\tThe progress of detente, we must acknowledge, is still very limited both in its scope and in its geographic extension: the danger that the great Powers might plunge mankind into a nuclear holocaust has not completely disappeared. In fact, the agreements which they conclude among themselves and which permit those industrialized countries to establish profitable economic relations merely redirect the areas of conflict towards the third world. For those Powers detente very often is no more than confrontation through third countries or peoples, in which the poorest bear the burden of the war.\n30.\tWhile none of the great Powers has a coast on the Indian Ocean, their presence in that ocean becomes more and more preoccupying each day. That ocean, which we want to preserve as a zone of peace, runs the risk of becoming tomorrow the battleground for those hegemonies which dispute control in Africa, the Near East and Asia.\n31.\tIn the displacement of the areas of conflict far from the industrial zones of the developed countries and close to the areas producing primary commodities, we believe that we, the developing countries, bear a great responsibility. It is only through lack of cohesion among ourselves and trust in each other that this threatening evolution is possible. That is why the Comorian State is in favor of the convening of a conference of all the coastal countries on the Indian Ocean for the purpose of harmonizing their action in order that all the conditions can be established to allow for the implementation of resolution 2832 (XXVI) in the spirit that the international community has wished to give it.\n32.\tLet us now turn to the Comoros. It is a burning subject which has strongly attracted international opinion, especially in the third world. I should not like at this stage to open a debate on the question included as item 125 of our agenda, which will be debated in plenary meetings. I therefore reserve the right to provide more information and to express the view of my Government on this question.\n33.\tFor the time being I shall confine myself to outlining the spirit and the framework in which the French Government and the Comorian Government entered into the process of bringing the Comoros to independence and the reasons why, as can be seen, having started with a dialog we ended up in a confrontation.\n34.\tThe French Constitution states: \\\"The French Republic, faithful to its traditions, abides by the rules of international law.\\\" Now, international law includes the United Nations Charter, which France has agreed to abide by and to which the Comorian State is fully pledged as a State Member of the Organization.\n35.\tWith regard to the rules and the laws of the French Government and Parliament, all laws, and public administration regulations, starting with the decree of 9 September 1889-and here I shall cite but a few: the law of 9 May 1946, the law of 17 April 1952, the decree of 22 July 1957, the law of 22 December 1961 and the law of 3 January 1968-have confirmed the political unity and the territorial integrity of the Comoros, composed of the islands of Anjouan, Mayotte, Moheli and Grande Comore.\n36.\tTurning to what the highest authorities of the French State have said on the subject, I would remind representatives of the solemn public statement of the President of the French Republic, Mr.Giscard d'Estaing, of 24 October 1974 that: \\\"The Comoros are a single unit, they have always been a single unit, and it is natural that their fate should be a common fate ...\\\"\n37.\tHow, then, on such a clear and precise legal basis and with such solemn commitments have we arrived at the situation that regrettably confronts us today in which negotiations with the French Government have been broken off.\n38.\tThe readiness of the French Government to engage in a dialog and to seek a solution to this problem keeps on being dangled in front of us. As for the desire for dialog, I should like the international community to attribute it to the people and the Government of the Comoros, for in 1973, during the first discussions in Paris on the accession of the Comoros to independence; in June 1974, when it became a matter of determining the modalities for the organization of the referendum which took place the same year; and, finally, in October 1975, when the Comorian Government, three months after independence, itself requested and sought to renew the dialog, the Comorian side always committed itself with firm determination to seek out ways and means susceptible of promoting a rapid solution of the problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte, a solution which must necessarily respect the principles of our Charter and fully meet the legitimate aspirations of the Comorian people.\n39.\tI should like to state before this Assembly that any time the opportunity is given us we shall give proof of this desire for dialog which for my Government has become a doctrine and a method of action. Political problems, whether bilateral or of international scope, can be resolved through dialog, and we are convinced that, by resort to this method in frankness and sincerity, many, if not all, of the problems facing the world could be resolved.\n40.\tWe intend to defend the legitimate cause of the Comorian people with firmness and determination. We are ready to defend it everywhere in New York as in Paris, in Colombo as at Libreville. In May 1976, my country took part in the work of the Franco-African Conference which was held in Paris  at the invitation of the President of the Republic of Senegal, Leopold Sedar Setnghor. That is additional proof that the Comorian people is in favour of any initiative whose result would be the reinstatement of Mayotte within the Comorian entity.\n41.\tWhat do we observe from the other side? France, after having signed the joint declaration on the accession to independence of the Comoros oh 15 June 1973, after having, pursuant to a law of its own Parliament, organized the referendum on self-determination of 22 December 1974 the result favoring independence is known to all after 130 years of colonization during which at no time was the legality of the Comorian entity questioned, after all the discussions and the statements to which I have just referred, whose only purpose is to seek a just solution and to safeguard the political unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros-France, I say has not come up with any other approach than that of occupying the Comorian island of Mayotte on 6 July 1975 in defiance of international morality, the principles of our Charter and the value of its alliances in Africa and its friendships throughout the Muslim world.\n42.\tFrance is applying to the Comoros a strategy that has three aims: first, it wishes to consolidate its position in Mayotte, that is, first of all the establishment, starting on 6 July 1975, of a strong, inflexible and omnipresent administration in the island, which is completely out of reach of the control of the Comorian central authorities; secondly, it wishes to legalize this situation by organizing in Mayotte a series of referendums whose purpose is to justify the occupation of the island; and, thirdly, it wishes to bring about, by the intensive behind-the-scenes propaganda of its diplomatic representatives abroad, the isolation of the Comoros and to deprive the Comorian cause of endorsement and support, thus rendering it a lost cause from the outset.\n43.\tIt seems to us that it is our duty to indicate to the Assembly that, for the consolidation of the independence of the Comoros, which it admitted as a Member of the United Nations on 12 November last, it is absolutely necessary for international solidarity to play a full role.\n44.\tI should like here to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who ever since he has assumed the heavy responsibilities of Secretary-General has ceaselessly been striving to bring about the essential objectives of our Charter, namely, peace, security and progress throughout the world.\n45.\tThe Mayotte affair constitutes a precedent fraught with consequences for the stability and the security of the independent African countries of the region and for the integrity of the young nations which, faced by numerous socio-economic problems, run the risk of being divided by outside forces, We note with sorrow that this is the first time that an independent State, which has been recognized by the international community, has been subjected to a process of recolonization. Faced with this crisis, the Comorian people is equally aware of the importance of what is at stake sad of the scope of the struggle which it has to wage. It was in this context that on 14 November 1975 the Comorian Head of State our brother Ali Soilih, declared:\n\\\"We shall assume bur responsibilities; we shall assume them because we shall never confuse friendship with humiliation, because nature has given the Comorian certain qualities simplicity, a sense of honour endurance and resistance to privation-and because, in any event, our cause is just. Our struggle is a worthy one and we are convinced that the Comorian people will emerge from this test united, strong and mature.\\\"\n46.\tOur cohesion, our determination, respect for the fundamental principles of our Organization will together ensure total and complete success to the lofty and historic mission which has been entrusted to us.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, allow me, first of all, to join the representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you on your well-deserved election to the high office of President of the thirty-first regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation is confident that in the genuine tradition of justice and equity, which are vital principles of non-alignment, your dedication and eminent qualities will guide this session to a successful conclusion. We are particularly happy that we have a President from Sri Lanka, a non-aligned country, where the latest summit Conference of non-aligned countries has just been held. We are convinced that your eminent qualities as an experienced and able diplomat, which have proved invaluable in the current negotiations on the law of the sea, will be a great asset to this session. On behalf of the Zambian delegation, I pledge our co-operation in the execution of your heavy and important task.\n159.\tMay I also pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, for his untiring and successful efforts in presiding over the deliberations of the thirtieth regular session of this Assembly.\n160.\tThe death of Chairman Mao Tsetung has left the people of Zambia with a deep sense of grief. Chairman Mao Tsetung symbolized those qualities that have marked and will continue to mark the outstanding and phenomenal achievements of the People's Republic of China and that country's contribution to the world as a whole in many fields of human endeavor. Chairman Mao Tsetung was a great revolutionary leader whose life was a shining example of dedication and self-sacrifice in the cause of the Chinese people and that of mankind as a whole. Even before the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921, he dedicated his life to the cause of the oppressed people of China against imperialism and domestic reaction. He was a worker, a teacher, a great guerrilla leader, a philosopher and a great statesman. In all these and other walks of life, he was an uncompromising champion of the cause of the downtrodden.\n161.\tChina's commitment to the cause of liberation and to the fundamental rights and interests of the developing world is an inspiration to the majority of mankind. We in Zambia mourn Chairman Mao Tsetung because he and his great revolutionary country have been reliable supporters, not only of Zambia, but of our oppressed brothers and sisters in southern Africa. Under the wise chairmanship of Mao Tsetung, the friendly people of China have forged a profound bond of friendship and co-operation based on a genuine commitment to the just cause of mankind. Chair-man Mao Tsetung has left us with lasting inspiration and pride.\n162.\tIn this connexion, Mr. President, I wish to convey, through you, to the delegation of the People's Republic of China my delegation's profound sense of sorrow and grief at the death of that great revolutionary leader.\n163.\tSince the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, little has taken place to shift the balance on the inter-national scene from one of too much emphasis on national or regional military strength to one of a fairer consideration of the genuine needs of the entire world community. Yet the fulfillment of the basic needs of mankind as a whole is a more secure basis for international peace and security. In the contemporary world, the United Nations is placed in a difficult position; for, while it is trying to promote the genuine needs of mankind in the political, economic, cultural and other fields, it is often subjected to pressures and even bullying from 'those of its membership who use their near-monopoly of crude physical power without international authority.\n164.\tLet me briefly address myself to a great challenge of our time -namely, development and international economic co-operation.\n165.\tDuring the past year, development and co-operation for development have increasingly become important in international politics. Indeed, development issues have today acquired a dominant, if not central, place in world affairs and in the minds of statesmen. In a real sense, development and international co-operation for development have now regained the attention previously held in the early 1960 s, when the First United Nations Development Decade was initiated by this world body in order to pursue policies to accelerate the economic and social progress of developing countries.\n166.\tThis is indeed as it should be, for we have all witnessed with great consternation the widening gap be-tween expectations and fulfillment in the intervening period of IS years. The hopes and aspirations of the developing nations occasioned by past declarations of Development Decades have remained largely disappointed and unfulfilled. Such hopes and aspirations for a greater and a more equitable share in the world's economic and social benefits have nevertheless continued to rise. They have not, however, been met with corresponding commitment and concrete action from the developed countries.\n167.\tMeanwhile, in the face of prolonged neglect or indifference on the part of the developed countries, old problems have become more complex, new problems have been created, and crises have emerged. Consequently, the economic and social situation of the developing nations has further continued to deteriorate. We are familiar with the various serious and complex difficulties still confronting the developing nations-difficulties which have adversely affected the ability of their Governments to ensure even basic standards of living for their peoples.\n168.\tWe in Zambia know these economic difficulties too well, having attained political independence barely 12 years ago. Since independence, the ruling United National Independence Party, the Government and peace-loving people of Zambia have vigorously worked towards the diversification of a once copper-oriented economy. We are proud to say that encouraging results are already evident with regard to self-sufficiency in staple food commodities. The implementation of the Zambian philosophy of humanism, a basic communal form of socialism which capitalizes on the importance of a man-centered society, has led to marked progress in the vital fields of rural reconstruction, education, health, agriculture and economic reforms.\n169.\tUnfortunately, on the international scene, the continued lack of significant progress in the important areas of trade, transfer of capital resources, debt adjustments, monetary reform, the transfer and development of appropriate technology to and within the developing countries constitute a major source of profound concern. In addition, the developing countries have had to bear the brunt of the world economic crisis, especially the ominous effects of recession and inflation in industrial countries.\n170.\tThe complex problems which have afflicted the world economy in general, and the economies of poor countries in particular, have served to demonstrate and highlight the highly interdependent character of the world community. They have, with equal force, underlined the imperative necessity for bold and comprehensive solutions which correspond, both in scope and magnitude, to those complex problems.\n171.\tSignificantly renewed and expanded efforts aimed at assisting the developing countries to be self-reliant have become all the more urgent and imperative. Evidently, additional means for an adequate effort to assist the developing countries are within the capabilities of the international community. The critical situation of the developing nations for the world social 2nd political environment must be accurately perceived and understood.\n172.\tIsolated, half-hearted and marginal measures applied thus far by industrialized countries are clearly inadequate to the gigantic task now before us, namely, to achieve a new and viable world order based on equity, justice and equality of economic opportunity among all countries- developed and developing, big and small. The costs of establishing such a world order are much less than the costs of the arms race, and the stakes for its achievement much higher.\n173.\tThe road towards the establishment of a new international economic order has already been clearly defined. The task ahead will, admittedly, be difficult. The cardinal point that should be borne in mind is that the movement towards the new international economic order cannot be dismissed casually by any one individual or group of countries.\n174.\tThe United Nations General Assembly, in both its sixth and seventh special sessions, has affirmed the principle of economic interdependence between the developed and developing countries. In addition, it has affirmed the principle of collective responsibility for the economic well-being and security of the world's developing nations. Moreover, common agreement was reached at the seventh special session on the need for structural changes in international economic relations through negotiation and mutual accommodation.\n175.\tThese are some of the main objectives within the context of the new international economic order which it is now the solemn duty of all States, in particular those materially better off, to attain through concerted means. Other key objectives are contained, inter alia, in the declarations adopted at the recent United Nations conferences on industrialization, food, employment and habitat.\n176.\tIt is therefore now incumbent on the community of nations to seize the opportunities thus afforded to give expression to its avowed solidarity in order to fulfill the commitment to change.\n177.\tDuring the past year, there have been signs of small, yet fairly significant and, it is to be hoped, irreversible, beginnings in our common endeavor to evolve a viable world order. One could discern a growing determination to work towards the achievement and equitable sharing of economic opportunities and the fruits of development. Although limited in both scope and magnitude, reference could be made to the decisions taken by the International Monetary Fund at its meeting in Kingston in January this year; the fourth session of UNCTAD held in May this year in Nairobi; the Conference on International Economic Co-operation currently taking place in Paris; and the application of the Lome Convention*\n178.\tInternational negotiations in process or in prospect, such as those within the framework of the Paris dialog or UNCTAD, require renewed political impetus to facilitate common agreement on the specific means and institutions for solving key global problems.\n179.\tIn this connexion, my delegation would like to urge speedy agreement on, inter alia, the establishment of the common fund for financing buffer stocks-a fund to which Zambia has already pledged to contribute-and effective measures for dealing with the critical debt problems facing many developing countries.\n180.\tIt is also encouraging that the developing countries have now, more than ever before, demonstrated their determination to develop and enhance their mutual co-operation in various fields, implementing thereby the principle of collective self-reliance which they have long espoused and championed.\n181.\tThe relevant decisions adopted, both at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries held at Colombo and at the recent Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries held in Mexico, bear eloquent testimony to the heightened sense of collective self-reliance among the developing countries.\n182.\tThe developing countries recognize the fact that the development of their peoples and economies depends primarily on their own efforts, although the success of their development efforts could be eased, or frustrated, by international assistance and trade policies.\n183.\tThe achievement of greater self-reliance among the developing countries constitutes an indispensable ingredient of the new international economic order. It is a vital objective which deserves the unqualified support of the industrial countries.\n184.\tFor a viable and just world order, which we are all seeking to establish, depends on collective self-reliance and progress in the developing countries and on co-operation and willingness to assist on the part of the industrial Countries. In the spirit of the growing recognition of interdependent interests of developed and developing countries and given the importance of equality of economic opportunity among nations, my delegation would strongly urge the developed countries to support and encourage developing countries in their determined efforts at achieving collective self-reliance.\n185.\t-\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is far from accomplishing the task for which it was convened, namely, the adoption of a convention dealing with all matters relating to the law of the sea.\n186.\tThe Conference has yet to resolve central issues relating to various important matters such as, first, the rights and interests of all States to all natural resources in the area beyond the territorial seas of coastal States - whether those States are land-locked, coastal or geographically disadvantaged; secondly, issues relating to the exercise by land-locked States of their right of free access to and from the sea; and thirdly, rational exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed as the common heritage of all mankind and the equitable distribution of benefits derived therefrom.\n187.\tMy delegation is aware that various proposals have been presented to the Conference on the Law of the Sea. My own delegation to that Conference is one of those that have presented concrete proposals. In relation to the first of the three matters to which I have just referred, I should like to mention specifically one important proposal which could very well lead to a break-through in the negotiations and provide a nucleus of an emerging consensus.\n188.\tZambia believes that the world community should continue to recognize a belt of ocean space, of suitable width, known as the territorial sea of coastal States. This could probably be extended by the Conference on the Law of the Sea to 12 nautical miles, measured from the coasts of such States.\n189.\tBeyond such limits, however, the area and its resources should continue to belong to all mankind and may be apportioned according to regions or subregions. All States in such regions or subregions, whether land-locked, coastal or geographically disadvantaged, should continue to have equal rights, especially with regard to all natural resources. Such areas, which could be delimited in such a manner as not to undermine the economic viability of the remainder of the international area, might be known as regional or subregional economic zones.\n190.\tSimilarly, proposals reflecting equitable, solutions have been made in respect of the second and third matters that I have just mentioned. Zambia's position on both these matters has already been elaborated in the course of the current negotiations on the law of the sea.\n191.\tMy delegation has a keen interest in ensuring that the Conference on the Law of the Sea achieves satisfactory results. It should do so expeditiously but without sacrificing the hopes of all mankind for equity and justice. It is my delegation's view that this will be possible if all participating States renew their faith in, and recognition of, the fact that the mandate of the Conference relates to the ocean space and its resources which are the common heritage of all mankind and res communis. All States, whether land-locked, coastal or geographically disadvantaged, are looking forward to the equitable sharing of benefits derived from this common heritage.\n192.\tPeople want to be free from foreign and domestic oppression and exploitation. It is only when man's freedom and development are ensured that prospects for peace can prevail. Otherwise man will continue to move within a vicious circle, alternating between hot wars and relative peace. For the past three decades, the arms race has taken on frightening proportions. Yet this specter is man-made, as it initially grew out of an essentially Eurocentric ideological war.\n193.\tWe are convinced that the relaxation of tensions in the world and the promotion of international peace and security are intricately related to the substantive progress in' the field of disarmament. We also agree with the declaration made in Colombo by the 85 members of the non-aligned movement that the arms race is inconsistent with the efforts aimed at achieving the new international economic order in view of the urgent need to divert the resources utilized for the acceleration of the arms race towards socio-economic development, particularly that of the developing countries [see A/311197, annex I, para. 136], It is in this context that we are convinced that meaningful and durable universal peace and security can be achieved not only through general and complete disarmament under effective international control but also through a consistent and sustained promotion in the basic needs of mankind, as failure in this regard greatly contributes to tensions between and within nations.\n194. To tackle the problem of the arms race effectively, we in Zambia call for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. In this respect, this Assembly should welcome and adopt the recommendation by the Colombo Conference for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly as early as possible on the question of disarmament [ibid., annex IV, resolution 12].\n195.\tThe arms race, with its concomitant adverse spheres of influence, is spreading danger to traditionally peaceful areas of the world. For centuries the Indian Ocean has been relatively peaceful except during the painful period of the slave trade. Through it, man's interdependence was promoted by the use of its waters mainly for peaceful trade and commerce between continents. However, as I am speaking today, the peace of the Indian Ocean is being disturbed by its increasing militarization. The rivalry between the big Powers in the Indian Ocean is increasingly posing a great threat to the genuine interests of littoral and hinterland States and to the international community as a whole. It is because of this threat to the Indian Ocean, and even more so to the littoral and other States in the area, that Zambia and other countries have continued to call for the preservation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n196.\tThe Middle East situation still remains a great threat to international peace and security. In Lebanon, people are being killed almost every day. The war in Lebanon must end, because its continuation is only diverting the attention of the world from the fundamental problem in that area. In the view of my delegation, there is nothing that has taken place in the Middle East since 1967 which would nullify Security Council resolution 242(1967) and other United Nations resolutions.\n197.\tIsrael continues illegally to occupy Arab territories in defiance of the relevant resolutions and decisions of both this Assembly and the Security Council. Furthermore, Israel continues to deny the Palestinian people their inalienable rights to self-determination, national sovereignty and independence. Zambia believes that the Middle East problem will be resolved only when the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and nationhood are realized; when the security of all States in the Middle East is ensured; and when Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories is completed.\n198.\tThe problem of Cyprus is a matter of great concern to us all. Numerous declarations have been made and resolutions adopted in the United Nations and other international forums, upholding the independence, the territorial integrity and the non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. Zambia submits that there is no justification for any State to go to the lengths of dividing another sovereign State into two or more entities on the grounds of ethnic diversity. We are opposed to the creation of new colonial situations in the world. In this connexion, we call upon all parties concerned to comply fully with the decisions and resolutions of this body in respect of the problem of Cyprus. It is our firm belief that as long as there is foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus no durable solution will be found to the problem and thus it will continue to be a threat to international peace and security.\n199.\tIn Korea tension is high, primarily because of foreign intervention. The continued presence of foreign forces in the southern part of Korea masquerading as United Nations forces is inimical to the legitimate interests and aspirations of the people of Korea as a whole. This continued threat to international peace and security calls for urgent international action. We strongly urge the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea.\n200.\tThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea has already demonstrated to the international community its seriousness of purpose and high degree of understanding in respect of the Korean problem. Zambia strongly supports the position that Korea should be admitted to the United Nations as a single unitary State. Once again, we in Zambia reaffirm our total support for the Korean people in their genuine efforts for the reunification of their country and the enjoyment of their lawful and legitimate rights in the United Nations.\n201.\tInterference in the internal affairs of the developing countries by the big Powers and other developed countries has assumed dangerous proportions. The independence and sovereignty of a number of developing countries remain under constant threat.\n202.\tZambia has noticed, with dismay, that in the past months some reactionary Powers and forces are back in a vigorous way at their old game of destabilization. Efforts are being made to undermine the independence and sovereignty of a number of progressive Latin American, Caribbean and other developing countries whose only interest is to free themselves from centuries-old imperialist and neo-colonialist exploitation. We want to state here that affluence based on the exploitation of other States and peoples is criminal and is not in the interests of the millions of exploited people in the world. Such actions are meant to establish unequal relations between developing and so- called developed countries through a variety of subtle and insidious means.\n203.\tWe are aware of the intensified determination and efforts by some big Powers to undermine the independence and sovereignty of Latin American and Caribbean States. Because of a growing yearning for genuine independence in Latin America and the Caribbean free from imperialist and neo-colonialist political and economic exploitation and plunder, some big Powers bent on perpetuating their political and economic domination of these regions have embarked on vicious measures aimed at destabilizing progressive and peace-loving countries of that region.\n204.\tIn this connexion, the non-aligned countries and other progressive forces of the world will continue to render full support and offer solidarity to the progressive peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean in their just struggle against international imperialism and neo-colonialism. Some countries of that area are members of the non-aligned movement, and many more have shown a keen interest in the objectives and principles of the movement. We shall remain in full solidarity with our Latin American and Caribbean friends in their legitimate struggle for genuine national independence and sovereignty, including full control over their natural resources.\n205.\tThe negative view held by some States in the world that the United Nations continues to play a marginal rather than a central role in world affairs will continue to have some validity, unless the institutionalized dictatorship of some permanent members of the Security Council through the veto system is removed. The United Nations must be democratized. The argument that the power of veto must go hand in hand with responsibility in world, affairs is invalidated by the fact that some of the Member States which continue to enjoy the right of veto in the Security Council have far less power and responsibility in the world of today compared with other Member States or groups of States which do not have such power of veto.\n206. Furthermore, the veto has largely been more abused than exercised responsibly. In most cases it is used merely to serve the perceived national or group interests of the factions within the world power structure. One of the most vivid expressions of abuse of the veto is in the area of undermining the principle of universality. It is therefore intolerable to note that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola have not taken their rightful places here in the United Nations. We are, however, confident that soon the heroic peoples of Angola and Viet Nam will assume their legitimate and rightful places in this august Assembly.\n207.\tLet me now turn to issues of colonialism and racism. My delegation is happy to welcome the Republic of Seychelles as a Member of the United Nations. The accession of those islands to independence is a significant development in the history of decolonization and a matter, of great encouragement to the other peoples of Africa which are still fighting against colonialism and racism in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.\n208.\tOne of the fundamental objectives of Zambia's foreign policy is to assist those struggling against colonialism and racism to win genuine freedom: Therefore, while we rejoice at the success of the people of Seychelles, my delegation is very disturbed at the continued neo-colonial situation on the Comorian island of Mayotte. We strongly deplore and reject that position because it constitutes a flagrant and unacceptable interference in the affairs of an independent African State; it has disturbing implications for all areas which are not yet free -other imperialist Powers may be tempted to maintain similar spheres of influence elsewhere -and it confirms the French Government's insincerity and inconsistency on questions of colonialism and racism. Zambia therefore calls upon this Assembly strongly to censure the French Government and to call upon it to stop forthwith that unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of the Comoros.\n209.\tColonialism and racism are on the retreat in southern Africa. The oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia have stepped up the war of liberation against their oppressor, represented by Smith, Vorster and their imperialist collaborators. In South Africa itself, the black people and other non-white people oppressed in all aspects of their human existence have decided to call the bluff of the reactionary apartheid regime. Thus, as I am speaking today, armed struggle is going on with increasing intensity in Zimbabwe and Namibia. In South Africa itself, the black population and other progressive people of that country are sacrificing their blood for the liberation of their country. Many more are ready to fight. What they need are medicines, guns and other war material. No doubt, victory is on their side.\n210.\tThe Zambian Government's position on Zimbabwe is very clear. Zambia supports the intensification of armed struggle. As is well known, attempts at achieving peaceful change in Zimbabwe that were undertaken strictly within the framework of the OAU mandate failed principally owing to the intransigent attitude of the racist regime of Ian Smith. Rebel leader Ian Smith then had every opportunity peacefully to transfer power to the majority. But the illegal Smith regime's short-sightedness had led to the intensification of armed struggle.\n211.\tThe heroic struggle launched by the patriotic people of Zimbabwe has inflicted severe blows on the Smith minority racist regime. It is now obvious that the Smith regime has been forced to recognize and accept the inevitability of majority rule and the need to establish immediately a transitional Government to implement that principle.\n212.\tI wish to state here that Zambia is determined that Zimbabwe shall be born under a genuine, free and independent government. To that end, the armed struggle will continue in Zimbabwe until a genuine majority government is in control. We want to add here that what is best for Zimbabwe shall be determined by the people of Zimbabwe themselves, who have been victims of colonialism and racism for too long.\n213.\tIn their Lusaka communique of 26 September 1976, issued as a reaction to Ian Smith's statement accepting majority rule for Zimbabwe within two years, the Presidents of Angola, the United Republic of Tanzania, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia put the entire Rhodesian situation in its true perspective: they gave credit to the armed struggle and paid a tribute to the gallant black freedom fighters of Zimbabwe. For it is the success of the armed struggle that has compelled the rebel leader Ian Smith and his collaborators to capitulate. Because of the unreliability of Ian Smith, the Presidents have insisted that a conference should be convened outside Zimbabwe by the Administering Authority, namely, the United Kingdom, with the authentic and legitimate representatives of the people in order:\n\\\"(A) To discuss the structure and functions of the transitional government.\n\\\"(B) To establish the transitional Government.\n\\\"(C) To discuss the modalities for convening a full constitutional conference to work out the independence constitution.\n\\\"(D) To establish the basis upon which peace and normalcy can be restored in the territory.\\\"\n214.\tIn calling upon the United Kingdom to convene the conference, we are taking precautions against giving the white racist minority regime of Ian Smith any semblance of legitimacy or legality. It is for that and other reasons that Zambia rejects Ian Smith's proposals on the structure and functions of the council of State and council of ministers in which he plans to leave in the hands of the whites the chairmanship and the ministries of defense and law and order.\n215.\tWe shall continue to support intensified aimed struggle until majority rule is assured and achieved. We appeal to the international community to continue the application of sanctions against the rebel colony of Southern Rhodesia until the establishment of an African majority government in Zimbabwe is attained.\n216.\tHaving declared the inevitability of continued intensified armed struggle, it is important for the international community to increase its assistance to the liberation movements both materially and financially. Furthermore, it is now imperative to strengthen existing programs of assistance to the countries that have either closed their borders with Southern Rhodesia or have cut off vital trade in implementation of United Nations sanctions against that illegal white racist minority, regime. In that respect, the international community should not, at this crucial stage, minimize the attention it is focusing on the adverse economic and social consequences and human suffering experienced by those countries.\n217.\tFor instance, in the struggle for human rights in southern Africa, Zambia has suffered considerably in human, financial and material terms. The cost to Zambia for implementing sanctions against the rebel regime of Ian Smith is already in excess of $US 450 million over the past three years.\n218.\tIn Namibia, the racist regime of South Africa continues illegally to occupy that international Territory. The racist apartheid regime of South Africa continues to flout with impunity the United Nations resolutions on Namibia. In particular, it has blatantly ignored numerous Security Council resolutions on that Territory. In January of this year, the Security Council gave South Africa until 31 August 1976 solemnly to declare its intention to withdraw from Namibia and to agree to the holding of a national election in the Territory under United Nations supervision and control.  South Africa has arrogantly refused to withdraw from that Territory so as to enable the Namibian people to determine their own future. The racist regime of South Africa has increased its oppressive rule over Namibia and has conducted premeditated and flagrant wholesale massacres of the innocent peace-loving Namibian people. Furthermore,, the South African regime is using the international Territory of Namibia as a military base from which it launches attacks against the people of Namibia and the neighboring independent African countries, in particular the States of Angola and Zambia.\n219.\tThe liberation struggle in Namibia has reached a decisive and crucial stage. Mere declarations of support and solidarity with the Namibian people in its struggle for independence and freedom are not in themselves enough. The Namibian patriots, under SWAPO, need practical material assistance in order for them effectively to conduct the war of liberation in their country. Therefore, we call upon countries and peoples that genuinely believe in the cause of the liberation of Namibia to provide SWAPO with the necessary assistance so that the people of Namibia can also enjoy peace, justice and freedom.\n220.\tZambia reaffirms its position that the armed struggle in Namibia will continue unless South Africa immediately withdraws its armed forces and the entire oppressive administrative machinery from Namibia; Namibia becomes independent as a single unitary State; and SWAPO takes its legitimate place in Namibia as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.\n221.\tTo this end Zambia will continue to support SWAPO and to cooperate with the United Nations and the rest of the international community in working towards the achievement of these objectives. We shall neither accept nor co-operate with any puppet regime in Namibia sponsored by racist South Africa. However, Zambia, having rejected the so-called Turnhalle Constitutional Conference in Windhoek, strongly feels that any meaningful future conference on Namibia should be between SWAPO as the authentic representative of the Namibian people and South Africa as the illegal occupation regime. Such a conference should be held under the auspices of the United Nations as the legal and legitimate authority.\n222.\tIn South Africa itself, the revolutionary situation that has been growing over the years is now ripe . As I stated earlier, the oppressed people of South Africa have now come out into the open to confront their oppressor. The spirit of Sharpeville has kindled the hearts of South African patriots, whose blood now flows in Soweto, Alexandra and in many other townships in South Africa. These patriots have chosen the only way open to them-indeed the only way to liberate their country, and that is with blood.\n223.\tZambia condemns in the strongest terms the South African racist regime for its brutal massacres of the innocent oppressed people of South Africa. However, it is our firm view that, whatever military machine South\nAfrican can apply against the oppressed people of South Africa, their determination to achieve their cherished goal will surely surmount the evil and reactionary forces in their motherland. There is no doubt that the goal of freedom and justice for the oppressed people in South Africa will soon be attained.\n224.\tThe racist regime of South Africa must know that the game of apartheid is up. That regime should scrap the system of apartheid immediately.\n225.\tThe revolt that has now erupted throughout urban South Africa will be the determining factor in the advance towards social justice and human dignity. The situation in South Africa will never be the same. The obnoxious system of apartheid will be eradicated and replaced by majority rule. The freight train of revolt is on the move in South Africa and the Vorster racist regime, with all its military and naval arsenal, with all the kith-and-kin support from its traditional allies, will be violently pushed aside or knocked down never to rise again. To this end we appeal to all peace-loving countries and other progressive forces of the world to render more material assistance to the liberation movements of South Africa, namely, the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress, so that they can wage the struggle for their birthright.\n226.\tWe are all aware of the unholy alliance existing between the racist South African regime and a number of Western countries, including Israel. The collaboration be-tween these countries and the apartheid regime of South Africa in the political, economic, military and other fields is primarily aimed at oppressing and dominating in perpetuity the African and other non-white people in the interest of monopoly capital. In particular, we are gravely concerned at the French nuclear collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa, which has implications for peace and security in southern Africa as a whole. We call upon France to abandon this scheme and instead to join with all well-meaning countries in ostracizing the apartheid regime of South Africa.\n227.\tLet me also make it clear that Zambia rejects and condemns the decision of South Africa to grant so-called independence to Transkei, in pursuance of the. evil policy of \\\"bantustans\\\". This is nothing more than a scheme to divide and rule.\n228.\tTherefore, in southern Africa the war of liberation will continue in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa itself until genuine independence, freedom and justice are won under authentic representatives of the peoples of these countries. Zambia will continue to support the just struggle by our patriotic brothers and sisters in southern Africa. We shall continue to render all moral and material assistance possible to the oppressed people of southern Africa through their authentic liberation movements until their cherished goals and aspirations are fully attained.\n229.\tAllow me to state that, while our Organization continues to experience short-comings, especially in its role of maintaining international peace and security, it nevertheless manifests increasing strength and viability in many other areas of global concern. In this connexion we are mindful of the increasingly central role assumed by the United Nations in vital international discussions and negotiations covering various fields of global co-operation.\n230.\tIt would be remiss of me if I did not pay a special tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our most dedicated and distinguished Secretary-General, for the vigilant and untiring efforts he has continued to render at the helm of this august Organization, oftentimes in extremely delicate and difficult circumstances. Mr. Waldheim has proved that he is committed to working relentlessly towards the fulfillment of the sacred principles of human dignity, social justice and world peace and security -all of which renders credence to the raison d'etre of the United Nations.\n231.\tZambia once again pledges its full support of and confidence in the United Nations as a sanctuary of peace and security for all mankind. We appeal to all Member States, large and small, to pull together in order to enable the United Nations to function effectively."

        "file_text": "The developing countries are fortunate to have such men as Mr. Amerasinghe. His election to the presidency of the General Assembly's thirty-first session is indeed a wise choice, demonstrating the Assembly's appreciation of the efforts personally exerted by him and by his country for the promotion of international co-operation and accord and the codification of international relations. His participation over many years in the activities of this Organization and in international conferences, the most recent being the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, his chairmanship of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea since its inception, and his recognized diplomatic sagacity, soundness of judgment and ability to bring about acceptable formulations are a guarantee that the work of this session will be brought to the successful conclusion hoped for and anticipated by us all. For all those reasons my delegation extends to Mr. Amerasinghe sincere and heart felt congratulations, wishing him every success.\n43. Nor can I let this occasion pass without expressing my delegation's appreciation to the last President of the General Assembly, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who so ably conducted the meetings of the thirtieth session.\n49.\tThe United Nations-with a sphere of activities vast and diverse beyond imagination, with enormous capabilities and a wealth of human and technical resources, facing as it does difficulties and crises that sometimes imperil not only the United Nations but the world itself, bringing it to the edge of a dangerous precipice requires an able man at the helm to steer it out of crises and to exploit all its potential for the preservation of international peace and security. The United Nations could not have found a better Secretary-General than Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, in the most exemplary fashion, has exerted prodigious efforts in his discharge of this immense international responsibility.\n50.\tMy delegation takes pleasure in commending the efforts of Mr. Waldheim and in declaring that his re-election as Secretary-General of this Organization will be instrumental in developing our Organization to serve the interests of world peace and security. My delegation fully supports his re-election to another term, confirming its confidence in his administration of this Organization.\n51.\tThis year my delegation is pleased to extend congratulations to the Government and people of Seychelles on their admission to membership of our Organization. The Sultanate of Oman looks forward to that day in the near future when all the countries of the world . will be independent, sovereign and represented here, taking part in laying the foundation for global justice, welfare and equality.\n52.\tDespite the success of our Organization in solving certain international problems resulting from colonialism, armed invasion and the forcible occupation of the territory \nof independent States, there still remain important problems which pose a threat to world peace and security, problems that demand our urgent attention.\n53.\tNumerous resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly concerning the problem of the Middle East. These resolutions remain to be implemented. For the failure to achieve progress towards a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East has created a state of instability and tension that dominates the region and threatens peace and security not only in that area, but also throughout the world. It is incumbent upon the international community to exercise its legitimate powers by all peaceful means, including the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East as soon as possible, with the participation of all parties concerned, without exception, in order to reach a peaceful settlement of the problem. That, and that alone, is the course that will ensure a relaxation of tension in the region, the course that will promote world peace and security.\n54.\tThe Sultanate of Oman, as I have already stated, endorses peaceful coexistence among all nations, irrespective of their system of government, so long as the people of each country have chosen a system that suits their public interest. Unfortunately, however, some major Powers still attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations, using for that end other States over which they have some influence or which subscribe to the same ideology. The object of these agent States is to provoke disturbances, stage coups d'etats, encourage subversive elements or incite fratricidal murders, in order to gain approval and win generous rewards from their powerful client States.\n55.\tThe sums being wasted to foment such disturbances and dissension are enormous. And at the very time when the financial resources of developing nations are so sorely needed to raise the peoples' standard of living, needed to avert the famine already afflicting some of them, needed to promote economic development, welfare and security in the world framework, these nations find themselves deprived of those resources, which are diverted to the defense of their independence, existence and population against infiltrators and saboteurs.\n56.\tIn that connexion I regret that the Foreign Minister of Aden made a speech before the Assembly that was marked by interference in our internal affairs and export of subversive elements to our country. We will not stoop to the level of vituperation and so will not take the trouble to reply, for the people of our region, indeed the people of the whole world, know the kind of Government that is established in Aden and know how it works; they also know the kind of Government established in Oman and its achievements.\n57.\tThe Sultanate of Oman, out of its faith in the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs and in pursuance of a policy of good-neighborly relations, has never interfered and never will interfere in the affairs of any other State, in particular the affairs of its neighbors in the Gulf region. On the contrary, my Government always extends the hand of assistance to our neighbors, not excluding even that neighbor which intervenes in our internal affairs, in the hope that all such States will desist from intervention and live in peace with their neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty of each of them.\n58.\tMy delegation calls upon those countries which attempt to intervene in the affairs of neighboring countries, and thereby drain their own resources and deprive their own people of much-needed care and well- being, to desist from such intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, whether they be neighbors or not. We call upon those countries to turn their attention to the welfare and development of their own peoples, to endeavor to provide the basis for a decent life for their citizens.\n59.\tMy delegation affirms, that the Sultanate of Oman, which extends the hand of cooperation to others, is able to defend its integrity and its people against any meddling in its internal affairs by any country- The Sultanate of Oman is further determined to pursue all avenues of co-operation to promote the well-being of all countries in the Gulf area in the context of economic development and world peace.\n60.\tMy delegation has a profound faith in full co-operation among developing countries in general. If those developing countries that are neighbors in a given region of the world could join forces to defend their economic, political and defense interests and their security, it would be possible to create zones of peace far removed from the rivalries of the major Powers. It would, further, be possible to achieve inter-zonal co-operation.\n61.\tThe creation of such zones would not be extremely difficult, given the sine qua non of common interests among the countries of die region, which requires that every country in the zone would be considering its neighbors interests along with its own, and those interests would provide the sound foundation for good relations.\n62.\tIt is well known that the developing countries are not similar in every respect. There are varying degrees of development among those nations, and many fields of development are fully open to dose and constructive cooperation among them free of any motivation of selfish gain. The areas of co-operation would be determined by the capabilities and resources available to some and needed by others. If the creation of such co-operation could be achieved by methods consistent with the resources and capabilities of each member, the foundation would be laid for the mobilization of the political will to create such zones of peace, with equality among countries of the zones. Undoubtedly the desire for co-operation would prompt the development of a complex of relations and co-operation in various economic, cultural, social, technological and scientific fields.\n63.\tWe believe in this pattern of international co-operation, which would lead to the creation of regional zones, and we.declare here pur willingness to extend a hand to all countries in our region in order to achieve development and security for our peoples and to preserve our independence against any foreign intervention. It has been demonstrated beyond doubt that a policy of military pacts is doomed to failure and that regional co-operation among neighboring countries, backed by the political will to \nachieve economic, social and cultural development, is the corner-stone for.the establishment of groupings whose goal is the attainment of interdependence among members of the region in the interest of regional and international peace and security.\n64.\tToday's world necessitates the creation of such groups among nations bound together by a common destiny. No country, however strong or self-sufficient it may be, can live isolated from the rest of the world, and the security and peace of major Powers actually depend on the security and integrity of the smaller nations. International security is an integral, indivisible whole. With this in mind, we also believe in and support the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a zone of permanent peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n65.\tIn the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General [A/31/l/Add.l], substantiating his statement with figures, has reminded us that a situation prevails which constitutes a massive drain on resources. I refer to the expenditure on armaments, which every year amounts to almost $300 billion. Allocations for the arms race since the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion, which is almost equal to the gross national product of all the countries of the world for the year 1976.\n66.\tThis regrettable fact prompts us to ponder the pernicious danger that threatens the human race and its existence. Disarmament, like other international problems, is not an isolated phenomenon. Rather, it is fundamentally linked with international peace and security. There is no doubt that dispelling the fear and uncertainty among States and guaranteeing their safety from aggression, attack, occupation, colonialism and intervention in their internal affairs would significantly contribute to the attainment of the final goal of complete and general disarmament. Then, those staggering sums which are wasted in the arms race could be directed to the development and welfare of the international community.\n67.\tInternational economic relations require our special and increasing attention since the issue of development is also organically connected with international peace and security. We should not view development in the abstract or in isolation from international politics. Developing countries do not regard the question of development as a lifeless mathematical equation but view it in terms of their portion of daily bread.\n68.\tThe Economic Declaration of the non-aligned countries adopted by the Colombo Conference in August 1976 [A/31/197, annex II] has confirmed this fact. That Declaration also stresses the practical means to achieve development in the world. On the basis of the principle of international interdependence, the burdens of development postulate effective participation by the developed countries and the developing countries. The developing countries are themselves fully aware that they, too, have responsibilities and obligations in the advancement of their economies. Both sides of the scale should be equally weighted, and burdens should be measured against capacities and resources.\n69.\tWe now have a heap of international documents which voice the conscience of the world and whose provisions deserve to be put into effect and to be respected since they are the result of long and exhausting studies and negotiations. I am referring to the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixth and seventh special sessions and at other, regular, sessions, as well as to documents emanating from other international conferences. In particular I am referring to the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)/. All those international documents urge consideration of the patterns of existing international economic relations whether in the field of international trade, of international monetary structure, of the flow of capital and investment, of the transfer of technology or of world food or in the organizational arrangements in those fields.\n70.\tMy delegation appeals to developed countries to do their duty in the cause of international development-not by making grants or donations but, rather by entering into a commitment to their partners in the international community for their common good and for the elimination of a serious danger that threatens world peace and security.\n71.\tMy delegation is fully convinced that the developing countries, on their own side, must spare no effort to play their part, whether this calls for self-reliance, co-operation among themselves, or reaching an understanding with the developed world to achieve their goals on the road to development.\n72.\tProceeding from the principle of international co-operation, in which we all believe, especially co-operation in promoting international trade, shipping and the exploitation of the mineral resources of the seabed, the Sultanate of Oman has effectively participated in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the fifth session of which, it was hoped, would reach an international agreement taking into account the interests of all nations and provide a practical and useful regime of the sea.\n73.\tOman has effectively contributed to all the previous sessions of the Conference. It has submitted working papers in which it outlined its position on navigation in an attempt to reach acceptable and just solutions. This manifests our direct concern with questions of navigation, especially in the straits used for international navigation, as the Sultanate of Oman is a developing strait and coastal State. It is interested, in the first instance, in the protection of its security and sovereignty over its territories so that it may carry out its role of protecting and ensuring the regularity of international navigation in the interest of development and the promotion of world trade. In this, we are ready to co-operate with all countries in order to attain a bright and better future for an ideal international community.\n74.\tAlthough the Conference has not yet achieved reconciliation of the conflicting interests or overcome the doubts and fears of certain countries, or mitigated the excessive concern of others for their own interests, we sincerely hope that the Conference will, at its next session in May 1977, reach solutions to these conflicting positions and adopt the international convention awaited by all of us in the common interest of mankind.\n75.\tHaving reviewed my country's point of view on various international problems, my delegation holds that we \ncannot solve our political, economic and human issues except with sincere efforts to realize the objectives stipulated by the Charter of our Organization. This cannot be done with words or speeches, but with positive and serious action, through co-operation in the assessment of our problems in a realistic and practical manner. In this way, we will be able to attain the common good which will be beneficial to all parties concerned and to the world at large.\n76.\tLet us then replace international confrontation with international co-operation in our discussions of the problems before us in our work this year. Let us reconcile our own interests with the general interest of the international community in order to realize the aspirations of people everywhere, who expect our Organization to do much towards the achievement of development and international peace and security.\n77.\tEver since His Majesty Sultan Qabus assumed the leadership of the Sultanate of Oman, the Sultanate has been working with dedication to the principles I have just mentioned to achieve development for its people and other peoples of the world, on the basis of regional and international understanding and co-operation.\n78.\tOman will effectively exert all its efforts, and direct all its capacities and its full potential, to attaining the fundamental objectives of our Organization, objectives in which Oman has the profoundest faith, for the establishment of an ideal international community in which prosperity, security and peace shall prevail everywhere.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, whole heartedly to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his election to the high post of President of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly and to wish him sincerely every success in discharging the responsible tasks entrusted to him by the Members of this prestigious international Organization.\n195.\tThe Mongolian delegation, on behalf of its Government, warmly congratulates the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations and wishes the Government and people of Seychelles every success in the building of a new life.\n196.\tI should like to state that the Mongolian People's Republic fully supports the legitimate request of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for admission to member-ship in the United Nations and resolutely opposes an unrealistic approach to this question. My Government is also in favor of the immediate admission of the People's Republic of Angola to membership in the United Nations. We are firmly convinced that the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Angola will contribute to enhancing the prestige and efficiency of this Organization.\n197.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the most pressing issue of the day is the consolidation of universal peace and security through the further deepening of the process of the relaxation of international tension and the adoption of effective measures to halt the arms race and bring about disarmament. Our belief is that detente, disarmament and development are closely interrelated in both their political and their material aspects. It is obvious that gains in any of these areas will facilitate progress in the other two areas, and vice versa.\n198.\tIndeed, the process of further deepening of the relaxation of international tension and of giving substance to the principles of peaceful coexistence through the development of mutually beneficial co-operation between States helps to strengthen the spirit of confidence and mutual understanding among States and to facilitate the adoption of measures in the field of disarmament as well as the solution of the pressing problems of development. On the other hand, the accelerating arms race, for which the military-industrial complexes of the Western countries are to blame, threatens to erode the foundations of inter-national detente and severally affects the objectives of the socio-economic development of all nations without exception.\n199.\tThe socialist countries, in close co-operation with all peace-loving and progressive forces, are making a decisive contribution to the achievement of further progress in those closely interrelated areas of international life. This is borne out, for example, by the fact that practically all the important multilateral treaties and agreements so far concluded in the field of disarmament and the curbing of the arms race are based on proposals originally put forward by the socialist countries, primarily by the Soviet Union. Upon the initiative of the same socialist countries, the United Nations has adopted a number of important documents on fundamental issues related to the strengthening of international security, the promotion of friendly co-operation among States and the safeguarding of the rights of peoples to freedom and national independence.\n200.\tThe Congresses of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the countries of the socialist community held this year have drawn up the guidelines for a further intensification of the foreign policy activities of those countries in the interests of universal peace and security.\n201.\tThe Seventeenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, held last June, laid down the goals and objectives of our foreign policy as an integral part of the purposeful activities of the socialist community in the international arena. We should like here to emphasize the great international significance of the program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples put forward by the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. That program, as is known, contains a broad range of objectives aimed at deepening the process of the relaxation of international tension, carrying out disarmament measures, introducing the principle of the renunciation of the use of force in international relations, eliminating hot-beds of colonialism and racism, and eradicating all forms of inequality, discrimination and exploitation in international economic relations.\n202.\tThe policy of the socialist countries, which is fully in keeping with the vital needs of all peoples, is gaining ever growing support, and the combined efforts of the peace- loving and progressive forces are scoring new successes in the strengthening of peace and security and in the development of international co-operation.\n203.\tAt the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that recently attempts have been made in the West to discredit the idea of detente and to revive the spirit of the \\\"cold war\\\" and the policy of operating from a \\\"position of strength\\\". Attempts are also being made to use detente for the purpose of interfering in the internal affairs of other States, particularly of the socialist countries, on the false pretext of defending human rights. Behind those attempts lie intrigues on the part of the most aggressive and reactionary circles of monopoly capital who are placing their narrow selfish interests above the interests of the security and well-being of mankind.\n204.\tGreat service is being rendered to the opponents of detente in the West by those who, under the cover of demagogic phraseology, are attempting to undermine the improvement of the international political climate and are openly calling for preparations for a new world war.\n205.\tNevertheless, the positive developments and changes in the world continue to expand and deepen, in spite of the opposition from the forces of reaction and adventurism. This is only natural because these changes have been engendered by the objective conditions of the development of contemporary international relations and by new shifts in the correlation of forces in the world arena.\n206.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic attaches great importance to the effective implementation of the decisions of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Measures agreed upon in that forum, as is clear from the name of the Conference itself, are of vital importance for all countries and peoples without exception. Their importance lies also in the fact that the participants in the Conference pledged themselves strictly to observe the principles agreed upon in their relations with all countries. It is therefore obvious that the implementation of the decisions of this important international Conference will have positive consequences for all the peoples of the world.\n207.\tAs an Asian country, the Mongolian People's Republic attaches special importance to the strengthening of peace and security on that vast continent inhabited by more than half of mankind.\n208.\tIn recent years, substantial changes have occurred in Asia in favor of the forces of peace, national independence and social progress. In this regard the historic victory of the Vietnamese people over the imperialist aggressors and internal reactionary forces as well as the formation of a unified socialist Viet Nam are of particular importance.\n209.\tThe proclamation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the fall of the anti-people reactionary regime in Kampuchea also constitute notable events which con-tribute to the improvement of the political climate in Asia.\n210.\tThe positive changes in South-Asia, moves towards a stabilization of the situation in South Asia, and the growing realization of the need for mutual understanding and co-operation among States with different socio-economic systems are opening up new prospects for the further normalization of the situation on the Asian continent.\n211.\tIt is against this background that the speedy elimination of the still existing hotbeds of tension in Asia assumes paramount importance.\n212.\tParticularly, it is imperative to achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the protracted Middle East crisis by eliminating the consequences of Israeli aggression against the Arab States. It is only through such a settlement and not through partial and separate arrangements that a durable peace in the Middle East can be secured.\n213.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic continues to hold the view that the key to the solution of the Middle East problem lies in the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967, the satisfaction of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to establish their own State, and respect for the right of all the States of the region to an independent existence.\n214.\tThe Mongolian Government considers it necessary for the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to be resumed as soon as possible with the participation of all the parties directly concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n215.\tThe tragic situation of crisis in Lebanon, which arose as a result of the intrigues of imperialist and Zionist forces, as well as of domestic reaction, should be resolved by the Lebanese people themselves on the basis of the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of that country.\n216.\tJustified anxiety has been aroused by the situation of the Korean peninsula, to which imperialist circles assign an important role in their schemes to perpetuate the division of Korea and turn its southern part into a base for aggressive encroachments. The presence of United States troops under the cover of the United Nations flag is the principle obstacle to the fulfillment of the aspirations of the Korean people for their national reunification.\n217.\tAt the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations a resolution was adopted recommending the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in the southern part of Korea, the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a permanent peace agreement [resolution 3390 B (XXX)].\n218.\tWe believe that the immediate implementation of these provisions of the General Assembly resolution would create favorable conditions for a peaceful settlement of the Korean problem.\n219.\tThe Mongolian Government continues to advocate a just and peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem without outside interference and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and of total respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\n220.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic feels in duty bound to do its utmost to contribute to the cause of strengthening peace, security and co-operation on the Asian continent.\n221.\tAt the Seventeenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Khural, Comrade Tsedenbal, stated:\n\\\"... a lasting peace and security in Asia can only be ensured through the joint efforts of the States of the continent. The elimination of existing hotbeds of tension in Asia, a political settlement of outstanding international problems, permanent rejection of the use of force or the threat of use of force in international relations and the development of mutually beneficial co-operation between the States of the continent serve as a basis for ensuring peace and security in Asia.\\\"\n222.\tIn our view, these are the international conditions which are necessary for the successful solution of the vital socio-economic problems facing the peoples of Asia today.\n223.\tIn this context we believe that the need to ensure peace and security in Asia on a collective basis, with the participation of all the countries of the continent, is becoming particularly urgent.\n224.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the positive changes which have been observed both in bilateral relations and in the multilateral efforts of the Asian States constitute a foundation upon which endeavors for ensuring lasting peace in Asia should be built.\n225.\tStrict observance of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations is the most important prerequisite for the normalization of relations between States, thus strengthening their peaceful co-operation. My Government therefore fully supports the proposal of the Soviet Union to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations [A) 31/243]. The essence of this peace pact would be the commitment of States to prevent aggression and to renounce the use of any types of weapon, including nuclear weapons, for the settlement of disputes among themselves. The conclusion of such a treaty would greatly strengthen mutual confidence among States and contribute significantly to the further deepening of international detente and to the reduction of the threat of world war. This would also represent a practical step towards the implementation of the objectives of the United Nations Charter and the historic declaration on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons solemnly adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly [resolution 2936 (XXVII)] on behalf of all Members of the. United Nations. Proceeding from the above mentioned considerations, the Mongolian delegation considers timely and urgent the proposal of the Soviet delegation to include in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly on item on the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.\n226.\tThe continuing arms race not only conflicts with the interests of the deepening of the international relaxation of tension but also threatens to undermine the effectiveness of measures already agreed upon in the field of disarmament. It also obstructs the objectives of development. It has been estimated that the resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6 trillion, which is roughly equivalent to the gross national product of the whole world in 1976.\n227.\tSuch a situation clearly underlines the urgency and timeliness of the memorandum presented at this session by the Soviet delegation containing the views of the Soviet Government on urgent steps to be taken to halt the arms race and to put into effect measures of disarmament. It is our view that this memorandum is notable, inter alia, for its constructive and flexible approach to the solution of the major issues of disarmament and related matters.\n228.\tMy delegation, like many others, agrees that primary attention should be devoted to nuclear disarmament measures. To that end, effective measures must be taken in the first place to strengthen the non-proliferation regime of this weapon of mass destruction. We hope that the General Assembly will devote special attention to this problem and will invite all States that have not yet done so to accede to or ratify without delay the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII), annex], in the highest interests of preventing the threat of nuclear war.\n229. The complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests would constitute an effective means of preventing the further perfection of nuclear armaments.\n23G. In that connection, we view as being of great importance the treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of underground nuclear tests and on peaceful nuclear explosions.\n231.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic regrets the lack of progress in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3478 (XXX), which called upon all nuclear Powers to enter into negotiations not later than 31 March 1976 with a view to reaching an agreement on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. The major responsibility lies with those nuclear Powers which refuse to comply with the provisions of that resolution. The General Assembly should call upon those States to display a constructive approach so that the negotiations can begin as soon as possible, on the basis of the existing draft treaty.\n232.\tIn this age of intensive scientific and technological progress the task of preventing the emergency of still more dangerous means of destruction becomes a matter of ever greater urgency. It is imperative immediately to reach a binding agreement on the prohibition of the manufacture of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, as has been proposed in such a timely fashion by the Soviet Union. My delegation notes with satisfaction certain positive steps in activating negotiation on this problem in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Progress in the SALT talks would be a decisive contribution both in political and in technological respects to blocking the emergence of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the Mongolian People's Republic attaches particular importance to the need to convert the Vladivostok understanding on the limitation of offensive strategic armaments into a binding agreement.\n233.\tWe welcome the finalization in the Conference of the Committee on disarmament of a draft convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environ-mental modification techniques, and express the hope that this session of the General Assembly will endorse this draft convention.\n234.\tOur Government favors the speedy adoption of effective measures in the field of the prohibition of chemical means of warfare.\n235.\tWe consider that the reduction of military expenditures and the level of armed forces of States, in particular those with large potentials, is one of the practical measures to curtail the arms race.\n236.\tOur delegation, like those of the overwhelming majority of States, favors the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. Such a conference would undoubtedly give an impetus to the preparation of concrete measures to check the arms race and promote the creation of a political climate conducive to the achievement of the goals of general and complete disarmament.\n237.\tBefore turning to another subject, I should like to emphasize that the United Nations should increasingly take into account the vigorous efforts of broad sections of the public in its efforts to strengthen peace and international security, and specifically to further the cause of curtailing the arms race and promoting disarmament. In this regard we endorse the idea expressed by the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, that world public opinion should be far more actively involved in the struggle for disarmament. In this regard my delegation would like to express its desire to see United Nations information media give wider coverage to important events like the recent world-wide campaign of the World Peace Council to collect signatures on the new Stockholm appeal for the cessation of the arms race and for disarmament, and the Helsinki World Conference of Public Movements for the Cessation of the Arms Race, for Disarmament and for the Relaxation of International Tension, held on 23 to 26 September this year. My delegation is convinced that the United Nations stands to gain a great deal from close links with mass movements favoring the cause of peace and international security.\n238.\tThe peoples fighting for their freedom and independence have scored fresh victories, which has led to the further weakening of the position of imperialism, colonialism and racism.\n239.\tThe Angolan people won a historic victory in their struggle against the aggression launched by the South African, racists, with the direct encouragement of imperialists and other reactionary forces. This victory, achieved with the assistance of their true friends, and in the first place the socialist countries, has given a new impetus to the struggle of the peoples of Africa for the final elimination of the remnants of colonialism and racism.\n240.\tThe national liberation movements of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, as well as the indigenous people of South Africa, are becoming ever broader in scope. Confronted with the prospects of the complete collapse of colonial and racist domination, the racist regimes and their imperialist protectors have been compelled to maneuver in their attempt to paralyzes the national liberation movements and to safeguard their economic and strategic interests in Africa. The Mongolian delegation is confident that the progressive forces of the African continent, enjoying wide international support, will be able to safeguard the cause of the genuine national liberation and social progress of the peoples of the southern part of Africa. The Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the basis of recognition of the right of oppressed peoples to wage the struggle for their freedom and independence by all means at their disposal. We associate ourselves with the demand that effective measures should be taken for the complete liquidation of colonial and racial domination in Africa.\n241.\tColonialism and racism, as well as regimes of a Fascist type, rely on the practice of the denial and gross violation of human rights.\n242.\tMongolian public opinion resolutely condemns the criminal acts of the Chilean junta against the progressive and patriotic forces of Chile in flagrant violation of elementary human rights and freedoms. We associate ourselves with demands that an end be put to all these actions and that the staunch fighter for the genuine freedom and vital interests of the Chilean people, Luis\nCorvalart, be released along with all the other Chilean patriots and democrats languishing in the goals of the Fascist junta.\n243.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, along with other socialist countries, has consistently supported the just demands of the developing countries for the democratization of international economic relations inherited from the past and for the elimination of all forms of inequality, discrimination and exploitation. We believe that the transformation of present economic relations which reflect the selfish objectives of imperialist monopolies is in keeping with the interests of the social and economic development of all countries and primarily with the need to strengthen the economic independence of developing countries.\n244.\tThe discussions on international economic issues in the light of the needs of the developing countries at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and in other representative international forums under United Nations auspices have been of great significance. Important positive documents have been adopted.\n245.\tHowever, the efforts of developing countries to bring about the practical implementation of the goals and principles of those documents, in particular the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, have met with stubborn resistance from a number of Western Powers which, despite their repeated promises, have taken a negative stand on problems of vital importance for the developing countries.\n246.\tIn these circumstances the unity of action of the developing countries in their struggle to secure their legitimate and vital interests and to strengthen their co-operation with the socialist world takes on growing significance.\n247.\tIn this connection, my delegation notes the importance of the statement in the Political Declaration of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo that the non-aligned countries should continue to endeavor to co-operate with all peace-loving and progressive forces throughout the world and thus strengthen the capacity of this movement successfully to combat imperialism in its desperate efforts to recover the ground it has lost in recent years. We believe that this statement is in keeping with the interests of the consolidation of democratic and progressive changes in world development.\n248.\tThe Mongolian delegation believes that the deepening of international detente and the increasing weight and influence of those forces which advocate international peace and co-operation have opened up for the United Nations new broad prospects for more effective implementation of the principles and purposes of its Charter.\n249.\tWe believe that at the present stage the main tasks of the United Nations lie in active promotion of the consolidation of new positive trends in world development, in rendering all possible assistance to the efforts of the international community to end the arms race and to bring about measures of disarmament, and in raising the efficiency of the Organization in supporting the struggle of the peoples for peace, national independence and social progress.\n250.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, through its efforts in both bilateral and multilateral relations, will strive to make its contribution to the attainment of the noble objectives of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "As I speak in this world assembly, my first words will be a message of peace, solidarity and success which the President of the Republic of Burundi, His Excellency Lt. General Michel Micombero, instructed me to transmit to all nations represented here at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.\n196.\tThe unanimous election of Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka to the presidency of the present session is a great tribute to the spiritual worth of his people and to his own abilities, to his great experience in the work of the United Nations and to his activities over many years in this Organization. Permit me then, Mr. President, to offer you our warm congratulations.\n197.\tI should also like to address my thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who, thanks to his outstanding qualities, his great experience as a statesman, and his dedication to the ideals of the freedom of peoples and equality among all men, has discharged the lofty functions of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly with the skill, wisdom and tact which are his.\n198.\tIn addition, I should like to express the satisfaction and gratitude of my people and my Government to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the outstanding work which he has done as Secretary-General of the United Nations and for the efforts which he continues to make in the service of the international community.\n199.\tThe General Assembly has just admitted the Republic of the Seychelles as the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of the United Nations. May I offer to this young State the warmest congratulations of my Government?\n200.\tMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to express the indignation and disappointment felt by my country when a single vote, in abuse of the right of veto, has prevented the People's Republic of Angola from taking in our Organization the seat which the valor of its people has earned for it. It is unacceptable that so anachronistic and unjust an attitude should still exist in this century thus trampling underfoot the principles of equality of States and the universality of the United Nations.\n201.\tDetermined to practise tolerance, to live in peace with others in a spirit of good neighbourliness and co-operation and to seek together the means of maintaining international peace and security, the representatives of all peoples of the entire world have, since 1945 in San Francisco, met 30 times in regular sessions and seven times in special sessions to debate together international problems in order to find for them, with the assistance and collaboration of everyone, solutions which satisfy all mankind.\n202.\tMeeting today for the thirty-first time in a regular session our Assembly will have to express itself on several questions, some of them to remind us that we are still hungry despite the many resolutions and recommendations which the General Assembly has already taken on them, and others which are new ones and with respect to which we must determine our approach.\n203.\tMuch concern about political problems remains undeniably important, and yet it seems to us that the economic situation requires from the whole of the international community special attention and detailed analysis. Delay, the deaf ear and even the silence of some countries with regard to proposals for the establishment of new and more just international relations, strangely echo the attitude of the colonial Powers towards the just demands for independence of the countries under their rule. In the same way that these countries finally triumphed over their former rulers, those which are fighting for a necessary revision of international economic relations will win-and this is our firm conviction-over those who egotistically argue for the maintenance of the present status quo. Our optimism is based on the justice of our claims, and the fact that a number of industrialized countries are adopting positions favourable to the arguments put forward by the countries of the third world is an encouraging sign for the poor countries which have the greatest need of a new international economic order. Those countries should be thanked for that.\n204.\tThe United Nations has reached the age of adulthood, which coincides with clear thinking and wisdom. May this fourth decade of the United Nations promise us a happy future in international relations. The countries which up to now wished to be the sole masters of the conduct of international affairs and the only guarantors of peace and security in the world will now wish to accept the principle that others, who also desire understanding and harmony, will make their valuable and indispensable contribution to the search for a world in which friendship and brotherhood reign in a climate of solidarity, mutual assistance and understanding.\n205.\tPermit me to take up all these problems in order to express the views of my Government on each of them.\n206.\tThe Government of the Republic of Burundi, which understands the meaning and the price of the liberty which it won and which practises an independent policy, would like to begin by restating its immutable and unconditional support for the national liberation movements which are engaged in an armed struggle for the restoration of their national identity. We are thinking, in particular, of the freedom fighters in southern Africa.\n207.\tThe victories which have already been won in this part of our continent and which peace and freedom-loving men must welcome, and the determination of the nationalists to free themselves from the degrading yoke of the corrupt regimes of Salisbury and Pretoria, enable us to expect their final victory in the near future.\n208.\tThe more the rebel Government of the renegade Ian Smith stubbornly refuses to hand over power to the black majority, the more severe will be our condemnation and the more determined and unconditional our support of the freedom fighters of the African National Council of Zimbabwe. The Republic of Burundi considers that Rhodesia remains, despite everything, a colony, a rebel colony too, unfortunately, and it believes that Great Britain, which remains in principle the administering Power for this Territory, should finally decide to compel Ian Smith and his supporters to accept majority government, which alone can guarantee their safety.\n209.\tBurundi reaffirms that the Rhodesian problem must be solved by the Zimbabwean nationalists and the British Government. We urgently appeal to the British Government to convene a constitutional conference to study the means of transferring power to the majority. For us, it is out of the question to ask the freedom fighters to lay down their arms, and even less to think of lifting the economic sanctions against rebel Rhodesia until the constitutional conference has achieved substantial results.\n210.\tWith regard to Pretoria, the Government of the Republic of Burundi has always expressed its total disapproval of the racist regime of the Vorster Government. This Government, which does not recognize the dignity of the black man because of the colour of his skin, disgraces not only the race whose supremacy he claims to defend but all mankind. The policy of apartheid which is identified with Hitlerian fascism must be fought by all those who believe in human dignity.\n211.\tWe condemn vigorously the activities of the frightening butchers of Pretoria who beat up and kill school children and workers in Soweto and other places, whose only wrongdoing was to claim their most fundamental rights.\n212.\tLegally speaking, Namibia is still a Territory administered by our Organization. My country is a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia. The failure of the international Organization in its task of administering and bringing this Territory to freedom and independence are due not so much to the refusal of Pretoria to hand over power to SWAPO, which is the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people, but also to the active and blind support which certain major Powers give to the South African regime. As far as we are concerned, we are convinced that, if these major Powers had so wished, freedom would have been restored long ago in this part of Africa.\n213.\tIn Western Sahara, Burundi profoundly deplores that the\\\" Saharan people have not been given the fundamental right to decide its own future. The situation prevailing in this Territory is in flagrant contradiction with the decision of OAU, which recommends respect for the old colonial frontiers. This fait accompli constitutes a dangerous precedent in international relations.\n214.\tWith regard to the so-called French Somali coast or Djbouti, the Republic of Burundi hopes that this African territory will as quickly as possible have its independence restored and will exercise it freely without any outside interference.\n215.\tMy country believes the Balkanization of the Comoros to be unacceptable because it is contrary to the oft-repeated principle of the territorial integrity of States.\n216.\tIn the Middle East, my Government's position is very well known. We roundly condemn the intransigent attitude of Israel and its refusal to restore to the Arabs the territories which it occupied by force. We restate our total support for the Palestinian people in its legitimate claim to the inalienable right to have a homeland.\n217.\tWe would like once again to thank and at the same time to congratulate the heroic peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos for the stern lesson which they gave to the whole world by destroying the myth of the invincibility of imperialism. We regret to see that the worthy representatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam must still wait at the door of our Organization.\n218.\tThe victories of the peoples of Indochina, which strengthen us in our conviction that nothing can bring to its knees the united people, naturally give us grounds to hope that we will soon be celebrating the peaceful reunification of independent Korea. In this part of the world in which a people forms a single nation, the Korean nation, and which remains divided against its will and despite the protest of the international community, my country believes that peace will not come except by the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea without any external interference and by the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea, in accordance with resolution 3390 B (XXX). Our Organization must discharge all its responsibilities and make good the wrong it has caused the Korean people.\n219.\tAt San Francisco, only 51 countries, helpless and anguished at the thought of a new war, decided on the Charter which was to govern all mankind. In their bewilderment, only the great Powers, which believed themselves to be the only masters and protectors of mankind, attributed to themselves an exorbitant power -the power to thwart the will of each and every one -thus violating a principle which they themselves had made sacred, namely, the sovereign equality of all States.\n220.\tJust as in the past the People's Republic of China could not occupy its seat among us because of the right of veto, Angola and Viet Nam, countries whose candidatures are supported by more than 123 states Members of our Organization, remain outside our great family. That cannot go on.\n221.\tThe peace and security which underlay the establishment of the United Nations will not be guaranteed until all peoples of die world understand that, being brothers, they must march hand in hand towards the building of a just and equitable society.\n222.\tWe believe that the inequalities between rich and poor countries constitute a source of insecurity in the world. While, for some of us, the major concerns are those of over-armament and over-equipment, for many others it is a question of how to deal with hunger, poverty and ignorance.\n223.\tFor some time, the representatives of the peoples of the third world have been meeting, sometimes together, sometimes with the representatives of the rich countries, to talk about the present state of affairs, which is unfavourable to the great majority of human kind.\n224.\tThe meetings at Georgetown, Dakar, Lima, Manila, Nairobi, and recently those in Colombo and Mexico, can each of them constitute a complete file of analyses which the developing countries have made of the international economic situation. And in addition to those meetings there were also the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, and between those two sessions, the twenty-ninth regular session, which highlighted the flagrant inequality in international economic relations. What can we say of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation which is merely marking time in the French capital?\n225.\tI wish briefly to take up in a general way these points in order to give the position of my Government on a matter which Burundi considers very important.\n226.\tThroughout its existence, the United Nations has had to deal with international problems and has used all its moral weight to defuse crises which might sometimes have led the world into incalculable ..disasters. This must definitely be put to the credit of our Organization.\n227.\tBut political problems are closely linked to economic problems, and we are happy to see that the international community, after having gradually recognized their importance, although somewhat belatedly, is now focusing increasingly on economic relations and is making efforts to invest them with a new character.\n228.\tFurthermore, we note, not without bitterness, that some developed countries are trying to label as confrontation the negotiations which are going on to establish a new international economic order.\n229.\tMy Government thinks that this means of proceeding is a major obstacle to the efforts to promote international economic relations on a more equitable basis.\n230.\tThe developing countries, for their part, have shown great imagination in the various international forums devoted to present economic problems.\n231.\tWhen in 1974, on the initiative of President Houari Boumedidne, the sixth special session of the United Nations was convened, some recognized the imperative need to establish a new economic system based on the interdependence and equality of States. At the end of that session the General Assembly adopted, inter alia, the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and recognized the inalienable sovereignty of States over their natural resources.\n232.\tMy Government believes that the international community must strengthen its activities with a view to the adoption by all States of specific measures concerning the implementation of that Declaration. It is in that sense that the developing countries held a series of meetings with a view to making international opinion aware of that problem.\n233.\tIn 1975 at Dakar the Group of 77 underlined the implications of the exploitation of raw materials on the social and economic development of the countries of the third world. The ferocious exploitation of these raw materials, which began in the long night of the colonial period and which is being continued at break-neck speed by the multinational corporations, had distorted the economies of those States in such a way that they are incapable of coping with the violent crises which shake even the soundest economies.\n234.\tIn order to permit these countries to obtain the resources they need for their development the countries wUch import raw materials must agree to nay more just and remunerative prices.\n235.\tAt Lima the Conference on industrialization and international co-operation  and the ministerial conference of the non-aligned countries  have adequately stressed the importance for the developing countries of the implementation of concerted action to free two thirds of the population of the world from under-development. The ministerial conference of the non-aligned countries stressed in particular the need for international economic cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual interest.\n236.\tAt the seventh special session of the General Assembly, the group of non-aligned countries clearly stated the demands of the developing countries in the field of international co-operation. We believe that resolution 3362 (S-VII), although it does not fully meet the desires expressed by the developing countries, does constitute a step forward towards the establishment of a more equitable world economic order.\n237.\tThat is why my country with all its strength calls upon the international community to ponder seriously the question of economic co-operation among States. For some food experts the world will be threatened with serious shortages in coming years. But what is being done to prevent such disasters? We cannot say exactly. But we do know that other experts, colleagues of the food experts, continue to push to absurd lengths expenditures made for the sake of prestige, of which armaments are the most frightening example.\n238.\tThe developing countries, which are rightly making tireless efforts to break the resistance of the imperialist forces, which stubbornly reject any change in the present system, value greatly the support of the progressive forces in the industrialized countries. For our part we think that the efforts by those countries should be strengthened in Older to stamp the present decade with an irreversible movement towards the establishment of truly democratic international economic relations.\n239.\tPursuing this work of economic liberation the Group of 77 at the Manila Conference  held at the beginning of this year elaborated even more specific proposals which in our view also meet the interests of both the developed and the developing countries. The Manila Declaration and Programme of Action  is a document of very great importance for the future of international economic relations, not only an the most legitimate claim of the third world but also as a broader framework within which economic relations among States may develop.\n240.\tThe Group of 77 had hoped that all countries members of UNCTAD would have no difficulty in supporting these very reasonable proposals, in particular the proposal for the adoption of an integrated commodity programme, including the creation of a joint fund for the financing of international stocks.\n241.\tBut our disappointment was very great when at the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi some of the richest countries opposed the establishment of that fund and wished us to believe that an international resources bank would meet better the interests of all.\n242.\tFor our part, we believe that the integrated programme, with all its elements, would protect the interests of all parties and would on the one hand enable the developing countries to guarantee a degree of stability in their export earnings and, on the other hand, enable the developed countries to count on a regular supply of raw materials for their industries.\n243.\tMy delegation therefore appeals from this rostrum to all States to take specific and speedy measures with a view to implementing the recent recommendations of the fourth session of UNCTAD. \n244.\tDespite all these efforts which the developing countries continue to make either within our Organization or at other international meetings such as those of the non- aligned countries or the Group of 77, the gap between developed and developing countries continues to grow. This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of certain developed countries.\n245.\tIn the field of production and investment, multinational corporations, supported by the political powers to whom they are tied, continue to play an evil role in the process of social and economic development of the countries of the third world and constitute a permanent danger to the political stability of young States.\n246.\tIn the field of trade, manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries continue to run up against the almost insurmountable tariff and non-tariff barriers raised by the developed countries, mainly those with market economies, with a view to maintaining their grip on the traditional markets.\n247.\tWith regard to monetary questions, we reiterate our appeal to economically strong countries to decide to reform the present international monetary system in order to enable developing economies to cope with the problems facing them. The manipulation of prices and currency speculation are the two main factors which weigh heavily on the budgets of young States, cause disturbing deficits in their balances of payments and increase their external indebtedness to unbearable proportions.\n248.\tWe are aware that it is those same Powers that condemn us to under-development and despair, that are doing everything they can to make those debts even heavier and that thus strengthen the economic dependence of the poor countries and seriously compromise their political independence.\n249.\tIn the group of developing countries there is a category which deserves special care and attention on the part of the international community: the least-advanced and land-locked developing countries. These countries have to overcome additional obstacles due to their land-locked situation. The extremely high costs of transport on the one hand weigh heavily on their export earnings and on the other hand greatly swell the cost of their imports.\n250.\tThe Government of Burundi attaches very great importance to an international agreement which would concede to land-locked States free access to the sea and from the sea, as has been proposed at the recent Manila Conference.\n251.\tFurthermore, we ask the richest countries to give substantial aid to that category of countries in their efforts to find a way out of their under-development. We know that the means do exist, but what is lacking is the will to use them better.\n252.\tWe stand by impotently and observe the arms race of the great Powers, which devote astronomical sums to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, but we must proclaim aloud and repeatedly our total disapproval of this wastage, when two thirds of mankind is fighting ignorance, poverty and despair. We affirm that a small percentage of the military budgets of certain Powers, if it were devoted to the development of essential sectors of the poor countries, would alone contribute considerably to raising the standard of living of these poor peoples.\n253.\tWe are convinced that it is not the balance of terror which will guarantee world peace for all time but only the speedy development of the poor countries, which will be a decisive element in promoting international peace and security."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to join the distinguished speakers who preceded me in offering Mr. Amerasinghe the sincere felicitations of my delegation on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. It is the fitting recognition not only of his distinguished record in this world body but also of the high esteem in which his country is held.\n2.\tMay I take this opportunity also, Mr. President, to congratulate the illustrious predecessor of Mr. Amerasinghe, Mr. Gaston Thom, on the distinction and success with which he completed his term of office as President of the last session of file General Assembly?\n3.\tMy delegation would also like to commend Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the diligence and ability with which he has discharged the responsibilities of his high office. At a time when the United Nations is called upon to play an increasingly important role in world affairs, this Organization has greatly benefited from his counsel and valuable experience.\n4.\tWe are particularly happy to welcome in our midst the delegation of the Republic of Seychelles. My Government hopes to be able to establish very cordial relations with the people and Government of this friendly neighbor in the Indian Ocean.\n5.\tThe last three decades have witnessed the dismantling of colonial empires and the triumph of the valiant and dauntless struggle of peoples determined to be free. However, the last few vestiges of alien rule still tenaciously survive in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.\n \n6.\tToday, the great continent of Africa is astir with the promise of total emancipation. The people of Pakistan know from their own national experience that the demand for the right of self-determination of peoples cannot be indefinitely contained by force or political maneuvers. The legitimate struggle of the African people in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa, united and determined to secure their right to freedom, liberty and human dignity, is bound ultimately to triumph.\n7.\tRecent news from southern Africa indicates that a break-through may be in sight. Pakistan has consistently supported the right of the peoples of southern Africa to be masters in their own homes. We have only to look around Rhodesia to realize how false are the fears that the transfer of power to the indigenous people of Zimbabwe will lead to chaos and bloodshed. On file contrary, it is the blind and fanatical attempt of minority regimes to cling to power and to their special privileges which threatens to bring conflict to southern Africa. The sooner the leadership of these regimes recognizes the realities, the better for all the peoples, whatever their race or color, who call southern Africa their home.\n8.\tIt would not be helpful on my part to offer any comment on the substance of the proposals of the Smith regime which are under discussion in connexion with the future of Zimbabwe. The statement made two days ago in Lusaka by the presidents of the five front-line African States concerning those proposals indicates clearly which way lies the road to peace. I Should like to express file hope on behalf of my country that the peace effort now under way, which has aroused high expectations, will not be allowed this time to be frustrated. For the consequences of failure will be grave for Africa and for the rest of the world.\n9.\tWhat I have said about Zimbabwe applies with even greater force to Namibia, a territory which South Africa holds without legal authority and in defiance of decisions of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice. Security Council resolution 385 (1976), unanimously adopted earlier this year, which called for free elections under United Nations supervision and control to determine the status of Namibia must be implemented. The so-called constitutional arrangements announced last month at Windhoek by the Pretoria regime completely ignored the need to hold such elections owing to South Africa's refusal to end its illegal control over this Territory.\n10.\tWe call on the South African regime also to heed the real nature of the turmoil on its own territory and to give up its policy of repression, to stop senseless bloodshed and arrests of its black population and to abandon the abominable policy of apartheid and racial domination. \n11.\tI turn now to our own region. I am glad to be able to confirm the assessment made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization for the current year that \\\"the over-all picture in South Asia as a whole begins to look more encouraging and a spirit of a greater understanding and co-operation seems to be emerging\\\" [A/3111/Add.l, sect. III]. There has been a remarkable improvement in our relations with Bangladesh. The normalization of relations with India continues at a steady pace and all communications air, land and sea-between our countries have been restored; trade resumed after 10 years; and after a gap of four years diplomatic envoys of the two countries have been stationed in the respective capitals.\n12.\tIn brief, all but one of the steps laid down in the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972 for normalizing relations between the two countries have been taken. The one step remaining to be taken under that agreement is to reach a final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. To quote the Secretary-General again: \\\"If the momentum of this welcome development is used to find mutually satisfactory solutions\\\" to outstanding issues, there will be \\\"hope that the area will enter into a new and brighter period\\\" [ibid],\n13.\tWe trust, therefore, that this dispute can also be taken up at an appropriate time and resolved in accordance with the right of self-determination of the people of Kashmir as recognized by the Security Council resolutions unanimously adopted in 1948 and 1949. This right was reaffirmed repeatedly by the late Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, for several years. Those Security Council resolutions and India's pledges have so far remained unimplemented.\n14.\tIn the Simla Agreement, both India and Pakistan resolved to work for the promotion of a harmonious and friendly relationship between them and for the establishment of a durable peace in the subcontinent. Clearly, this objective will not be attained so long as this dispute remains unresolved.\n15.\tI am happy to state that there has been a promising development in our relations with our other neighbor, Afghanistan, following exchange of visits between Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and President Mohammad Daoud. The talks between the two leaders have been friendly and constructive. They have both agreed to find a final settlement of the differences between their two countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful co-existence, which comprise respect for each other's territorial integrity and national independence and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. There is reason to hope that such a settlement may be reached in the near future, thereby contributing significantly to the well-being of the people of both countries and the progress and stability of die region as a whole.\n16.\tIn the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict remains deadlocked. The limited Israeli withdrawal from Sinai in 1975, which was to have been a step towards a comprehensive settlement, is assuming the shape of a status quo, and the hope of an eventual final settlement it had generated has dimmed. We believe that durable peace can return to the Middle East only when Israel withdraws from all Arab territory it has occupied since 1967, including the holy city of Jerusalem, and when the inalienable national rights of the people of Palestine are fully restored. Nothing short of that will bring lasting peace to this war-tom, tormented land.\n17.\tThe tragic chaos in Lebanon is a sombre warning of what awaits the region as a whole if a just settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict is not reached in the near future. For who can doubt that the conflict in Lebanon has its roots in the unresolved problem of Palestine and the over-all Arab-Israeli conflict?\n18.\tThere has been little or no progress in the field of disarmament. In fact, while disarmament negotiations continue, expenditures on armaments mount year after year. A comprehensive test ban, a most important objective of disarmament negotiations, remains elusive. Nuclear tests continue and ever more destructive nuclear weapons are being developed. We believe that unless all nuclear tests, whether above or below ground, are banned, the nuclear arms race will continue and all efforts at nuclear disarmament will prove infructuous. The threat of a nuclear holocaust will continue to loom ominously over the world so long as the nuclear Powers do not cease developing nuclear weapons and do not agree to destroy all existing stockpiles of these weapons.\n19.\tIn such a situation, we believe the time has come to consider, on an urgent basis, the question of security of non-nuclear States against a nuclear attack or threat. In our view, only credible and effective measures would ensure the safety of non-nuclear States from this threat and act as a positive disincentive to nuclear proliferation. In this connexion, we have been urging that the nuclear States undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against those non-nuclear States which are not protected by treaty guarantees from a nuclear Power. Unfortunately, this plea has so far gone unheeded.\n20.\tIn the same context, we have also urged that nonnuclear States, acting in self-defense, adopt regional security measures such as establishment of nuclear-free zones. In particular, we have advocated the creation of such a zone in South Asia. At the twenty-ninth session and again last year, at Pakistan's instance, the General Assembly adopted resolutions resolutions 3265 (XXIX) and 3476 (XXX)] calling for consultation on this subject. A nuclear-free-zone in South Asia will, we believe, help generate a sense of security and peace among the States in this region. It is a matter of great regret that no progress has been made thus far in implementing that resolution. We hope that this matter may receive further consideration during this session.\n21.\tI now turn to the most vital issue of our time: the grave economic disparity between the industrialized and the developing countries and the economic disarray which prevails on every side. What is more, this disparity continues to widen. It has been estimated that in the coming five years, the income per head in the poor countries may increase by at most $10; in the same period, the income of the average citizen in developed countries will increase by $900. In other words, the rich are becoming richer, the poor seem destined to stay dangerously poor.\n22.\tThis is an extremely disturbing situation. It is not the result just of some inherent disability arising from the geographical location of countries, their respective capabilities or resources. It is, in fact, largely man-made.\n23.\tIt has now become plain, and is indeed widely recognized, that some fundamental changes are necessary in the existing economic order, which is loaded heavily in favor of the industrialized countries as against the developing countries. Unless these changes are made and the economic dealings between the developed and the developing countries are put on a just basis, the developing countries will, we fear, never have a fair chance to raise the standard of living of their poverty-stricken masses.\n24.\tIn an article on this subject, which has been circulated as an official document of the General Assembly, Prime Minister Bhutto has put the matter thus:\n\\\"We cheerfully undertake the toil and sweat for a better life for our masses. We accept the denial of immediate comforts. But we cannot allow the value of our sacrifice to be jeopardized by institutions and practices which structurally operate against us. The labor of our masses is being constantly devalued by unequal economic relationships between us and the richer countries.\\\" [See A131/208, annex, sect. III.]\nThe Prime Minister goes on to say that the external economic environment and its integral link with the collective weaknesses of the developing countries are such that the global economy acts like a strong current setting the developing countries back in their voyage to self- realization. This situation, he concludes, is intolerable.\n25.\tUnless the inherent bias of the existing institutions of trade and capital in favor of the strong and the rich is removed and unless the massive economic power of rich countries is counterbalanced by unity among the developing countries, the gap between the poor and the rich will continue to expand, because, in the words of the Prime Minister, a built-in feature of the present international economic order is that \\\"the rich must continue to appropriate an overwhelming proportion of the earth's wealth\\\" [ibid., sect. II].\n26.\tInternational efforts to narrow this widening gap between the developing and the developed countries have so far proved ineffective. The proposal for a new international economic order, launched at the sixth special session, remains still only a concept. The consensus arrived at on this subject at the seventh special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], widely welcomed at this time as a new turning-point, has been all but forgotten. The North-South dialog initiated in Paris last December with much hope and promise has, after nine months of effort, not gone much beyond discussing questions of procedure or making analyses of the situation. The fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [ UNCTAD] held in Nairobi ended in last-minute compromises of a more or less textual character and the value even of these has been virtually nullified by the reservations entered by the most important industrial Powers.\n27.\tMy country firmly believes that a solution of international problems, including the problem of mass poverty and under-development, must be sought through negotiation and constructive dialog. We have never given primacy to doctrine over pragmatism. We neither seek retribution for past wrongs nor close our eyes to present realities. However, we cannot allow the need for consensus to justify inaction. We do not accept that the prevailing situation reflects an immutable reality. We recognize the need for change by evolution but, in practice, what we see is not evolution but inertia, even regression.\n28.\tAccordingly, Prime Minister Bhutto has proposed that developing countries of the third world hold a summit meeting to deal with this all-important issue. This proposal was considered at length in the meeting of the Group of 77 recently held in Mexico. It was there decided that this important proposal should be considered by the Governments of the Group of 77. In our view, the combined will of the peoples of the third world, expressed at the highest level, could alone create the necessary impact in the developed world to make it realize the imperative need for changes in the existing economic order that will assure justice to developing countries. These changes are indispensable in the interest of peace, progress and tranquility. The far-sighted will not fail to recognize that, in the long run, both developed as well as developing countries would stand to benefit from such action.\n29.\tThe history of mankind is a history of movement and transformation. Even in periods of apparent calm, forces of change and flux remain at work under the surface. At other times, the process of change becomes greatly accelerated and assumes revolutionary and violent forms. The century in which we live has been such a period.\n30.\tFor the vast bulk of mankind the past century was a period of subjugation and stagnation. In the last 25 years much of what used to be taken for granted has changed. The sun has finally set on colonial empires. The struggle today is to give concrete shape to independence-not political independence only but economic independence as well. Let interdependence be a reality, not a euphemism for the continued dependence of the poor and the weak on the rich and the strong.\n31.\tAt different periods it has fallen to different nations and peoples to set in motion the wheels of history. Today that responsibility falls upon the part of the globe known as the third world. In pursuing the goal of emancipation, the people of the third world are also fulfilling a historic duty to bring justice and equity to bear upon international relations, the absence of which has been a major reason why the pages of history are filled with conflict, oppression and misery. Given reason and goodwill on all sides, there can be no doubt of the ultimate success of our common struggle.\n"

        "file_text": "With the Assembly's permission, my delegation would like to discharge what to us is an especially important duty. I hope it will not embarrass Mr. Amerasingihe if I extend to him our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.\n46.\tThat tribute was paid to him because of his outstanding qualities as a state-man and an experienced diplomat. It is also a tribute to his country, Sri Lanka, an Asian country which has played a decisive role in the growing self-awareness of the Afro-Asian peoples of the world.\n47.\tOne of the principal promoters of Pan-Asianism and the Afro-Asian spirit, Sri Lanka is a founding member of the movement of the non-aligned countries, which today encompasses nearly all the countries of the third world. At New Delhi in March-April 1947, at Belgrade in September 1961, earlier at Colombo in April 1954 and at Bandung in April 1955, Sri Lanka was instrumental in building the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist movements of Africa and Asia. My country has participated in all the third-world conferences since Bandung and can bear witness to this statement.\n48.\tIt was in view of that exceptional contribution to the awakening of those who have been exploited and colonized on the five continents that the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, meeting at Colombo, appointed Mrs. Bandaranaike, the Prime Minister of that country, Chairman of the non-aligned movement. That distinguished name of Bandaranaike which she so proudly bears calls forth moving memories of important stages in the emancipation struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples.\n49.\tPresident of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, representative of the Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee on non-aligned countries, Chair-man of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction, and Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories- Mr. Amerasinghe has all the qualities and experience needed to conduct our work. The delegation of Mali wishes, through me, to assure him of our active co-operation.\n50.\tSecondly, I wish, through you, Mr. President, sincerely to thank Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, who so skilfully conducted the proceedings of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Thanks to his talents and vitality, he steered our difficult debates clear of a number of shoals. His success was particularly welcome to me because Luxembourg and my country have very friendly relations, both bilaterally and within the association of members of the European Economic Community and of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group, in which he has been a prime mover.\n51.\tMy delegation would not like to conclude these comments without expressing to the Secretary-General our appreciation for the outstanding services that he has rendered to the cause of peace and harmony in the world. He is a trustworthy man with a sense of duty. Mr. Kurt Waldheim, during his brief term of office, has traveled to all continents of the world to take our Organization's message of hope. My delegation wishes to express to him our appreciation for the exceptional contribution that he has made with his characteristic political courage to strengthening the role of the United Nations throughout the world.\n52.\tScarcely two months after OAU did so, the United Nations, on 21 September last, admitted a new Member, the Republic of Seychelles. My delegation bids welcome to that fraternal country and extends to its Government and people our warmest congratulations. We wish to pledge to them Mali's fraternal co-operation. A multiracial country and member of OAU, which acceded to independence in peace and concord, the Seychelles will, I am sure, make a valuable contribution to our work.\n53.\tMy delegation would like also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the victory of the valiant Angolan people over the imperialist forces and their puppets who tried to block their independence. We bow humbly in memory of all those patriots who have fallen for the sacred cause of freedom in Angola. The People's Republic of Angola is a reality today which the world cannot ignore. It is a member of OAU and is recognized by nearly all the States Members of our Organization. The victory of the heroic people of Angola, who fought spontaneously under the banner of the Movimento Popular de Libertao de Angola [MPLA], under the leadership of Agostinho Neto, is the victory of all peace-loving peoples in the world over colonialists and racists. It is also a victory for the United Nations, which has solemnly proclaimed in its Charter the right of all peoples to freedom and independence.\n54.\tThe international Community can no longer tolerate the unjustified and unbearable obstruction of the admission of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations. More and more people here are speaking out against those attempts, because they undermine the prestige of our Organization and are also a flagrant violation of the principle of universality, which is the very strength of our Organization. The admission of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam cannot be postponed any longer, without defying democracy and calling into question the moral authority of the United Nations. The thirty-first session of the General Assembly must live up to its responsibilities and assert what is right and just concerning the admission of those two States, which find the door of the United Nations unfairly closed to them by reason of the improper use of the veto right by the United States of America.\n55.\tThe maintenance of that exorbitant privilege which was granted by the founders at San Francisco to the allied Governments following their victory over Nazism can no longer be justified and is no longer in keeping with present-day reality or with simple justice. The decisions of the United Nations must reflect the interests of all the Member States. In such fundamental questions of the admission of States, a single Member can no longer assert certain domestic considerations which have little to do with the mission assigned to the Organization by its Charter. It is reprehensible indeed that a single negative vote can cancel out the positive votes of 14 other members of the Security Council. That is a denial of the principles of democracy. We must put an end to that anomaly which paralyses our Organization and discredits us in the eyes of the peoples of the world which we represent.\n56.\tThe improper use of the veto right by certain permanent members of the Security Council has blocked the process of decolonization in southern Africa and has put a brake on effective action by the international community to bring down the racist and rebel regimes of Pretoria, Salisbury and Tel Aviv. Assured of impunity, thanks to the protection of their allies, they are openly challenging our Organization and have done so for a number of decades. That is why, at its thirteenth session, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU, meeting at Port Louis, adopted a resolution calling for a reconsideration of the veto right in the United Nations. We are sure that a number of delegations here present share the views and concern of OAU on that question.\n57.\tIn the opinion of my delegation, the imperative task before us, namely the democratization and the rationalization of our institutions, requires that we reconsider the veto right of some Member States in the organ which is primarily responsible for the maintenance of peace in the world, the raison d'Stre of our Organization, this question must occupy a central role in our efforts to revise the Charter and restructure our institutions. The efficiency and the credibility of the United Nations depend on that action. I remain convinced that everyone has a proper appreciation of the importance of what is at stake.\n\n58.\tThe sessions of the General Assembly give us an opportunity to review the international situation, to sum up what we have done for peace over the past year and to contemplate the future in the light of the objectives of the Charter. In this connexion, while we may say that relative peace has reigned in South-East Asia since the victory in the spring of 1975 of the patriotic fronts in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos, at the same time we must realize that with respect to certain sources of tension, the focus has shifted to Africa and western Asia. The bloodshed at Soweto, the general uprising of the blacks and the Coloreds in the large towns of South Africa against the inhumanity of apartheid and the savage and blind repression which followed, and which indeed continues today, reminded the international community of the ugly nature of the Fascist regime in Pretoria.\n59.\tSome like to say, perhaps to quiet their consciences, that for the past three decades there has been no war in the world. For them, regardless of the number of the victims, an armed confrontation is no undue source of concern, unless the arena is Europe and unless it endangers the major military Powers. In the terminology of those \\\"mentors\\\", the wars in Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, in the course of which the aggressors and their allies in the South-East Asia Treaty Organization used the means of mass destruction and extermination in a vain attempt to reduce the peoples of those countries to subjection, those wars are merely local conflicts. A more cynical view, indeed, could not be taken. It is not a well-known fact that in Viet Nam alone the quantities of bombs that were dropped during the 30 years of the national liberation struggle equaled in force all the bombardments that took place during the Second World War? From January to August 1973, from 4,000 to 5,000 tons of bombs per month were dropped on Cambodia, which is the equivalent of six atomic bombs of the type used at Hiroshima. For our part we would contradict that incorrect theory and say that the world has not known peace since 1939. The theater of war has moved from Europe to the third world, where violence has at times been extreme.\n60.\tAfrica, like Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, does not need the \\\"compassion\\\" of those theoreticians and, if necessary, it will take up arms to free itself from the yoke of the racist regime of Pretoria and the rebel clique of Ian Smith. The peoples of those countries are on a war footing and they are determined today more than ever to recover the land of their ancestors and to determine their own future. The killings at Soweto, Alexandra and other black ghettos in South Africa have only made them stronger.\n61.\tWe consider in this connexion that the historic communique of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five Nordic countries published at Copenhagen on 20 August last is an exceptional contribution to the liberation struggle of Africa. We should like to extend our thanks and congratulations to the peoples and Governments of those countries who have not spared their material, moral and political support to the freedom fighters.\n62.\tMy delegation condemns, however, the recent agreement between South Africa and France on a nuclear power station.\n63.\tThe international community will assume sole responsibility for the racial confrontation brought about by its own inertia. The fact that some major Powers have paralysed the United Nations gives Africans no alternative \nbut to wage an armed struggle to win their inalienable right to freedom. We shall not retreat because ours is a just fight and our victory is inevitable. Azania, Zimbabwe and Namibia will be liberated. Mayotte will become part of the Comorian group, to which it has never ceased to belong. France has illegally occupied that province of the Comoros and must give it up immediately.\n64.\tNo stalling tactics, regardless of how subtle they may be, and no military force can prevent the African peoples from achieving their final goal, namely, the total liberation of the last bastions of colonialism and racism in Africa. The last vestiges of colonialism will also be uprooted from the continents of Asia and Latin America by their people.\n65.\tReturning to western Asia, we note that there has been no progress in settling the two crises which have existed there for a number of years, namely, the crisis in the Middle East and the crisis in Cyprus.\n66.\tThe situation in the first case is stalled because Israel refuses to abide by the relevant decisions of our Organization. The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, created by General Assembly resolution 3376 (XXX), has had no greater success with the authorities in Tel Aviv.\n67.\tThe tragedy which continues to tear Lebanon apart and which indeed is a constant and daily threat to the very existence of that country and its people is one of the tragic consequences of the lack of improvement in the situation in that region.\n68.\tTension is mounting in the Middle East and Israel continues to arm itself feverishly and to strengthen its alliance and military co-operation with the racist and Fascist regime in Pretoria. The theory of secure and recognized boundaries advanced by the officials in Tel Aviv is more and more being replaced by that of secure and defensible boundaries. The establishment of settlements, which has become State policy, is being frantically pursued in the occupied Arab territories. The \\\"Koenig plan\\\" is being hatched; here we have an antisocial plan which advocates a series of measures to check the growth of the Arab population in the country.\n69.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains more explosive than ever. Israel's boasting and untimely out-bursts can ignite the powder at any moment. The United Nations must therefore reactivate the process of finding a settlement to the Middle East crisis before it is too late. It is above all up to the United Nations to implement the relevant resolutions which it adopted on the question and which established the framework, namely, Israel's unconditional withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n70.\tThis latter question is at the very heart of the Middle East crisis. That is why our Organization believes that the return of the Palestinian people to its homeland, which was usurped by international Zionism, is the sine qua non for a settlement. The Committee which was established to that end at the last session of the General Assembly was unfortunately not able to carry out its mission owing to\nIsrael's categorical refusal to co-operate with it. We must therefore see to it at this session that the Tel Aviv Government gives up its negative and belligerent attitude. If necessary, we must force it to do so by having recourse to the relevant provisions of the Charter. Let us not wait until violence breaks out in the area before attempting to contain it. Let us act in accordance with our responsibilities while there is still time. That is the price for a return to a just and lasting peace in this martyred land of the Middle East.\n71.\tThe other center of tension in western Asia, Cyprus, continues to be a source of concern to us. Indeed, since the adoption by the General Assembly in 1974 of resolution 3212 (XXIX), no progress has been made in the inter- communal talks which that resolution recommended to the parties and which constitute the most appropriate framework for negotiating a just and lasting settlement of the crisis, that is to say, a settlement that would safeguard the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and policy of non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, which our Organization has pledged to guarantee.\n72.\tThe five series of talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in Cyprus have not produced any significant result. However, the doors are still open to new attempts at a settlement. The praiseworthy efforts that the Secretary-General continues to make to establish a basis for resumed negotiations among the parties should be supported and encouraged by our Assembly.\n73.\tWhen I spoke a moment ago about South-East Asia, I said that there was only relative peace there. I would add that it will remain precarious so long as that sub-continent continues to be plagued by the access of the Korean crisis. This was dramatically revealed by the well-known tree- cutting incident of August last. It was quite possible that that incident could have degenerated into open hostilities, and our Organization would have found itself involved, even though it has no effective responsibility in the country. Indeed, during this incident the so-called United Nations Command in Korea was receiving its instructions from a third authority and not from our Organization.\n74.\tWe must draw a lesson from that. In fact, the United Nations served only to lend its name throughout the Korean war. It is only by making use of this subterfuge that the southern part of the country was turned into a military base for aggression, endowed with a formidable arsenal which even includes nuclear warheads. That is an example of the danger to peace and security in South-East Asia as a result of the tension persisting in Korea, as well as indication of the gravity of our responsibilities in maintaining the so-called United Nations Command. That is why my delegation believes that its dissolution is imperative, as was decreed by the General Assembly in its resolution 3390 B (XXX), which was not implemented because of the obstruction of certain Member States.\n75.\tThe Koreans and the Koreans alone must be allowed to settle their dispute without any foreign interference. The foreign armed forces now in place there must be withdrawn unconditionally, in order to make it possible for negotiations to resume between the two parties on the basis of the 4 July 1972 joint communique of their Red Cross Societies.\nThe Armistice Agreement of 27 My 1953 is no longer relevant, and it must be replaced by a peace agreement. In the settlement of the Korean crisis,' the United Nations must ensure the territorial integrity of the country, which it has pledged to guarantee. Resolution 3390 B (XXX) remains valid in this connexion; our Organization must require that all its provisions be implemented.\n76.\tAs we have just seen, the international situation once again confirms that the third world is not benefiting from detente; its promoters in any case conceived it only for the European continent and related areas beyond the Atlantic. The detente held out to us is based more on a balance of terror than on a real political desire to promote peace and true collective security in the world. Because of that, its foundations are fragile and its scope limited.\n77.\tThe third world has become accustomed to this cruel reality. That is why the arms race is being frantically pursued. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and the partial disarmament agreements concluded thus far have, as we have always said, been- outside the framework of real disarmament, that is to say, general, complete and con-trolled disarmament. The second round of the strategic arms limitations talks remains suspended and the conference on the mutual and balanced reduction of forces in central Europe seems to have come to a standstill.\n78.\tAs the Secretary-General so aptly said in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"Any significant advance towards a system of world order based on collective responsibility will depend upon a degree of disarmament and upon a climate of confidence, both of which are lacking today.\\\" [See Aftl/l/ Add. 1, sect. V.]\nNo one is any longer deceived and no State any longer believes in the theory of collective security, which nevertheless remains vital for the survival of mankind. That is why increasing amounts are being spent on armaments.\n79.\tAgain in the introduction to his report the Secretary- General indicated this when he said:\n\\\"... while the world spends approximately $300 billion a year on armaments, the net flow of official development assistance amounts to some $15 billion a year. Resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion} which is roughly equivalent to the 1976 gross national product of the entire world.\\\" [Ibid.]\nThat is stupefying!\n464\n80.\tVertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation is continuing. The \\\"grey\\\" market is expanding daily. The Fascist and belligerent regimes, such as those of Pretoria, Taiwan and Tel Aviv, now have nuclear capability thanks to official transactions. The world is living with the specter of self-destruction, while it must at the same time cope with the most serious challenges in its long history. But the words of the Preamble of the Charter are before us to remind us of the solemn commitments which we have undertaken vis-a-vis future generations. There is still time for the international community to come to its senses and resolutely move towards genuine disarmament, that is, general, complete and controlled disarmament.\n81.\tIn this connexion we would recommend to the Assembly for assessment and consideration the resolution adopted at the Colombo Conference, in which the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on this question was proposed. [A/31/197, annex IV, resolution 12.]\n82.\tAs I said during the general debate last year,  the insecurity which characterizes the international situation in regard to peace is also, unfortunately, a feature of the world economic situation. The same division exists, namely, the developed world on one side and the third world or the developing world on the other.\n83.\tMore than two years after the sixth special session and one year after the seventh special session, which established the bases of a new international economic order to redress the imbalance, no progress has been made in the implementation of the celebrated Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], which are the basis and the charter of that new international economic order.\n84.\tWorld-wide inflation, the recession in the industrialized countries and the iniquities of international trade have only widened the gap between the developed countries and the developing countries. Even before the world crisis the developing countries were finding it difficult to keep up with the implacable needs of development, and now their situation has worsened as a result both of the decrease in their resources and of the reduced flow of the foreign capital necessary for them to maintain their growth rate. According to recent estimates by the World Bank, there has been a zero growth rate, since 1975, in the per capita income in the least developed among the developing countries.\n85.\tThe various conferences held for the purpose of setting up the structures of the new international economic order have yielded very meagre results indeed.\n86.\tFirst and foremost, there has been the North-South dialogue in Paris, or the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which, had it not been for the ingenuity of the co-chairmen, would have failed because of the differences on the problem of the establishment of a common fund for commodities and the problem of public debt in the third world. Although we recognize that that Conference has some merit, the fact remains that we have no illusions about the results, for we still see no sign of a genuine thaw.\n87.\tWith regard to the fourth session of UNCTAD, held at Nairobi in May 1976, it ended its work, at the eleventh hour, after stormy debates and under the pressure of world \npublic opinion, with a consensus to which some delegations of the industrialized market-economy countries paid only lip service; indeed, shortly afterwards they rejected the consensus' in June during a ministerial session of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. The negative attitude adopted by those countries constitutes a serious hindrance to the North-South dialog in Paris.\n88.\tI turn now to the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, held last June at Vancouver. It too was characterized by a regrettable division between the North and the South.\n89.\tFinally, I would refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which deals with an area unanimously regarded as the common heritage of mankind. Here again we must note that the participants at the fifth session were unable to reach any agreement. The intransigent statements of some delegations reminded us of the famous Berlin Congress of 1885, which made official the division of colonial possessions among the imperial Powers. The paradox of this \\\"1976 Congress\\\", that is, the fifth session of the Conference, is that the victims of the dividing up of the sea, the common heritage of mankind, are the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States, including some industrialized countries of Europe.\n90.\tIn this case the division is not based on traditional affinities, but on interests of the moment. On the one hand we have the coastal States and on the other the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged countries. None of the just claims of the latter countries were accepted. Actually, they were only asking for the legal confirmation of a de facto situation rather than making new claims. They asked that the convention being drawn up should merely note the right of free access to and from the sea and the right to exploit the marine resources in future exclusive zones. That request was refused. But the coastal States are about to obtain legal sanction for all their new demands. In order to bypass the requests of the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged countries, the spokesmen of the coastal States went so far as to offer them a deal, and what a deal! There is a flagrant injustice here. The international community cannot assume responsibility for that.\n91.\tMali, my country, has no problem with its neighbors in regard to its access to and from the sea. It has the best of relations with the fraternal States of the Ivory Coast, Guinea and Senegal, which provide all port and transit facilities without asking anything in return. But in legislating for the future we must, taking into account the lessons of history, adopt a broader view than those who attended the Berlin Congress in 1885, Let us not, then, draw up, in the name of the United Nations, legal instruments that can lead to conflicts between future generations, when we know that under the Charter we are' committed to preserving those future generations from the scourge of war.\n92.\tLet us not encourage, through the strengthening of this division, the establishment of a \\\"fourth world\\\", as is desired by some theoreticians who always need something to prophesy about. The accentuation of the division in the world and the confrontation between groups of interests that could result from that division represent sources of tension that will inevitably endanger peace in the more or less distant future. The sea, the common heritage of mankind, which only yesterday belonged to no one, must be exploited for the benefit of all. It is in that spirit that we must draw up the new convention on the law of the sea, which will be, let us never forget, one of the main pillars of the new international economic order, which everyone ardently wishes to see established. Justice and solidarity are the principles that should guide us all as we build this edifice.\n93.\tThe fourth part of my review of the world economic situation relates to international economic co-operation. Here again there has been no progress.\n94.\tIndeed, there has been a net reduction in the official development assistance of the industrialized countries. If the present rate continues, that assistance will be reduced by 1980 to 0.29 per cent of those countries' gross national product, whereas the Second United Nations Development Decade has established a goal of 0.7 per cent for that period. The praiseworthy financial assistance given by the countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to the developing countries between 1970 and 1975, amounting to $16 billion, was insufficient to make up for the deficiency.\n95.\tFurthermore, the prospects for the fifth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association [IOA], a branch of the World Bank which was established to assist in the financing of the development of the poorest countries, by means of long-term, interest-free bans are not encouraging because of the reluctance of the traditional donors. Indeed, the trend seems to be towards a reduction in contributions whereas, in view of the inflation in the world, fluctuations in national currencies, and the recession, the resources of IDA should be increasing if the level of action of the fourth replenishment, which will come to an end on 30 June 1977, is to be maintained in the future.\n96.\tWith regard to the financing of the \\\"third window\\\", the World Bank has been able to mobilize only $600 million of the target of $1 billion. The International Fund for Agricultural Development, established in November 1974, has not yet been able to start operating because of the lack of resources.\n97.\tThe picture that we have just painted is certainly not a brilliant one. It contains many shadows which must be eliminated if we really wish to establish the new international order that we have promised the world. Such an undertaking, on which the salvation of everyone depends, is incompatible with the spirit of exploitation and domination that guides certain large Powers. It is incompatible too with the subjugation of peoples that still persists in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n98.\tThe new international order, which is composed of a political, a military and an economic aspect, is an indivisible whole. If it is to be viable it must be based on justice, solidarity, harmony and collective security and responsibility. If that new international order is not established, mankind will succumb to confrontation and chaos. No nation, no group of nations, however powerful, can face alone the challenges confronting mankind. It is therefore high time that the great Powers of our world came to their senses and demonstrated a real political will to act in the common struggle we have undertaken for our survival. The implacable law of interdependence obliges them to do so. In any case, they have no alternative. May they heed this final appeal that my delegation takes the liberty of making to them through you, Mr. President.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all I should like to express to you my warmest congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The great talent of the Permanent Representative of SriLanka, of the President of the Conference on the Law of the Sea and of the representative in New York of the presidency of the non-aligned countries is known to all. I have no doubt that at this session it will increasingly manifest itself. The co-operation of the French delegation will be yours in helping you to bring to a successful conclusion your difficult task in the next few weeks.\n90.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly displayed qualities of intelligence and character which made him the candidate of the group to which France belongs. An illustrious European and hence familiar with international problems, he found here a scene that' was equal to the exceptional talents and gifts which brought him to the head of the Government of a country united to France both by the ties of history and geography and by those of the heart, will and reason.\n91.\tLastly, I am particularly pleased to find here again my friend Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who was so frequently for me a welcoming and understanding interlocutor and to tell him to what extent France appreciates the talent, the authority and the tact with which he accomplishes his lofty and difficult mission. Our confidence in him has never been wanting, and he still has our full support.\n92.\tIt is not without some emotion that, after having been twice accredited to the United Nations and, just recently, the Permanent Representative of France for more than four years, I address the Assembly today in this familiar setting in my capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs. I recognize the honor but also the weight of the duty which falls to me in this circumstance when once again, this time vested with broader responsibilities, I must make France's voice heard. My task is lightened by the pleasure I feel at seeing so many familiar faces and at drawing on such recent memories.\n93.\tIt will not surprise members of the Assembly that as a former Permanent Representative I am tempted to review the world situation in the light of our Charter. This document, written 30 years ago, is still the basic instrument of international co-operation. Do not its preamble and the purposes and principles it lays down for oar Organization in memorable words contain a statement of the aspirations that should determine the action of peoples and States? A comparison between what should be and what actually is should serve to stimulate reflection and spur efforts so that, in this necessarily interdependent world where we live, war, poverty, intolerance and discrimination will no longer have to be put up with as inevitable ills.\n94.\tTo save succeeding generations from the scourge of war: that is the first goal set by the Charter. Although there is now no military conflict between States in the conventional sense of the word, how can we fail to see that overt or potential hotbeds of crisis persist or have developed quite recently?\n95.\tThe crisis in Lebanon, a country to which France is deeply attached, is a tragic illustration of this fact. That country, once a model of coexistence among different communities, has been subject to uncontrolled outbreaks of violence for more than a year now. An implacable mechanism has consistently kindled new flames from the smoking ashes of each previous outbreak. What is at stake is Lebanon's very existence and the survival of its people in all their richness and diversity. It rests with the Lebanese people themselves to find through dialog a political solution which, alone, can put an end to these fratricidal struggles.\n96.\tOn behalf of the French Government, I should like to express again to Mr. Elias Sarkis, the new President of the Lebanese Republic, our heartfelt wishes for the success of the difficult task he is undertaking and our hope that once peace is restored the Lebanese people will be able to devote their efforts to the necessary work of reconstruction.\n97.\tI should like to state here that the crisis in Lebanon will be resolved only by a settlement based on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country. The French Government, for its part, remains available and, in particular, willing to facilitate any meeting or any search for reconciliation, which obviously presupposes a definitive cessation of the fighting. With a view to this, France is maintaining close contact with all the parties to the conflict.\n98.\tDeeply moved by the suffering of the entire Lebanese people, we have endeavored to provide humanitarian aid. Assistance has been granted to Lebanese nationals temporarily living in France and large shipments of medical supplies have been sent to Lebanon itself. Moreover, we are ready to lend our help, in conjunction with our partners in the European Community, to the reconstruction of Lebanon.\n99.\tBut the solution of the Lebanese tragedy cannot be separated from the solution of the Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole. These three questions are in fact inextricably linked. It is for that reason that in the latter two cases we reaffirm both the necessity to implement Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and the basic nature of the three principles upon which any lasting settlement must necessarily rely: withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, recognition of the Palestinians' right to a homeland, and the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to live in peace within secure, recognized and guaranteed boundaries.\n100.\tThe basis of any just and lasting settlement can be found in the application of those principles, especially as regards the Palestinians. That people, raised in hardship and made strong by suffering, has now taken its place as a necessary partner in any negotiation. It has become quite obvious that no solution to the conflict is possible unless the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to express its national identity becomes a reality. But how can that right be exercised without a territorial base which, at the proper time, could be given the structures of statehood?\n101.\tClose to the Middle East is another area of tension, Cyprus. The United Nations feels especially responsible because it decided on the framework and guidelines for a settlement there. We are obliged, unfortunately, to recognize that the resolution adopted by our Assembly two years ago [resolution 3212 (XXIX)] has so far remained a dead letter.\n102.\tIndeed, a settlement can result only from an agreement between the communities of the Republic of Cyprus. The United Nations has never ignored this. France and her European Community partners have, for their part, tried to persuade the parties involved to set aside passion and resentments, even when justified, in order to begin genuine negotiations and reach a settlement in keeping with law and justice. Such a settlement must preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and must be acceptable to all Cypriots.\n103.\tThe Secretary-General, who was entrusted by the Security Council with a mission whose importance deserves special emphasis, has tried in every way he has felt possible to carry out this mission successfully. He is striving and will continue to strive with ail his well-known dedication to bring about a real resumption of and progress in inter- communal negotiations and to help them to move forward. We consider his contribution indispensable in attaining the goal we all seek: the restoration of peace in Cyprus and a return to its former prosperity.\n104.\tI have cited only the examples of Lebanon, the Middle East and Cyprus here, but this by no means implies that the solemn pact that commits us \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another\\\" is being respected everywhere else.\n105.\tI note, however, that in South-East Asia, where the guns have at last fallen silent, the possibility does exist for the principles of our Charter now to find fruitful application. And what more fervent hope could we have for South-East Asia, so long divided and battered, than that peace should take hold, independence assert itself and co-operation increase in a spirit of tolerance? The recent improvement of bilateral relations among the various States of the region gives ground for hope that the time will come for a free and harmonious concertation; it gives hope that a regional grouping can be formed in mutual respect, a grouping that will make it possible to ensure the neutrality of South-East Asia as a whole and to pool efforts to meet the challenge of development. Who can fail to see how valuable an example the success of such an undertaking would be?\n106.\tNobody, of course, should put himself in the place of the nine countries of South-East Asia to assess the timeliness of one move or another or suggest the most appropriate ways in which they might co-operate. But it is our task to increase the chances of success and eventually to uphold the results of any initiative which would spare over 300 million people the dangers of new conflicts and the effects of confrontations which are not their own.\n107.\tFrance, which has so many ties with that part of the world and whose sole ambition is to best serve the interests of the countries there, is for its part determined, along with all those who share its concern, to make every effort to further this end.\n108.\tPeace, the goal which is central to our action, is the product of an equilibrium which is built on the independence of States and nations, to be sure, but it also needs broader foundations. Back in 1945 did we not, after all, proclaim our \\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\"?\n109.\tMuch has been said and done, right here and elsewhere, towards the realization of this noble goal. But we are forced to note that there are distressing situations in the world today which may at times actually jeopardize peace. Those situations arise from the failure to recognize the fundamental rights of the human person.\n110.\tI am thinking most particularly of southern Africa, where tension and confrontation are becoming more acute. This development justifies the part we are taking and the support we are giving to the efforts to prevent a fatal escalation. It is all too evident that racial discrimination is the underlying cause of the crisis, though situations may differ here and there. France -and I want to say this with the greatest possible emphasis-rejects and condemns the policy of apartheid. The recent tragic incidents should have made South Africa's leaders realize at long last that such persistent contempt for the dignity of the human person in itself constitutes a source of perpetual conflict among men, and this could lock their country in a deadly cycle of unrest and repression.\n111.\tThe fact that France, like other countries, but to a lesser extent than some, maintains commercial relations with South Africa obviously should not be interpreted as contradicting its position on apartheid. The peaceful nature of a recent contract in the electro-nuclear sector has been amply demonstrated, as is witnessed, moreover, by the international guarantees that have been granted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n112.\tThe French Government's condemnation of racial discrimination and other aspects of the policy followed by Pretoria led it to adopt an increasingly restrictive policy with regard to the delivery of arms and ultimately to prohibit any new contracts or further sales. I informed the Security Council of this on 19 June in my capacity as Permanent Representative.  I am saying it again here as a member of the French Government.\n113.\tElsewhere in southern Africa, the situation is of still more immediate concern. It is a matter of urgency that Namibia should in accordance with United Nations resolutions accede to sovereignty and independence under the supervision of our Organization after a constitutional process in which the political groups, the principal one being SWAPO, should participate. In several instances, we, together with our European partners, have approached Pretoria to that effect.\n114.\tIt is no less urgent a matter for the majority to accede to power in Rhodesia. Accordingly we welcomed \nthe announcement in which the illegal regime in Salisbury has at long last accepted that principle following the recent mission to southern Africa by the Secretary of State of the United States, In this matter, as in the question of Namibia, he has had our encouragement. Without concealing from ourselves the difficulties that still have to be overcome, we want to note the decisive step that has been taken and the change in thinking that it shows. In so far as the two communities and the African leaders directly concerned are prepared with the assistance of the administering Power to draw conclusions from this, it seems to us that prospects for a peaceful settlement may be foreseen, in accordance with the wish that France has always expressed.\n115.\tThe right of peoples to self-determination is written into our Charter. It has been the guiding principle through-out our policy on decolonization, and it is still our foremost criterion in defining the future of peoples and the framework for their existence.\n116.\tWith regard to the Comoros, France has scrupulously applied this principle, and we intend to remain faithful to it. Although we have raised no obstacle to the admission of the State of the Comoros to the United Nations, our attitude has frequently not been understood. I do not wish to harp on misunderstandings that I should like to see overcome. What is past is past; we are looking only to the future. I can tell you that the proposal on the status of Mayotte, to be submitted to the French Parliament, will indeed leave open all possibilities for the future, with due respect for the wishes of the peoples.\n117.\tIn the French Territory of the Afars and Issas, France is engaged in a process that will lead in a democratic manner to independence, if such is the wish of the population. Our intentions are, I believe, now understood, especially by those who are concerned most particularly with the peaceful settlement of this question, and under-stood by all those who have wanted to listen to us. We hope that all the States which call for this evolution will contribute to it as the process develops.\n118.\tAt this point I should like to emphasize that the issue of development is one of major importance for the African continent. Absolute priority has to be given to enabling African States rapidly to improve the lot of their peoples. This is one of the governing principles of France's African- policy. Therefore, the President of the Republic recently proposed the creation of a fund for African advancement, an instrument of solidarity for the financing of development projects that are of special interest, particularly for the least favored countries.\n119.\tThe need to give priority to development problems quite naturally leads us to hope that Africa will remain free from ideological conflicts and will not become a pawn of Powers outside the continent. As Mr.Giscard d'Estaing recently said:\n\\\"Africa must be left to the Africans, and the only competition that serves its interest is competition, the sole objective of which is the economic, social and cultural development of Africa.\\\"\n120.\tLatin America too aspires to define its identity still more clearly. Its vast reservoir of human and intellectual potential, its rich cultural past and its very considerable resources assure for this continent a promising future. The affinity we have with its peoples makes us particularly sensitive to the respect for human dignity and the tolerance enjoined on us by our Charter, of which, as we know, Latin American nations have so frequently set an example.\n121.\tRespect for the rights of the human person is not an obligation incumbent on States alone. Our laws and customs impose it on individuals as well. Here I should like to add France's voice to the universal cry of condemnation and anguish that is aroused by acts of terrorism. The point is not to determine whether certain forms of violence generate others, but to condemn such acts in their principle and to repress them because they involve innocent people, without distinction as to age or sex, making them instruments of intolerable blackmail.\n122.\tThe measures that should be taken to end this outrage are part of the yet unfinished labor of defining, and especially of ensuring, proper respect for human rights.\n123.\tWe fully approve of the initiative taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to combat the taking of hostages, and we will support it to the full.\n124. But it is not enough to remove the most imminent threats of conflict and the most brutal manifestations of violence or better to guarantee the exercise of justice. The authors of the Charter knew full well that the freedom of mankind is but an empty phrase if the material prerequisites for existence are not satisfied. Hence the ultimate grand design which they assigned to our Organization: namely, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\n125.\tOf course, the results achieved cannot yet be considered satisfactory: the intolerable gap between the multitude of poor countries and the small minority of developed countries remains an object of scandal. It explains one of the predominant factors of tension in our world. But the United Nations effort to attain the objective of economic progress and justice deserves recognition. Over the years, right in this very place, I have witnessed the growing importance accorded development and co-operation. The seeds of these concepts were in the text of the Charter. Thirty years later, they have become an imperative.\n126.\tFrance, for its part, believed in this effort-an effort made within our Organization, by our Organization. At the early sessions of UNCTAD, France presented specific ideas on the percentage of public aid for development, generalized preferences and the organization of raw-materials markets, which have made considerable headway. France closely associated itself with the elaboration of the Inter-national Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and confirmed its interest in this collective effort. When it became evident that new relations had to be established between the producers and consumers of energy, the French Government turned first to the United Nations to deal with this problem. Lastly, France has participated unconditionally and without ambiguity in the immense undertaking of joint reflection required to set up a new international economic order. For, indeed, this is precisely what has to be done: to replace the disorder in world economic relations, and the relations of force permeating them, by the quest for rationality and justice; and to ensure lastingly, at the world level, as was stated last year by the President of the Republic, a better balance of trade, economic activity, currencies and revenues.\n127.\tWe are still wide of the mark, but progress has been made. Indispensable transfers of resources from the developed countries to the developing world are on the rise. That will be the case this year for the volume and percentage of French public aid. But what can and should evolve are the very structures of international trade. In this respect, I think that we must not underestimate the positive results of the fourth session of UNCTAD. After years of procrastination, the international community has finally committed itself to work for the organization of markets. France, whose delegation to that Conference took the initiative of making certain proposals concerning the centralized financing of buffer stocks of raw materials and which participated very closely in the drafting of the fundamental resolutions, is firmly resolved to participate actively and in good faith in the implementation of the principles approved in Nairobi.\n128.\tThe negotiations to begin shortly in Geneva on this vital question and the discussions to be continued on other important problems will require the understanding and patience of us all. Reason and realism preclude recourse to slogans and rejection of the facts. This law of life is even more binding in debates on the full range of economic problems, from energy to development, as is the case in the only forum with such a complete agenda- the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, which is being held in Paris at present.\n129.\tIt is only natural that the tensions of international life should be reflected in the work of that Conference since the justifiable impatience of the third world is so keen and since it is so difficult to define truly valid solutions in these diverse areas, even when agreement can be reached on the principles to be respected and the goals to be attained.\n130.\tBut the instrument is there if we want to, and if we can, go further. It is a unique instrument, with advantages recognized by all the participants, an instrument that can easily be used to complement the large meetings of the United Nations.\n131.\tThe world conferences held in recent years have broadened our field of action. I will mention, in particular, the United Nations Conference on the. Human Environment, held in Stockholm last year, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Lima last year, and, more recently, the International Labor Organization's Tripartite Conference on Employment, Income Distribution, Social Progress and the International Division of Labor. As the goals defined by Governments in their successive assemblies acquire world-wide importance, the variety of means and solutions must also grow. No prejudices should be allowed to limit the choice of methods needed to attain the desired goals.\n132.\tThe specific role of the United Nations is not to tackle each and every problem. It is still less to serve as an arena for conflicts in which the stakes would be the ephemeral, and useless, victory of one ideology over another. As the Charter says so well, the Organization must be \\\"a center for harmonizing the actions of nations\\\" for purposes they hold in common. What we expect from it, through reflection, discussion and practical action, is that it arrive at and constantly perfect an overall strategy to build this more effective, more equitable economic order.\n133.\tThere is no doubt that laying the foundations of this new order will be a lengthy task, because it involves nothing less than getting the world started in a new phase of organization and setting up a global system that reconciles the liberal principles of the old order with new measures governing structure and organization.\n134.\tThe basics are already present, namely, each nation's acceptance of this common endeavor of justice. As for concrete measures, we must still avoid getting bogged down in facile ultimatums and ready-made solutions. We have yet to listen to our partner, and confirm our faith in negotiation and co-operation, as the Economic and Social Council asked us to do at its session this summer in Abidjan. In order for us to be faithful to the spirit of the Charter, we must still combine perseverance, courage and realism.\n135.\tTo \\\"live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\" is the last great aspiration that the Charter proposes to our peoples.\n136.\tThe organization of regional relations, particularly in Latin America and Africa, corresponds to this desire. I shall refrain from making an assessment which our friends from these regions might find out of place. I shall merely recall the progress made in Europe.\n137.\tThe fratricidal wars of the past now belong to history. The distrust and antagonism of former days have been replaced by entente, co-operation and organization.\n138.\tThe organization is, first of all, that of the Europe of the nine members of the European Economic Community; Year after year, whatever the difficulties, whatever the hazards, which sometimes come from abroad, that Europe is making progress. The United Nations knows this. When I was Permanent Representative and one or another question was being examined, so many people used to ask me, \\\"What are the nine going to do? \\\". This vitality of the Community stems from its very nature as the framework for reconciliation and co-operation among nations\twere once enemies but which have today deeded to work together. For this purpose, there have been set up structures and institutions which, instead of being fixed once and for all, are slowly but surely evolving. \\\"Progress\\\", wrote an author in ancient times, \\\"is when something grows while remaining itself'. This could be the motto of the European Communities. Thanks to the traditions of the States that comprise it, this group of nations has also chosen to be a center of exchange and dialog. Sometimes denounced for being a closed bloc, it has proved its ability to be open towards the rest of Western Europe as well as towards countries to the east of our old continent and, since the Lom\u00e9 Convention,  towards 46 countries lying across the seas.\n139.\tThe existence and soundness of the Community cannot be demonstrated better than by the passage in the address delivered yesterday by its current President, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, on behalf of the member countries. The French delegation fully agrees with everything he said in that capacity about economic and political problems.\n140.\tNothing illustrates this better, also, than the role played by the Community here at the United Nations and in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe-the culmination of several years of patient effort to end the divisions caused by the Second World War and a point of departure for a pattern of development which, with time and experience, would reveal a clearer picture of a Europe at last consistent with its geographical designation.\n141.\tWhat happens on the European continent does not, however, exempt us from observing that the world is still far from the state of neighborly relations prescribed by the Charter. There has not been a global conflict in 30 years; probably not so much because peace feigns in the full sense of the word as because destructive capabilities neutralize each other.\n142.\tThat is why France believes that, foremost among our concerns, should be the quest for an agreed disarmament between States. That undertaking, which got its start shortly after the Second World War, is marking time. Fifteen years ago the study of general plans for disarmament was in fact abandoned in favor of the study of partial measures. But the agreements reached in that direction-some of which have some merit-should not conceal the unremitting arms race, which leaves an awesome threat weighing on the world.\n143.\tNevertheless, some initiatives are taking shape to revise the very structures of the disarmament effort. My Government is following them with interest. It is prepared to support any proposal aimed at genuine disarmament, that is, at the effective destruction of weapons of all types, nuclear and conventional, in accordance with a reasonable time-table and under effective international control.\n144.\tSince the very birth of the United Nations, it has ' been fashionable to criticize and even lampoon our Organization for its shortcomings and relative ineffectiveness.\n145.\tI would like to say here that France does not share that skepticism. It considers the United Nations an in-dispensable and irreplaceable instrument for dialog and co-operation among the peoples of the earth. It realizes that, in the maintenance of peace and in many aspects of economic development, the Organization has rendered services which are so easily forgotten because they were so effective. Lastly, it is aware of the fact that the shortcomings of the United Nations are a product of the political divisions in the world. As a minor, it shows nations their own reflection; as a forum, it allows aspirations to be expressed in a political and diplomatic framework; and as an instrument, it is the natural tool of those who want to use it and who know how.\n146.\tThe Organization today extends, with but a few exceptions, to the dimensions of the globe. Five years ago it took an important step in this direction-although it was merely a reasonable step-by restoring China to its rightful place here. In this way, the representatives of that immense nation were able to bring to us here the echo of the great voice that fell silent early this month.\n147.\tThe Organization must truly become a world body, that is, it must welcome the States which apply for membership once they have met the recognized criteria of international law and once they have declared their willingness to respect the Charter.\n148.\tAccordingly, while France is pleased to welcome the admission of the Republic of Seychelles, with which it has historical affinities, it hopes that the doors of the Organization will be opened to VietNam -with which it particularly intends to develop its relations-to Angola and, generally speaking, to all those that request membership. By the same token, it speaks out against any attempt to prevent or suspend a State's membership. Whatever complaints are brought against the States thus threatened, such extreme measures would in no way facilitate the search for settlements-quite the contrary.\n149.\tTo find what unites us and overcome what divides us, harness our mutual determination to build and repress the instinct that urges us to destroy, work together for the liberty, happiness and dignity of mankind-that, to my mind, is a program that is just as relevant and imperative in 1976 as it was in 1945. That is also the reason for my country's acceptance of the ideals of the Charter and the action of the United Nations.\n150.\tThis acceptance is no mere formality. It is based on the conviction that, beneath frequently militant positions, there is a large community of needs which is expressed here. Over and above the verbal battles and attempts to gain the advantage, there is a growing recognition of the real ills that set mankind: economic crises, deterioration of the environment, mass poverty, over-population and war. Rooting out those scourges is a long-range task; but the future of coming generations and the survival of humanity are at stake. Such a task demands that concertation win over confrontation, that everyone agree to lend himself to dialog; it demands the patient and resolute efforts of countries which are capable of looking beyond groups and blocs. France intends to be among them.\n"

        "file_text": "We meet under your genial auspices, Sir, under a President of unique distinction and experience to whom it is my pleasant duty to offer my delegation's sincere congratulations on election to that high office. Your impressive record as President of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is a splendid testimony to your own remarkable abilities as a presiding officer, and the warmth of your personality will ensure that our deliberations will never lose that human touch so essential for peace and understanding between peoples.\n143.\tTo my friend and colleague, Premier Gaston Thorn of Luxembourg, President of the thirtieth session, I should also like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation on the completion of his distinguished term of office.\n144.\tTo Mr. James R. Mancham, President of the Republic of Seychelles, I offer our sincerest congratulations on his nation's becoming the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of the United Nations.\n145.\tIn welcoming the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of our Organization, might I express the hope that the applications of all other peace-loving States willing to accept the obligations of the United Nations Charter will be accepted in the near future, so that our body may truly reflect the principle of universality to which my country attaches so much importance.\n146.\tThe Charter of the United Nations commits us to seek a world order of peace and justice between nation States. Peace, justice and order have always been the broad aims of political action within individual States. It is now vital that they be established on the world level: peace, because war can destroy us; justice for its own sake and because peace without justice is unstable; and, order, because neither peace nor justice will prevail in a world of disorder and conflict.\n147.\tBut, as political leaders have always found at the level of the nation, to achieve one of these aims is not necessarily to achieve all, and the question often posed is, Which should come first? Some would say peace at any price- to the extent of allowing a just society to be overturned by greed, ambition or fanaticism; some would give first priority to order-even the unstable order which comes from an unjust settlement or unjust political structures; and some are so intent on justice for all, that they will tolerate neither peace nor order-the conditions for real progress-until the day justice can be achieved.\n148.\tThe reality for us is that no one of these three aims can be achieved in isolation at the world level any more than at national level. Specific problems on our agenda may relate in a particular way to one or other aim. But in our approach to all of the concrete issues we face, we need to have constantly in mind that our solutions will not work in the long run, unless they are part of a broader concerted effort to work patiently towards a world where all three- peace, justice and order together- increasingly prevail.\n149.\tThis sets us a broad program for action in various areas of the work of this Organization. We must seek to advance this program as a whole as best we can and without applying double standards to different situations.\n150.\tFirst, as a minimum requirement to secure peace, we must do everything in our power to avoid global war and to contain regional wars and bring them to an end.\n151.\tSecondly, to secure greater justice throughout the world we must use this forum so that States of different outlooks and ideologies can gradually establish common agreed norms of behavior. Those norms should establish just relations between States and their peoples in both political and economic spheres; and beyond this they must also seek to ensure respect on a world-wide basis for individual human rights.\n152.\tThirdly, we must use the capacities of this universal Organization, and of all the bodies within this United Nations family, to bring order not only to the traditional areas of human activity with which the United Nations has been concerned but also to areas which have newly come within the control of mankind, such as the seas and oceans of this planet, and the space around it.\n153.\tAt this General Assembly session we face a long agenda of specific problems, each of which bears on one or more of these areas of action. At this, our thirty-first such annual session, we can have few illusions as to the capacity of the United Nations to solve all of these problems in three months of debate. But -with a realistic idea of its limitations-it is important that we use all of the possibilities which the United Nations offers to advance as steadily and consistently as we can towards a world which will have a stable peace based on justice and where the political order and political structures of the world community help increasingly to secure both.\n154.\tA very important series of issues bearing directly on our need to maintain peace is that complex of problems which faces us at each Assembly session in the field of disarmament and arms control. We are increasingly preoccupied with the problems of hunger, of illiteracy, of disease, of economic development and of an equitable sharing of mankind's limited resources. And yet, while we debate these problems, global military expenditure is reaching, as we have been told already today, $300 billion a year, and technology is steadily working to produce even more efficient, and more costly, means of mass destruction. Nuclear war is of course the greatest danger. To avert it the world has depended for over a generation, for better or worse, on a system of mutual deterrence. It is realistic to recognize that the United Nations cannot hope in the near future to end this kind of confrontation or substitute for it a fully accepted and world-wide peace-keeping procedure. But there is nevertheless a pressing need for our Organization in the interests of peace to seek to avert the dangers inherent in the uncontrolled spread of nuclear technology.\n155.\tThat danger has, of course, been with us for years, but it has been accentuated recently by the increasingly irresponsible readiness of suppliers of nuclear technology to equip countries not only with the means of generating nuclear energy but with reprocessing plants which produce plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons.\n156.\tThe hard fact of the matter is that in the field of enrichment and reprocessing, where the basic danger lies, it has begun to seem that the present system of international safeguards, even if applied, may not be adequate to provide protection against the possibility that countries importing advanced nuclear technology will use it for the production of nuclear explosives. If improved safeguards cannot be devised, and devised quickly, then other steps will be required. The Governments of the principal suppliers may have to consider limiting their exports to other types of nuclear materials and refusing to sell either enrichment or reprocessing plants.\n157.\tWe hope also that this session of the General Assembly in its debates on disarmament will be able to encourage early progress in the limitation in other ways of weapons of mass destruction. We need a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear weapon tests. We also need to see work continue in an area where progress has already been made the working out of a convention on chemical and biological weapons, and we hope that a treaty in this area can soon be concluded.\n158.\tWe cannot, however, lose sight of another danger, to which the preceding speaker, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore, just made eloquent reference, in a speech of compelling logic and frankness, namely, the extraordinary growth in recent years of conventional weapons in all areas of the world often encouraged by commercial competition among supplying countries. I need not say more on this aspect, which Mr. Rajaratnam covered so fully and bluntly. The last decade has seen a remarkable build-up of conventional arms throughout the world.\n159.\tIt is against this background of dangerous developments in regard to armaments of all kinds, nuclear and non-nuclear, that proposals have been made for a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. A special session could perhaps perform a useful function in directing the attention of public opinion in Member States to the dangers of armaments and the urgent need for arms control. But disarmament has always been an area where it is tempting to substitute rhetoric for genuine and carefully worked out actions. If, therefore, such a special session is to be held, it will require careful preparation and the prior adoption of a detailed agreed agenda. It will also be essential if it is to be successful, that all of the nuclear Powers take part and that each of them make a constructive contribution towards its success.\n160.\tThe growth and spread of armaments has unfortunately contributed to the duration and intensity of regional conflicts in many areas. The problems of peace, order and justice are directly linked in a number of those areas where the present order is unstable and peace is constantly endangered because a just settlement has not been found to what may admittedly be a complex international problem. The Middle East is clearly a case in point.\n161.\tThe Netherlands Foreign Minister, Mr. van der Stoel, as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, has recalled for this Assembly [7th meeting] the position of the nine member States on the Middle East problem and the principles which we consider should govern a just settlement that would bring peace and stability to the region. I should like to emphasize that these principles are not partisan or arbitrary ones. They are based on a deep conviction that the Middle East conflict of its very nature cannot be resolved by recourse to war, and on a belief in the urgent need for negotiations.\n162.\tThese principles include the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and, consequently, the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation it has maintained since the conflict of 1967; they include also respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of every State in the area-including Lebanon, I must at this point emphasize-and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. And it includes recognition that in the establishment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. It should be made clear that the Palestinians, too, have the right to be established within secure boundaries and the right to give effective expression in appropriate political form to their sense of their national identity. For my own part I believe that this means that they should have the right to decide for themselves whether to establish an independent entity on the territory vacated by Israel.\n163.\tIt is on the basis of these general principles that the Middle East crisis will be resolved. We all know this -all of us, including those directly involved in that dispute. There should be no further delay in reaching a solution on this basis. Delay cannot and will not alter the eventual outcome. It can only risk a further major conflict between those neighboring States, which have already fought so many bloody wars and which must eventually learn to live with each other and with the Palestinian people. It should be our aim to arrive at the framework of such a settlement not in the next decade but within the next year, exerting all our efforts to bring the parties together with this end in view.\n164.\tI should like at this point to echo the hopes expressed by other speakers for a speedy end to the appalling bloodshed and destruction in Lebanon and to associate myself with the good wishes extended to President Sarkis in the urgent and difficult task that he has of restoring harmony and rebuilding his country.\n165.\tIn Cyprus, too, a just settlement as a basis for a stable peace, is urgently required. The European Community is closely associated with the three countries directly involved with this problem and it has on several occasions manifested its support for the maintenance of the Republic's freedom and unity in conditions of peace. But to achieve these aims it is obviously necessary that substantive negotiations should begin between the representatives of the two communities involved, under the aegis of the United Nations. I believe that I am echoing the feelings of the vast majority of my fellow representatives in calling for an end to the frustrating delays which have dogged the negotiations on Cyprus so far and in expressing our full rapport for the efforts of our Secretary-General and of his representative in Nicosia, Ambassador Perez ds Cuellar, to bring the parties together in a forum of genuine negotiation.\n166.\tThe problems of southern Africa -Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa itself- raise perhaps in the clearest way all three of the issues of peace, justice and order, to which I referred. In that area, peace is now very seriously threatened because a minority in each case has for a long time imposed its own version of order with an absolute lack of concern for justice.\n167.\tA situation such as that in southern Africa can create a dilemma for those-both within the area and outside it-who set a high value on peace and non-violence and hope and work for orderly change. The patience and the attachment to peaceful methods shown over the years by movements within the region which represent the legitimate demands of the black majority for elementary justice and basic rights have been notable. But these efforts have hitherto been met with an absolute intransigence which has provoked a war of liberation in Rhodesia and violence in South Africa that has escalated at the cost of the lives of hundreds of innocent Africans whose killing we deplore and condemn.\n168.\tAt the present time, however, against all the odds there is hope. The mission undertaken in southern Africa by the American Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, has raised the possibility of an agreement which could bring peaceful change and the establishment of a more just order in the region. We appreciate this effort and we have particular sympathy and understanding for the patience of the neighboring African Governments and the respective African liberation movements which have been willing to accept that peaceful methods should have every possible opportunity of bringing change to the region.\n169.\tIt is our hope that the change of attitude demonstrated by the head of the illegal Rhodesian regime last week will provide a basis for agreement on a rapid, peaceful transition to the establishment of an independent State of Zimbabwe. I read with interest the statements of the Presidents of the five neighboring African States noting the announcement by Mr. Smith and his acceptance of the need to establish immediately a transitional government. I hope that the problems that remain in implementing this can be peacefully resolved.\n170.\tWith our partners in the European Community we hope, too, that the independence of Namibia can be rapidly and peaceably secured and that the obstacles that remain in the way of this can be removed with goodwill. There, as in Rhodesia, the outcome is no longer uncertain, nor can it be delayed; only the immediate path to freedom, and the amount of blood to be shed or spared, is at this stage in doubt. In that country-Namibia-more than almost any-where else the role of the United Nations is crucial and should be given primary importance.\n171.\tFinally, I must refer to South Africa itself. There are those who profess to see in current events some kind of a plan to consolidate rule by the minority there and its evil practices of apartheid. I do not believe that this can happen. The example of the rapid transition now taking place in Rhodesia and in Namibia, following similar developments in Mozambique and Angola, has started a process within South Africa itself which cannot now be halted. The only question is whether those in charge there have the wisdom, the courage and the political skill to face that reality, or whether they are going to make the very mistake against which they have been warning Mr. Ian Smith. The ultimate issue is not in doubt there any more than in the Territories to the immediate north. And the firmness of the international community in such matters as the non-recognition of Transkei can leave no doubt in the minds of the rulers of South Africa as to how they must move or that they must move quickly, if they are to prevent a holocaust and to preserve an appropriate role for the white minority in the South Africa of the future.\n172.\tThe second major area of action for our Organization is that of establishing norms of behavior to secure not only peace between the world's peoples but also justice, which alone can be a sound basis for order. This involves two major lines of action for our Organization: first, the working out of a fair and just economic relationship between nations and particularly between industrialized and developing countries; and, secondly, the promotion and advancement by every means open to us within the limits of our Organization of respect within each Member State for basic individual human rights.\n173.\tAs regards the reordering of the inequitable socio-economic relationships between rich and poor countries, some limited progress has been made over the past three year. In this period of time we have moved from the near confrontation of the sixth special session to the cooperation involved in launching the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in Paris and in securing a limited- and I stress limited-positive result from the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi.\n174.\tAs a small nation which has experienced the economic and social problems arising from the absence of a well-developed industrial base, we in Ireland are in a position to appreciate to some degree the difficulties which the countries of the third world are seeking to overcome; and as a State member of the European Community we are associated with that Community's considerable efforts, of which the Lom\u00e9 Convention  is an important example, to improve economic relationships between developed and developing countries.\n175.\tBut this whole issue is one which demands action by the world community as a whole on a very large scale, and the task before us is immense. Pressing as our other problems may now appear to be, it is possible that from now into the next century this may be one of the greatest issues we have to face on this planet.\n176.\tIt is easy enough to talk rhetorically of the need for justice in international economic relations but difficult in the extreme to accept the practical consequences of what we advocate. We have to learn to accept that the order which has so long prevailed in economic relations between the developing and the industrialized countries is grossly unjust and, therefore, in the long run also unstable and that direct action on a world scale must now be taken to redress it. This is a difficult message for any country to accept, however developed it may seem by comparison with other States elsewhere in the world. But action is necessary, and I sincerely hope that Hie General Assembly will at this session do everything open to it to encourage progress in these areas.\n177.\tBut despite the fact that this is an Organization of nation-States concerned primarily with inter-State relations we simply cannot be content to limit the effort to establish a just and stable world order to that level. This Organization has long since rejected the idea that it is concerned only with disputes between States. No Member of this Organization today-other than the country immediately involved-accepts the proposition that apartheid in South Africa is the concern of none but the Government of that country, or that it is unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of South Africa for the whole world community to condemn apartheid as an* odious offense against the rights of individuals to equal treatment before the law, regardless c? race, religion, sex, or other distinction.\n178.\tRacial discrimination is indeed an odious form of discrimination-the most odious-but this must not blind us to the fact that it is but one of many forms of discrimination, all of which must be condemned by men and women of honesty and goodwill if we are to avoid double standards and be consistent in the effort to advance towards a world order based on justice.\n179. In this effort to promote such a world order, where there will be respect for human rights, including above all the right of freedom from torture, there are a number of steps to be taken: first, the elaboration of principles which should guide the conduct of States and individuals; secondly, the development of a framework within which the application of these principles in a practical manner may be discussed, and procedures for the investigation of allegations of breaches of these principles worked out, particularly when it appears that these form a consistent pattern; and, thirdly, the question of remedies, when, on investigation, it appears that breaches have taken place.\n130. I believe that we have made very considerable progress in relation to the first aspect, the elaboration of principles. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the United Nations Covenants in particular, there has been worked out as never before in human history a universal code accepted in principle by all States as a guide to their behavior. While we may be tempted from time to time to despair at the seemingly endless reports of serious breaches of fundamental rights, we must never lose sight of the fact that these documents give expression to a broad consensus within the world community as to what constitutes human rights, and that it is this that makes it possible for us to point out those breaches when they occur.\n181.\tAs to the second aspect, the Economic and Social Council, through the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary sub-commissions, provides a framework for discussion, and this will now be complemented by a Human Rights Committee set up under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In my view there should be full and free discussion within this framework.\n182.\tUnited Nations procedures for the investigation of alleged breaches of human rights are, however, inadequate largely because they depend in each individual case on the consent of the party complained against. I believe that these procedures need to be improved and complemented by a greater willingness by States to cooperate with investigations even if they think the complaint made against them is unjustified. I would therefore strongly support the proposal made earlier this afternoon by my Belgian colleague, Mr. Van Elslande, that States be invited each to make a general voluntary declaration of willingness in the future to permit an on-the-spot investigation by a United Nations committee of inquiry in the case of an allegation of a breach of human tights on its territory. My Government has authorized me to state its willingness to subscribe to such a declaration.\n183.\tThe third question, that of remedies, poses the greatest problem. As this Assembly will be aware, the States members of the Council of Europe have agreed on certain procedures not only for the investigation but also for the adjudication of alleged breaches of human rights. There is, for example, a procedure under which a State may initiate action against another State which it believes to have breached human rights-a procedure which my own State has recently successfully employed. Moreover, under an\\\" optional procedure some of us have admitted the right of our own citizens to take proceedings in this international forum against our own State, when national remedies have been exhausted. The universal application of these procedures, now available within the European context, is the objective towards which we should strive.\n184.\tPointing to the example of the European Com-mission and Court of Human Rights, I have proposed in this Assembly each year since 1973 that an effective world-wide human rights jurisdiction should be created, so that no country should be free from inquiry, from inspection or from condemnatory action by the international community in respect of such breaches of the rights of man. Accordingly, I commend for further study the suggestions made to this Assembly by my friend and colleague Foreign Minister Genscher of the Federal Republic of Germany, who in his speech here [7th meeting] proposed the creation of an international court for human rights.\n185.\tThe rights of the individual to freedom and justice are threatened, however, from many quarters other than governments of sovereign States. The right to freedom and to life is now under challenge in the most barbarous manner by many individual groups which in the name of some political or ideological cause claim the right to kidnap and take hostage, and in certain circumstances to kill, people innocent of any connexion with their cause or their country. They claim to act in the name of justice, but the injustice to the innocent victims of their actions belies their claim. Many of our countries have suffered from this scourge in one way or another, and any of us may b.e exposed to it at any time.\n186.\tIt is time the world community joined together to combat and end it. We must reject the spurious claim of such groups to promote justice by their barbarous actions; we must together work out effective means to bring these atrocities to an end, and we must complement the action we take by continuing our own sustained efforts both as individual States and through this world Organization to promote a more just and peaceful world order. As an immediate step all of us-every State Member of this Organization without exception -should join in a convention to combat the taking of hostages, as has been proposed by my colleague from the Federal Republic of Germany, so that the perpetrators are either extradited or brought, before a court in the country in which they were seized. This procedure is one which my own country has recently adopted on a reciprocal basis with the United Kingdom to deal with acts of terrorism committed in either of our two States.\n187.\tThe third complex of issues which, I have suggested, constitutes a major area of action for the world community at present is that of bringing agreement and order, on a basis of justice, to the control of the oceans and the sea-bed. This vast area of the planet's surface, greater by far than the land surface to which humanity was so long limited, is now at last coming definitively within the control of mankind. It is our task in this generation to see to it that political order rather than anarchy will henceforth prevail in its allocation and use.\n188.\tThe responsibility is a heavy one, to be approached with a sense of the limits of our planet's resources and of the limits to their capacity to renew themselves. This is primarily the task of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, working as part of the general structure of the United Nations system under your wise chairmanship, Mr. President. The problems that Conference faces are formidable, and although a good deal of progress has been made the relatively limited results of the last session of the Conference were not encouraging.\n189.\tAs a result a number of States have taken unilateral action by declaring a 200-mile limit for fishing. This is having the effect of diverting the fishing effort of other States from the waters thus brought within national jurisdictions to waters in the vicinity of my country and its partners in the European Community. These waters close to our coast are already disastrously over-fished because of the total inadequacy of international conservation methods, and the short-sighted and indiscriminate depredations of the fishing fleets of certain countries. We cannot face the extinction of our fishing industry, on which our country is heavily dependent and which accounts for a significant part of the potential resources of our State. Accordingly, my Government, in consultation with its partners in the European Community, has reluctantly concluded that it will be necessary to extend its fishing limits in the near future owing to the delay in reaching world-wide agreement. In doing so we are convinced that a large majority of governments consider that States should be entitled to such limits, and we expect that the convention which we all hope the Conference will adopt will include a provision to that effect. In the meantime we are confident, Mr. President, that you and your collaborators at the Conference will find appropriate procedures for preparing the work of the next session. We look forward to the eventual success of the Conference in adopting a widely accepted comprehensive convention.\n190.\tIn the island of Ireland, too, the issues of peace, order and justice, to which I have referred throughout my remarks, are inextricably interconnected. In Northern Ireland the political order which prevailed for almost half a century proved unstable because it did not secure justice in a divided community. In such a community, each section of which has been taught by history to fear the other, the restoration of order and the maintenance of order require not merely the consent but the dedicated support of both sections. This cannot humanly be secured if one section is excluded indefinitely not merely from any share in the government of the area but from any prospect of ever enjoying such a share. Only a just system of government, in which both sections, for so long as they may distrust each other, are sure of participation, can provide a firm basis for the re-establishment of order and the restoration of peace.\n191.\tIn Northern Ireland at the present moment the prime need is peace so that a just order may be established. That the will to peace is there among the ordinary people of our island has been dramatically shown in recent weeks, when, led by a courageous band of women, tens of thousands from both sections of a divided community have together marched peacefully and prayerfully throughout Northern Ireland demanding the end of violence from any and every quarter. The barriers that have divided the ordinary people of Northern Ireland from each other have been weakened by this spontaneous popular movement.\n192.\tAs I have made clear from this rostrum on previous occasions, my Government and the people of my State have only one wish in this matter: that the people of Northern Ireland be brought to live together in peace, joining with each other in the common interest of their part of the island of Ireland. We hope that one day they may choose freely to join with us in a political arrangement for the good of the whole island, but we are content to leave that to them to decide freely by majority vote when and if they choose to do so.\n193.\tIn the meantime we shall spare no effort in any manner open to us to prevent their lives and their livelihoods from being destroyed by a violence that has become an end in itself for those who practice it. Limited only by our concern for the protection of human rights, which should inhibit every Government from acting arbitrarily or unjustly, we have recently strengthened our laws, lengthened die sentences imposed for violent crimes and initiated a move to extend, with all appropriate safeguards, from two to seven days the period during which a suspect under investigation may be detained without charge.\n194.\tIn all these actions we are conscious of the duty to ensure that justice prevails while order is maintained and peace is secured. In this we are fortified by a constitution strongly protective of human rights, by vigilant public opinion, by a vocal opposition in Parliament, and by a free press.\n195.\tThe balance between maintaining order and ensuring justice is difficult to ensure under conditions of violence or threats of violence. But only if this balance is maintained evenly and equitably can peace be secured in such conditions, and that we are determined to do in Ireland today.\n196.\tThroughout this statement to the General Assembly I have stressed the need to advance consistently and patiently towards the three aims of peace, justice and order. These are not abstractions. They bear in the most direct way possible on all our people. They are aims which preoccupy us in this Organization as we begin this thirty-first session, and they are aims which occupy us greatly in Ireland at the present time.\n197.\tAs we face the work of the session I should like to commend to the General Assembly the declaration which the peace movement of the ordinary people of Northern Ireland, to which I have just referred, has adopted as its motto. If the General Assembly will bear with me I will read out these words since I feel that, while they were devised to meet the needs of that particular small part of the world, they are of such direct relevance to our work here too on behalf of the world community. They are:\n\\\"We have a simple message for the world from this movement for peace. We want to live and love and build a just and peaceful society.\n\\\"We want for our children, as we want for ourselves, our lives at home, at work and at play, to be lives of joy and peace.\n\\\"We recognize that to build such a life demands of all of us dedication, hard work and courage.\n!'We recognize that there are many problems in our society which are a source of conflict and violence.\n\\\"We recognize that every bullet fired and every explosive bomb makes that work more difficult.\n\\\"We reject the use of the bomb and the bullet and all the techniques of violence.\n\\\"We dedicate ourselves to working with our neighbors, near and far, day in and day out, to building that peaceful society in which the tragedies we have known are a bad memory and a continuing warning.\\\"\nThat is the message which I leave with the General Assembly today on behalf of the people of Ireland.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first of all congratulate you on your unanimous election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your long service at the United Nations will receive even greater support in its efforts to solve the many political and economic problems that seem to escape immediate attention. I wish to assure you of the fullest co-operatiOn of the delegation of Mauritius in the discharge of your responsibilities.\n75.\tI should also like to convey to your predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, our deepest appreciation for his valuable contribution to the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n76.\tMay I also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, whose dedication to the service of this Organization, to its objectives and its goals, continues to evoke our respect and admiration.\n77.\tAt this crucial hour in the history of the world in general and of Africa in particular, may I begin with an appeal to all men of goodwill who believe that peace can only be achieved by common understanding and mutual comprehension and by a sense of justice. Wherever injustice exists, wherever democracy is being trampled upon, wherever disease, ignorance, and poverty prevail, wherever there is usurpation of the people's legitimate rights, wherever there is unlawful occupation of one's lands by force, let us awake to our responsibilities and strain our energies towards finding solutions based on equality and natural justice in accordance with the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.\n78.\tAfter 31 years of continuous and serious difficulties, the United Nations justifies, by its achievements, its indispensability. The mere fact that all the independent nations of the world adhere to its principles clearly indicates the trust that we all have in this august body. Why, then, should any permanent member of the Security Council cast a negative note and use it to block the admission of independent and free nations like Angola and Viet Nam to our Organization? May I appeal in particular to the United States of America to show its wisdom and realism and renounce the use of this negative vote? Indeed, the abuse of the right to cast a negative note on the part of permanent members of the Security Council is one of the frustrating features of an otherwise ideal Charter. Neither Africa, with its 48 States, nor Latin America enjoys such a privilege; nor are they sure they want it. There is no reason why five States should in 1976 still enjoy the special privileges of another age and thus place the rest of the world at an unacceptable disadvantage. So we honestly believe that the appropriate Articles of the Charter should be reappraised realistically, bearing in mind that the United Nations today comprises almost 150 Member States, whereas at the time of the Charter's adoption it comprised only 50.\n79.\tSince our last session, there have been striking developments all over the world. Firstly, we had a summit conference of OAU in June this year in Mauritius, where it was decided to intensify the struggle against the remaining colonial regimes in Africa and against racialism. We also subsequently had the Conference of the non-aligned countries in Colombo, where a larger number of peace-loving countries fully supported the OAU's demand for the early termination of colonialism in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa in fulfillment of the heritage of every nation and of its right to independence and national sovereignty. Apart from reaffirming that there can be no compromise with colonialism and racialism, I do not wish to dwell greatly on these issues just now, when momentous consultations and negotiations are taking place with a view to finding peaceful and early solutions to the problems in these countries. While we fully support the national liberation movements in their valiant efforts to achieve freedom from oppression and foreign rule and will continue to do so till their objectives are achieved-at the same time, we would welcome any moves for peaceful solutions, provided that they carry with them the assurance of the earliest achievement of liberation for the struggling peoples of Africa and, therefore, the immediate cessation of their hardships. In my capacity as Chairman of OAU, I fully endorse the initiatives taken by the five African Presidents mandated by OAU and will be happy to give any further support and assistance that my country may be called upon to render in this connexion. As much as we welcome the mission of Mr. Kissinger to southern Africa, we must point out that there should be no confusion in anybody mind regarding our collective stand on Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.\n80.\tAs regards Namibia, much remains to be done, and done quickly. First, a date for its independence-I mean real independence, not a mockery of it-must be accepted. I suggest that date should not be further delayed.\n81.\tSecond, the United Nations should convene within four weeks a constitutional conference comprising only three parties; namely, the United Nations itself, South Africa and SWAPO, the true and authentic representative of the Namibian people.\n82.\tThird, all political detainees and prisoners should be released at least three weeks before the date of the constitutional conference.\n83.\tFourth, all South African forces should be withdrawn as soon as the conference starts and they should be replaced by a United Nations peace-keeping force until such time as the Namibian army and police take over.\n84.\tIt is not too late for the Vorster regime to face the stark realities of life. As the outgoing President of this Assembly rightly pointed out, Mr. Vorster, and Mr. Vorster alone, would carry the sole responsibility_.before history if bloodshed and human carnage occurred in this part of the world, as all events tend to show. We of OAU are determined, and have resolved unanimously, that, should all efforts to find a peaceful solution to these problems fail, we would ensure that recourse to armed struggle is not only pursued but intensified with the help of our friends and the progressive nations of the world.\n85.\tLet me also here make it clear that OAU cannot and will not accept the devious concept of separate homelands and will not give recognition to the bogus independence of the Transkei an.d \\\"bantustans\\\", which will only perpetuate the inhuman policy of apartheid.\n86.\tI sincerely hope that countries like France will ensure that the decolonization process in Africa will not suffer any impediment and that the just and legitimate aspirations of the people of the Comoros, of the French territory of the Afars and the Issas and of others will soon be fulfilled.\n87.\tSince this Assembly met last, there has been a stalemate in regard to the problems of the Middle East and in regard to the finding of a solution fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It is heart-rending to find that the global pulls of politics have halted developments towards peace in that area, and I therefore greatly welcome the recent signs of a reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to make further progress on the problems of that area. It is indeed a sad commentary on the state of affairs in this world that, while new nations are becoming independent, almost the entire population of a country should be compelled to stay in camps outside their homelands.\n88.\tThere can be only one solution, involving the strict adherence of Israel to the Charter of the United Nations, withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the restoration to the Arab people of Palestine of their legitimate right to the creation of a separate Palestinian State, as provided for and endorsed by the United Nations in the partition agreement of 1947 [resolution 181 (II)].\n89.\tLebanon, which was until recently a peaceful and beautiful country, is today in a state of ruin, politically and economically. In spite of all the efforts deployed so far, peace does not seem to be in sight. I believe the United Nations, through the Secretary-General, could make a positive contribution to the solution of a conflict which we can only hope is temporary, but success can only be achieved as long as the sad current situation in Lebanon is not exploited for narrow national purposes.\n90.\tI also trust that the problem of Cyprus will lead not to a partition of the country but to a reunification of its people for the creation of a prosperous and economically viable State, in which the rights of each and every citizen are safeguarded.\n91.\tThere is one more problem, the problem of disarmament, regarding which there has been, unfortunately, little progress. As I said at the last session,  I would emphasize that to make detente an irreversible process it should extend to all geographical areas and at the same time that it should include disarmament measures. I then suggested that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should be called upon to submit concrete proposals and recommendations in regard to a more positive role for the United Nations in the field of disarmament, and I once again stress the necessity, as a matter of priority, for the revitalization of the United Nations in this field. Immediate steps in this field seem to be imperative if not for expanding detente and the creation of larger areas of peace, leading towards the elimination of all sources of war and conflict, at least because of the compulsions of the alarming world-wide sales and gifts of arms, combined with competition in the acquisition and refinement of categories of weapons. In my opinion, a United Nations subsidiary organization deeply committed to the early establishment of disarmament could also function as a monitor or watchdog to speed up the half-hearted efforts of the big Power blocs towards mutual reduction of arms.\n92.\tOne of the most pressing problems of the moment is, no doubt, the need for early solutions to the economic\n' problems faced by the world as a whole and by the\ndeveloping countries especially. Economic forces are not the monopoly of either the developed nations or the developing nations, but the forces generated in the economically advanced and industrial nations have a con- comitant and, in general, an adverse-effect on the developing nations. The repeated attempts of developing nations have been frustrated, although goodwill has been shown jointly or individually by several advanced countries. The recent Conference of the non-aligned countries in Colombo came up with a number of suggestions based on the Nairobi meeting of UNCTAD, and I do hope that realism will play its due role in finding early solutions so that the world as a whole can develop in harmony and fruitful co-operation.\n93.\tIn the same context, I may note that, in December next, OAU is holding a conference at ministerial level in Kinshasa to study ways and means of consolidating our economies and how we, in Africa, through our interdependence, can create prosperity for the continent as a whole. Commerce and trade, industry and technology will be among our main preoccupations, and I hope that the ministers who are striving so hard will reach the right conclusions and lay the foundation for the creation of a united and prosperous Africa.\n94.\tIt is also unfortunate and sad that, after 10 years of deliberation, no equitable and fair solution has yet been found as regards the share of every nation in the exploitation of the wealth of the sea. We can only hope that better counsel will prevail at the next session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, where a just, fair and equitable solution can at last be found.\n95.\tWe have already before us the resolutions of the United Nations as well as of the recent non-aligned Conference concerning the early realization of the preservation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. This is a vital issue for my country, which has to depend for its trade and sustenance on the fact that the Indian Ocean is an ocean of peace and not a gradually militarized ocean which would lead to conflict. The other countries of the Indian Ocean as well as the littoral countries are equally concerned, and I hope, Mr. President, that with your active role as President of this Assembly and the great interest you have already taken in regard to this problem from its very beginning, your efforts in this field will be crowned with early, success. It is because of these mutual military rivalries between power blocs, extending far beyond their own legitimate spheres of military necessities, that I proposed at the last session a fundamental approach, namely, the conclusion of an international treaty barring the use of force? in international relations. I do hope that, however impractical! it may appear to those with almost superhuman military power, this humble proposal will receive the attention of the vast majority of this Assembly, who are obviously similarly placed as ourselves and would not like to become involved in any conflict to their own interests.\n96.\tI. cannot refer at this forum, as I should like to do, to all the excellent work which is being done, despite great difficulties, by the specialized agencies of the United Nations. We of the third world wish to record our appreciation of the devotion and selflessness of all the men and women who serve in them. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like on behalf of my delegation to convey to Ambassador Amerasinghe our most sincere congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly.\n88.\tMay I also be permitted to reiterate the warmest congratulations of my delegation to his outstanding predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn.\n89.\tThe thirty-first regular session of our General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is still deeply affected by the death of one of the most distinguished statesmen to leave their imprint on the twentieth century, Chairman Mao Tsetung. My delegation wishes yet again to pay a sincere tribute to the memory of the helmsman of the Chinese people who made it possible for his country to become a modern, free and respected nation. The peoples of the third world will always be grateful for his constant unreserved support of their fight for liberation. The principle he taught, that one must rely first and foremost on one's own resources, has become a slogan for the Chinese people and a source of inspiration for the nations of the third world.\n90.\tAt a time when the majority of States of our international community are confronted with serious problems of development, we believe it is important to highlight that principle, so true is it that it is through their own daily collective endeavors and common will to overcome disease, illiteracy and hunger that the developing countries can hope to achieve social well-being while safeguarding their dignity and independence, which can be real only if they have been won.\n91.\tDesirous of achieving that kind of independence, the Government of Niger, under the enlightened leadership of His Excellency, Lt. Col. Seyni Kountche, has bent every effort to mobilize all the vital forces of the nation to build a new Niger and at last ensure the happiness of each and every one of its citizens.\n92.\tThat mobilization has been carried out in particular by traditional youth associations called samarias, which, by channeling all their efforts, undertake joint mutual assistance and development activities at the town and village levels. Their dynamic and responsible action has made it possible, inter alia, to build in less than a year about 2,000 classrooms, something the First Republic had been unable to do in 15 years of independence. After six long years of drought and cruel trials and tribulations, we are more determined than ever to persevere in this, the only true course of freedom and source of development. Thus we have placed ail our hopes in the three-year development plan, which upon completion should enable us, in particular, to raise the rate of school attendance from 12 per cent to 35 per cent and to move towards agricultural self-sufficiency.\n93.\tA retrospective look at the months that have elapsed since the thirtieth session will show certain disappointing \nfacts and events that have left their imprint on international life. Once again we deplore the fact that the world we live in is still faced with serious problems endangering inter-national peace and security. Be it the unbridled arms race, the numerous cases of infringement of the sovereignty and integrity of States, the Middle East crisis, the explosive situation in southern Africa, or worrisome economic problems, our General Assembly must at the current session assume fully its responsibilities and find appropriate and just solutions to those problems.\n94.\tBut before dwelling on these burning questions, I wish, on behalf of my delegation, to applaud the admission to our Organization of the sister Republic of Seychelles. As great as our joy at welcoming that new State in our midst, so great is our disappointment at the non-admission of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as a result of the abuse of the right of veto. Niger, which supports the principle of the universality of the United Nations, emphatically denounces this attitude, for which there is no justification in any of the provisions of the Charter.\n95.\tWith regard, first of all, to the People's Republic of Angola, we believe that it is doubly unjust to keep that country outside our Organization: on the one hand, that country is a member of the Organization of African Unity fOAUJ, which has given it its full confidence; and, on the other, that same nation has been recognized by over two thirds of the United Nations membership.\n96.\tAs for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, my delegation feels itself in duty bound to emphasize that that State, which only recently regained its national unity and territorial integrity after more than 30 years of a cruel and bloody war that marked its brave people profoundly, deserves that our Organization should do it justice at last, not only by admitting it to membership but also by helping it to heal its wounds.\n97.\tThis abuse of the right of veto leads us to believe that there is an urgent need to amend the Charter in order that some of its machinery may be brought more into line with the reality of our time, which is characterized by a more marked desire to introduce a certain degree of democratization into international relations.\n98.\tOne of the most difficult tests to be withstood by our Organization in the forthcoming years is that of the unbridled arms race, which has reached alarming pro-portions in some countries. Thus it is that the report of the Secretary-General [Al31ll Add.l] stresses that over $300 billion is spent annually for that purpose, whereas three quarters of mankind live in poverty and despair. That arms race is one of the greatest scandals of our time, became the world is in the process of manufacturing the instruments of its own destruction. The list of those that have it in their power to blow us all to kingdom come grows longer and longer as time goes by. Even Africa, which was expected after decolonization to make development its primary objective, is also arming itself dangerously.\n99.\tThe various disasters that have struck the world, such as earthquakes, tidal waves and droughts, and that have caused so many victims, should bring us all to greater wisdom.\n100.\tMy country believes that our Organization should accord special importance to that question before it is too late. Its objective should be the realization of general and complete disarmament, the only solution that can prevent the total disintegration of our planet. A special general conference on development, were it to be convened, would be the ideal framework for the serious consideration of that objective. We therefore fully support such an initiative.\n101.\tAnother source of concern is to be found in the countless cases noted here and there of interference in the internal affairs of other States. We regard such interference as true acts of terrorism and a permanent source of conflict in international relations.\n102.\tFor our part, I can say that ours is a peace-loving people, an advocate of human brotherhood. But I must also add most emphatically that we shall always remain obdurate where our sovereignty and dignity are concerned, because no one can love or stand up for our fatherland better than ourselves.\n103.\tIn the Middle East, too, the situation has in no way improved. Israel still persists in its refusal to restore to the Arab States the territories it has unlawfully occupied since the June 1967 war, despite Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Niger, for its part, denounces and condemns most strongly the policy of aggression and expansion undertaken by Israel in the region. It is for this reason, and in conformity with the relevant aforementioned resolutions of the United Nations, that we vigorously reaffirm that any settlement of the Middle East crisis necessarily entails the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, and its recognition of the legitimate, inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland. Therefore, we shall continue to hold the Zionist State of Israel alone responsible today for that situation.\n104.\tAs for the serious and sad tragedy besetting Lebanon today, it is, in our view, the result of that permanent crisis which has reigned throughout the Middle East since the birth of the Hebrew State. We exhort all the parties involved in that country to show greater moderation and wisdom in order to put an end to that war which has already claimed too many innocent victims. Thus we firmly support the laudable efforts made by the League of Arab States in its search for a peaceful political solution to this painful problem.\n105.\tElsewhere in the world, there are other thorny problems which could, unfortunately, lead to fratricidal confrontations. I am referring, inter alia, to the situation prevailing in Cyprus and in Korea. Although our General Assembly decided this year no longer to deal with the Korean problem, it still remains a concrete reality which we cannot continue to evade indefinitely in so far as it represents a definite threat not only to stability in the Asian continent but also to peace throughout the world. In Niger, our view is still that it is for the two parties concerned to seek, through dialog and without outside interference, ways and means which will lead to a just and peaceful settlement of their dispute, a settlement that will be lasting only if it leads to the reunification of the two Koreas.\n106.\tWith regard to Cyprus, we deplore the events that have rent that island asunder, and it is for this reason that my country firmly supports the action of the Secretary- General of the United Nations aimed at restoring peace and security in that part of the world.\n107.\tHowever, it is the events in southern Africa which today constitute the most sordid and most repugnant drama of all. In fact, we cannot but deplore the fact that our Assembly has been powerless to put an end to the racist South African policy ever since this question was included on our agenda for the first time in 1951.\n108.\tTwenty-five years have elapsed without the international community making the slightest change in the arrogant and defiant attitude of the colonialist and racist authorities in Pretoria. Not only has the heinous policy of apartheid been entrenched as an almost inexpugnable state institution, but it is in the process of being transplanted to the neighboring Territories of Namibia and of Rhodesia. The question that arises for the conscience of mankind is whether our Assembly today is in a position to checkmate the insane determination and senseless conspiracy of a handful of unenlightened white settlers who wish to see their retrograde dreams become a reality.\n109.\tEverything seems to have been said again and again for the past 25 years concerning that situation. Our Organization today, appears to be tired of vainly condemning at each of its sessions one of its obstinate Members which appears to be more determined than ever not to implement its decisions. This continued defiance by South Africa of the United Nations cannot but undermine our Organization.\n110.\tNiger believes that the time has come for our Organization and, more particularly, for certain States to put an end to their complicity before the policy of fait accompli carried on by the Government of South Africa, and that the time has come to embark, at last, upon a complete and swift consideration of the question of southern Africa, because too much blood has already been shed on our continent. Perhaps it is time for us to ponder the old adage that hatred brings forth hatred and blood calls for blood.\n111.\tHundreds of young black Africans died in Soweto and other South African ghettos while confronting with bare hands the bullets of the racist criminals. Africa's reaction to this massacre, so revolting to the world conscience, was its spontaneous, unanimous condemnation of it. In addition, on the occasion of their summit conference in Mauritius, the Heads of State and Government of (OAU) decided that each year the date of 16 June shall be commemorated throughout the African continent as the Day of Martyrs.\n112.\tHow much longer will our Assembly tolerate the bloody exactions and daily crimes perpetrated by that accursed, shameful regime?\n113.\tWe believe that the time has come to take decisions.\n114.\tAs for the Namibian question, in respect of which our Organization has given proof of its impotence, I had occasion to stress before the Security Council  the imperative need to envisage today very seriously the application of measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter, the only measures capable of permitting our Organization to assume fully its responsibilities over that Territory. \n115.\tAs for Rhodesia and South Africa, we must recognize that only the direct application of majority rule should prevail. This is the reason why Niger will not oppose any initiative, from wherever it may come, provided that its ultimate aim is the strict application of that rule and that it take into account at all times the recommendations of OAU, one of whose fundamental objectives is precisely the liberation of the entire African continent.\n116.\tI appeal to the conscience and logic of some of the great Powers, those which, in one way or another, support the survival of a system that they themselves reject.\n117.\tI advisedly decided to dwell on these burning questions, some of which seriously endanger international peace and security. However, we are also well aware of the economic crisis rampant in the world today, the nefarious effects of which are deeply felt by the poorer countries, among them my own.\n118.\tAn analysis of the international economic situation leaves no room for optimism. In fact, the inflationary situation which has affected the world for the past three years remains an important factor in the decline of the world economy, above all in the non-oil-exporting developing countries. In our view, this factor-rather facile to recall whenever there is an economic crisis-is far from justifying by itself the ever more serious difficulties faced by our countries. This is; perhaps, an appropriate time to denounce not only the tendency to blame it all on a circumstantial-albeit serious-event, but also, and above all, the deliberate absence of political will on the part of the Industrialized countries increasingly concerned with not- too honorable preoccupations that generally run counter to the objectives of the Charter, such as the arms race which I have denounced earlier.\n119.\tWhat has become of the United Nations Strategy for the Second Development Decade-a whole ingenious mechanism of operation and assessment, which was drawn up with such ardor and detail? Like all human constructions, it soon became obsolete, and skepticism prevails each time that we consult the very meager results at the end of each year. There are many industrialized countries which have not yet accepted the transfer of 1 per cent of their gross national product to the developing countries. Thus, we must note that the lack of financial resources prevailed over the enormous hopes for development that were aroused throughout the developing world.\n120.\tThe same problem of the transfer of resources is to be found everywhere as the key to any development aid program. We saw this in Nairobi at a time when UNCTAD felt it necessary to create a buffer stocks fund. The mitigated, even hostile, acceptance by some countries \ndid not lead to optimism, and, as everywhere else, when it is a question of the transfer of resources, the same vicious circle appears, accompanied by heated statements, by votes and by compromise solutions where the essential part of the recommendations are left out of any decisions.\n121.\tThe countries of the third world without oil re-sources continue to live in the most precarious economic situation. The deficit in their balance of payments in 1976 reached SUS45.2 billion. This exorbitant figure represents a growing trend, and if nothing stops this upward trend between now and 1980, most of the countries concerned will cease to participate in world trade. Moreover, no one is unaware of the fact that the financial resources of those same countries are exhausted or, more particularly, that they are increasingly obliged to resort to borrowing in order to ensure some continuity in their investments. We must believe that, if this is the price of development, very few developing countries will be in the race by the year 1980.\n122.\tMy country will never cease to denounce most forcefully the world economic order as it exists. In this confrontation between the powerful and the weak we know what our fate will be. This scandal to which so many nations are still attached persists despite resolutions adopted here and there. The promise of a gesture towards more balanced co-operation as provided for in the objectives of the Second Development Decade has, regrettably, found only timid accomplishment. In our view, although there are plenty of good intentions everywhere there still remains to be carried out a deliberate, courageous political action which would induce the rich nations to fulfill their contracts and commitments with those on which, often, they have based their own development.\n123.\tA ray of hope shone for a moment at Lome: nine Western European countries instituted a stabilizing system for export earnings for the benefit of 46 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The policy and the evolution of relations between the rich and the poor countries had led us to expect better prospects for the future. Many had hoped that this machinery would be enlarged and improved and consequently would have an effect on the linkage between prices of manufactured goods and commodities, but nothing happened. The world must once again take note of the fact that the new world economic order has its price. Whichever way we approach it, the essential thing is to accept the idea and facilitate its application.\n124.\tThe countries of the third world want their non- manufactured products to receive a fair remuneration. They are aware that their development depends essentially on those products and that any transfer of financial resources can only be a supplement.\n125.\tThe international situation, as we together with most of the previous speakers from the third world have noted, leaves very little hope for a solution of our development problems. However, we shall not be discouraged. With our neighbors alone or jointly with those that share our ideals of solidarity and devotion to development, we have undertaken local and regional actions to benefit our peoples. Among these I shall mention only the Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, whose actions have made it possible in the first stage to save the lives of thousands of human beings and on which we rely for the establishment of the necessary economic arrangements to avert the prolonged effects of such disasters. To all those countries which have helped us we wish to express again our sincere gratitude.\n126.\tOutside the regional sphere, we made a point of being present at the meeting of solidarity of the third world at the Colombo Conference. On that occasion the Head of State of Niger, Lt. Col. Seyni Kountche, when speaking of the dynamics of non-alignment said the following:\n\\\"Let us conceive formulas for mutual assistance in order to avoid accepting the generosity of the two blocs, because, just as water that comes from the same source cannot be both salt and fresh, so- we cannot expect to maintain non-alignment while we are attached to others.\\\"\n127.\tThe fifth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the law of the Sea was concluded only a few weeks ago. Without advocating skepticism, the least one can say of that session is that it achieved no positive results.\n128.\tWe may search for the reasons for this semi-failure in the difficulties inherent in the establishment of an international convention; but we cannot conceal the fact that there are too many interests involved, whether admitted or otherwise. The obstacles encountered during the fifth session stem particularly from the hegemonic desires of some and the egotism of others.\n129.\tMy country, Niger, which is a land-locked State, must point out that its good relations with its coastal neighbors make its geographical position less hard to bear.\n130.\tHowever, as regards the elaboration of a convention to govern at the international level the rights and duties of the States parties, we could not accept a text which does not recognize to land-locked or disadvantaged States the right of free access to and from the sea.\n131.\tSimilarly, we could not remain silent as regards the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed, which are the common heritage of mankind. Those resources should be used for the harmonious development of the international community as a whole, and that result cannot be achieved if the authority and the enterprise to which all States are to belong do not have the appropriate legal and financial means for that purpose.\n132.\tHowever, we all know that there are other things involved besides direct economic interests which hamper the progress of the work of that Conference. The sharing of the oceans is part of international military strategy. The great marine spaces, like outer space, have become privileged territory where man is beginning to establish his bases for the launching of weapons of destruction.\n133.\tAnother ominous subject of tension must be pointed out: it is the gap that divides us from the great Powers. We speak of development, but on the other side they think of strategy and hegemony with all its retinue of provisions which seek to keep the planet in a state of terror.\n134.\tFor the small countries which seek development the United Nations is a very important instrument on which we have based our hopes for peace and freedom, and we believe it will for long remain the privileged place, the meeting place, where we can achieve consensus and where progressively it will be possible to do away with injustice, inequality and egotism among nations and among men. In this connexion we note with satisfaction the considerable work accomplished by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who identifies himself more and more with our struggles, our hopes for equity and the faith we have in this institution. My delegation was happy at the summit conference of OAUs to present to the Heads of State and Government a recommendation expressing sincere congratulations and a profound recognition of the remarkable task accomplished.\n135.\tThe intentions of my country are sincere, and our preoccupation is still development. Around us reasons for satisfaction are rare; but, despite these disappointments and perplexities, my delegation sincerely hopes that we shall soon see an era of pooling of views leading to the establishment of a new world order of peace and tolerance.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to extend my congratulations to Mr. Amerasinghe, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka, upon his election to the presidency of the thirty- first session of the General Assembly. His choice by the Assembly is surely warranted by his long experience in the United Nations as well as his diplomatic talent.\n184.\tI also would like at the very beginning of our work to reiterate our deep appreciation for the distinguished services rendered to this Assembly by the President of the thirtieth session, the illustrious Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thom.\n185.\tOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, during the annual period which has just passed has continued to accomplish with the greatest devotion, alertness, fore sightedness and tact so characteristic of him, the important tasks entrusted to him. We have found in him a statesman who is identified with the action of our Organization and someone who spares no effort in the work he carries out on the international arena to promote the principles and the goals of the United Nations. May he find in these few words the expression of our warm appreciation and gratitude.\n186.\tI am happy to welcome here the representatives of the recently created Republic of Seychelles, which is joining the great family of the United Nations at this session. We are very happy to welcome the Seychelles into our Organization. I am convinced that it will make an invaluable contribution to the work of the United Nations.\n187.\tThis session of the General Assembly prompts us in the first place to reflect on the role of the United Nations during this complex period. The introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization contains a detailed and wise analysis of the traits of this period and highlights the possibilities open to the world Organization as well as the obstacles it has to face. We share for the most part his assessments and I should like, in the context of the general debate, to refer in particular to his ideas concerning the procedures on the basis of which the General Assembly adopts its decisions.\n188.\tThe thirtieth session has indeed in certain cases given results about which we should reflect. The adoption of resolutions which have a dual nature or which are based solely on the views of one of the parties to a conflict is likely to weaken the authority and the credibility of the General Assembly and to render its resolutions completely inapplicable and to impede, rather than to facilitate, the process of negotiation and peaceful settlement. We all know that the resolutions of the General Assembly cannot alone settle the conflicts or the problems. None the less, they can contribute to a settlement to the extent that they correctly and objectively reflect a given situation, a thorough understanding of the positions of the parties involved, respect for them and realism, fairness and justice. I should like to hope that this year the conclusions of the work of the General Assembly may be less controversial, better balanced and more constructive.\n189.\tAt the beginning of this thirty-first session we must first of all define the most important problems we are facing. What have been the significant developments of this last year? Towards what goals will we have to direct our efforts in the present circumstances? I should like briefly to submit in their general lines Turkey's views on the international questions which my Government deems are of major interest at this time.\n190.\tThe year which has just elapsed had its difficulties, fears and tensions. If obvious progress was achieved in connexion with certain questions which were debated by our Assembly at its last session, new problems have arisen and conflicts have broken out in certain regions of the world. At the beginning of the last month we commemorated the first anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki, which defines the conditions of detente in Europe. That event was marked by moderately enthusiastic comments concerning the developments which have taken place during that initial period of the detente in Europe.\n191.\tIt is no less true that, in a general fashion, the countries of the European continent have enjoyed a certain stability in their political relations and relatively favorable conditions in the area of economic and technological co-operation. This is certainly not a negligible accomplishment, but the essential element which this period since the Final Act of Helsinki has highlighted is what for our part we have from the beginning called the \\\"indivisibility of ddtente\\\".\n192.\tThe experience acquired in that brief period of time has helped us to realize more clearly and more decisively that detente cannot be considered and maintained in isolation in any given part of the world, and that it is necessary that efforts aimed at making possible greater stability and more active co-operation be pursued in all parts of the world.\n193.\tIn this context we continue to think that peace and security in Europe are closely linked to peace and security in the Mediterranean. That is why we attach particular importance to the document entitled \\\"Questions on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean\\\" in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We hope that the conditions at present existing in that region will develop in a way that will make possible the total implementation of that document.\n194.\tIn the course of the year which has just finished Turkey, for its part, has undertaken all the initiatives it could in order to contribute to the establishment of conditions favorable to a new climate in international relations. In the two parts of the world which form its region, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, my country has renewed with almost all of its neighbors the existing good neighborly relations by forming closer ties with them both in the political domain and in that of economic co-operation. I think I can say that the countries of that region, because of those relations of good neighborliness and collaboration which they pursue and develop resolutely, make an important contribution to the maintenance of peace.\n195.\tAlongside these efforts which we must make with perseverance, efforts whose objective is to create and maintain international relations based on mutual respect, equality and the spirit of co-operation, several important questions in the economic field require today particular attention on our part.\n196.\tA global consideration of the world economic situation shows there are three trends which are particularly striking.\n197.\tThe first is the tendency towards interdependence among nations. The successive crises of these recent years and the serious problems which the international community has had to face have demonstrated without doubt that co-operation and that close international co-operation and co-ordination are indispensable.\n198.\tThe second tendency is the interrelation existing between economic problems both nationally and internationally. Until now such problems were for the most part dealt with on a sectoral basis, case by case-trade, financing, monetary problems, the environment. The need to adopt a multidisciplinary integrated method to resolve these problems becomes increasingly evident.\n199.\tThe third tendency is the evolution in concepts governing economic relations between industrialized and developing countries-that is to say, the recognition that such relations must be based on equality, equity and reciprocal interests. Conscious of this evolution and desirous of meeting the aspirations of the majority of the international community to assure a just and equitable development, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the program of Action at the completion of its sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J.\n200.\tInspired by those very same principles, the resolution concerning development and international economic cooperation adopted by consensus during the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] brought new scope to international economic relations. It provided measures to be taken in the fields of international trade, the transfer of resources, financing, development, science and technology, industrialization, monetary reform, agriculture, food and co-operation among developing countries.\n201.\tThe year which has just elapsed was rich in the field of negotiations within the United Nations system between developed and developing countries for the purpose of ensuring more rapid application of those measures provided for the establishment of a new international economic order. It is difficult to say that all those negotiations led to fully satisfactory results. None the less, we recognize that serious efforts were made on the part of all the parties concerned.\n202.\tWe can equally note that certain efforts were made during the course of that same year outside the United Nations system in order to contribute to the attainment of a new world economic order. The Paris Conference of International Economic Co-operation, which we are happy is resuming its work, the Seventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers,  the Manila Conference,  the Colombo Conference and the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  deserve special mention in the context of all those activities.\n203.\tMy Government is convinced that the establishment of a new international economic order based cm equality, fairness, interdependence and co-operation among all States regardless of their economic and social systems will rectify inequality and will correct present injustices. At the same time it will make it possible to eliminate the growing gap between developed and developing countries and will secure the economic and social development of present and future generations in peace and justice. Turkey, a developing country engaged in a process of rapid industrialization, has\nalways associated itself with all initiatives taken within the United Nations system as well as outside of it aimed at bringing realistic solutions to the international economic problems.\n204.\tThe persistence of colonialist and racist attitudes is a problem whose seriousness increases and which increasingly imperils peace and stability in the African continent as well as threatening international peace and security. Turkey, which had to wage an arduous struggle against imperialism and expansionism to safeguard and strengthen its independence, feels deep solidarity with the peoples who are resolved to ensure their self-determination and their independence. We welcomed with joy the acceleration of the process of decolonization over the last few years and more recently the accession to independence by Angola, Cape Verde, the Comoros, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles and Surinam. None the less, the problems of Namibia and Southern Rhodesia remain disquieting and, unless they are speedily solved, may soon give rise to interracial confrontations in southern Africa.\n205.\tTurkey, as a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, has given its full support to all efforts intended to assist the people of Namibia in its struggle for freedom and independence. The United Nations has taken on a very responsibility vis-a-vis Namibia. My delegation has backed the efforts of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Security Council demanding free elections under United Nations supervision. The lack of progress has seriously worsened the situation by creating new dangers. We hope that before it is too late South Africa will become conscious of the need to co-operate with the United Nations for the purpose of giving the Namibian people its inalienable right to independence.\n206.\tAs concerns Southern Rhodesia, Turkey reiterates its unreserved support of the request for self-determination and majority government by the people of Zimbabwe. We follow with great interest the sustained efforts recently made with a view to promoting and speeding up the solution to the problems in Southern Rhodesia. It is our sincere hope that those efforts will be successful and will make possible rapid progress towards a negotiated solution which, while meeting satisfactorily the needs of the people of Zimbabwe, will also prevent bloody confrontations.\n207.\tThe policy of apartheid in South Africa still continues to be a profound source of disquiet and concern for all countries devoted to the cause of racial justice and human dignity. The tragic events which have taken place recently in that country have served as a dramatic illustration of violent reaction which apartheid arouses. Turkey has always firmly stated its opposition to that policy and to racial discrimination in South Africa. We support Security Council resolution 392 (1976) inviting the South African Government to end violence against the African people and to take urgent steps to eliminate apartheid and racial discrimination. We hope that vigorous condemnation of this policy by the international community will compel the South African Government to abide by the judgment of the world conscience and will encourage it to adopt a rapid solution which would give to the African population of the country the same basic human rights which had been denied to them for so long.\n208.\tOwing to its geographical situation and its numerous ties and links and relations with the countries of the Middle East, Turkey continues to follow with great concern the conflict between the Arab States and Israel, which is a constant source of danger for peace and security in the region. The position of my country with regard to this problem has been repeatedly stated from this rostrum. The unswerving principles on which this foreign policy is based prompts Turkey to be opposed to the acquisition of territory by force. On the substance of the problem, we have always maintained that Israel should withdraw from all the territories it has been occupying since 1967 and that a settlement should allow all countries of the region to protect their independence, their sovereignty and the security of their borders. During recent years we have supported all efforts to ensure recognition of the political rights of the Palestinians because we are and continue to be convinced that this question is at the very heart of a broader problem-that of establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is out of this conviction that we have supported General Assembly resolutions reaffirming the inalienable rights of the Palestinians in Palestine-their rights to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty-and requesting that the Palestine Liberation Organization should be invited to participate on an equal footing with the other parties in all deliberations and conferences on the Middle East which take place under the auspices of the United Nations. My Government has followed with great interest and has supported all the initiatives which have been taken over the past few years to bring about conditions for a solution cf the conflict in the Middle East. If can be said that certain progress has been achieved in the search for a final solution. This progress essentially is based on a better understanding by international public opinion of the real aspects of this problem. However, if we have thought at times that a beginning has been made towards progress in this conflict, I have to acknowledge with great regret that the Middle East situation appears today to be as inextricably complicated as it was during the most difficult periods of the past.\n209.\tThe bloodshed in Lebanon has created new problems in that part of the world. Those of us who are neighbors and friends of that country have followed the grievous twists and turns of that fratricidal war with the deepest distress. Salvation lies in a national solution which would safeguard the territorial integrity of the country, based on a realistic compromise among the different groups that are today opposing each other and which would respond both to the exigencies of a modem democratic States as well as to the traditions and the real aspirations of the Lebanese people.\n210.\tWith regard to a question which is of vital importance for mankind, that is, to put a stop to the armaments race and bring about disarmament, we cannot help noting with great regret that not only has no progress been achieved in this area since our last session, but that quite to the contrary developments are taking place which aggravate and complicate fee problems still further. No steps forward have been made towards defining the concepts which might lender possible a beginning of negotiations on general and complete disarmament.\n211.\tOn the other hand, we must note that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex} has not attained its stated objectives. Not only does that Treaty not provide protection and serious guarantees for non-nuclear countries, but it has also not prevented the spread of nuclear danger to new regions of the world. We believe that all these problems which are linked to disarmament should be subjected to very serious reconsideration.\n212.\tIn recent years the whole world has witnessed an intensification of acts of international violence. The number of hijacked airplanes, of hostages taken and of diplomats murdered has reached alarming proportions. My country, like many others, was a victim of some of those inhuman and cruel acts. We are of the view that the Assembly should devote itself to this problem even if only to consider certain aspects of acts of violence which, unless measures are taken without delay to put an end to them, could plunge us into new human tragedies.\n213.\tImportant negotiations are now taking place in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose goal is to adapt international law to the new conditions of world shipping and of the exploitation of sea resources. What has made these negotiations so long and to this date inconclusive is that owing to the novelty of the concepts which are being elaborated in order tc define the new law of the sea, each country tends to understand them and interpret them on the basis of its own particular interests, and hence on the basis of its own geographical situation. The geography and geopolitics of our globe show all imaginable forms of variety and diversity. The continents and the seas certainly have not been traced with a regularity that would enable them to find simple and easy solutions in a new law of the sea. A global solution could only be arrived at if the Conference were to prepare concepts sufficiently broad to define general principles acceptable to all, but which on the other hand would facilitate and render possible the solution of specific cases. Those principles must take account of equity. On the other hand, as regards the resources of the ocean, which do not come under the jurisdictional sovereignty of any State, the methods for their exploitation should be determined within the framework of a system which would take account of the rights of each member of the international community to those resources and would afford an equitable distribution of the products of that exploitation.\n214.\tI should like to make some remarks on the problem in Cyprus. I am certain that all the Members of the United\n-Nations will remember what took place at the thirtieth session. The debate on that question led to an outcome which only hindered the process of negotiation. It was clear that negotiations could only be reactivated within the framework of a new procedure. And it is with that purpose in mind that we reached agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece on a new basis which envisaged the resumption of the dialog without preconditions, for the purpose of arriving at a \\\"package deal\\\" on all aspects involved in the Cyprus problem. Regrettably and despite the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, substantial negotiations were not undertaken owing to repeated attempts to call into question this new agreement, to void it of its true content and to derogate from it. The Secretary- General with tenacity and perseverance, for which we are most grateful to him, none the less did not abandon his efforts. He has recently held consultations with the representatives of both communities.\n215.\tI should like to repeat the considerations and principles which guide the Turkish Government in its policy concerning the problem of Cyprus. The two communities are engaged in a negotiating process. This fact, as well as the resolutions of the Security Council, require that both communities should be represented on an equal footing in all international forums where the question of Cyprus is debated. In the United Nations this need must be respected to the fullest extent allowed by the rules of procedure. Any action, any decision, which would encroach on that principle could only hamper negotiations and prolong the conflict.\n216.\tThe present situation on the island originated in the military coup d'etat by Greece in 1974 for the purpose of annexing Cyprus. The future solution will have to safeguard the independence, the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Cyprus. The State of Cyprus should be able to follow a policy of true non-alignment, which, in the mind of the Turkish Government, would truly correspond to the long-range interests of both communities by contributing to peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean.\n217.\tAn inevitable regrouping of the two communities in two distinct zones took place during the past two years. Sixty thousand Turkish Cypriots found refuge in the north of the island by abandoning their homes and their property in the south. A movement in the opposite direction occurred among the Greek population of the north of the island. These population movements present difficult problems which can only be settled in the framework of a global solution.\n218.\tThe Turkish intervention in Cyprus in July of 1974, which followed the coup d'etat against the independence of the island, was fully in conformity with the obligations undertaken by Turkey under a treaty which guaranteed that independence.  Turkey in no way intends to maintain its forces in Cyprus. It has already reduced its troops on the island by 12,000. Turkey has no wish to impose a solution and has no interest in Cyprus beyond the independence of the island and the prosperity and security of the Turkish community. Turkey wants Cyprus to remain outside any strategic arrangements and does not want it to become a pawn in the power politics of the major Powers. And along these lines I would like once again to stress that the Turkish community has committed itself to a policy of non-alignment for Cyprus. For those reasons, any solution acceptable to the Turkish community is also and without reservations acceptable to Turkey. As soon as a solution is found, Turkey will without delay withdraw its military forces, which it was compelled to send to Cyprus in conformity with its contractual obligations.\n219.\tI would like to repeat that in its Cyprus policy Turkey will continue to be guided only by one concern to encourage by all means a just and well-balanced solution which will contribute to peace and security and to harmonious co-operation in our region.\n220.\tTurkey has the same wish concerning the Turko- Greek bilateral problems. Questions concerning the continental shelf of the Aegean Sea, the militarization of the islands situated along the Turkish coast and the utilization of the air space of the Aegean call for urgent solutions. All of these questions were recently discussed in the Security Council and at the time 1 submitted the views of my Government on each one of them.\n221.\tThe militarization of the islands situated only a few miles away from the Turkish coast in flagrant violation of international treaties-particularly the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24 July 1923 and the Paris Treaty of 1947  governing the status of those islands-are a serious threat to the security of Turkey and activate a climate of mistrust between both countries. Effective steps aimed at restoring the demilitarized status of the islands in question should be adopted without delay.\n222.\tThe disagreement on the continental shelf stems from the claim made by Greece to exclusive sovereignty and to a monopoly of powers in the Aegean Sea. The legal arguments advanced by Greece to support this claim are not valid. The legal concepts on this subject are still very far from being well defined, but it is obvious that the configuration of the Aegean, with a multitude of islands among which a vast number are very close to the Turkish coast, will require the application of criteria founded on fairness which will fully take account of the specific conditions prevailing in the Aegean.\n223.\tThe demographic factor cannot be disregarded. The population of thousands of islands in the Aegean Sea does not exceed 300,000 inhabitants, whereas the population of the coastal region of Turkey is 10 million. The Aegean is a sea where only Turkey and Greece have coasts. Therefore it is a common sea. The problem of the continental shelf and its delimitation goes beyond purely technical and legal considerations and encompasses political, economic and security factors. Turkey cannot abandon its vital rights, which are linked with the preservation of the general equilibrium in that region.\n224.\tRecent decisions of the Security Council and of the International Court of Justice have confirmed the validity of the Turkish position. The Security Council did not accept the Greek thesis that research and prospecting activities of a Turkish civilian vessel would be an encroachment on the sovereign rights of Greece. The International Court of Justice legally rejected the request of Greece calling for interim measures to be taken in order to put an end to the research and exploration activities by Turkey. Turkey has always advocated negotiations between both countries for the settlement of that dispute and Security. Council resolution 395 (1976) of 25 August last made a recommendation along the same lines. As for us we are always prepared to have negotiations provided that those negotiations not be shadowed by unilateral actions which would be incompatible with the Security Council resolution and which could affect mutual trust, without which no dialog could yield positive and fruitful results.\n225.\tIn conclusion I would like to express the conviction that the debates of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will achieve progress towards constructive solutions to the, important international questions which concern us today in the interest of better understanding and closer collaboration among all countries of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries assembled in your great country and gave further evidence of the constructive role Sri Lanka plays in the non-alignment movement with a view to helping maintain world peace and security, promote development and prosperity, and enhance the struggle against colonialism, foreign domination and exploitation. Today we are gratified to see a distinguished citizen of that country, a brilliant diplomat with great experience, presiding over the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is my pleasure to congratulate your great country and you personally on the coincidence of these two important occasions, and to express our confidence that under your wise leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success.\n96.\tI should like also to extend my congratulations, Sir, to your predecessor, Mr. Thorn, for his efforts as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n97.\tWe note with pride and appreciation the high qualities of wisdom and patience shown by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the indefatigable efforts he has been making in the interest of humanity and peace and towards strengthening the role of the United Nations and maintaining its independence and effectiveness. On behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic I express our complete support for his efforts, support which we have given in the past and shall continue to give in the future.\n98.\tOne of the important events that has taken place at this session has been the admission of Seychelles to the United Nations. On behalf of the Government and people of the Libyan Arab Republic I extend most sincere congratulations to the people of the Seychelles and wish them progress and prosperity.\n99.\tThe recent passing away of Chairman Mao Tsetung was a very sad event, deeply affecting the whole world. I take this occasion to reiterate my condolences to the delegation of the People's Republic of China on the passing away of their great leader, who during his lifetime took strong stands in favor of peace and liberation. Our Arab nation will never forget the backing and support it received from China in its struggle against colonialism and foreign domination.\n100.\tThe year 1976 marks the beginning of the five-year plan in the Libyan Arab Republic. More than $22 billion have been allocated for the plan, which includes pro-grammes and projects in such areas as the economy, communication^, and social services and social affairs. In the preparation of the plan, special emphasis was laid on the development of existing productive capabilities and the creation of new resources, with a view to adjusting the economic structure and freeing it from complete dependence on the petroleum sector through the creation of new sources of national income.\n101.\tLike the other plans, this five-year plan is aimed at achieving the goals of the Libyan Arab Republic-namely, growth of production, equitable distribution, and reform of the economic and social conditions-the ultimate goal being the attainment of progress, prosperity and social justice for the people.\n102.\tAware of the fact that they influence and are influenced by the problems of the Arab world, the. African continent and the world as a whole, the people of the Libyan Arab Republic are concerned with these problems as much as they are interested in the preparation and implementation of ambitious development plans. They would also like to take part, along with other peace-loving nations, in the effort to lay durable foundations for world peace and security, to promote prosperity and welfare for the peoples of the world, and to enhance the advancement of human civilization.\n103.\tOne of the aims of the people of the Libyan Arab Republic is the achievement of Arab unity I repeat: the achievement of Arab unity-be cause the present backwardness, disunity and division are unnatural in our Arab nation. A nation having the same destiny, facing a common threat and yearning to achieve the same goals and objectives ought to be unified in the framework of a single, strong \nunit capable of defending itself against any threats and of\tsupport they receive from various countries -and primarily achieving advancement and progress from the United States. The most recent flagrant support at the United Nations was given when the Security Council. \n104.\tWe are aware of the hardships of the course we are\tdiscussed the question of Palestine on four occasions last talking and of the dimensions of the challenges we are\tyear. The majority of Security Council members endeavor facing. The present stage of our struggle for unity is\tinevitably accompanied by differences and disputes, but\tother nations also have their differences and disputes, and\tsometimes even wars and tragedies occur in the course of their development and struggle for unity. We are determined to reach our goal of unity and will no be hindered by sterile attempts which stand against Arab unity: these attempts will be crushed by the Arab masses in their triumphal march to ultimate victory. \n105.\tWe can hardly conceal our feelings of sadness and pain at the tragic developments in the Arab world which have been initiated and exploited by colonialist reactionaries and heinous Zionist forces, in order to fuel the Arab differences and to sow the seeds of hatred among the sons of one Arab nation. The Libyan Arab Republic has made\nevery effort to extinguish the fire of dissension and to\nalleviate the tragedy of the afflicted. We are confident that\nour nation, by virtue of its traditional vitality, wUl be able\nto overcome the difficulties, achieve unity and eliminate all\nthe intrigues and conspiracies woven against its unity and\nprogress.\n\n106.\tThe unity we seek is a requisite for our nation's The unity we seek is a requisite for our nation's ability to enrich civilization and contribute effectively to the progress of the international community. Arab unity is a legitimate national movement, and in the light of the trends of history is viable. It is considered an essential\nfactor in the struggle against backwardness, colonialism and\nimperialism.\t\n107.\tThe virtue of its geographical location our Arab nation\tis is linked to Africa by bonds of blood, history, culture,\nelision and common interest. We also have in common the\nstruggle against colonialism and imperialism and mutual\nefforts to move away from the state of backwardness.\nEighty per cent of the Arab population and 70 per cent of\ntheir land is in Africa. Bearing these factors in mind, it is\nour conviction that Arab-African solidarity is inevitable for\nthe advancement of the masses in the Arab world and in\nAfrica. Contributing its share in the strengthening of ArabAfriCUl\nsolidarity, the Libyan Arab Republic champions all\nsincere efforts made in this connexion by other sister States\nand by the Organization of African Unity and the League\nof Arab States. Sound development, reasons of interrelated\nsecurity and historical changes all demand that we should\ndevelop and increase Afro-Arab solidarity and create a genuine unified Arab-African front.\n108.\tThe problem of the Palestinian people is the primary concern and cause of the Arab nation. Although this\nquestion has been before the United Nations since 1947,\nthe lot of the Palestinian people has been alleviated, and\nneither the United Nations not the international community\nhas been able to reach a final just solution in this\ncause. The deterioration of the situation has, as we all\nknow, been due to th~ arrogance and stubbornness of the\ncriminal Zionist gangsters and the unjust and unlimited\tsupport they receive from various countries and primary from the United States. The most recent flagrant support the United Nations was given when the Security Council discussed the question of Palestine on four occasions last year. The Majority of Security Council members endeavored to reach a consensus but their efforts were in vain because the United States could not but satisfy the Zionist gangsters at the expense of the Palestinian people abusing its right of veto. \n109.  We Will believe that the optimal solutions of the problems lies basically in enabling the Palestinian people to exercises its legitimate rights and in the creation in Palestine of a democratic secular State within which Moslem, Christians and Jews would be equal. We also believe that the settlement of the Palestine question is the basis of solving what is now called the Middle East question. \n110. The people of the Libyan Arab Republic stand firmly\nby their brethren the people of Palestine and will continue\nto do so until victory is achieved, despite the pressures,\nblackmail and slander waged against us by colonialist\nreactionaries and exploiters of people.\n111. On this occasion I should like to comment on the\nstatement of the last speaker and to express our sorrow and\npain at hearing a representative of an Arab country at the\nUnited Nations saying things that sadden us and undermine\nour cause. Unfortunately he was trying to justify the\nslaughter of the Palestinian people. We do not wish to turn\nthis meeting, which is the last of the general debate, into an\nArab quarrel, because we Arabs are engaged in lengthy talks\nand, as I have said, the problems of the Arab nation are\nacknowledged by us. We are very wen aware of them and\nwe would have hoped that the problems of the Arab nation\nand Arab questions could be dealt with within the Arab\nfamily. Regrettably, however, what happened, happened.\n112. The question of Palestine and the tragedy of the\nPalestinian people cannot be discussed without reference to\nthe deplorable role of the governing establishment of the\nUnited States of America as champion of unreasonable,\nunjust and unlimited Support for the Zionist colonial aggressors in the Arab homeland. From the United States the Zionist gangsters get material, economic and military\naid; from the United States the Zionist gangsters also\nreceive moral; diplomatic and political support without\nthis continuous and steady flow of support for more than\n30 years the Zionist gangsters-who gathered from all\ncorners of the world-would not have been able to remain\nand live in Arab Palestine and to oppress the Arab people of\nPalestine. Events have shown the deep and close association\nbetween the governing establishment of the United States\nof America and the aggressive racist Zionist movement.\nEvents have also shown how sensitive the American leaders\nare regarding anything that might affect the racist Zionist\ngangsters from near or far. As a result of Zionist influence\non American politics, the American information media, the\n. Congress and Government officials all compete in ingratiating\nthemselves with the Zionist racist gangsters by trying to\nkeep them happy at any sacrifice, even at high cost to the\ninterests, money and sweat of the working-class people of\nthe United States themselves. Above all, in doing so they\nignore the high ideals of the founding fathers of America,\nwho revolted against British colonialism in America.\n113.\tThe most recent example of American leaders capitulating before Zionism was to be seen on television last week. What we beheld was painful if not ridiculous: the two presidential candidates humbly and pitifully competing to ingratiate themselves with the criminal Zionist gangsters, even though those gangsters create devastation and destruction in our homeland and use the armaments given them by America to destroy our farms and houses in Palestine, Sinai and the Golan Heights.\n114.\tIt seems as if at stake in the current election campaign is the office of the mayor of Tel Aviv rather than the office of President of the United States, which is one of the super-Powers of this world.\n115.\tIn that debate no criticism was made of the Zionist gangsters. On the contrary, generosity in offering more assistance to the Zionist gangsters in all areas was pledged, as if the debate was an auction , in which bids were being desperately offered by the two candidates to assist the Zionist entity. Neither of the duelists dared utter a word in favor of the struggling people of Palestine or the ISO million Arabs who have suffered from American napalm and whose land the American economy has been draining of tens of billions of dollars every year.\n116.\tIt is a tragedy beyond description to see the American giant being dragged into supporting injustice and the oppressor, arming the aggressor and contracting the enmity of a nation struggling for freedom, unity and progress, such as the Arab nation, by allowing America's great capabilities to be used in the aggression against our land and in killing our people.\n117.\tHowever, our nation is determined to pursue the struggle against the twentieth-century tyrants, whom it will teach a lesson, as it has done in the past in its long, continuous civilization -which has endured for thousands of years in spite of difficulties and obstacles-and in its struggle against invaders and tyrants.\n118.\tMr. Carter has threatened to wage an economic war against us, not because we have wronged the United States, but as a reply to our boycott against the Zionist entity. He must be aware that the Arab boycott of Israel is a legitimate international weapon against this artificial entity which invaded our land and plans to stay there brazenly at the expense of our struggling peoples. The other candidate, who joined in the parade of those attacking the Arab boycott of Israel, knows better than any that the United States is the last country to be justified in condemning the Arab boycott, because it practices a boycott against many countries, for illegal causes in most cases.\n119.\tThe governing establishment in the United States knows that the Arab boycott is an economic weapon against an entity which we do not recognize, and with which we are at war, and not against any religious, ethnic or cultural group. The Arab boycott list includes Moslems, Christians and Jews -white, red, yellow and black. We boycott anyone who supports the economy of Israel and violates me regulations agreed upon unanimously and collectively by all Arab States invoking their right under all rules and laws effective in the world of today.\n120.\tI would like to make it clear that I speak on behalf of all Arabs when i say that threats will not intimidate us, nor will the rumbling of the election campaign. If the candidate who threatened us with an economic war is fortunate enough to win the election, we will be watching to see how he is going to carry out his threat. He might discover that to carry out his threat will not be as easy as he thought, that the life of the Arab nation is not in the grip of the American governing establishment, and that the United States is not the only State nor is it the only power in this world. He will discover that we will find markets-other than American markets -which will be available to us for products, technology and trade.\n121.\tThe imminent future will set the record straight. Perhaps the mad threat we heard will help to unify us and awaken those who because of bad judgment and misguided ideals are backing the American horse. This group has to be assured, as we have been, that the American horse has disappointed them, and has given its rein to the gangsters of New York and Tel Aviv, the warmongers and exploiters of peoples.\n122.\tAmerican disregard was recently manifested in the decision taken a few days ago to provide the Zionist entity with new, highly sophisticated weapons. This conduct confirms anew the unreasonable policy and irresponsible conduct of the United States in our region, and the fact that it is hastening unwisely to give unlimited and unrestrained support to the Zionist gangsters. This latest foolish conduct shows that American leaders have lost their minds and are obviously acting beyond the realm of reason and logic, in a flagrant challenge to the Arab community and the morality of the world.\n123.\tEven the American press, which supports the Zionist gangsters, has voiced its surprise and its fears at this foolhardy conduct. Yesterday, for example, the Washington Post stated that: \\\"This is an obvious case of the principles of national security falling victim to political interests.\\\"\n124.. The question of decolonization in general, and that of Africa in particular, Is closely linked with the question of world peace and security, and is a matter of concern to our people. The white minority regime in Zimbabwe continues to pursue its repression of the black majority in defiance of all United Nations. resolutions. The situation there is explosive, and a dangerous war is already in progress. Despite repeated United Nations efforts at reaching a solution, as well as the efforts of African leaders and other mediators, the racist minority regime continues to refuse to recognize realities and listen to the voice of reason.\n125.. In Namibia, the imperialist, racist collusion is quite apparent. The racist regime, of South Africa, disregarding all United Nations resolutions and the appeals of the world community, clings .to its rule in Namibia; continuing to perpetuate apartheid and racial discrimination, and to sow the seeds of-dissension among the people of that Territory by pursuing the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\". The continuation of South Africa's presence in Namibia is illegal and in violation of the international Organization's resolutions. South Africa's administration in Namibia must be withdrawn and its occupation of the Territory must come to an end. The United Nations should also reject any step taken by the South African Government that would prejudice the unity and territorial integrity of the Territory, or that would hinder the Namibian people's free and legitimate expression of their will with regard to their future. Any constitutional arrangements made for the Territory are void unless based on the desires and views of the genuine representatives of the people of Namibia, and such arrangements should be made under the supervision of the United Nations.\n126.\tThe racist regime in South Africa could not have dared to take the stand it has taken without the support it receives from colonialist, racist, and Zionist circles, which provide that regime with arms and military support, and stand by that regime in the Security Council, by placing their veto at its disposal.\n127.\tWe hope that the United Nations will be able to achieve full decolonization and the total elimination of racism on the African continent, thus ending bloodshed, suffering and destruction. We also hope that the peoples of the area will detect any conspiracies implanted to raise false hopes, to sow the seeds of division, and to perpetuate the interests of colonialism and racism, once the advocates of colonialism and imperialism feel that the strong winds of liberation are irreversible and that the hour of salvation is inevitable.\n128.\tThe increasing tensions between Turkey and Greece are a cause of great concern for us because of our traditionally brotherly and historically friendly relations with both countries. Therefore, from the moment of the eruption of the Aegean Sea crisis, we took the initiative by offering our good offices in order to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. As a friend of both States, we hope that they will be able to settle their disputes in the imminent future.\n129.\tThe question of Cyprus also is a matter of concern for us. We hope for the achievement of a solution that will be acceptable to both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities, that will preserve the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus, and affirm its role in the non-aligned movement.\n130.\tThe Security Council is the body entrusted with maintaining world peace and security. Yet, the Council's performance has been restrained on a number of occasions by the abuse of the right of veto. In this connexion I would like to mention the following examples.\n131.\tFirst, there was the opposition to the draft resolution submitted by five Member States during the consideration of France's announcement of its intention to conduct a referendum on 8 February 1976 in the island of Mayotte, which is a part of the territory of the Comoros.\n132.\tSecondly, there was the opposition to the draft resolution submitted by nine Member States regarding the admission of the Republics of North Viet Nam and South VietNams to the United Nations, and the threat to use it against the admission of the Peoples' Republic of Viet Nam. This was the primary obstacle preventing the admission of Angola and Viet Nam to the United Nations-and in violation of the principle of universality. We wish to take this occasion to commend from this rostrum the struggle of these two great peoples. We look forward to their participation in the work of our Organization in the near future.\n133.\tThirdly, there has been opposition, on three occasions, to draft resolutions submitted during the consideration of the Middle East question including the situation in the occupied Arab territories, and the examination of the report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.\n134.\tThe abuse of the right of veto obliges us to insist on the urgent necessity of reviewing the United Nations Charter and of finding an alternative to the veto in order to make our Organization more effective in maintaining international peace and security.\n135.\tOur people value equality among peoples and abhor all forms of racial discrimination as being degrading to man and denying his dignity. That is why we condemn the racist regimes in South Africa and in occupied Palestine, where the ugliest forms of racial discrimination are practiced against the black majority in southern Africa and against the Arab people in occupied Palestine. The report of the Special Committee against Apartheid has exposed the evil collusion between the two racist regimes in all areas, particularly in the military sphere.\n136.\tMy country had the honor to act as host to the International Symposium on Zionism and the Racial Questions in Tripoli from 24 July to 28 July 1976. The Symposium urge, all States to sever diplomatic relations with the racist regimes in South Africa and in occupied Palestine. The Symposium responded to the defamatory campaign waged against the United Nations by the Zionists and racists and their allies in the wake of the General Assembly resolution at its last session declaring Zionism as a form of racial discrimination [resolution 3379 (XXX)]. The communique by the Tripoli Symposium stated that:\n\\\"Nothing is more dishonest than the slogan unleashed by the United States and Israel as the principal weapon in their campaign against the resolution of the United Nations that anti-zionism is anti-Semitism. This dishonest slogan is predicated on the false equation of Judaism with Zionism, and the equally false equation of Jews with Zionists.\n\\\"It should be remembered that the first opposition to political Zionism was forcefully voiced by Jewish spiritual leaders, who stressed that Zionism's ethnic, nationalistic and territorial priorities were incompatible with the beliefs and moral precepts of the Jewish faith....\n\\\"Other prominent Jews have opposed the exclusivist nature of Zionism, its ethnocentrism, and the racial injustices it has perpetrated, on moral, humanistic and universal grounds\\\". \n137.\tIn the light of the necessity of escalating the struggle against all forms of racial discrimination, the International Symposium has established an international organization for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. It is a popular, independent and non-governmental body, whose objective is to participate in the implementation by all means possible of the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination everywhere and to co-ordinate the efforts of all those struggling to achieve this end. The decisions and the communique of the International Symposium have been distributed as an official document of the General Assembly dated 30 September 1976.\n138.\tOur policy regarding both the old and the new colonialism and racial discrimination has been declared and is well known. We are opposed to both forms of colonialism and to all forms of racial discrimination, and we support all peoples suffering from colonialism, foreign domination and racist regimes. We fully assist the national liberation movements in their struggle to rid themselves of these racist regimes. We also stand ready to confront all the evil schemes being hatched for the purpose of liquidating the cause of the Palestinian people. The policies of the Libyan Arab Republic conform fully with United Nations objectives, principles and resolutions and hence it is naturally adverse to the common interests of the imperialist and Zionist circles, and, as a result of this, it is the target of a mad, defamatory propaganda campaign waged by these circles who rely on prevarications and false allegations. The imperialist and Zionist circles deliberately seek to distort the honorable image of the national liberation movements by confusing their struggle with individual acts that have nothing whatsoever to do with those movements. They seek to establish a link between the assistance of the Libyan Arab Republic to the national liberation movements and the irresponsible acts which are deplored by all, particularly by the Libyan Arab Republic. The colonialist and Zionist circles also seek to associate the Libyan Arab Republic with the hijacking of planes and the taking of hostages, although the Libyan Arab Republic has repeatedly denounced such acts as being reckless and unresponsible. Therefore, we emphatically deplore all hijackings because they threaten the lives of innocent people. Moved solely by humanitarian reasons, and sometimes at the request of the authorities concerned, the Libyan Arab Republic has, on several occasions, permitted hijacked planes to land at its airports.\n139.\tThe colonialist and Zionist Powers are attempting to undermine the Libyan Arab Republic and to create a demagogic atmosphere in order to conceal their terrorist actions against people under the yoke of colonialism and foreign domination.\n140.\tThe sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly were turning-points and essential turning-points in the field of international economic relations. They have opened the door for international efforts to correct the deteriorating economic situation that has prevailed for many years, by the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equity,\nand on respect for the sovereignty of States and their inalienable right to utilize their natural resources.\n141.\tThe key element in the implementation of General Assembly resolutions concerning this new order is the\npolitical will and genuine determination to implement these important resolutions.\n142.\tThe developing countries are determined to develop their economies, depending mainly on their own capabilities and in co-operation among themselves, by using their collective power in negotiations for the establishment of a new economic order with a view to guaranteeing a better life for their peoples.\n143.\tIt is clear from the resolutions adopted by the Conferences of Algiers, Dakar, Lima, Manila, Colombo and Mexico that the developing countries stress the necessity of a complete restructuring of international economic relations by the establishment of a new system based on equal sovereignty, common interests and fruitful co-operation among all peoples of the world.\n144.\tThe developing petroleum-exporting countries have fulfilled satisfactorily their responsibilities, and continue to shoulder their responsibility, by assisting their developing sister-countries in overcoming economic difficulties caused by the present economic situation, which has dominated the world for over a quarter century. Through bilateral or multilateral channels, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] have given assistance to developing countries. Furthermore, they have established a number of banks and funds for this noble purpose, their most recent efforts in this connexion being the pledge of $400 million to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\nMS. In addition to its contribution through OPEC, the Libyan Arab Republic gives assistance to developing countries through bilateral arrangements and through its participation in international projects and its contributions to regional and international banks and funds. Furthermore, in 1972 it established the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, whose basic objective is to finance development activities abroad, particularly in the developing countries. The Bank has contributed to the capital of a number of banks and financial institutions in developing countries. The number of its contributions rose from four in 1972 to 19 in 1975. The assistance of the Libyan Arab Republic to the least developed countries reached in 1975 about 6 per cent of its net oil income, which is approximately 3 per cent of its national income.\n146. The peoples of the developing countries awaited with high expectations the outcome of the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Yet UNCTAD, unfortunately, was unable to solve the problems of reforming the world market structure in the areas of raw materials and commodities which are important for the exports of developing countries, raising the developing countries' share in world industrial production and attaining the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] regarding the flow of financial resources into developing countries, especially the objective of official development assistance specified at 0.7 per cent of the gross national product. Nor was UNCTAD able to reach a conclusion concerning the transfer of technology, the reform of the international monetary system in the interest of international trade and promotion, and the easing of debt-servicing problems. It should be pointed out, however, that UNCTAD has made some progress in the area of the development of an integrated program for commodities, whose major component is the common fund, with a view to financing the international stock of commodities. Still needed, though, is the political will to implement the principal objective of this program, which will constitute an important element in international economic relations.\n147.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction the attention given by the international community to two of its initiatives during the last session. One of them related to the question of mines planted in the Libyan Arab Republic by the parties to the Second World War. At that session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3435 (XXX), dated 9 December 1975. The Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program also showed interest in the question and adopted Decision No. 80 (IV), dated 9 April 1976 [see A/31/25, annex I]. My delegation expected the study envisaged in paragraph 3 of resolution 3435 (XXX) to be submitted during this session; yet it will be content that adequate time should be allowed for the experts to prepare a comprehensive study. In this connexion, we endorse the proposal that an intergovernmental meeting be convened to take up this important matter. We also support resolution No. 32 of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo, calling for an international conference to consider all aspects of this matter [see A131/197, annex IV].\n148.\tThe second initiative was concerned with bribes and the role of transnational corporations. Consideration of this question led to the adoption of resolution 3514 (XXX) on 15 December 1975. The Commission on Transnational Corporations, at the request of the General Assembly, took up this question at its second session, held in Lima from 1 to 12 March 1976. Furthermore, the Economic and Social Council adopted resolution 2041 (LXI) on 5 August 1976, establishing an 18-member Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Working Group to consider this question. The Libyan Arab Republic delegation is gratified by this attention and hopes that a proper solution will be reached in the near future by this international group.\n149.\tThe United Nations has made commendable efforts in the social field, especially with regard to a group who have been partially or totally unable to provide for their individual or social needs because of physical of mental disabilities. In this regard the General Assembly adopted resolution 2856 (XXVI), containing the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, and resolution 3447 (XXX),; dated 9 December 1975, containing the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. In appreciation of the importance of care of the disabled, and in affirmation of the United Nations resolutions in this respect, the Libyan Arab.Republic has submitted, under agenda item 12, \\\"Report of the Economic and Social Council\\\", a draft resolution proclaiming the year 1978 as the International Year for Disabled Persons with the theme \\\"Compassion, Equality and Peace\\\", with a view to the achievement of a number of objectives, including: first, the attainment of social and psychological adjustment and conformity for the disabled, to ensure their ability to overcome their physical and mental problems; secondly, the increase of all forms of assistance, care and direction and the creation of appropriate employment opportunities for the disabled with a view to giving them equality with normal individuals; thirdly, the dissemination of information on the importance of this sector of the population and the need for their participation in all the economic, social and political aspects of life. We trust that all States and international organizations, concerned will do their best to help in making this humane endeavor a success.\n150.\tBecause of our interest in human rights, we are deeply concerned that these rights are still being grossly violated. Despite the enormous material success made by man in recent decades in the exploration of outer space and the sea and the ocean depths, man on this planet still suffers injustices from his brother. Racial discrimination is still at its peak and is practiced officially and unofficially; in some countries, human suffering and injustice on grounds of color, race and religion still exist. Some minority groups around the world are still suffering injustice and tyranny; brutal physical and psychological torture is still being practiced against prisoners of war and prisoners in general.\n151.\tThe question of torture was dealt with in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is also being given attention by this international Organization. The General Assembly adopted resolution 3452 (XXX), containing the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. We call for further achievements in this area. Hence, protection of human rights should be the corner-stone in rebuilding the international structure, an objective which we all should endeavor to achieve.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to say how pleased I am to see Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe vested with the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Ambassador Amerasinghe is a man who enjoys great prestige in international forums, in which he has served with particular distinction as the representative of the Government of his noble country, Sri Lanka, and his presence presiding over the work of this General Assembly is a guarantee of calm and proficiency in the lofty functions which the international community has called upon him to perform.\n5.\tI should also like to address a word of sincere appreciation to the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, for the relevant contribution he made to the General Assembly as President of its thirtieth session.\n6.\tMoreover, I am happy to be able to welcome the Republic of Seychelles on the happy occasion of that State's becoming a Member of the United Nations. The Brazilian delegation wishes to establish a close and friendly relationship with the delegation of Seychelles and hopes to co-operate intimately with that delegation when we deal with the items on our agenda.\n7.\tIn recent years the United Nations has become the target for mounting criticism leveled against its operation. The time has certainly come to place these criticisms, which are at times quite blunt, in true perspective. It would not be difficult to ascertain how much of this attitude is self- serving. Such an attitude does not meet the most enlightened interests of nations, those very interests which justified the creation of the United Nations and its later call to universality. Therefore, it is always opportune to reaffirm, in a constructive manner that the international responsibility of this Organization derives from commitments freely and spontaneously undertaken by States under the Charter of the United Nations, commitments which do not admit of exceptions or reservations.\n8.\tThe United Nations is a political organism immersed in a world which is also political. The United Nations, in reality, constitutes the only political forum of universal scope at the disposal of States. In addition to fulfilling the normative functions laid down in its Charter, the United Nations must deliberate on the international problems the Member States bring to it in order to safeguard their national interests at the international level.\n9.\tAccordingly, international problems of the most varied nature are included in the agenda of the General Assembly, and those problems must be discussed according to the procedures set forth in the Charter and in the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. As is only natural, such discussion entails characteristically parliamentary behavior and attitudes. It would be illusory to think that such procedures and related behavior could ever be isolated from the political circumstances that generated the problems and from those surrounding their discussion. \nThe\u2003United Nations does not function in a world apart from the real world where political facts take place. Events in this hall are not independent of the real context of international relations. Quite the contrary, what happens here reflects a wider political reality. That reality explains better than words the atmosphere of frustration and tension which at times prevails in this forum. The debates in the General Assembly and the resolutions that this body, more than any other major organ of the United Nations, has the capacity to adopt make equally apparent the hopes and the disappointments of the Member States and portray both the advances and the set-backs in the international political process.\n10.\tIn recent years international life has gained much in complexity. Not only have new States been admitted to the United Nations but also increasingly varied matters are being subjected to international rule, as witness the current cycle of great, thematic conferences held under the aegis of the United Nations. This broadening of the scope of multilateral negotiations may or may not be of benefit to the majority of States. In many cases, it is; in others, it may also serve to direct attention towards problems of secondary importance, an attention' that should, first and foremost, be concentrated upon the fundamental issues of international security and the harmonious development of nations. For the process of universal negotiation to produce lasting results, however, it is necessary to keep it under the authority of .the principle of sovereign equality, a principle that ensures to States equitable participation in international decisions affecting the future of each State and of mankind as a whole.\n11.\tIt must perforce be recognized that, as an organization essentially devoted to promoting international peace and security, the United Nations does not present a record of important gains in recent years. The picture is rather one of institutional and operational impasses. The machinery of collective security seems to be obstructed, decisions are delayed and, when they are taken, they meet frequent obstacles in the way of their implementation.\n12.\tThis weakening of the central functions of the Organization is symbolized by the deadlocks that characterize the proceedings of the Security Council. The unrestricted use of the veto continues to leave room for apprehension, particularly as no special diligence can be noted on the part of some permanent members of the Security Council to seek negotiated solutions for the delicate questions submitted to that body. It seems paradoxical that two apparently contradictory tendencies coexist on the world scene, namely, a relaxation of international tension, especially between the super-Powers, and a weakening of the collective security machinery of the United Nations.\n13.\tSuch deadlocks are found in almost all multilateral efforts in the field of international security, as can be seen from the deadlocks which over the years have dominated the negotiations for both disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, and peace-keeping operations.\n14.\tStalemates in the political field are one aspect of the stratification that characterizes the present international structure. Perhaps only the advances made towards decolonization allow us to discern a trend away from that stratification, a trend that holds out new possibilities for positive interrelations and for a more just international order.\n15.\tWe are living in an era marked by, dissent and by the persistence of areas of international tension, as well as by the permanence of generalized conditions of under-development. I do not now intend to list these areas of tension, but the eye is immediately caught by what is happening in Africa and in the Middle East.\n16.\tSouthern Africa, where racial oppression persists, is today not only seized with unrest and fear, but also devastated by violence and slaughter. In the face of recent events, the items now on our agenda concerning the problems that afflict that region have taken on unprecedented importance. Brazil has always been in favor of peaceful solutions for those problems and has always been convinced that there was no time to be lost in arriving at them. Our opinion, repeatedly stated over the years, was that, unless solutions were promptly reached, the region would be irresistibly drawn into open conflict. Unhappily, we have no reason to revise our diagnosis, but we should still like to believe that the unanimous international repudiation of the injustices committed will serve as a grave warning to those that consider it possible to continue to maintain racial oppression. It is our hope that the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, who still have not achieved their independence, may soon be able freely to exercise their true national will.\n17.\tIn the Middle East, alongside the Lebanese tragedy, which Brazil particularly regrets because of the ties of all kind that we have with Lebanon, the same basic problems still exist, problems that have for years been challenging the political ability of the international community. The reactivation of these problems is a disquieting prospect, one that is always possible and always present.\n18.\tThe experience of the last few years confirms the widely shared perception that, in the absence of speedy and just solutions for regional conflicts or disputes, such disputes end up by acquiring a wider international character, thus disseminating to other regions and to the international system as a whole an unrest which was initially localized. Contrary to what might have been expected, the present situation of relative international strategic balance has not created favorable conditions for the prompt correction of those localized situations. The Brazilian delegation is convinced that, in dealing with these difficult issues, more intensive use should be made of the United Nations not only because the Organization offers the parties opportunities for negotiations but also because, among the principles of the Charter, there is one concerning the non-use of force or the threat of force in international relations.\n\n19.\tSadly, it is today considered commonplace to affirm that the disparity between the developed and the under-developed countries has become flagrantly unbearable and that it is urgent to negotiate concrete measures to correct it. Four sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD have already been held and, ironically, not one but two decades have, one \nafter the other, been declared to be United Nations Development Decades. A variety of formats of negotiation have been attempted during that period. We have participated on the international level in case-by-case approaches; we have negotiated work programs on different themes; we have been present at countless generic declarations. All those efforts have led to such scanty results that their paucity is now universally acknowledged.\n20.\tThere is increasing frustration, as much in practice as in theory, over the whole basic issue of international trade and the economic and social development of the less- developed countries we exclude the oil-producing countries from our analysis, we can see that the net transfer of capital from the developed areas to the less-developed ones is becoming a myth. In net terms, that flow may shortly run from south to north. And while the relative participation of the less-developed countries in world trade is dwindling, there is a disproportionate increase of their presence in generating the surplus that is accumulating in the balance of payments of the main world business partners.\n21.\tAll that is all the more surprising since it can be shown that if the financial transfers of the developed countries to the developing ones were directed into productive sectors, they would not detrimentally affect the possibilities for economic growth of the developed countries themselves. Studies prepared by experts of the United Nations show that if, as a hypothesis, the net flow of capital to non-oil-exporting developing countries reached in the next few years levels compatible with the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade -that is to say, an average rate of increase of the gross national product of at least 6 per cent the income of the developed countries members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development would increase at a rate faster than the present one. Contrary to what superficial reasoning might lead one to believe, the effective implementation of measures designed to maintain the international buying power of the developing countries would not have a negative effect on the developed countries but would benefit them by increasing their income and their rate of employment. Moreover, it is possible to predict that this expansion would occur precisely in the less inflationary sectors of their economies.\n22.\tThe debate about the essence of the problem of under-development has lost its impetus, although attitudes, perist that seem to wish to impute to the developing countries an alleged guilt for their conditions of economic backwardness. This determination of historical guilt lacks any practical sense and should not be used to avoid or postpone concrete negotiations, or to lead countries to fail to take more constructive stands in international economic negotiations. The so-called sterile confrontations have their origin precisely in the general frustration felt by the under-developed countries at the diplomatic immobility that such attitudes engender or stimulate.\n23.\tTo this negativism, founded on alleged reasons drawn from the past, there recently has been added another, this one addressed to futurological concerns. It is alleged that for ecological reasons the economic development of the under-developed countries of today is no longer practicable.\nNow, the stagnation of the poorer areas of the globe cannot be the price to be paid to conserve the environment. What is really necessary is to proceed to a broad reorganization of the world economy so as to correct the acute disparities both in the distribution of the means of production and in the patterns of consumption. Invoking ecological motives in order to frustrate expectations for development would be a new and unacceptable form of domination that would meet with the opposition of all those peoples that have been subjected to colonialism and that, despite all the predications to the contrary, knew how to organize themselves politically in order to achieve their independence and to preserve it, as well as to struggle for their economic autonomy.\n24.\tAs this century draws to a close, the people of the world have a right to social and economic development, and it is a right they do not intend to give up.\n25.\tThe other face of the struggle for development is the increasing interdependence of States. Opening the general debate of last year's session of the General Assembly,  1 had the opportunity to dwell on the distinction Brazil believes should be drawn between the present vertical interdependence-that is, one based on a rigid and discriminatory international stratification and a desirable horizontal interdependence that would be founded on a legitimate community of interest and on equitable sharing of the world's wealth by all States.\n26.\tToday I wish to add that the persistence of under-development, resulting as it does in the continued political and economic marginalization of most developing countries, will inevitably hold back the evolution of the process of interdependence of States itself.\n27.\tIt is especially disquieting to note that, although external trade may be more and more significant for the economy of developing countries as a whole, the share of these countries in the international flow of trade the oil exporters naturally excluded-is less and less important in percentage terms. The great majority of developing countries is losing ground in the global exchange of goods and services, and what is more, even as suppliers of raw materials to developed countries, which more and more have taken to trading among themselves. If this trend continues, developing countries will be pushed farther and farther to the edges of the international economic system.\n28.\tAs a result, the integration of the world economy is being carried out at the cost of a radical disequilibrium that it is urgent to correct. It is unacceptable for the process of interdependence to continue indefinitely to accentuate exclusively the expansion of the strength of the great industrial centers, where the essential part of the world's technical and economic capacity is concentrated.\n29.\tIt is necessary to give a new meaning, more just and more open, to the dynamics of interdependence. The imbalance that distorts it must be speedily eliminated and the only way to do that which is consonant with the \ngeneral interest is to create international conditions for the real and not just the apparent overcoming of economic underdevelopment. An essential facet of the joint efforts we should undertake along these lines is the narrowing of the technological gap- not only by transferring technology from north to south but also by establishing an inter-national structure which will facilitate the production by developing countries of the technology they need.\n30.\tAn awareness of these new needs is, happily enough, being spread. There are those who think, however, that obsolescence of States will be the inevitable counterpart of the general process of interdependence. I do not think so. World economic integration cannot dispense with the role of States, which, far from being mere cartographic facts, reflect ineradicable political realities. On the contrary, for interdependence to continue on its course with a minimum of attrition and as a rational, consensual and harmonious process, it can only be based on the independence of States and on the gradual elimination of the economic disparities between them.\n31.\tI have attempted to show, that disequilibrium and disparities are not limited to the socio-economic field but also permeate the sphere of multilateral political negotiations. These disparities will remain as long as there is an unyielding conflict between development and under-development, as long as the transition from the latter to the former economic stage is obstructed by external factors, as long as here and in other forums impasses continue to impede operative understandings for the removal of inter-national obstacles to development.\n32.\tIt is in this context that the United Nations must do' more than simply reflect international reality; in fulfillment of the functions conferred upon it by the Charter, the United Nations must discharge a positive role in changing the present international structure. In spite of all the difficulties, Brazil still cherishes the hope that we can carry out this task by taking the path of comprehension and understanding among States, understanding and comprehension based on sovereign equality, on equity and mutual respect.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to express the congratulations of our delegation on the keen perception with which the General Assembly has chosen Mr. Amerasinghe to preside over this session containing in its agenda issues for study and decision of great importance to States Members of die United Nations. We are certain that his privileged experience and his wisdom will facilitate the achievement of our common purpose in the search for just solutions as well as in the results of our deliberations. Let us then hope that, guided by the values he represents, we will be able to say at the end of our work that at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly considerable progress has been made and that we have been able to clear up the unknown factors that have held back progress toward a new policy of understanding and effective decision-making in the difficult task of fulfilling the mandate imposed by the expectations of our times under the Charter of our world Organization.\n126.\tI wish to convey the most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the brilliant manner, the goodwill and competence with which he presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n127.\t1 also wish to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the effective and vigorous work of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has so faithfully served the principles of the Organization.\n \n128.\tThe delegation of the Dominican Republic is pleased to offer its congratulations also to the Republic of Seychelles for having been admitted as a Member of the United Nations. These congratulations on behalf of my Government and of the people of the Dominican Republic are addressed to the Government of the people of the young Republic of Seychelles as well as to its delegation, with which we have the honor to participate in this General Assembly.\n129.\tWe are here at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly of this important body at a time when the economy of developing countries such as ours are facing difficult situations which must find a prompt and happy situation. At the same time, however, we are strengthened by the ideals which inspired the founder of the Republic, Juan Pablo Duarte, known among .us as the \\\"Christ of Freedom\\\"-whom all Dominicans honor this year in just tribute on the centenary of his death whose selfless life was passionately and completely devoted to the emergence of a new nation in the American continent under the protection of God, the fatherland and liberty.\n130.\tWhile we realize that all items to be discussed at this session are of great importance, we cannot forget the needs we are faced with, and speaking on behalf of my country I wish to mention in particular that we shall raise the problem of the sugar market with its falling prices as well as other points which have been causing a deterioration in the peaceful coexistence of nations and our very existence as States. That is why we are going to limit our considerations to those matters.\n131.\tThe idea of a collective security system has always been present in the United Nations. On the other hand it is not too bold to think that it has never been more justified to see to it that its Member States favor having a practical instrument, an instrument which may prove effective in preserving peace and proscribing the scourge of war so as to imbue the Charter with more vigor in that field.\n132.\tWe know very well that there are innumerable obstacles to the emergence of such a mechanism because of the differences and the controversies which produce stagnation and which create a climate adverse to reconciling conflicting interests-interests which instead of diminishing have multiplied in the last 10 years.\n133.\tThe problem, as complex as it may be, must be viewed in the light of other criteria. Among them that of the international economy is essential.\n134.\tActually there are also reasons to consider it necessary to recognize that collective security is not possible without economic security. Both causes produce the same effects: economic insecurity drives peoples to collective insecurity. Thus, if the former could be attained through a process similar to an effective moratorium on the tensions produced by harsh disputes and conflicts it would be possible for peace not to be precarious, which it has been for many years, and to reduce coercion and threat which were the agents determining the instability affecting the principles embodied in the Charter of our Organization. \n135.\tThese thoughts lead the delegation of the Dominican Republic to mention the importance which my country attaches to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], which should not be left or considered a simple expression of purposes which have remained inoperative as so many others or which have been neglected despite the causes which led to it.\n136.\tA review of the disturbances caused in the territories of States Members of the United Nations shows that violence in its most inhuman forms has not diminished but has rather increased and intensified considerably. We cannot deny that those facts have negative international implications such as the hijacking of aircraft, a subject which involves States with all the characteristics we know.\n137.\tSeizing hostages is no doubt one of the most odious forms of violent coercion. Now this practice has spread to the Americas, where it has created threats to public order in the form of kidnappings which defy authority to obtain the objectives pursued, disregarding the fact that the victims are actually innocent persons-and this makes these deeds barbarian crimes.\n138.\tIn this danger zone of crime in the international arena we must admit that the instruments available to us so far have been ineffective to prevent or punish violations which are contrary to moral and cultural progress, in contrast to the technology which is leading us to ever deeper penetration of outer space.\n139.\tThe General Assembly in previous years has been concerned with this serious situation, and the statements made on those occasions were so conservative that we could say today that they have been largely the cause of the evil we are now facing without any apparent remedy.\n140.\tThe frequency with which this type of violence occurs nil over the world makes a more thorough review necessary in order to find new, more effective instruments to check the proliferation of terrorism, hijacking and kidnapping, in all its forms, so that this evil may be halted before this covert method of warfare unleashes an international conflict which could lead to a new war.\n141.\tIt would not be an exaggeration to give priority to the idea of a preventive and corrective mechanism for this purpose, which has already been studied by the General Assembly. Preventive action may consist in the formula which is applicable to other cases similar to the ones we have mentioned. We think that time has come to consider terrorism to be an offense under ordinary law, taking into account not merely the motive, but the dreadful nature of the crime and the fact that its victims are innocent people. This would also provide the necessary means for the prevention and punishment of hijacking of aircraft, the holding of hostages etc. These specific offenses must be regarded as crimes against mankind, with all the legal consequences.\n142.\tThe Dominican Republic has attached special importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and within its possibilities has lent its decided co-operation toward the adoption of a draft convention that would be viable and effective.\n \n143.\tWe understand that such a task is very difficult given the opposing interests in the world today. At the same time we are largely elaborating a new law of die sea which covers greater areas than the land masses. It is obvious, on the other hand, that many of the provisions which have been proposed compel us to abandon centuries-old practices-a matter which frequently requires uncommon decisiveness and firmness. However, the reasons leading States to find a new regime for the seas are so clear and convincing-now that we must speak no longer of a mare liberum, but rather of the common heritage of mankind that we must yield to the requirements of our time before it is too late.\n144.\tThis is a challenge which we cannot neglect, since the world is beset by prospects of food scarcity in particular, and the wealth of the sea is important for survival and human progress. No one can ignore the situation, which is linked, so to speak, to a fixed time-table. The realities have placed us in a \\\"state of siege.\\\"\n145.\tWe have been disappointed to see that on many of the subjects involved in the law of the sea not only have opposite positions been taken and this has disturbed recent meetings on the subject-but they have also made impossible the adoption of agreed formulas and have delayed the possibility of agreeing on a convention that can be adopted on time, bearing in mind the urgent need to exploit the resources of the sea, while we move towards the year 2000.\n146.\tThe reference to food shortages and malnutrition leads us to the resolution of the World Food Conference,  which is of great topical importance for the problem of hunger. It is difficult to conceive that despite the importance of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the oil-producing countries have not contributed to that mechanism for the mobilization of agriculture, at the levels required by the urgency of that program, the implementation of which would alleviate the demand for food in critical areas and reduce the devastation brought about by malnutrition.\n147.\tIt is clear that this problem is becoming more acute and spreading everywhere, and it is that continuous projection which remains a question to which no reply has so far been forthcoming on the basis of population growth forecasts and other statistics endorsed by competent organizations.\n148.\tThe Dominican Republic shares the concern over the need to make use of all available resources for agricultural production with a view to attaining the maximum possible level, i.e., the need to act now with a view to preventing the ills that are threatening future generations. That is why the Government headed by His Excellency President Joaquin Balaguer, not only maintains a vigorous agricultural policy but has also been gradually changing the land-holding regime so as to open up more opportunities in agriculture and in all other fields of production including mining-an unprecedented change. The system which has been established for agrarian reform includes recovering State lands and gradually acquiring large tracts of arable land to be turned over to the farmers. These standards constitute a true bloodless revolution, the results of which will be found in the total economic development of the country through the use of all its natural resources.\n149.\tOur delegation wishes to make special mention of the sessions of UNCTAD through which developing countries expect to receive the means which will vigorously com tribute to trade and development. This recognition leads us to hope for the best results from a world economic survey as well as an analysis of the prospects for the second half with regard to means to speed up the transfer of real resources to developing countries on a secure, foreseeable and permanent basis.\n150.\tWe share the idea that the time has come to introduce reforms into the Charter of the Organization. We understand that instruments relating to world order must be revised from time to time in the light of experience. Also, and for the same reason relating to changes in the life of nations, new forecasts made mandatory by the facts of international life must be incorporated into the ordering of the objectives brought about by the constitution of our system.\n151.\tWe must admit that some of the difficulties we are faced with are the result of some existing principles or of the lack of others; we must admit that these abnormalities should be largely attributed to the States themselves owing to the alternatives of international politics or to the fact that States do not subject themselves to existing principles.\n152.\tThere is very little marble that has no imperfections, says the dictum, and we can therefore say that no human endeavor is perfect. Hence we can state that if the United Nations is imperfect the same applies to the States that constitute it. There is therefore no reason for despair.\n153.\tThat being understood, it follows that the task we have before us requires the firm will to make the Charter more effective and worthy of respect so that it will always condition the objectives for which it was established on the basis of the experience of total war, whose consequences still to some extent weigh on our present civilization.\n154.\tThere is a new manifestation of discrimination no less detrimental to mankind than those which involve the economy of States. Economic discrimination leads to distrust and to fear in the States which are affected. This risks bringing about controversies and may disturb peace placing in jeopardy the basic objectives of the Charter of the Organization.\n155.\tThere is the risk of having a type of economic totalitarianism which would upset the international balance. It distorts the economy and applies great but unforeseeable pressures-even a kind of slavery-on the peoples directly affected. That evil should disappear since we are convinced that today the idea of domination is being replaced by that of the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\".\n156.\tIn addition to the realities which lead us to recognize that we are still suffering from a crisis in a law, we have the crisis in international co-operation, which may be in a covert form, and, furthermore, impedes the necessary assistance among States under the essential principle of universality for the world Organization.\n157.\tIt seems that the oil crisis engendered by inflation in development centers is becoming a regressive phenomenon with inevitable characteristics, and it is occurring precisely at a time when the forecast is that the problems of population growth, unemployment and malnutrition will have doubled by the end of this century, while on the other hand production will not suffice to meet the demand for food and alleviate the tragedy of hunger. Hunger is the war that can unleash war.\n158. We should therefore like to offer statements of the greatest importance for our delegation. We refer to the problem of the sugar markets whose ups and downs since 1974 have been of extraordinary importance for the economy of many exporting countries, our own among them.\n159.\tThe history of the efforts made in order to stabilize basic commodities would take too long even to summarize. On the other hand, it is well known by all, and therefore we need not recount what has occurred hitherto. Rather, we would like to start from now and to look for solutions that are positive, just and mutually advantageous for exporting countries as well as for importers. The former wish to have security with regard to surplus supplies and their consequential depressing effect on prices. The latter need protection from scarcity and violently inflationary prices. Consequently it would seem that the obstacles to a harmonious marketing of many raw materials and sugar is a case in point-depend on hew the parties interpret that is just and reasonable, and we must admit that it is not easy to attain unanimity on definitions. It is, however, a challenge, and the best opportunity available to mankind today to take the initiative on a subject as vital as international commodity agreements, if we wish to attain positive facts free from that endless rhetoric to which we are used, is international co-operation which is meaningful to producers, consumers, exporters and importers.\n160.\tOne of those agreements can be envisaged. UNCTAD has already set in motion the convening of an International Sugar Conference for April 1977. There are many documents ready for the preparatory work and experts have examined in detail the possibilities of laying down the basis to eliminate from the resulting convention the concept of \\\"exploiters and exploited,\\\" which would be frustrating for all parties.\n161.\tFirst of all we think it essential to maintain a certain relationship between production costs and prices in the light of the results obtained by the efficient producers. In this regard we should point out that production costs, for totally extraneous reasons which have nothing to do with the recognized efficiency of some producers, have-as is the case of our country-increased for entirely extraneous reasons. It is a fact that, due to the influence of the higher oil prices and the inflationary trends prevailing all over the world, the cost of the input essential to produce sugar and other consumer goods has risen astronomically. In a document presented some months ago to the International Sugar Organization there is a comparison, as an example, \nbetween the costs of these goods in 1972 and the costs in 1975. For example, fertilizers in some instances went up from $76 to $346 per metric ton-46 per cent in the case of urea-and in others from $80 to $312. The price of super phosphate tripled. Herbicides, according to the same chart, have generally doubled in price, and the same can be said of some equipment. Oil f.o.b. the Persian Gulf increased from $15 to $77. These are figures taken at random but they are quite representative for our purposes here.\n162.\tIt is thus obvious that maintaining price levels for sugar and other export commodities similar to those prevailing at the beginning of this decade would be, and they are indeed right now, simply ruinous to the countries whose national income and whose balance-of-payments depends substantially on them. It is in the light of this situation fraught with serious consequences for the development and the well-being of the less developed nations that we must in a broad spirit of international solidarity focus on the search for a solution which can and must be found within the framework of the negotiations towards a new International Sugar Agreement. However, pending the adoption of a new international instrument on this subject we must adopt measures which would henceforth prevent a greater disruption in the international prices of sugar.\n163.\tInestimable and adverse consequences arise when world sugar production and consumption, according to the best estimates available, barely amount the 90 million short tons without any great surpluses to depress prices. We car safely say that in the present world situation, where there are such pressing needs, to speak of a sugar surplus is most erroneous.\n164.\tThat is why we are faced with a situation which we thought had been superseded and would not be repeated, since we believed that market forces would moderate the traditional sharp rises and drops which have frequently curbed the expansion and prosperity of one of the most strategic industries in the agricultural sector in this century. Furthermore, we thought that sugar cane production was no longer one more raw material widely marketed throughout the world. That concept has been superseded owing to the production of valuable by-products obtained in the industrialization process.\n165.\tThe many applications of sugar cane by-products in modern industry, which lacks essential raw materials, made it impossible to think that an asset of that magnitude would not with a full expansion of the world economy respond to the real demands for all these goods. However, since the real forces of the market have not taken over, the industries of many exporting countries are being forced into bankruptcy, since, because of declining prices, they will have to cut back production acreage, not process existing crops, close down their factories and declare bankruptcy. However, after the contraction has been fully felt, after marginal producers have been eliminated, and after the supply of what appears to be surpluses has been reduced, prices will again rise, consumer countries will be increasingly concerned and will lift import restrictions, encourage the use of sweeteners, offer incentives to domestic production and resort to marketing mechanisms to depress prices.\n \n166.\tIt is shameful that in this century we, producers and consumers alike, are so incapable of preventing this game from playing itself out in front of everyone without taking into account that not only the interests of poor countries are included but also the very sustenance of thousands of workers, their economic and political stability and above all the supply of food-stuffs for human consumption.\n167.\tOur delegation sincerely believes in the goodwill of countries represented here to co-ordinate their interests at this crucial moment in the history of mankind. In this regard we think it pertinent to express in general lines the position of the Dominican Republic on this very important matter, for the destiny of our countries and in general for the world in which we have to live.\n168.\tIn the annual report submitted to the National Assembly on 27 February 1975 the President of the Republic, Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, defined the position of our country with regard to the meeting which was to be held in Puerto Plata by the group of sugar-exporting countries of Latin America and the Caribbean as follows and I quote:\n\u201cIn effect, in the same manner in which the increase in the price of oil and its derivatives disrupted even the economy of industrialized nations, an excessive hike in our export products, such as sugar or coffee, could wreak havoc on the economy of countries which may be forced to acquire those products on extremely hard terms.\n\u201cThe best contribution that could be made by the Latin American countries which export their raw materials to the highly industrialized countries of the area would be not to aggravate, through a disproportionate increase in their raw materials, the crisis brought about by the rise in the prices of oil and its derivatives. It would be preferable for consumer and producer countries alike to reach an agreement establishing fair prices for sugar, coffee, cocoa, etc. These new prices must be set at levels which allow developing countries to pay the high price brought today by the fuel needed to run their economy, and which enable consumer countries to obtain Latin American raw materials at prices which are acceptable and equitable for both parties.\\\"\nThis position has been repeatedly maintained by the Government of the Dominican Republic on all those occasions in which we have participated in the efforts of the international community to pursue objectives of justice and equity in economic relations among States and will be maintained in all meetings where we participate. For that reason we shall defend our position in the new agreement, not in terms of a confrontation between opposing interests but as forms of co-operation among nations large or small, rich or poor, to attain objectives of human solidarity which may gradually erase the social and economic contradictions which, rather than diminishing have been deepening in recent years.\n169.\tThese thoughts are confirmed in the facts which have prevailed in our. economic activity. It would be sufficient to mention that while we are forced to import at extremely high costs everything that our expanding economies require to increase the income levels of the population, we are forced to sell in the international markets some of our main products-for example, sugar at prices such as those prevailing now at approximately eight cents per pound f.o.b. for immediate delivery which makes us a victim in the markets of those commodities.\n170.\tTo understand our situation, suffice it to say that at these prices the production of crude sugar of the Dominican Republic, which is more than 7 million short tons for export, would hardly cover the cost of oil imports for 1976, which are estimated at $175 million.\n171.\tIn view of those circumstances we wonder what a country like the Dominican Republic can do, a country which is not an economic or military Power, which does not have vast energy resources but which is striving to diversify its production, which is making efforts to capitalize its savings, to expand its infrastructure, to introduce technology into agriculture, to multiply its industries, to expand its technological and scientific base, in a word, to develop its economy to the greatest extent possible. Simple as it may seem in countries which have been traditionally in similar situations, the way out points to the need to resort to international financing or to appeal for a debt renegotiation. Nevertheless we have started measures of austerity to combat the crisis internally by adjusting our budgetary expenditures, by limiting superfluous expenses and by establishing a system to restrict the use of foreign currency resources.\n172.\tAll those measures, however, would seem inoperative given the problems of the external sector of our economics and, in order not to appear to exaggerate and since facts offer eloquent grounds, let us examine the experience of Latin America in the last few years and the forecasts prepared by the Organization of American States for the external sector of the region. It is mentioned in the report of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council that the unfavorable balance of non-financial goods and services of countries which did not export oil rose in 1975 to $8 billion. If to this we add payments to service the external debt, the needs of external financing resources amounted to some $15 billion. For 1976 it is estimated that the probable flows of funds from multilateral and bilateral sources of official development assistance plus support to the balance of payments would hardly exceed $4 billion. Assuming that reserves are used in the amount of $2 billion, the debt to be financed through non-favored financing would be approximately $9.5 billion.\n173.\tIt is obvious, therefore, that the basic problem of our economies continues to be the bottle-neck in the external sector and the sugar-cane exporters of the region have been hit by the plummeting prices on the world market. It is urgent to reorder the international economy and to that end undertake decisive, bold and broader efforts in the field of multinational co-operation. That is why we reiterate once again to States Members of the United Nations that, in compliance with the provisions of the Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States the most important provisions concerning situations such as that affecting the sugar sector should be implemented.\n174.\tTo mention only one example, if we look at our experience with the sugar market of the United States, a market which- we have traditionally supplied in a steady manner, we realize that we have not operated under terms of trade based on the advantages which should be offered to a supply source only a few miles from its coasts. For over half a century the Dominican Republic fought to have a considerable export quota in that market; when the quota system was changed under the Sugar Act of the United States in order to cover the deficit in the domestic market of that country we were given a substantial quota for the first time. Unfortunately, however, that mechanism which for our country meant stability in its sales and prices came to an end in 1974 when that law expired. From then on we went back to our traditional position as a net producer and exporter without guaranteed quotas and whose production of more than 1 million metric tons in 1975 accounted for 65 per cent of our foreign exchange export earnings, 48 per cent of employment in the industrial sector and 20 per cent of gross national product.\n175.\tFurthermore, we wish to emphasize the fact that, while we respect the decisions adopted by countries in defense of the interests of their nationals, that principle of self-determination in the economic field must stop where it infringes the legitimate rights of other nations and when those protectionist measures tend to create artificial conditions which encourage specific producers and displace the efficient and competent suppliers of developing countries.\n176.\tIn order that a new international sugar agreement should be a truly effective instrument aimed at stabilizing the market to benefit exporters as well as importers, it should be more than a mere restriction of production whose effects fall most heavily on exporting countries with the passive participation of importers. This means that to regulate the market it cannot rely on quota schemes adjusted to pre-established patterns of trade which are usually artificial or discriminatory. Although we cannot do without quota arrangements, these should not be the only mechanism to maintain the stability of prices. The important role of stocks in any new agreement so that the instrument could function effectively in times of scarcity as well as in times of over-abundance of sugar has been recognized. But it has also been said that buffer stocks give rise to serious difficulties of financing, administration and operation in the case of a product like sugar because of the special physical characteristics of this commodity, and it is in this regard that we need true solidarity and a spirit of co-operation among the parties.\n177.\tThe importing countries, which include most of the larger economic Powers, should forget the traditional scheme of horizontal arrangements according to which all participants are to share in the obligations and sacrifices as if they were on an economically equal footing. The new spirit in international relations should prevail a spirit which recognizes economic, technological and cultural inequalities or differences among various countries and the different needs which these inequalities imply for the various categories of countries.\n178.\tIt is also our hope that the new agreement will include the largest possible number of participants, including the large highly-industrialized producers and consumers such as the European Economic Community and the United States of America, which have remained outside the most recent multilateral arrangements of that type. Our \nwish to have them associated to this new effort of international cooperation is based not only on the recognition of the important contribution which both economic Powers could make to the greater effectiveness of the new instrument but also on the benefits that would result from the adherence of the European Economic Community to the provisions of the instruments and therefore its participation in the sugar market in a way which would be less harmful to less developed countries than the practice of subsidized sales, and from the maintenance by the United States of access to its domestic market without tariff barriers, which hinder the fair competition of foreign suppliers.\n179.\tWe have briefly presented the tragedy which sugar poses for producing and exporting countries from the point of view of the delegation of the Dominican Republic. We believe that our position coincides with that of all agricultural raw material-exporting countries and we express broad support and sympathy for them in our statements. That is why at this session we intend to reach a consensus for adopting international emergency measures to rescue the sugar industry' of traditionally exporting countries from their present situation.\n180.\tIn conclusion we appeal to the commonsense of Member States and to the solidarity which should prevail among peoples to design with justice and sincerity, in the light of our needs, strategies needed to give a final thrust to the harmonious development of our peoples.\n181.\tWe must emphasize the serious responsibility which this world Organization would bear were it to remain inactive in the phase of the tragic situation of sugar affecting exporting countries which basically depend on that product for drawing up their development strategy.\n182.\tOnly our faith in international co-operation which we have resolutely supported and encouraged continuously to retain a cohesive structural base and the open, frank dialog through which the solution to common problems is attained lead us to think that there will be adopted short- and medium-term measures which would contribute to maintaining more just and worthy relations between highly developed countries, countries which emerged sheltered by the sacrifice of those which today seek their full development.\n"

        "file_text": "The election of Ambassador Amerasinghe to the presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly is symbolic in many ways. In addition to being a fitting recognition of his personal qualities as a diplomat who has attained the stature of a statesman, coming as it does after the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held recently in his beautiful country, his election is a tribute to Sri Lanka's contribution to the cause of the United Nations and heralds the new role non-aligned countries are determined to play in international affairs.\n80.\tTo the outgoing President of the Assembly who, despite his responsibility as head of his country's Government, devoted much of his time and effort to the work of the United Nations, I extend the gratitude of my delegation.\n81.\tThe job of the Secretary-General is not only, as it is often described, an impossible one, but very often may be a thankless task as well. The nature of the office limits what a Secretary-General can say to set the record straight Or even to defend himself when unfairly attacked. Courageously and resolutely, Mr. Kurt Waldheim has used the mandate and the authority of his office in defence of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The present Secretary- General will always be remembered for his forthright and forceful stand on the issues of colonialism and racism in southern Africa when it counted most,\n82.\tWe welcome Seychelles to membership in the United Nations and are looking forward to working very closely with its delegation.\n83.\tThe death of Chairman Mao has deprived revolutionary peoples everywhere of a great teacher and leader. My Government has expressed to the Government and people of China at the highest level the sense of loss and grief the Ethiopian people feels. On behalf of my delegation, I reiterate those sentiments.\n84.\tThe increase of the membership of the United Nations from 51 States to 145 reflects the transformation the world Organization has undergone in the last 30 years. Although this change is readily recognized by all, its full implications are not fully appreciated. Most of the problems in international life today can be traced to the failure of the international community to recognize and accommodate the changes that have taken place since the Second World War. The prospect of peace and orderly international life will also depend on the capacity of the international community as embodied by the United Nations to respond in timely fashion to much-needed change in the future.\n85.\tWhen the United Nations was founded 30 years ago, virtually all of Africa and Asia was under colonial domination. Socialism, although firmly established by then in one country, was very much a force of the future. The co-operation among the big Powers which the prosecution of the war against fascism required was counted upon to provide the basis for a new collective security founded upon big-Power unanimity in the Security Council.\n86.\tNo sooner had the war against fascism ended than the peoples of Asia and Africa rose up against the colonial order. The old contradictions between socialism and capitalism, muted temporarily during the war period, reappeared and, with them, the hope for international security predicated on big-Power unanimity receded.\n87.\tFor the greater part of the post-war period, the United Nations became the arena for a trial of strength rather than a forum for a constructive accommodation of the inevitable changes that followed. Rendered ineffective by the failure to recognize for the United Nations a central role in international affairs, most of the revolutionary changes that took place in the world not only bypassed the Organization but, propelled by historical forces, proceeded despite the United Nations.\n88.\tFor almost two decades the United Nations remained a spectator when the great anti-colonial struggle unfolded. In Indonesia, South-East Asia and North Africa, the United Nations could not avert bloodshed before the peoples of those regions won their independence. In other areas, the United Nations played little more than a marginal role in their decolonization.\n89.\tAlthough a nuclear holocaust and big-Power confrontation may have been averted in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, hostilities have occurred all too often to cast doubt on the efficacy of the United Nations as a guardian of the peace. Hardly any significant agreement has been achieved involving a reduction of existing stocks of armaments. All the lamentations about disarmament have only resulted in limited agreements on arms control and have not placed any significant constraint on the frightful accumulation of conventional and thermonuclear weapons, or on their increasing sophistication.\n90.\tFor a long time, discussions in the United Nations on international co-operation for economic development have focused on the symptoms rather than on the underlying causes. Almost no attention has been given, until very recently, to the need to restructure the international economic order and to redistribute equitably the world's economic surpluses.\n91.\tAll in all, the record of the United Nations performance shows, in the main, a great many lost opportunities. The immediate future will therefore depend on what the international community can do to utilize for constructive ends the remaining opportunities before time runs out on it. Over the long haul, however, the balance hangs on the capacity of the world community to perceive the requirements for change and on its flexibility for accommodation.\n92.\tAs we enter the fourth decade of the United Nations, we should recognize that even while we are calling for a new world order based on new patterns of relationships, the fact remains that the Powers that be have not accepted for what they are the changes that have taken {dace. There is need, therefore, to show where there is a refusal to accept change, for a world that has dosed its eyes to an accommodation of the changes that have occurred despite the United Nations cannot now be expected to bring about the far-reaching restructuring of international relationships that a more secure and prosperous world requires.\n93.\tWhere does this impasse lie?\n94.\tFirst and foremost, there seems to be less than full appreciation of the fact that, with the independence of several Asian and African colonial Territories and their admission to the United Nations, the alignment and the equation of forces in international relations have changed. The majority of the present membership of the United Nations is made up today of countries which had attained independence in the last 15 years. Likewise, the number of Member States with a socialist system has increased. Some of the older Members have themselves undergone internal metamorphosis and are today either under revolutionary or nationalistic leaderships which reflect and articulate the will of their people.\n95.\tThe outcome of all these transformations has been to push to the foreground the problems which the third-world countries face, particularly in their relations with the established order-colonialism; the strengthening of independence and sovereignty, especially over the use and disposition of natural resources; the struggle for a new order based on mutual respect for sovereignty and restraint from interference; and a call for new terms of trade and economic relationships. On all these problems, the newly independent countries are articulating demands which confront deeply entrenched vested interests and old ways of doing things.\n96.\tIn the United Nations, the resistance to accept these new forces is reflected in the contemptuous disregard by the Powers that be of resolutions of the General Assembly adopted with the overwhelming support of the membership as the diktat of an irresponsible and mechanical majority.\n\n97.\tIn the same manner m those emerging forces have been excluded from the management of the economic and financial affairs of an increasingly interdependent world in which the decision of a few rich and powerful countries has immediate, and often times deleterious, consequences on the well-being of the great majority, the notion has been advanced that voting in the General Assembly of the United Nations should be based on some weighted system reflecting the economic and military power of each Member State. Only then, it is suggested, the tyranny of the majority can- be broken. Only then, it is said, can there be an orderly management of world affairs. Nothing is said, of course, of the mechanical majorities of yesteryears which trumpeted as the genuine expressions of the will of the peoples of the world, nor of the fact that what is being prescribed now is the legitimization of the tyranny of the minority.\n98.\tNot content with the monopoly of power which they enjoy, the surrogates of the established order are being more than myopic in suggesting that, in order to cope with the demands of the new forces, their own power in the General Assembly should be further enhanced. The present international security system, which has placed arbitrary power in the hands of a few countries, has prevented the resources of the international community from being employed in favor of the liberation of colonial peoples, to combat racism and to liquidate the consequences of aggression. Instead, it has been used mainly to preserve the status quo.\n99.\tDenying financial contributions to programs of the United Nations supported by the great majority of Members is yet another leverage they exert to frustrate the will of the majority.\n100.\tA concrete manifestation of the resistance to change is the actions of certain permanent members in increasingly resorting in the Security Council to the use of the veto to block forceful action when peace is breached or threatened. As a result of the exercise of the veto, the United Nations is held in complete immobility in the face of threats to peace and aggression in southern Africa and the Middle East. Nations of the world have so lost confidence in the security provided by the United Nations that they are now relying more and more on the acquisition of weapons of war.\n101.\tEven more contemptuous is the use of the veto to deprive the peoples of Angola and Viet Nam of their right to membership in the United Nations. Despite the wrath of one permanent member the rest of the world has not only welcomed but rejoiced in their independence as a development that would strengthen the struggle against colonialism and imperialism everywhere. The peoples of Angola and Viet Nam have an inalienable right to their rightful places in the United Nations. They have strengthened that right by the indomitable struggle they have waged and by the price they have paid dearly in blood, sweat and toil.\n102.\tWe have now reached an impasse where the United Nations has become a platform for a sterile confrontation rather than a.medium for innovative accommodation. The minority, however powerful it may be, should take due account of the will of the majority. There cannot be an orderly accommodation of change, nor can we realize our hopes for a more secure and prosperous world, if the powerful few regard the voice of the peoples of the world as expressed in General Assembly resolutions as irresponsible cries that can be ignored with impunity.\n103.\tThe choice is clear: that the international community either move with the United Nations now in the search for practical and just solutions to the problems of liberation, peace and development, while there is still time and a residue of goodwill, or be bypassed by the swift currents of events as an irrelevant symbol of stillborn hope.\n104.\tThe United Nations does not seem to have very much time-by all prognoses some three years at the most-to seize whatever is left of the abundant opportunities that have been frittered away to solve the problems of southern Africa and the Middle East and to initiate a process towards disarmament and the establishment of a new international order. If we go at the present pace, there will not be very much time. If, on the other hand, we move with deliberate speed and with a keen perception of the alternatives, not only shall we be able to arrest the dissipation of these last remaining opportunities but we may even succeed in turning them back towards fertile ground where they will germinate, send deep roots and multiply.\n105.\tThat is why today we should have a very clear understanding of the inevitable march of forces and events and should adopt a realistic agenda and a time-frame. And it is against this background that my delegation would like to plead for a sense of urgency in all those sensitive matters where the prospect of total liberation and peace hang in the balance.\n106.\tFirst, there is southern Africa. Did it require the slaughter by the brutal police of the apartheid regime of over 500 helpless schoolchildren, the maiming of several hundred and the imprisonment of thousands of black people for the world to begin to realize that an explosive situation was developing? Did the Sharpeville massacre of 1959 not foretell what was to come?\n107. The records of\tare full of the death cries of the people of South Africa. The records also amply show the warnings of African countries and others that the whole situation was evolving towards a dramatic confrontation which could only end in a terrible racial war, the consequences of which would not be confined within the borders of South Africa.\n108,\tWhat has the United Nations done despite the. warnings? With ritual regularity; the General Assembly and its Committees have been issuing edicts expressing their disapproval-now elevated to abhorrence-of the system of apartheid as being incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n109.\tIn the meantime, however, things have been left to go on as they always have. Despite repeated calls for the adoption of sanctions, South Africa's trade with the great industrial Powers of the West has been assisted to flourish. South Africa has been allowed to purchase highly sophisticated weapons of war, which has made its forces, at least on paper, the most powerful in Africa. It has obtained the collaboration of Israel in the development of certain weapon systems. France sells to it nuclear reactors which, whatever the safeguards, whatever the promise sought or received, will enhance South Africa's capability to develop its own nuclear weapons.\n110.\tEmboldened, and encouraged in some instances, by its major economic partners, South Africa is pursuing, in the name of self-determination, the creation of bantustans which would give artificially created black ghettos the appearance of independence, with flags and national anthems and the other symbols of independence, while every precaution will be taken to make these bantustans an integral part of the South African economy by developing them as dependent and defenseless reservoirs of cheap labor.\n111.\tDespite the termination of whatever legal pretense it might have had for administering Namibia on behalf of the international community, South Africa has continued to deny the people their right to self-determination and independence and has frustrated all attempts by the United Nations to assume interim responsibility in order to complete arrangements for the transfer to the people of the powers of government. For over 30 years, since the very first session of the General Assembly, when its request to incorporate Namibia into its territory was rejected, South Africa has engaged in one maneuver after another, in one dilatory tactic after another, often shifting grounds. First, South Africa claimed sovereignty over Namibia by virtue of the right of military conquest. When this position became untenable, South Africa claimed a special right to administer Namibia under the Mandate of the League of Nations, despite the demise of that organization. The International Court of Justice rejected this contention and insisted that South Africa should be fully accountable to the United Nations for its administration of Namibia. \n112.\tWhen South Africa refused to recognize its obligation to be accountable to the international community, the United Nations terminated its Mandate, called for the immediate independence of Namibia within its present frontiers and assumed direct responsibility to arrange for the exercise of self-determination.\n113.\tNow that South Africa is confronted with the immediate spectre of a liberation struggle waged by SWAPO-which would undoubtedly have the effect of galvanizing the revolutionary struggle in its own territory  as a last ditch maneuver to buy time and to stem the inevitable march of independence, it is making preparations to arrange for ;a bogus exercise of self-determination. Hie latest response that South Africa has given to the demand of the Security Council to comply, by 31 August of this year, with all General Assembly and Security Council resolutions to terminate its illegal occupation of Namibia, accept United Nations responsibility and hand over the powers of government to the authentic representatives of the people, in the form of a declaration of a so-called constitutional conference, is but an exercise in evasion.\n114.\tAs in the past, South Africa is now counting on the disposition of the United Nations to give it one more chance to show its good faith by giving the appearance that this latest maneuver represents an honest attempt to meet the requirements of United Nations resolutions. The fact of the matter is, however, that by excluding from the so-called constitutional conference SWAPO, which, through revolutionary struggle, has gained the right to speak and act on behalf of the people of Namibia, South Africa has revealed its true intentions. By leaving in ambiguity the question of Namibia's accession to independence with its present territorial integrity intact, South Africa is giving adequate notice that it wishes to continue to implement its policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\". Even more indicative of South Africa's true design is the fact that at the same time it is talking about constitutional conference it is extending to Namibia the application of its apartheid laws, it is increasingly militarizing the Territory and is developing it as a base of operation against the independence and sovereignty of Zambia and Angola.\n115.\tZimbabwe stands today as a monument to the complete failure of the will and gross negligence by the United Nations of all responsibility. A small group of white racist settlers, numbering some 2S0,000, has been allowed to successfully usurp the responsibility of the United Kingdom to advance the people to independence, to deny to the indigenous inhabitants of Zimbabwe their right to independence, and to defy and frustrate all attempts by the United Nations, including the imposition of mandatory sanctions, to end the rebellion.\n116.\tOnce again, the hand and design of South Africa are visible. South Africa considers Zimbabwe the outer perimeter of its defense and has sent its troops there to bolster the Rhodesian rebel authorities in their brutal attempt to crush the liberation struggle. Even more significant is the fact that, by providing its territory as a corridor of evasion, South Africa, with the co-operation and complicity of others, has successfully frustrated United Nations sanctions.\n117.\tThe picture in southern Africa is now clear. The racist and colonialist forces are strongly anchored in the apartheid regime of South Africa. From that racist bastion they are endeavoring to buy insurance that would protect them against the advance of independence. They want to achieve this by showing aggressive prowess, as evidenced by their brazen attacks on Angola, Zambia and Mozambique, and combining that posture with the appearance of a disposition to negotiate. They also seem to be looking towards their traditional partners for help to bail them out by salvaging the core of the colonialist interest through a commitment to defend the apartheid system.\n118.\tThe questions that inevitably arise are, What are the envisaged negotiations about? What price are the Africans asked to pay?\n119.\tIt should be clear that there cannot be any negotiations in any constitutional conference of any format except for transferring the powers of government to the authentic representatives of the people. That much should be clear and more. No arrangement designed to protect entrenched colonial interests, ostensibly chimed under the label of minority rights, can be acceptable. The independence of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia will have to be unconditional and unencumbered.\n120.\tIn the case of Zimbabwe, where an interim transitional arrangement might be necessary, that will have to be as brief as possible with a very clear definition of what the transition is supposed to achieve. Most important, however, is that even the transitional arrangement will have to be based on majority ride. South Africa has no right to administer Namibia, and it cannot now be asked to be the prime mover for a peaceful solution. Any constitutional conference, any negotiating process for independence will have to be under the aegis of the United Nations, with SWAPO acting as the principal, authentic representative of the people.\n121.\tIn any negotiating effort for the independence of Namibia and Zimbabwe, including the one initiated by the Secretary of State of the United States, Dr. Henry Kissinger, the impression should be avoided that South Africa is allowed to use the independence of those two countries as bargaining chips to obtain Africa's acquiescence in its apartheid system. Even less, South Africa should not be made to feel that it is indeed buying insurance. Let there be no mistake: the struggle against apartheid will continue. With the independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia the struggle will, instead of abating, intensify. The international community should not be deluded into believing that the independence of those two countries will usher in a period of tranquility, brotherhood and peace. The international community should therefore brace itself for the prospect of an intensified struggle, and everything should be done now, while there is time, to avoid a tragic racial conflagration.\n122.\tThe key to avoiding a racial blood-bath is South Africa. As long as 4 million whites continue to deprive 16 million Africans and other non-whites of equality, justice and a role in the government of their country and attempt to herd them into racial ghettos, there cannot be tranquility, there cannot be peace in southern Africa. That is the inevitable outcome and the world has to be prepared for it.\n123.\tThat is why today no plan can hope to advance the prospect of a peaceful solution to the fast-developing racial confrontation unless it also includes the readiness of the international community to impose sanctions against South Africa. There should be tangible proof that the major trading partners of South Africa will move towards sanctions with the rest of the international community. Short, of that, they will have to realize that the continuation of their present policies will countenance and strengthen the grip of the apartheid system.\n124.\tSouth Africa will have to be made aware that, until it removes the apartheid system, it will face economic and political sanctions vigorously enforced by the United Nations.\n125.\tIn Namibia and with regard to the struggle against apartheid, the moment of truth has come: either we move with determination in the direction of mandatory sanctions or, through inaction, increase the chances for a racial blood bath. As I have suggested, we do not have much time. We should be wiser before we are overtaken by developments.\n126.\tI wish briefly to refer to other colonial problems. The Comoros has been dismembered on the way to independence. Its independence cannot be considered complete, nor France's mission to decolonize those islands fulfilled, unless Mayotte is united in independence with the Comoros.\n127.\tEthiopia sincerely hopes that the dispute that has arisen between friendly African countries regarding the exercise of self-determination by^ the people of Western Sahara will be resolved by all the parties concerned. Certain standards will have to be met in the exercise of self-determination when a people under colonial domination advances to independence. With the overriding interest and right of the Saharan people to self-determination taking precedence over other considerations, and in the interest of peace in that region of Africa, every effort should be made to see that the exercise of self-determination will meet the requirements of recognized standards.\n128.\tFrench colonialism in Djibouti is a spent force without much will to linger on. TTie only way it can stay on in one guise or another is by taking advantage of circumstances that outside forces may create for, it. African countries should, therefore, continue their vigilance and should make sure that the call they have especially made to the two neighboring countries of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia, at the last summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity [OAU],  held recently in Mauritius, should be completely adhered to and implemented. That call consists of a request that Ethiopia and Somalia should renounce any and all territorial claims to Djibouti and that they give an undertaking to respect the independence and territorial integrity of Djibouti after its accession to independence.\n129.\tEthiopia, on its part, has made an unequivocal declaration at the highest possible level and reaffirmed several times that it does not have any territorial claim to the whole or any part of Djibouti!\n130.\tAs a further demonstration of its good faith and as a contribution to. the acceleration of the independence of the Territory, and in the interest of peace and stability in the region, Ethiopia submitted at the last African summit meeting a declaration to be jointly subscribed to by. Ethiopia and Somalia that would commit the two countries to renounce any territorial claim they may have and to respect the independence and the territorial integrity of an independent Djibouti!\n131.\tThe only response from the other neighbor of Djibouti to the call of OAU was to say, without ever renouncing its territorial claim, that it is prepared to accept the exercise of self-determination and the liberation of the Territory. Such a declaration from that neighboring State is in keeping with its often repeated policy because it considers Djibouti as being already part of its national territory which is now \\\"under foreign occupation\\\".\n132.\tSomalia has rejected the declaration we proposed to be signed under the authority of OAU on the flimsy ground that a solemn pledge by the two neighboring States to respect the territorial integrity of an independent Djibouti would impose a limitation on the sovereignty of the new State, and would also create a right for the two States which they might use to intervene in Djibouti's internal affairs. Nothing could be further from the objective our declaration seeks to achieve than this interpretation. Indeed, instead of creating a right, our declaration, on the contrary, preempts any and all claims to rights in Djibouti, such as a territorial right, which might be used as a pretext for intervention. The analogy with the Cyprus case, often used by Somalia, in addition to being inaccurate, is deliberately advanced to mislead and to confuse the issue.\n133.\tOAU has asked France to make immediate arrangements to transfer the powers of government to the people. OAU has also called for a conference cf all political parties and groups as well as of liberation movements to be held in Accra, Ghana, under its auspices, with a view to creating a transitional government of national unity to complete the final preparation which would pave the way for the independence of the Territory. There is now in the Territory only a coalition government of two political groups. The base of the transitional government has to be expanded in accordance with the demands of OAU.\n134.\tWe hope that this thirty-first session of the General Assembly will discuss the independence of Djibouti and will strengthen the actions recommended by OAU by giving them its support.\n135.\tThe Middle East is one of those problem areas where, the longer we wait, the more intractable a peaceful solution becomes. After so many missed opportunities, time now seems to have imposed a limit on a peaceful solution. Although we may disagree on the time-frame, there is no doubt that, it is not one that can allow us indulgently to proceed at the present pace.\n136.\tThe requirements for a peaceful solution are known and have often been repeated here and in other international forums. Israel must withdraw from all Arab territories that it has occupied since June 1967. Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a national homeland. The Palestinian Liberation Organization must take part in all negotiations for peaceful settlements.\n137.\tOnce those requirements are accepted, talks and negotiations In one format or another can proceed with a view to implementing the principles of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\n138.\tUnless some visible progress is made soon towards peace, the opportunities that have led to agreements on the disengagement of forces, will be lost irretrievably.\n139.\tI said earlier that a world that refuses to accommodate changes that have taken place will be hard put to bring about those far-reaching transformations in the relations of States, especially between the rich and the poor, the exploited and the exploiter, the weak and the powerful. Thus, the urgency to solve some of the outstanding problems, in addition to ensuring international peace and security, is directly linked with the effort to create a more secure and prosperous world.\n140.\tThere are three major areas of international concern which call for a profound change of attitude, accommodation of interests and a determination to avoid conflicts by anticipating the potential sources of such conflicts and removing them, while there is time. These are disarmament, \nthe law of the sea and the ^creation of a new economic order.\n141.\tThe nations of the world are now spending over $300 billion for armaments. Almost 70 per cent of this huge sum is accounted for by the investment of a few countries. Arms sales have also grown enormously, increasing from about $6 billion five years ago to about $39 billion in 1975.\n142.\tAs a result of the spread of nuclear technology, the number of countries which may be considered as having nuclear weapons capability has now increased to 35.\n143.\tSome notable achievements in the arms control field were made in the 1960s. These modest achievements for a moment had even led to some optimism that the momentum of the arms race might be arrested in the 1970s. But this optimism has now been replaced by a foreboding pessimism as a result of lack of progress in the last few years.\n144.\tIn the second half of the Disarmament Decade, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD) has almost nothing to report by way of progress in disarmament negotiations. And this has happened despite the fact that the General Assembly has repeatedly requested CCD to give highest priority to a host of disarmament measures, including, for example, the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban agreement and the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons as well as new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons.\n145.\tMy delegation feels that there is need to inject a sense of urgency in disarmament talks and to generate some momentum. A special session of the General Assembly devoted to the consideration .of all the outstanding problems of disarmament, as recommended by the recent\nnon-aligned summit meeting,  might achieve this purpose.\n146.\tThe oceans and the seas cover more than two-thirds of our planet. Even when we find it difficult to establish the rule of law to govern the relations of States on the inhabited part of the globe, we have to think of how to regulate State interests and inter-State relations over and beneath the Wide expanses of Water, which modern technology has brought 'within reach of utilization for man's benefit.\n\n147.\tThe attempt to create a regime of law on the utilization of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed is one of the most challenging tasks ever undertaken by the United Nations. It is challenging because it is one of the rare moments in history when the nations of the world have seen well in advance that their collective interests would be better served if they placed limits on their rights and behavior and if they planned and worked together for the utilization of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed for the benefit of all.\n148.\tThis endeavor to create an acceptable regime for the sea is in a race against the disposition of each State, especially where the possibility and the technology exist, to stake out unilateral claims which, unless arrested, would narrow the margin for co-operation.\n149.\tThere is thus need to put the lid of moratorium on unilateral claims and to accelerate progress towards agreement.\n150.\tThe prevailing patterns of relationships, especially between third-world countries and the developed and industrialized countries of the West, are characterized by basic inequalities. Some aspects of these relationships are in some measure a carry-over of colonial ties, while others are affected by attitudes which accept those relations as normal and, on the whole, as mutually beneficial.\n151.\tRelations between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" have long suffered from outlooks that tended to rationalize the preservation of vested interests and historically accumulated advantages. In the name of free trade, the developing countries were asked to abandon policies which would help them assert control over their natural resources as well as assure them a more equitable revenue from their exports, while at the same time the industrialized countries denied to the exports of the developing countries unencumbered access to their markets. It was claimed that international trade would expand with proportionate benefits accruing to all the nations of the world if they were to maximize the production of those commodities for which they may have unique advantages. However, this argument conveniently ignored the fact that, for historical reasons, the balance of advantages, particularly in the field of industrialization, was lopsidedly in favor of the developed countries.\n152.\tSimilarly, discussion of development problems in and outside the United Nations was constrained by limited vision. Most of the talks focused on resource transfers from the developed to the developing countries. Until very recently, little or nothing was heard about the need to do away with built-in inequalities in international economic relationships, with economic advantages preserved through monopolistic practices, exclusive access to technology and, in some instances, to the resources and markets of developing countries.\n153.\tIn order to show how these built-in inequities distort the distribution of world economic surpluses, let us take the case of international trade, the mainstay of the present order.\n154.\tExcluding oil exports, about 12 major primary commodities account for about 80 per cent of the total export earnings of the developing countries. The final consumers pay over $200 billion for these commodities and their products, while the primary producers-the developing countries obtain only about $30 billion, the middlemen taking the difference. Another example is that out of $102 billion of international reserves created during the period 1970-1974, the developing countries received $3.7 billion or less than 4 per cent.\nWe cannot today realistically speak about economic development and, even less hope to find just and equitable solutions to the ills of under-development, unless the problem is seen in the context of the need to build new structures of economic relationships. As long as there is no change in these basic structures, all our development efforts will not only remain palliatives but they could also become self-defeating.\n156.\tWhat is required at this juncture of history is a new economic and social order which recognizes the changes that have taken place in the post-war years as well as the need for further change. The liberation from colonialism of a large number of peoples has cut the Gordian knot of dependency relationships, but these yet remain to be replaced by relationships based on sovereign equality, mutual benefit and a shared sense of mutual responsibility for development and the management of the world's economic and financial affairs. In short, this new economic order should be predicated on the recognition of the increasing interdependence of the international community. His interdependence has created a chain of cause-and- effect relationships in what nations do or fail to do. While no one country is immune from the consequences of the actions of others, the poor and the disadvantaged inevitably suffer most. The solutions of the major economic problems today require the concerted and the converging action of all.\n157.\tThe development of the third-world countries is a central problem. International trade has to be restructured to bring to developing countries their due share of the benefit. Not only should they be enabled to have unencumbered access to the markets of the industrialized countries but also their export earnings should be protected from seasonal fluctuations and these should be held at reasonable levels of parity with the prices of industrial products.\n158.\tThe historical disadvantages are such that better terms of trade alone would not be enough Aid has to become a vital component of a new international development strategy. In order to play such a role, aid has to be conceived not as charity but as an investment which would redound to the benefit of all. Aid has to be more concessionary and, especially with regard to the least developed and disadvantaged, it should be made available mostly as grants. Donor countries should also alleviate the heavy burden of debt-servicing borne by the developing countries. Any agreement to that end should be considered as additional aid rather than a cancellation of contractual obligations. Some organic link should also be established between development financing and the creation of new international liquidity .\n159.\tI should like to conclude my statement by offering some observations on the achievements of the recent non-aligned Conference held in Colombo, Sri Lanka. First of all, the impact of the results of that Conference should not be lost on the United Nations. The views expressed by them represent the hopes and the aspirations of over 2 billion people who are represented in the .United Nations by 82 sovereign States.\n160.\tAt Colombo the non-aligned countries defined a new role for their policies. That role is to help bring about new structures of peace and prosperity through dialog and accommodation. They also gave notice that the non- alignment policy they wish to pursue is not one of acceptance of the present status quo but one that seeks change in favor of the liberation of peoples, the assertion of sovereignty over natural resources, the liquidation of the consequences of aggression and the pursuit of just and equitable policies for the solution of specific regional and international problems.\n161.\tCentral to their aspirations is the creation of a new economic order within which they would play an appropriate role to ensure the interest of their people on the basis of equality, mutual benefits and recognition of common responsibility for the well-being of an increasingly interdependent world.\n162.\tIn particular, Ethiopia subscribes to the views of the non-aligned movement on a number of specific problems, such as the question of Cyprus, the problem of the Korean peninsula and others regarding Latin America.\n163.\tMy country shares the course charted by the non- signed movement. The new Ethiopia believes in a dynamic non-alignment which is committed to change. Ethiopia believes that at a time when third-world countries are calling for radical changes in the international order, each one of us has the responsibility of carrying out internally those changes that would make our demands at the international level credible.\n"

        "file_text": "We are fortunate at this time to have Mr. Amerasinghe as President, for his long experience can so significantly assist in guiding our deliberations during this momentous session of the General Assembly. It is fitting, too, that his country, Srilanka, which has been charged with the task of co-ordinating the affairs of the non-aligned movement, should provide an essential link to facilitate, here at the United Nations, the implementation of the mature decisions that were taken at Colombo. I entertain every hope that this Assembly will not prove to be below the level of events and that the results of our deliberations will reflect those tenets of justice for which we all strive.\n305.\tIt also gives me particular pleasure to welcome into our midst the new State, the Republic of Seychelles. We look forward to working with it in the years ahead in this Organization in advancing the objectives of peace, security and development.\n306.\tThis session of the United Nations General Assembly, I feel, will go down in history as one of significance and importance to the question of freedom in southern Africa. As this question so well illustrates, all the difficulties which confront us in the contemporary international system can. be traced to one strategic dilemma which faced the victorious Powers at the conclusion of the Second World War. It was very clear after Potsdam that the gravest threat to peace was the defend perceptions of those who saw the world in terms of an ideological confrontation between so-called free and unfree societies. This legacy informed all the important changes in the world since 1945: the Chinese revolution, the Algerian revolution, the Cuban revolution, the Viet Nam revolution. Wherever a people strove to end the process of exploitation and to devise strategies of development that would increase their control over their natural resources and to realize fully their human dignity wherever these existed, the issues were approached from the standpoint of the elimination or, alternatively, the expansion of socialism. Looking back on this period we may well wonder at the prodigious expenditure of life- energy over mere matters of terminology and nomenclature.\n307.\tThe Rhodesian rebel leader, Ian Smith, said in a broadcast on 24 September this year:\n\\\"Dr. Kissinger assured me that we shared a common aim and a common purpose, namely to keep Rhodesia in the free world and to keep it from Communist penetration\\\".\nIt is significant that Smith did not say that the United States and Rhodesia shared the common aim that the black majority should be free and that the will of the black majority should prevail. That, after all-black majority rule should be the common aim. If this session of the United Nations General Assembly achieves anything-and I feel sure that it will achieve much its most outstanding contribution to progress on this planet could be the universal acceptance that the fight for freedom and for material equality is waged at a level beyond the strategic imperatives of competing ideologies.\n308.\tIndividual freedom has this characteristic: its claims are universal. I say emphatically that neither the present position in Rhodesia nor the position envisaged by the Anglo-American proposals is consistent with any definition of freedom, with any definition of democracy, or with any definition of justice. Guyana wishes to make its position dear. We completely endorse the action taken by the five front-line States of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia and the United Republic of Tanzania in reaffirming the sole conditions under which majority rule can be installed in Rhodesia through negotiation. Either Smith accepts these now or the war will be intensified until inevitable victory. It was perhaps asking too much that the Secretary of State of the United States of America should succeed where other Fearless Tigers had failed ignominiously. In the sense that we are told that the so-called Anglo-American proposals stem from a desire to prevent a racial war in southern Africa in that sense, I do not impugn the motives of the architects of those proposals. What I question is their judgment.\n309.\tThe character, the attitude, the stubbornness and the short-sightedness of the rebel in Rhodesia have been well documented. Here is a man who has defied international opinion for more than a decade, has been buttressed by international monopoly capital and has vainly sought to suppress in Zimbabwe those very instincts that in 1776 led to the birth of the United States of America. George Washington was not told on the eve of victory that he could have freedom in two years; Patrick Henry was not told that the alternative to immediate liberty was a temporary quasi-slavery. Yet here, 200 years later, a solution is offered to a problem of freedom that envisages transitional government with built-in minority power structures, with cessation of armed struggle, with the lifting of sanctions and-\\\"the most unkindest cut of all\\\"-economic aid as a sweetener and an incentive.\n310.\tIt is unreasonable to expect that Ian Smith will negotiate power away from himself except when faced with the final acceptable casualty. It is equally unreasonable to expect that armed fighters of the majority will Jay down their arms before the acquisition of majority rule. Those are the lessons to December 1974 and those are the lessons of September 1976.\n311.\tBut Rhodesia, important though it is, is not at the heart of the problem of southern Africa. To discuss the freedom of the majority in Rhodesia it is necessary to speak to Vorster; to install freedom in Namibia it is necessary to confront Vorster; and it is Vorster who temporarily rides roughshod over the majority in South Africa itself. The core of the entire problem of southern Africa is apartheid - the economic, political, social and ethical justification for what passes for government in southern Africa.\n312.\tIt is hoped that no assurances were given to South Africa, expressly or implicitly, in support of the apartheid system, in order to facilitate the so-called negotiations with Ian Smith. Guyana remains resolutely opposed to apartheid, implacably opposed to the \\\"bantustan\\\" system, and firmly determined to ostracize those who have sporting and cultural links with South Africa so long as this modern-day version of slavery persists. So long as there is minority rule, whether in South Africa or in any other part of southern Africa, the people of Guyana will ally themselves with all opponents of that system and will support the liberation struggles of the oppressed majority.\n313.\tIt has been announced that the first of the \\\"bantustans\\\" will be given a kind of portmanteau independence on 26 October of this year. Needless to say, Guyana will not recognize any such puppet creation. We are aware that there are some who will seek to justify some kind of recognition on tactical grounds perhaps, or on military strategic grounds. At Colombo, 85 countries of the non- aligned movement denounced that maneuver for what it is a transparent fraud. We feel confident that the rest of the international community will do likewise.\n314.\tThe continuing conflagrations in the Middle East have increased the value of the communication routes around the Cape of Good Hope. This fact, together with the mineral wealth of South Africa, has blinkered the vision of those who pay lip-service in their opposition to apartheid. How much longer can they indulge in such sophistry in the face of the intensive struggle in southern Africa and the brutal continuing slaughter perpetrated by a Fascist Government in the segregated areas in South Africa? Is it not ironic that the freedom of the majority in Zimbabwe should be considered in dialog with him who brings to the negotiating table hands stained with the blood from massacres in Sialola, massacres in Soweto and massacres in Capetown?\n315.\tIn Namibia, where the illegal occupation still continues and where the South Africans are smarting from the trouncing they received in Angola, a so-called constitutional conference has been held. My delegation denounces that conference as having no meaningful relationship to the future of Namibia. We support the South West Africa People's Organization as the legitimate representative of Namibia. We support the United Nations Council for Namibia and the continuing efforts of the United Nations to obtain majority rule and independence within a single unitary State. Guyana supports the armed struggle in Namibia as the only viable option left to the oppressed majority. The Caprivi Strip, bristling with modern armaments, remains a threat to international peace; it must be dismantled. So long as it exists, so long will it remain an instrument for the repression of the aspirations of the Namibian people, and so long will it remain a base of operations against the front-line independent African States.\n316.\tIn the Middle East the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people remains the sine qua non of a just and lasting peace. Huddled in refugee camps, subjected to the crumbs of international compassion, the Palestinians still await the restoration and exercise of their inalienable national rights. My delegation expresses its profound concern over the situation prevailing in Lebanon and will continue to support all efforts aimed at terminating the fighting among brothers, at restoring peace and at safe-guarding the unity, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon.\n317.\tWe reiterate that peace in the Middle East must rest on the implementation of three principles: first, the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland; secondly, the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to exist within boundaries that are universally recognized; and, thirdly, the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967.\n318.\tRecently, the non-aligned movement held its Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government at Colombo, Sri Lanka, in the Indian Ocean. Aware of the threat to the security of the States in the area posed by the concentration of naval and aerial strength in the Indian Ocean and on the communications route between those two great expanses of water in the world-the Atlantic and the Pacific-the non-aligned movement repeated its call that the Indian Ocean should be a zone of peace [see A/31/197, annex IV, resolution 11]. My delegation reaffirms its conviction that the implementation of that declaration on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace would contribute substantially to the relaxation of international tensions.\n319.\tSpeaking from this podium last year I ventured the opinion that in Cyprus the question of peace was related to the achievement of a consensus between the two communities, obtained without duress and achieved with-out coercion. Today, nearly a year later, little if any progress has been made in the inter-communal talks; colonization of the northern part of Cyprus has proceeded apace; and foreign armed forces, despite the unanimous call of the General Assembly, remain entrenched on the island. Force majeure predominates. The resolution that the Assembly adopted unanimously two years ago [resolution 3212 (XXIX)] continues to provide the only valid framework for a solution to this problem. Let us ensure that during the course of this Assembly appropriate action will be taken to implement the decisions that we have already discussed, formed and sought to have implemented.\n320.\tThe tragedy of Cyprus is the tragedy of the interference by other States in the affairs of a small State. Techniques of destabilization are being mobilized against Governments which seek to free their economies from the stranglehold of imperialist control\u2014Governments which seek to create systems of development which would abolish hunger, disease and poverty, which would restructure their societies so as to provide their peoples with the quality of life for which they yearn. The immediate objectives of such campaigns of destabilization are clear and unmistakable: they range from the comparatively unobtrusive change of key personnel to bloody events which sometimes culminate in such tragedies as the assassination of political leaders.\n321.\tThe techniques used are also equally clear and equally unmistakable. The promotion of internal unrest with a view to the break-down of law and order; the fomenting of intraregional conflicts through client States; the financing and organization of hostile propaganda campaigns; the attacks on embassies and consulates; the manipulation of international markets; the restrictions on export capabilities; the frustration of bilateral and multi-lateral aid; the subversion of economic objectives by the machinations of transnational corporations all this arsenal of destabilizing techniques is aimed in the first instance at ensuring the continuation of a relationship of dependency between developed and developing countries, and in the second instance at yoking the legitimate aspirations of the peoples in developing countries to the strategic conceptions of larger nations.\n322.\tMost of the countries in the developing world were former colonies of Western Europe and the radicalization of their liberation struggle has therefore been in anti-West terns. This does not necessarily mean that those terms are pro-East. Similarly, most of those countries have adopted socialism as an internal strategy of development. This likewise does not indicate that they are anti-West or pro-East. At Colombo the golden thread running through all the resolutions and discussions was the determination of 85 countries not to sacrifice their sovereignty and independence on the altar of ideological nicety. We of the non-aligned movement have in effect chosen not to be for one side or the other. We have chosen to be ourselves. At Colombo, non-aligned countries denounced all forms of interference and emphasized the need for unremitting vigilance in this regard. Here in New York at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly I call on the Assembly to denounce these activities and I urge the international community to consider in earnest measures to safeguard the integrity and sovereignty of small States and to discourage all attempts to interfere with their right to pursue the paths they have freely chosen for themselves. This, after all, is one of the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter, to which we all subscribe.\n323.\tBut the security of developing States is inextricably linked with their economic survival and their economic advancement. My delegation feels that there can be no meaningful economic advance without the implementation of the new international economic order as adopted at the sixth special session. The non-aligned movement and the Group of 77 have tirelessly sought to bring home to those in the developed world, who are ever resistant to change, that the economic progress of the developing countries is in the security interests of the developed countries. The billions on this planet who live in the developing countries and whose existence is subjected to the constraints of the few who manipulate to their advantage the present day economic system those billions have pinned their hopes on the modest programs put forward in Nairobi and elsewhere. Their determination is adamant, inexorable and relentless. The International Monetary Fund and the Bretton Woods monetary system must give way to alter-native structures such as international development banks which are not geared to-the revival and reconstruction of Europe or to preferential arrangements for the developed marketing economies, but rather to the just distribution of the gains of an equitable global system.\n324.\tThe crippling problem of debt and the servicing of debt have assumed a special urgency. Developing countries cannot afford to depart from their basic and fundamental demand made in Manila and Colombo earlier this year calling for measures of cancellation, rescheduling and the declaration of moratoria. We must eschew all attempts to deal with this problem by the divisive tactics of a case-by-case approach. We cannot afford to mortgage the future of unborn generations to the obligations of burden some capital repayments and crushing debt servicing, The time has come for a debt moratorium.\n325.\tOn the important question of commodities, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the integrated program. We therefore deplore the equivocation on the part of some developed countries in respect of the negotiations to be held on the establishment of a common fund for buffer stocks, which, after all, remains the cornerstone of a viable integrated program. While we naturally hope for a change of attitude on the part of these countries during the forthcoming UNCTAD negotiations to permit the establishment of a fund supported by all countries, we are firmly committed nevertheless to proceeding with the establishment of a fund as advocated by the non-aligned countries should the forthcoming negotiations fail to yield satisfactory results.\n326.\tThe Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, although hailed by some as the ideal forum for producing definitive solutions to the crucial inter-national economic issues has, after months of debate, produced only halting and insignificant progress. There are some who are prepared to sound the bugles of advance in the face of what is obviously a halt. My delegation therefore fully endorses the concern expressed by the non-aligned conference in Colombo over the slow progress made at the Conference. I wish to reiterate my well-known skepticism about the attempt to find solutions to the critical international economic issues outside the framework of the United Nations system, such as the one being attempted now in Paris. Instead, my Government considers that the United Nations is the legitimate forum for the settlement of such issues.\n327.\tThere is a clear need for restructuring and technically improving the United Nations system. Basically the United Nations Is a political organization and changes must reflect political realities. If the Security Council is to become more effective, if its authority is not be diminished by the misuse of the veto in the service of narrow national interests, then restructuring is necessary. The early admission of the People's Republic of Angola and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam would mark and advance the universality of the membership of the United Nations and would enable it to deal more effectively with the global issues that confront it.\n328.\tNon-aligned countries have always insisted on the importance of the United Nations as an effective instrument or promoting international peace and security and for harmonizing the interests and objectives of its Member States. The work of its various organs constitutes a co-ordinated attempt to share the future for the better condition of mankind on this revolving planet of ours.\n329.\tIn the onward march of man there have been many obstacles, many hurdles. There have been many Vorsters; Smiths have abounded. We must not assign the attributes of victory to an ignominious surrender to false perceptions of defense.\n330.\tPeoples against whom the doors of meaningful negotiation have been closed have no other recourse but to resort to arms. The bell is tolling in southern Africa. The last call to prevent the blood-bath has died away, buffeted by the winds of insincerity. Soon -perhaps very soon- majority rule will prevail throughout southern Africa. Those who have sought to temporize with and accommodate the forces of oppression and reaction must heed these basic truths. Those who have died in this struggle have hallowed the ground beyond any powers of oratory and rhetoric. Guyana reaffirms here at this thirty-first session of the General Assembly its untiring support for those who strive for justice in southern Africa, for those who strive for the removal of racism as an ethos of government, for those who strive for the reaffirmation of the authority and respect of the United Nations, and for those who would perceive the unfolding logic of events. History is not side-tracked by spectaculars. The internal dynamics of the progress of mankind are dictating the results in southern Africa. We are proud to identify with those dynamics.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is with real pleasure that I add the voice of the Rwandan delegation to the chorus of praise addressed to you since the beginning of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, of which you have been elected President. Your great qualities as a man experienced in political affairs and your outstanding familiarity with international relations will, we are convinced, ensure further progress and real success in our work. Your unanimous election is not only a tribute to you personally but also a tribute to your people with whom we have relations of friendship and to whom we are grateful for the warm welcome we received at the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries.\n136.\tWe should also like to express our sincere thanks to your predecessor the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mr. Thorn for the way in which he carried out his delicate mission in the course of the thirtieth session. The delegation of Rwanda last year was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to speak about the deep friendship and fruitful co-operation which exists between Luxembourg and Rwanda.\n137.\tWe also wish to pay an earnest tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for his personal devotion to the efforts of the international community to bring about a world society where peace, justice, equity and human solidarity will prevail, and to express anew our Government's confidence in him. We should also like to pay this tribute to all his associates for their dynamism and the devotion which they have shown in the discharge of their tasks and heavy responsibilities.\n138.\tI should also like, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda, to pay a pious tribute to the memory of one of the great figures of mankind who has left an indelible mark on contemporary history. President Mao Tsetung not only injected international relations with new dynamism in the direction of progress, peace and security throughout the world, but he was undeniably the master helmsman, the creator of a new China, whose accomplishments we cannot fail to admire. The delegation of Rwanda, because of the great friendship and fruitful co-operation which exists between our country and the great Chinese people, wishes once again to express our sincere condolences to that friendly country on the passing of one of the greatest men of all time. It is our fervent hope that his work will be perpetuated for the greater good of China and of all mankind.\n139.\tBefore speaking of the problems of the day, we wish particularly to greet here the presence of the Republic of Seychelles. Rwanda has already expressed to it its joy at the outcome of the glorious struggle it has waged for the independence and dignity of its people. Now, on behalf of my delegation, I should also like whole-heartedly to bid it a warm welcome to the ranks of this great family of nations. I feel certain that its fresh contributions will do much to ensure the success of our deliberations at this session.\n140.\tThe presence of the People's Republic of Angola and Viet Nam within our great family would have been a source of great satisfaction and joy to us. The frustration caused by the absence of those two fraternal countries because of the obstruction of their admission to the United Nations is shared by the great majority of the international community. My delegation earnestly hopes that the entirely legitimate and timely application of those countries will be accepted and that the door of the great family of nations will stand wide open to them very soon.\n141.\tAlthough we have witnessed with much satisfaction the triumphs of the process of decolonization and although in recent years many countries have attained independence after many years of heroic struggle, it is nevertheless true that, in spite of those positive results, our continent is still a source of explosive tension and very recently it has been the theater of violations of human rights and the rights of nations on the part of the racist regime in Pretoria and the rabid and incorrigible Zionism of Tel Aviv.\n142.\tWe are convinced that peace in the world will be endangered as long as the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty of States are flouted in the settlement of local conflicts.\n143.\tPeace in the world will be endangered as long as colonial machinations and expansionist plans, in disregard of the obligations we assumed as Members of the United Nations, work against the rights of peoples and nations and hence compromise peace and security in various parts of the world.\n144.\tPeace in the world will be endangered as long as a number of peoples are the victims of interference marked by pressure and violence totally inconsistent with respect for the fundamental human rights which are the focus of the concern of the international community, and until we have unmasked all the forms of domination which are disguised behind a deceitful exterior.\n145.\tSuch vigilance requires from us courage linked to a fierce determination which will enable us to put aside personal and egocentric inclinations in our struggle against systems of destabilization, subversion or corruption, what-ever their source.\n146.\tRwanda remains convinced that the solution of various crises must be found in respect for the sovereignty of each State and the self-determination of peoples within a framework that will guarantee them full and free expression of their will, without foreign occupation, interference or pressures, such a situation to be achieved through all possible peaceful means, such as dialogue and consensus.\n147.\tOn the subject of decolonization, southern Africa has experienced the most criminal and humiliating forms of white oppression of the black people. The evil geniuses of apartheid wish to establish an intolerable legal fiction, because a minority of white racists, flying in the face of common sense and the inevitable development of events, obstinately try to maintain under their ignominious yoke 20 million African blacks through the insidious, cunning and diabolic scheme of the Machiavellian policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" -a clumsy trap aimed at making it impossible to achieve majority rule and hence to enable the majority to decide their own destiny.\n148.\tAs His Excellency Habyarimana Juvenal, the President of the Republic of Rwanda and the founder of our national revolutionary movement for development stated:\n\\\"We must denounce the obstinacy and intractability of the authorities of Pretoria, who in spite of the moving appeals of the black peoples under their domination, in spite of the recommendations of organizations reflecting the combined wisdom of mankind, continue to retain African lands and to consider themselves the best guarantees of the future of the black peoples they oppress.\\\"\n149.\tWe are convinced that peace-loving countries will never take seriously the myth oft-repeated in the South African press that the racist Vorster will introduce of his own accord changes likely to put an end to the system of apartheid and the policy of \\\"bantustanization\\\" which he obstinately pursues, the sole purpose of which is to perpetuate his criminal regime which has been rejected by all the Members of this Organization.\n150.\tWe are well aware that the political situation in South Africa is deteriorating daily. Tens of thousands of Africans are being expelled from urban zones and fertile agricultural areas and relocated on hard-pan lands, when they are not decimated by arbitrary arrests, sentenced to long prison terms or degrading hard labor.\n151.\tThis situation is particularly tragic because, in spite of the embargo decreed by the United Nations on arms sent to South Africa, that country continues to receive weapons from Western countries, as well as basic materials and technical assistance to produce those weapons locally. The situation is particularly tragic because, despite the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has been in effect since 1970 and has been signed by all the major Powers, South Africa continues to equip itself with large quantities not only of conventional weapons but also nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\n152.\tOur Organization must most vigorously condemn these threats to international peace and security posed by the arms race in South Africa. There can be no peace in that part of the continent or in the world as long as the retrograde doctrines of the racist.regime of Pretoria are allowed to subsist.\n153.\tOur Organization must condemn with great indignation the bloody events which have taken place last June in South Africa, where new, unspeakable crimes of genocide have been committed and constitute an act of defiance of humanity.\n154.\tOur Organization must fully appreciate the possible disastrous consequences of these massacres, which flow, and will continue to flow, from the sinister plans of the advocates of apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa.\n155.\tTogether with this series of ignominies we must also mention the aggression against the People's Republic of Angola, the attack on the innocent village of Sialola in Zambia by the bloodthirsty, racist South African army.\n156.\tMy delegation believes that in the present circumstances it is high time that we go beyond the stage of ineffective and futile condemnations and that we take concrete and vigorous action, including the imposition of sanctions, as envisaged by Chapter VII of the Charter. We must support with all the force at our disposal the Security Council's unanimous condemnation of the regime of Pretoria for its illegal presence in Namibia, and we must make a solemn appeal to all Member States .to put into practice all resolutions relating to the sanctions against South Africa for its persistent refusal to leave Namibia and for the brutal repression of the Namibian people by the Vorster regime. We add our strong opposition to efforts to negotiate with irresponsible tribal chiefs, the sole objective of which is to destroy the unity of the Territory and to perpetuate the South African presence in Namibia.\n157.\tI shall not mention the case of Zimbabwe, where it is painful indeed to note that the survival of the illegal regime of Ian Smith is due to the complicity of certain Member States who, far from vigorously implementing economic sanctions against the rebellious Rhodesian regime, have, through practically overt trade relations, given them moral and material support.\n158.\tWe would be remiss if we failed to pay an earnest tribute to the People's Republic of Mozambique for its exemplary decision to close its border with the Salisbury regime in application of the sanctions decreed by the\nUnited Nations. That has been of inestimable assistance to the cause of peace in the world and progress in Africa.\n159.\tWashington's initiative and London's backing of the efforts of the Secretary of State of the United States have in recent days given us some hope for a peaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa, especially of Namibia and Zimbabwe. Rwanda nevertheless believes that the treacherous Ian Smith and the racist Vorster must seize this final opportunity to avoid a protracted and inexorable bloody armed struggle in that part of Africa.\n160.\tIn Namibia in particular, the African continent with justified impatience is anxiously awaiting the convening, under the auspices of the United Nations, of a constitutional conference in which the authentic representatives of the Namibian people, namely SWAPO, will participate, and we are anxiously awaiting the freeing of all political prisoners and the independence of Namibia as soon as possible.\n161.\tFinally, the delegation of Rwanda believes that all non-aligned countries, and in particular African countries, must follow with keen interest developments in southern Africa, and we must not, for want of ah appropriate strategy, miss an opportunity to bring about, albeit belatedly, a peaceful settlement to the problems of decolonization; nor must we, because of excess confidence, miss this opportunity which has been created by many sacrifices and efforts during the course of our long liberation struggle in our continent.\n162.\tAt the northern border of our continent, a consideration of the international situation hardly justifies optimism.\n163.\tAs far as Western Sahara is concerned, my country is devoted to the sacred principles of self-determination and the inviolability of the borders which colonialism has bequeathed each State. We condemn as vigorously as we can any violation of these principles, which we think would be an exceedingly dangerous precedent for peace and stability in several parts of the world.\n164.\tHie fratricidal war which has engulfed Lebanon in a bloodbath for the past 17 months, and nearer to us, the Arab territories occupied by Israel and the humiliating treatment of tho Palestinian or Arab populations in areas under Zionist domination are not the kinds of actions which can bring about peace in that part of the world.\n165.\tA tight network of international interests exists in that part of the world; the murderous war is sustained by foreign aid and for direct interests that have not yet been made clear. Bloodshed continues in a completely confused and ominously clouded situation.\n166.\tWe have always believed that international peace and security cannot prevail in a situation in which sources of tension spread from one area to another, from one country to another. In Lebanon, human solidarity must replace egotistical attitudes. The desire for domination, for hegemony, for confrontation must be replaced by co-operation on a basis of equality.\n167.\tThe major Powers and all the countries in any way involved in these atrocities have heavy responsibilities. We still hope that they will respond with humanity to the cries of pain of thousands of men who are dying without knowing why. Arms must be laid down so that the parties concerned may be able to conduct negotiations leading to a lasting peace in that part of the world.\n168.\tRwanda is a peaceful country. Respect for the ideals of our Charter, especially the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, has been a golden rule from which our national revolutionary movement for development, the supreme organ of our institutions, will never depart.\n169.\tOur founding President and President of the Republic of Rwanda, His Excellency Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal, reaffirmed this position in his manifesto of 5 July 1975, as follows:\n\\\"The national revolutionary movement for development favors negotiations for the settlement of international conflicts. Our movement wants the Rwandese Republic to side with those who sincerely seek to strengthen world peace and international co-operation, and especially with the countries that are least privileged and those that are fighting for the liberation of their peoples or in defense of their independence.\\\"\n170.\tWhile the problems of Africa and the Middle East are a source of particular concern to us, we cannot fail to mention certain other problems which, although they may occur a long way away, are nevertheless of concern to the Republic of Rwanda.\n171.\tThe problem of Korea, in particular, is one such problem, and an extremely important one, because it concerns the right of peoples to self-determination; it is moreover a serious problem because it is linked to international peace and security.\n172.\tThirty years ago the Korean nation was divided by the force of arms and by a shameful line of demarcation. That line became a definitive frontier not as a result of the desire or the decision of the Korean people but because of the presence of foreign occupying forces camouflaged under the colors of the United Nations.\n173.\tThat division of a single people to which the United Nations Command gave a semblance of legality has been denounced by the international conscience. Last year the General Assembly adopted two resolutions [resolutions 3390 A and B (XXX)] calling for the dissolution of the United Nations Command so that the Korean people might be in a position to bring about their independent and peaceful unification, without foreign interference.\n174.\tThe United Nations must persevere in that course in order to put an end to the consequences of former conflicts which have lasted all too long, creating a de facto situation of which the Korean people are victims because they have been divided between two conflicting political and social regimes.\n175.\tThe question of Cyprus is another one of those questions whose complexity and gravity are due to the handiwork of outside forces bent cm dividing the island and proliferating sources of tension, with the unavowed purpose of diverting the third world from its major objective: the economic, social and cultural development of their peoples.\n176.\tIn dealing with the Cyprus crisis, the maneuvers of the proponents of a policy of the fait accompli should be disregarded, and honest and constructive negotiations should be encouraged between the Greek and Turkish communities in accordance with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.\n177.\tThe territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus require the withdrawal of all foreign forces, the unconditional cessation of competing foreign ideologies and the restoration of refugees to their homes.\n178.\tRwanda's position on this question is quite clear. One of the constant principles of the foreign policy of our national revolutionary movement for development is support for peaceful coexistence and co-operation on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of each nation.\n179.\tThe international community owes it to itself to act along the same lines and it is only through this realistic and eminently humanitarian policy that peaceful coexistence will be achieved between the two Cypriot communities.\n180.\tThe Republic of Rwanda has always been opposed to the division of peoples and nations. This applies to Namibia, South Africa, Cyprus, Korea, Viet Nam and, particularly, Germany. My delegation has never endorsed the erection of walls of shame within the territory of a single nation. That is why the head of the Rwandese delegation stated from this rostrum on 1 October 1973, at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly:\n\\\"Among [the divided States] we see the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, two States which, we hope, will one day again become one nation, the great and noble German nation. \\\"\n181.\tMy country will constantly uphold that clear position, dictated by our excellent relations with the entire German nation. We have indeed had such relations since the dawn of modern history. It is my Government's view that we should see to it that future generations do not inherit disastrous situations resulting from our errors, from the confrontation of interests or from the desire for hegemony.\n182.\tMy delegation would have liked to pass over in silence the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the arms race because we believe that the egocentrism and desire for hegemony on the part of the major Powers have turned those sectors into their own private preserves. My Government believes that there can be no detente in the world until an end is put to the arms race, to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to the creation of nuclear power stations in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the third world in general.\n183.\tAs regards reforms in the United Nations, we should continue to realize that all nations, regardless or their size or power, share certain rights and duties in the conduct of the affairs of our world. All wish to discharge their task fully within the community of nations. That is why the decision-making power of the General Assembly, whose functions are now more limited than those of the Security Council, must be strengthened.\n184.\tThe new structure of our Organization must be in keeping with the principles of international democracy and the new configuration of the world, in which many changes have occurred since the United Nations was created in San Francisco 30 years ago.\n185.\tThe conditions which prevailed at the time, justifying certain points in the Charter, no longer exist today and the Charter must follow the developments of history. The monopoly of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council, a privilege that some of them have abused, very often promotes situations that are contrary to equity, to the principles of the Charter and to world peace.\n186.\tThe unjustified refusal to admit certain independent States to membership in our Organization and the reprehensible use of the veto to further territorial expansion on the part of certain Member States clearly show that that monopoly has harmful consequences. That is why my delegation believes that, first, in view of the changes in the world political situation since the adoption of the Charter, we must reduce the number of questions to which the veto can be applied and, secondly, that Africa and other regional groups which are recognized within our Organization but which do not have the veto must be given group vetoes.\n187.\tIn this way, when the Security Council adopts decisions on matters of substance, the veto of a representative duly accredited to the Council by a specific continent or a region would have the same effect as that of a permanent member.\n188.\tIn the area of social and economic relations for some time now, and particularly since the sixth special session of the General Assembly in April 1974, the Group of 77 has spared no effort to reform the present economic system and to set up certain structures in keeping with new economic realities. We are all well aware of the fact that it is no longer possible for a country or for a group of countries or for any alliance of transnational corporations to enjoy the benefits of the work and heritage of independent peoples.\n189.\tThree quarters of mankind are therefore determined to participate in the organization of world power, in a spirit of dialogue, mutual concession and solidarity.\n190.\tThe Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States represents a great stride forward simply because opinions have converged and a consensus has emerged on certain very important questions such as the sovereignty of States and a State's control over its natural resources and the question of international co-operation for development. Although there are differences of opinion regarding how certain matters should be approached, that Charter remains a source of standards and of invaluable mechanisms in dealing with world economic changes.\n191.\tHie results of the seventh special session, the desire to come together, to consult and to bring about harmony which marked that session, had revealed a definite willingness on the part of the developed countries to take action without delay to put an end to the imbalance of power and to restore fair relations among nations.\n192.\tThe fourth session of UNCTAD, in keeping with the spirit and resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions and of the twenty-ninth and thirtieth regular sessions of the General Assembly, was to consider certain substantive proposals relating to the decisions which UNCTAD was to adopt to promote negotiations and the building of a world economy based on equity and inter-national solidarity.\n193.\tThe Nairobi Conference and all the preparatory meetings which had preceded it focused on the problems of commodities, indebtedness, the transfer of technology, multilateral trade negotiations, trade relations among countries with different regimes, manufactures, action to help the least advanced countries and institutional questions.\n194.\tWe are all familiar with what happened to certain specific recommendations after four weeks of difficult negotiations on certain subjects.\n195.\tThe frustration of the third world arising from the postponement of consideration of certain matters important to it, the restrictive declarations by certain developed countries on positive resolutions-such as the creation of a common fund to finance international stocks-had prompted certain quarters even in the West to say that the fourth session of UNCTAD yielded \\\"meager results paved with good intentions\\\".\n196.\tThat eloquent comment on the part of certain nationals of the developed countries requires no comment. Nevertheless, the meager results of the session should not undermine the morale of the international community but should rather encourage us to redouble our efforts to bring about the speedy establishment of more equitable and universal social justice. Vigilance is required if there is to be a carefully thought out and concerted strategy as worked out at Kingston and Rambouillet and in Puerto Rico.\n197.\tFinally, I should like to say to this Assembly that our country has been following with close attention developments in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Everyone is well aware of the fact that all countries attach great importance to rules governing the sea-bed and ocean floor, whether they be industrialized countries or developing countries, coastal States or land\u00aclocked States. We believe that it is of utmost importance to stress here that the seas and the oceans and the living resources and minerals thereof all constitute the common heritage of mankind.\n198.\tIf the United Nations, our universe where we gather for dialog and agreement, provides us with an ideal framework for international cooperation thanks to its many bodies, our Organization must, if it wishes to survive, assess in time the pressures and course of movements and events throughout the present-day world, faced as it is with imperfections, frustrations, anguish, conflicts and struggles for hegemony, in order fully to grasp their meaning and needs, direction and intensity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Japanese delegation I wish to offer sincere congratulations to Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election to the presidency of this thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. We have all had an ample demonstration of his vision in the search for a new order of the sea, in his capacity as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. I am confident that the far-sightedness he displayed in leading that important debate will inspire this session of the General Assembly to seek affirmative results.\n138.\tI should also like to express our sense of indebtedness and appreciation to Mr. Gaston Thorn, a world statesman, for his wisdom in leading the eventful thirtieth session of the General Assembly to its successful conclusion.\n139.\tMay I, in addition, pay my sincere respects to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, who has been indefatigable in his pursuit of conciliation and peace and has provided thoughtful and creative leadership in the promotion of international economic, social and cultural co-operation, thus helping this Organization to cope with problems arising from the diversified international environment.\n140.\tOn the occasion of the admission of the Republic of Seychelles to the United Nations at this session, I should like to extend to its delegation a warm welcome. My country enjoys friendly relations with the Republic of Seychelles, and I am certain that the role of that Republic in this Organization will be constructive and beneficial to us all.\n141.\tSince the establishment of this Organization, pro-found changes have taken place in the world. The earlier and very severe tensions of the East-West cold war have been reduced, as a result of the dialogs between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as between the United States and China. The Western European nations and Japan are now playing more effective roles in world economic and political affairs. The number of newly emerged nations has risen sharply, and world politics has undergone great changes as international relations have become vastly more diversified.\n142.\tDespite these positive developments, the question of Korea remains unresolved. So do the complex situations in the Middle East, Cyprus and southern Africa. However, in Asia progress is being made in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Indochina, whose peoples have suffered greatly from prolonged warfare. There is also visible progress in strengthening the unity and autonomy of the member States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. And, within the Indian subcontinent, the nations of that region are adapting to new political realities, and are together reaching for a new and longed for stability.\n143.\tWorldwide relations in the economic and social fields are becoming more interdependent, although there are vast differences in our political systems, historical backgrounds, and stages of economic development. No country can solve by itself economic and trade problems, or the problems of natural resources, energy, food, the environment, habitat, human rights, the status of women, and scientific and cultural co-operation.\n\n144.\tIf the Member States wish to overcome such complex and difficult problems and to share equally in peace and prosperity, all the Member States, industrialized or developing, irrespective of their size as nations, should try to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity on a global scale, in accordance with the provisions and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. It is essential that all Member States act in a spirit of mutual respect for each other's positions, co-operate in mutual concessions, avoid confrontation, promote harmony and co-operation, and collaborate with each other in a responsible manner.\n145.\tOnly thus can the United Nations function properly as the sole and supreme citadel for peace in the world today. There were days when powerful countries employed their power to conquer, invade or plunder other countries, tried to overturn other Governments, and interfered in the internal affairs of other countries. As a result, some disastrous precedents were drawn in history. I am sure that there is no single country that does not wish for peace in the world. In order to attain it, we should see to it that illegal use of power is not condoned. Japan pledges never to do so. Our determination is manifested in the Constitution of Japan, promulgated in 1946, which provides for the renunciation forever of war as a means of settling international disputes, and expresses the ideal of \\\"the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance for all time from the earth\\\". Japan's pacifism reflects the same ideas expressed in the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations; it is, in fact, the spirit of the Charter.\n146.\tFukuzawa Yukichi, a pioneer of democracy in the Meiji era of Japan, once said: \\\"No person is created above another, nor below another.\\\" His words are known widely among the people of Japan. I believe this saying can also be applied to States. In other words, \\\"No country is created above another, nor below another.\\\" No State should reign over another. Relations between nations should not be based on domination and subordination.\n147.\tIt is the firm conviction of my Government that peace, which is the supreme ideal of this Organization, can be achieved if each of our 145 Member States rejects the use of force in its conflicts with others and makes its own achievements available for the benefit of others. I should Eke to reaffirm Japan's dedication to a diplomacy of peace, for we sincerely desire peace in the world, and will oppose any attempt to hamper the attainment of peace.\n148.\tFrom this point of view, it is only realistic to observe that special responsibilities devolve upon the big Powers, especially those nations which enjoy special status under the Charter for the maintenance of peace and stability in the world. The success of the United Nations requires the initiative and full co-operation of all Member States, but the great Powers have great responsibilities in particular areas of this Organization's work-for example, in the fields of disarmament, self-restraint in the export of armaments, the institutionalization of peace-keeping activities, and administrative and financial support to the United Nations system. I hope that the big Powers are aware of their responsibilities in these fields, and will accordingly make more positive and more constructive contributions to the work of the United Nations, thereby reinforcing the raison d'etre of this Organization.\n149.\tJapan, ever since its admission to this Organization, has loyally observed the objectives and the spirit of the Charter, which calls for international co-operation for the purposes of maintaining peace and security in the world and of promoting social progress and raising standards of living in a broader atmosphere of freedom, to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which ... brought untold sorrow\\\". My country has actively participated in, and renders positive co-operation to, the work of the United Nations.\n150.\tJapan lives up to these ideals by rejecting for itself the path of military power. Trusting in the justice and faith of the peoples of the world, Japan has decided to rely solely on peaceful means for the settlement of international disputes, and to avoid firmly any recourse to military means. Japan prescribes only minimum needs of self- defense, and seeks to contribute to world peace and prosperity through its diplomacy of peace-which manifests a very strong determination on the part of its people.\n151.\tIn keeping with its diplomacy of peace, Japan ratified in June of this year the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. The Treaty accords a special status to the \\\"nuclear-weapon States\\\", allowing them to possess nuclear weapons, while all other States, including potential nuclear-weapon States, are prohibited from possessing such weapons. It is the firm conviction of my Government that this inequality should be neither consolidated nor perpetuated. It should be rectified, not through the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which could lead to the annihilation of mankind, but rather through the abolition by the nuclear- weapon States of all nuclear weapons. Despite a controversial and heated discussion on the pros and cons of ratification, my Government took the important decision to ratify the Treaty in the earnest hope that the nuclear- weapon States would take positive steps towards the elimination of such weapons, and in the belief that our ratification would contribute further to the peace and stability of the world.\n152.\tJapan, as the only victim actually to suffer atomic explosions, feels that it is most important to activate international co-operation concerning the promotion of nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n153.\tFailure on the part of the nuclear-weapon States, which have a special responsibility in disarmament, to achieve meaningful disarmament-particularly the reduction of nuclear armaments and a comprehensive nuclear test ban-will inevitably lead to the erosion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, the proliferation of nuclear explosive capability may well take place under the guise of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. My Government is seriously concerned with the potential danger inherent in the fact that such nuclear enrichment and reprocessing facilities as would have an important bearing upon the manufacturing of weapons material could be acquired and constructed without respect to their actual need for peaceful uses and without effective international safe-guards. There is a pressing need for both restraint by the parties concerned and international co-operation to ensure the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n154.\tAs a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, my Government is firmly determined to contribute positively to international cooperation envisaging nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n155.\tIn spite of the present balance of nuclear power, the creation of an international atmosphere where peace and stability can be maintained should be encouraged. To this end, it is essential to make progress in conventional weapons disarmament as well as nuclear disarmament. In some areas of the world we are witnessing a significant build-up of arms through the rapid importation of conventional weapons. Although possibly justified in some respects by actual needs, such a trend, causing deep concern, will only further intensify existing conflicts or risk provoking new disputes.\n156.\tMy Government forbids the export of weapons to areas in conflict. I feel that the time has come to seek feasible ways to formulate international agreements on the transfer of weapons, to avoid encouraging international conflicts. In the meantime, I should like to urge all countries concerned to take reciprocally prompt measures of self-restraint and to give serious consideration to all the implications of this matter.\n157.\tThe United Nations, despite many trials since its founding, continues to be the only universal system with precise responsibilities to maintain international peace and security and to promote international co-operation in economic, social and humanitarian affairs.\n158.\tYet, the Organization can contribute constructively to the solution of world-wide problems only if the Organization's decisions are formulated on the basis of \\\"dialog\\\" and \\\"conciliation\\\".\n159.\tThe United Nations offers Member States a universal forum in which to hold talks, and the General Assembly is the most proper place for the exchange of views among all nations on issues of common concern. Without both \\\"dialog\\\" and \\\"conciliation\\\", based on mutual respect and animated by a conciliatory spirit; the resolutions adopted cannot be implemented, the prestige of the Organization is damaged and its reason for existence undermined.\n160.\tThe \\\"North-South problem\\\", or the problem of development, is an important area where \\\"dialog\\\" and \\\"conciliation\\\" are essential. The challenge of development is of the utmost importance, requiring a serious consideration at present as well as uninterrupted efforts over the long run in order to reach an abiding solution.\n161.\tMy Government appreciates that the spirit of \\\"dialog\\\" and \\\"conciliation\\\" took a step forward in the course of the seventh special session of the General Assembly and of the fourth session of UNCTAD. In dealing with various issues, such as the integrated program for commodities and the expansion and improvement of official development assistance, my Government is determined to work vigorously and realistically towards practical solutions, not only in various United Nations forums, including UNCTAD, but also at the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n162.\tWe also note with concern the growing gaps in the levels of development of the developing countries them-selves. We must free ourselves from the traditional approach of treating the development problem as that of the industrialized countries versus the developing countries; instead we must adopt a comprehensive strategy founded on a more realistic and organic assessment of the issues.\n163.\tWith such understanding, and paying increased consideration to the least developed among the developing countries, my Government intends to expand its multi- phased co-operation in many fields, such as trade and aid, in support of self-help efforts for economic and social development.\n164.\tMultilaterally, Japan has extended cooperation to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, and others; it has contributed substantial amounts to a number of United Nations funds, including the United Nations Development Program; and has pledged a major contribution to the International Fund for Agricultural Development on its establishment. It is strongly urged that the efforts of the developing countries to help themselves receive full co-operation from those developing countries which are in a position to offer it, such as the oil-producing countries, as well as from the socialist countries, each in its own way.\n165.\tOne of the areas where international co-operation is needed is the problem of establishing a new legal order of the sea. It is essential that, at the Third United Nations\nConference on the Law of the Sea, we seek a broad consensus on the very complex and diversified problems of the sea, in a spirit of \\\"dialog\\\" and \\\"conciliation\\\" among nations with conflicting interests, so that we can formulate an international legal order which will endure for a long time to come. Japan is determined to contribute to the earliest possible formulation of a new treaty which would reflect the harmonized interest of the international community as a whole. I should like to appeal to the Governments participating in the Conference to make further intensified efforts towards an early conclusion of the treaty.\n166.\tWhen we think of the problems of the economic and social advancement of developing countries, we must recognize how important it is for each developing country to enhance its human resources for constructive engagement in national development. I feel this deeply from the experience of my own country. Japan intends to expand and strengthen various kinds of co-operation for raising technical and educational standards as a means of contributing positively to the enhancement of human resources in developing countries.\n167.\tJapan took an initiative towards establishing the United Nations University and has welcomed the head-quarters of the University at Tokyo. Fortunately, this vital investment in the future welfare of all mankind was launched with the support of many Governments. My own Government has pledged $100 million to the University over a five-year period, in expectation that similar contributions will be made by other countries. Actually, my Government has already contributed $40 million, and I strongly urge other Member States that have not yet done so to make their contributions, in recognition of the significance of the United Nations University.\n168.\tMy Government is most anxious that peace and stability be maintained in the Korean peninsula, especially because of our geographical proximity and close historical and cultural relations. In cur view, the prompt resumption of dialog between the South and the North of Korea is essential for the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula and for peaceful reunification on the basis of the freely expressed will of the Korean people.\n169.\tWe also urge that \\\"talks\\\" be held among the parties directly concerned, to take up problems such as the dissolution of the United Nations Command and arrangements relating to the Armistice Agreement. Out of firm conviction, my Government has endeavored consistently to create an international atmosphere where \\\"confrontation\\\" is avoided and \\\"dialog\\\" is encouraged. Therefore my Government welcomes the fact that a fruitless confrontation is to be avoided at this session. It is the earnest hope of my Government that, without losing this momentum, dialog between the South and the North of Korea, and talks among the parties directly concerned, will be started as promptly as possible.\n170.\tJapan holds to the position that, if it is the wish of both the South and the North of Korea, we shall welcome the admission of both to the United Nations in the interval before peaceful reunification is achieved.\n171.\tMy Government is gravely concerned that recent developments in the Middle East, particularly the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, may further delay a solution to the complex problem of the Middle East. It is my Government's hope that a peaceful solution will be reached through prompt and complete implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973), as well as through the implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This entails adherence to the following three principles: first, the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible, and therefore Israeli armed forces should withdrawn from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war; secondly, the integrity and security of the territories of all countries in the area, and the need for guarantees to that end, should be respected; thirdly, the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations should be recognized and respected in bringing about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n172.\tWe earnestly hope that this conflict will be settled promptly so that the peoples of the region can enjoy a just and lasting peace. We believe that talks could quickly get under way among Israel, the Arab States, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other parties concerned, on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions of this Organization.\n173.\tWith regard to the problem of the Palestinian refugees, my Government will continue its financial contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, in co-operation with other countries. I wish also to urge the Socialist countries, which have not contributed in the past, to begin now to support this humanitarian program.\n174.\tThe United Nations has for many years played a valuable role in southern Africa, but it is most regrettable that the problems of Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and apartheid have so far not yielded to satisfactory solutions. During the course of this year, the Security Council has held a number of meetings to deliberate on southern African problems, and a number of talks have been launched among countries concerned, seeking a peaceful resolution of these problems. My Government applauds all these initiatives but deplores the fact that armed clashes are now taking place in Southern Rhodesia, that blood is being shed in South Africa and that the decisions of the United Nations on Namibia have yet to be carried out.\n175.\tThese conditions cannot endure. In this connexion, I should like to express my appreciation for the active efforts being jointly made by the Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, of the United States and leaders of the countries concerned for a solution of the southern African problems. I sincerely hope that these efforts will bring about fruitful results. Japan will continue to participate in the search for prompt and peaceful solutions to southern African problems, holding persistently to our rejection of any form of racial discrimination.\n176.\tAmong the most valuable examples of this Organization's role as an impartial third party in seeking its prime objective of the maintenance of peace and security are \\\"its peace-keeping operations\\\". The United Nations Emergency Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Middle East, as well as the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, have made indispensable contributions to the maintenance of peace in those areas. Since those peace-keeping operations are the most effective means available to this Organization for preventing the recurrence and escalation of armed conflicts, there should be no disputing the value of strengthening this; peacekeeping capacity for the future. Therefore, my delegation hopes that the work of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations will make it possible for such operations to be carried out in the future in a more effective, smooth and assured manner. My Government will further co-operate in the strengthening of this Organization's activities in that area.\n177.\tIn the hope that the United Nations will continue to play a constructive role in solving various international problems, I should now like to refer, from the viewpoint of strengthening the role of the United Nations, to the questions of institutional structure and the financing of the United Nations system. My delegation appreciates the work already initiated on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. I think that through that work we should aim at strengthening the functions of the United Nations, making greater efforts for the rationalization of United Nations activities and the simplification of its structure, as well as for increasing the efficiency of its work. In this regard, we should like the work of restructuring to include a thorough examination of such problems as the duplication of activities among various organizations of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and the organic and overall co-ordination of the functions of those organizations.\n178.\tFirst, may I urge that we attempt to make more efficient use of the already existing organizations and that, when the setting up of a new organization is inevitable, the principle of \\\"scrap and build\\\" should be applied.\n179.\tAs to the personnel of the United Nations, I believe we should rectify the situation in which important posts are occupied by the nationals of a limited number of countries. With this in mind, although we should try as much as possible to maintain present staff levels, it is time that special consideration should be given to equitable geographical distribution of personnel, and in particular to the recruitment of personnel from such countries as are now unduly underrepresented.\n180.\tIn response to the pressing needs of our times, the United Nations has expanded its activities. As a result, its budget has expanded considerably. The Organization's regular budget has tripled in the past decade, and the annual rate of increase in the last five years has been about 15 per cent. This rate of expansion does not, however, necessarily coincide with the fiscal position of Member States-and that is a matter of concern to us. For many nations, the responsibility of supporting the steadily in-creasing United Nations budget has become a considerable burden. In Japan's case, as a result of both budget increases and our increased assessment, our contribution is now eight times what it was 10 years ago.\n181.\tIn view of those facts, I wish to express our conviction that the United Nations must make every effort to hold its budget as low as possible through the rationalization of structure and more efficient use of limited resources. It is necessary that both the Secretariat and Member States clearly recognize the actual state of United Nations finances and work together to avoid situations where funds are depleted because of preoccupation with current cash demands without due regard for the availability of funds.\n182.\tThe Government of Japan has made a special contribution of $10 million to the United Nations because of our concern that the Organization's deficit could hamper effective and smooth operations. We hoped that this contribution would serve as a first step towards a solution, but we have been deeply disappointed that few countries have followed our initiative and that no solution to the financial problem is yet in sight. I urgently appeal to the membership of this Organization not to refuse payment or delay payment of assessed contributions on political grounds. If the United Nations is to deal effectively with the problems we bring before it, its organizational and financial base must be firmly established.\n183.\tSince this is the time-recurring every three years when the General Assembly must review the scale of assessments, I believe that we should re-examine the formula for determining the scale of assessments, taking into account not only the capacity to pay, which is based on national income and other indices, but also such factors as the special status accorded to certain States by the Charter of the United Nations.\n184.\tFinally, I should like to stress the importance of strengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations through improvements which can be made within the framework of the Charter, as well as through a review of the Charter. It hardly seems necessary to point out that no organization can function well without effort and determination to work together for common aims on the part of members who constitute and operate it. Criticisms directed at the United Nations these days deal not only with defects in the structure and the Charter of the Organization but also with the lack of the will on the part of the Member States to observe the Charter. Therefore, Member States should reaffirm their intent earnestly to observe the Charter and should demonstrate that intention through their actions.\n185.\tUndeniably, there are a number of discrepancies between the structure and functions of the United Nations contemplated when the Charter was drafted more than 30 years ago and the role the Organization is expected to play in the vastly changed international political and economic environment of today. It is indisputable, in fact, that certain provisions of the Charter have become not only obsolete but meaningless.\n186.\tWith regard to the review of the Charter, I should like to recall that my Government has taken a position favoring the review of such items as the strengthening of \\\"peace-keeping operations\\\", the strengthening of the on- the-spot fact-finding function, the composition of the Security Council, the strengthening of the co-ordination function of the Economic and Social Council and other bodies in the fields of economic and social development, the reconsideration of the Trusteeship System and the elimination of the \\\"enemy State\\\" provisions.\n187.\tIn any event, I trust that constructive recommendations and clearer perceptions of the United Nations Charter and functions will flow from the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, and the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System.\n188.\tIn conclusion, it is imperative for all Member States to join in strengthening and reinforcing the United Nations, which is the world-wide Organization bearing the ideals and hopes of mankind, and to co-operate more effectively for the attainment of peace and prosperity in the world. On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of our admission to the United Nations, I should like to reaffirm the determination of the people and the Government of Japan to spare no effort in the pursuit of those goals.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I hope that you will convey to the President of the Assembly that we are extremely honored at his election to the presidency of this thirty-first session of the General Assembly. His reputation which has been established in this Organization has long since won for him general esteem. Only recently, he presided with distinction over the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. From the beginning of his presidency of this Assembly, we have been in a position to appreciate his wise and expeditious conduct of our proceedings.\n5.\tIt is a pleasure for me to congratulate the Secretary- General on his excellent report on the work of the Organization [A/31/1 and Add.l]. We have read this document with the greatest interest because it reflects the deeply pondered judgments which have been arrived at after five years, years in the course of which our Secretary- General has never ceased to work with patience, diplomacy and discretion and in the course of which he has won our esteem.\n6.\tWe are aware of the difficulties encountered by the Secretary-General in his work and of the efforts he is making to resolve them. To be more precise, we share his concern to make more effective the functioning of the United Nations System. We shall continue to seek, particularly through the restructuring of the economic and social sectors, measures to adapt the system to the needs of the international community and to make better use of the human and material resources available.\n7.\tThis year, the United Nations has once again taken a step towards universality by admitting to membership Seychelles, something which was accomplished as the result of an exemplary peaceful process. We would convey our best wishes to the one hundred and forty-fifth Member of the United Nations.\n8.\tThe Europe of the Community is continuing its development towards unity, as was demonstrated by the statement given yesterday [7th meeting] by the Netherlands Foreign Minister in his capacity as the current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community. He addressed the Assembly on behalf of all the members of the Community in detail with regard to the most delicate problems of the hour, such as the situations in Cyprus and Lebanon, and the efforts which have been made so that the States in the Middle East could live in peace and security, and the rights of the Palestinians to national identity could be recognized.\n9.\tI should also like to place stress in my turn on our growing concern with regard to the tensions which have been developing in southern Africa. Southern Rhodesia- and this is something that we call for each year-must return to legality, and South Africa must give up its illegal occupation of Namibia and cease the practice of apartheid. My country, along with its European partners, has always worked to this end, not only taking an unequivocal position in this regard but also undertaking constant diplomatic action. \n10.\tWe now have serious grounds for hoping that the mission which has just been concluded in southern Africa by the United States Secretary of State and the positions taken by the leaders of Africa will make it possible to lay the foundations for  solution that will be equitable for all. I am pleased to note the initiative just taken by the United Kingdom Government, which I fully support, of proposing the convening of a conference of all the parties concerned in order to ensure the establishment of a provisional government.\n11.\tI should also like to congratulate my colleague from the Federal Republic of Germany on having presented us yesterday with his draft relating to a convention on international action to be taken against the taking of hostages [A/31/242]. It is in the interest of all States without exception to support this humanitarian draft.\n12.\tAll human societies, whether national or international, wHi be judged by what they have done for the development of man and for the respect of his fundamental rights.\n13.\tThe dignity and effectiveness of our Organization also depend on what it does in this area. Thus I have chosen to dwell on this essential subject. Human rights must be examined from three standpoints. First of all, we must guarantee for everyone a true right to existence, according to the old precept: \\\"primum vivete, deinde philosophari\\\". The crucial question of food in the world is also something which should be raised-and of course the right to existence Must also entail the right to growth and development. This legitimate aspiration should be realized in the new world economic order. Secondly* man must be able to live in peace and security. This implies a security based upon respect for law; only law can prevail over force and control it. Efforts to that end within our own countries should be developed at the international level. Thirdly, respect for man entails the guaranteeing of his fundamental rights and access to fundamental freedoms. Man will not be truly free, his rights will not be truly exercised or preserved, until an international organization guarantees those rights.\n14.\tPermit me to begin with man's place within the physical context, or, if you like, the economic context.\n15.\tFor 20 years or so economic rights have gradually been spelled out and exercised within the framework of improved co-operation between the industrialized and third-world countries. Recently they have been mentioned in many resolutions, particularly at the seventh special session of the General Assembly and at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], while in Paris at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation further progress has been attempted.\n16.\tThe formula of limited participation at the Paris Conference represents an attempt to overcome the difficulties and, often, the set-backs resulting from the institutional formulas used so far. Mr. van der Stoel, current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community, has spoken about our determination to achieve specific results by honoring the obligations to which we have subscribed. We for our part will do everything in our power to see to it that this is done.\n17.\tMy country has the same attitude with regard to the other major economic negotiations, where it is determined to make the most of every opportunity to make progress. Therefore I now come to speak of the position that we hold following the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi.\n18.\tThe Nairobi session did not result in art unambiguous consensus making it possible to proceed in the best possible conditions to the adjustment of economic relations between industrialized and developing countries; nor did it result in a failure which would have endangered dialog and re-engendered a spirit of confrontation. UNCTAD at Nairobi took important decisions both with regard to raw materials and the indebtedness of developing countries and in other areas, particularly the transfer of technology to the developing countries.\n19.\tIn the area of raw materials, the participants undertook to hold true negotiations. These will relate particularly to action designed to stabilize the prices of certain commodities, while trying to improve them, and on the creation of a common fund. We also undertake to implement all the other resolutions of the Nairobi session.\n20.\tThe definition of a new international economic order is a matter of concern not only to developed market- economy countries but indeed to all States represented here. Belgium and the European Community for their part will do everything in their power to support this work. Within this context, I should like to mention that my Government has decided to abide by the time-tables produced in Nairobi.\n21.\tThe advent of a new international, economic order presupposes that first of all we have succeeded in removing what seems to me to be a growing threat, namely, that of lack of food-indeed, in certain areas of our world, actual famine. This concern seems to me to foe one which has the highest priority.\n22.\tHowever, I am constrained to note today that, almost two years after the World Food Conference, the Inter-national Fund for Agricultural Development has not yet come into being. In the field, in spite of the praiseworthy efforts of certain local governments, national and foreign experts, in spite of specific actions to benefit the rural sector undertaken by organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Program [UNDPJ and the World Bank and in spite of certain encouraging local results, we have to acknowledge that the general situation remains a matter of great concern. In many parts of the world we have both under-use of arable land and a food shortage which has to be made up through imports.\n23.\tHowever, to remedy these situations, however paradoxical they may be, is not an easy thing, particularly because of the high cost of fertilizers, energy and other factors of production; but does the complexity of the problems entitle us to be satisfied with our present efforts? Belgium for its part does not believe so. We are not only in favor of keeping up these efforts; we should like other avenues to be explored with a view to accelerating action.\n24.\tApart from what has been done at the level of major multilateral organizations and even possibly within the framework of those organizations, we must seek, as my country is ready to do, bilateral agreements to decide what could be done, or even agreement in a regional group, the Community for example, for the same purpose.\n25.\tHowever, I fear-and in my country more and more people are saying the same thing-that international discussions on ways of establishing a new international economic order do not take sufficiently into account the high-priority efforts which should be made to combat the chief threat to the third world, that of famine, which has assumed alarming proportions for the next few decades.\n26.\tAt any cost we must find a remedy to a food situation, which may get entirely out of hand unless adequate measures are taken. The situation is such that we can no longer content ourselves with reasoning and acting in global terms. Each country must, for its own part and with its own resources, do what it can do itself without expecting everything from the results of negotiations at the world level.\n27. Within this context, in order to meet the growing food needs, Belgium states its readiness to examine with developing countries that may be interested forms of collaboration in industrial development to be undertaken in those countries, the purpose of which would be both the increase of primary agricultural commodity production and the production of new fertilizers with local ingredients.\n28. The second matter of concern about which I should like to say something in this Assembly is that of the right to peace and security.\n29.\tIndeed man aspires to conditions of peace and security which would enable future generations to enjoy harmonious development, free from war and the resort to force.\n30.\tBut there is a general consideration that we should bear in mind. That objective can be achieved only to the extent that law comes to prevail over force. So it would seem, then, that action along two lines is called for. First of all there is the development of international law, a particularly difficult task. To appreciate its complexity, it is sufficient to note how many problems have arisen in the Conference on the Law of the Sea, although that subject is a matter of vital concern to all. Secondly, we must create the instruments necessary to guarantee respect for law and its provisions. We are very far from achieving this, hence fear and suspicion still dominate the policies of States. While so many countries are making the tasks of disarmament the center of their political concerns, we are witnessing a development of military arsenals that sometimes affects areas where the arms race has not yet become established. Such a development causes concern with regard to the real or assumed intentions of Governments. After all, where are we to draw the line between legitimate self- defense and ambition, which seeks to transform military power into an instrument of influence or even of political domination?\n31.\tOf course, the logic of deterrence has taught us that people accumulate arms in the hope, if not with the actual purpose, of not having to use them. But that also entails the risk of a chain reaction that would inexorably culminate in the triumph of violence and mindlessness.\n32.\tIn view of this distressing phenomenon and in spite of the praiseworthy efforts of many Governments, Belgium can only be struck by the stagnation in the work with regard to disarmament on the multilateral level. There is no area where negotiation is so slow in getting under way or where, when it does get going, it comes up against so many obstacles, fears and suspicions.\n33.\tOf course effective and efficient arms control can be brought about only at the world level. But there will be no prospects of negotiation until States come to realize that, regardless of the defensive arrangements they are entitled to make, their security can also be strengthened by general arms limitation and control agreements, so long as those agreements do not contain any elements of imbalance or discrimination.\n34.\tWe should take initiatives to prevent the development and use of biological and chemical weapons. Belgium will support initiatives in this area to the extent that they lead to concrete measures to eliminate weapons which are a disgrace to man's imagination.\n35.\tOne of the reasons for the fact that the work has come to a standstill at a more general level certainly lies in differences of doctrine, but also and above all in the absence of dialog between the major military Powers, in particular the nuclear Powers.\n36.\tIt is impossible even to think of producing international instruments until States give up hardened ideological positions. The Moscow Treaty on the partial cessation of nuclear tests  and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] are two remarkable instances of this.\n37.\tThere is growing concern with regard to the risks of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is essential there-fore for us to consolidate and develop the achievements of the non-proliferation Treaty, particularly because the importance of nuclear energy for the development of the international community is now better understood. But we should prevent this constantly growing recourse to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy from increasing the number of countries which possess nuclear weapons.\n38.\tCountries which, like Belgium, have by international treaty renounced the right to acquire nuclear weapons are entitled to call on the nuclear Powers to discharge their particular responsibilities towards the international community because of the crucial monopoly they have granted themselves in this area.\n39.\tThe nuclear States parties to the Treaty should make a particular point of working out provisions relating to free access to nuclear technology. The voluntary subordination of civilian activities to the control, of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] would be further proof of goodwill on the part of the nuclear States parties to the Treaty. So far, only two of the three nuclear States have decided to do this. States should also commit themselves further to bringing about the objective laid down in article VI of the Treaty, namely, nuclear disarmament.\n40.\tBelgium is ready to participate in efforts to obtain supplementary guarantees so that nuclear material is not diverted from civilian purposes. We have already joined in many attempts along those lines which have been under-taken by a certain number of exporting countries. In addition to those efforts, at the General Conference of IAEA at Rio de Janeiro Belgium has just proposed provisions to place under the control of IAEA the entire combustible fuel cycle for all the members of the Agency.\n41.\tBelgium has always considered the Treaty as a stage in the process of nuclear disarmament. We have only a rather short time left to conclude this stage and we should do everything in our power to see to it that it is concluded. Above all, the States parties, nuclear Powers in particular, should help to remove the objections that are still being made by several countries with regard to the Treaty.\n42.\tI should like to call on all the nuclear States to turn their back on ideological quarrels and to display a higher degree of pragmatism and mutual understanding and to undertake this work of negotiation, which alone will make it possible to make disarmament a reality. That example wOl, doubtless, bring in its wake more propitious circumstances and conditions for the examination of a subject which we consider just as important as the nuclear area and which has often been laid aside in international conferences: that of conventional arms which have given rise to a tremendous volume of trade, the flood-waters of which we shall in the end have to control.\n43. I should like to stress the urgent importance of universal provisions, but I do not want to underestimate the significance of certain bilateral negotiations for the future of the world. The United States and the USSR in particular, and more recently France and the USSR, have indicated the path of dialog. Notable treaties have already been concluded, particularly in the field of strategic arms limitation. However, so far that is nothing but a partial and limited process, and efforts aimed at the reduction of that category of weapon should not be allowed to lead to the increase of other categories of arms.\n44,. Partial approaches must also be undertaken, and in this context we must acknowledge that the requirements of security are more easily perceptible among States in the same region.\n45.\tWith regard to Europe, Belgium plays a dynamic role in the preparation of an offer of negotiation made by a certain number of Western countries which has led to the talks now under way in Vienna on the mutual and balanced reduction of forces and arms in central Europe. Our objective is to establish there, thanks to balanced reductions, regional stability, which can only serve to contribute to an improvement of political relations in that part of the world.\n46.\tThe talks on mutual and balanced force reduction, of course, offer only a limited answer to the global and planetary problem. But we are convinced that this answer will have the merit of being concrete and immediate. That is why-in spite of the relatively little progress achieved so far-our country is more than ever committed to the success of those negotiations.\n47.\tMore generally speaking, each country should act directly in the region in which its responsibilities lie in order to promote the search for disarmament measures or measures which will control armaments.\n48.\tThe technical elements of a negotiation would be circumscribed more quickly, whether it is a matter of stabilizing or reducing forces or a matter of nuclear free zones, the arms trade or measures designed to increase confidence and co-operation among States in the region. A very important example of regional negotiation exists in Latin America. During the past sessions of the General Assembly various initiatives demonstrated the increased interest that exists there for drawing up measures at the regional level in the world.\n49.\tThe Assembly, for its part, should focus its actions on the global study of subjects which lend themselves to a regional approach, without, of course, attempting to replace States in the region by itself determining the advisability and the arrangements for the measures to be undertaken.\n50.\tCertain regions have hitherto so far escaped the temptations to undertake an arms race.\n51.\tThe United Nations could help the States of a region to lay down norms which would ensure their security without, however, forcing them to incur intolerable expenses for development. Agreements brought about in this way would be respected by all other States.\n52.\tMy country would commit itself to authorize only the export of arms which would be in keeping with the ceilings established. Our delegation in the First Committee will be instructed to undertake consultations with a view to a possible initiative in this area.\n53.\tIn the determined search for ways of establishing the rule of law, arms control, both universally and regionally, Belgium is pursuing the objective which remains one of the raisons d'etre of our Organization, namely, the guaranteeing of peace to all the inhabitants of our planet.\n54.\tI come now to my third concern: the guaranteeing of fundamental human rights.\n55.\tHuman rights have been proclaimed and defined in a number of texts to which the international community has subscribed, but our society is still without the instruments which would guarantee the implementation of those texts and ensure respect for those rights.\n56.\tThe year 1976 is an important year. At the beginning of this year, the two International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 (XXI), annex] came into force.\n57.\tThe Belgian Government is now concluding the process of ratification. We subscribe to the optional machinery provided for in article 41 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, whereby a State party to the Covenant recognizes the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and examine communications in which another State party claims that it is not fulfilling its obligations under the Covenant. We are therefore observing scrupulously our basic option which places respect for the rights of citizens above the principle of State sovereignty. This principle should be interpreted flexibly so as to prevent fundamental human rights from being violated with impunity.\n58.\tThe ratification of these Covenants by all countries would obviously not be a final panacea in human rights problems. Human rights indeed continue to be violated, sometimes on the territory of the very countries which have ratified the Covenants. Torture is still being used-our Assembly solemnly outlawed torture last year [resolution 3452 (XXX)] -and recourse is also being had to exile, the suppression of political rights and the internment of individuals of sound mind in mental institutions.\n59.\tWe must continue the struggle and use to the utmost the existing texts and organs and consider whether they are sufficient.\n60.\tThe Belgian Government attaches particular importance to the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, which should prepare a convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. That document should constitute an international juridical instrument of a binding character, not confining itself merely to spelling out rights, but providing the necessary provisions to ensure that they are actually put into effect.\n61.\tWhat has been done by our Organization with regard to enforcing respect for human rights is not sufficient. My Government regrets the trend in the Commission on Human Rights to content itself with examining complaints against a few countries, which in most cases have been quite justly accused. The Commission will be carrying out its task only when it receives and hears all complaints, disregarding all arguments based on regional or ideological solidarity which enable certain States to avoid scrutiny.\n62.\tThe ideal, of course, would be for us immediately to establish universal jurisdiction. But if we were to pursue this objective alone, would we not be running the risk of neglecting the achievements of partial progress? Historical, spiritual, cultural and social affinities have made possible remarkable results on the regional level. Thus, the coming into force of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  was accompanied by the establishment of a court of justice against which State sovereignty can no longer be invoked once the States parties have recognized the competence of the Court.\n63.\tAgain, on the regional level, the 35 States which signed the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have the obligation fully to apply resolutions with regard to human rights and the free circulation of persons and ideas. But that is still far from the case. Indeed, the results which were achieved at the third round of that Conference should in fact over the longer term lead to extending to all the territories of the signatory States what we have already achieved, the scope and importance of which I have just recalled. The meeting to take place in Belgrade in 1977 has the purpose of assessing the results obtained in the light of the texts adopted at Helsinki, and also to stress what has not yet been done, as well as to examine ways of making progress towards a situation which would be more in keeping with the letter and spirit of the resolutions to which the signatory States have subscribed.\n64.\tWhat has been achieved at the regional level highlights the fact that at the world level violations of human rights have not been noted. What can we do?\n65.\tIn my view, we can adopt immediate procedures. Last year I made some suggestions here  with regard to the dispatching of commissions of inquiry to countries which have been the subject of complaints with regard to violations of human rights.\n66.\tThis year, I should like to spell out my thinking on this subject. I hope that the Assembly is considering adopting at this session a resolution calling on States voluntarily to renounce the possibility given them under paragraphs of Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) to refuse to receive on their territory an ad hoc committee of investigation with regard to human rights situations and, generally speaking, to refuse even to allow that committee to undertake inquiries. States which agree on a voluntary basis to make such a commitment would so inform the Secretary-General.\n67.\tIf the Commission on Human Rights should deem it necessary to send a committee of investigation to any of those States, all that would remain would be for it to work out, together with the State, the purely technical arrangements for the travel of the committee.\n68.\tThe resolution which I have in mind would note that such a decision on the part of States would constitute very marked progress towards the protection of human rights. It should provide for the annual submission by the Secretary- General of a report to the Assembly giving a list of States which had voluntarily made the undertaking I have in mind. This report would be examined by the General Assembly when it came to discuss the study of further means of promoting human rights.\n69.\tThis proposal does not aim at the creation of new institutions and presupposes no change in existing texts or resolutions adopted by our Assembly.\n70.\tMy delegation has received instructions to make the necessary contacts on this with all the Members of our Organization.\n75. The purpose of my proposal is to promote the progress which we could make and to demonstrate that our Organization rejects stagnation and to enable all Member States to give proof, on a voluntary basis, of their devotion to human rights.\n72.\tAs in previous years, I have devoted part, if not most, of my statement to problems which directly affect man himself. Respect of his rights, concern for his well-being, the guarantee of his security-these are objectives which are common to us all. In order to make our Organization better able to realize those objectives, I hope that I have made some suggestions which will meet with the Assembly's approval.\n"

        "file_text": "The distinguished speakers who have preceded me to this rostrum have warmly congratulated Ambassador Amerasinghe on his election and paid a fitting tribute to his sterling qualities as a statesman and diplomat. My delegation fully shares their views and sentiments. The delegation of Ghana is gratified to have a personality of Mr. Amerasinghe's caliber to preside over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The remarkably able manner in which he has managed the affairs of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, as President of that complex and extremely difficult negotiating process, assures us of the success that will attend our deliberations here. Equally gratifying to us is the\nfact that his country, Sri Lanka, which has only recently acted as host to the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries, should thus be honored through his election. It underscores the increasingly central role that the third- world nations now play in international affairs.\n224.\tBefore I go further, permit me to pause to pay a tribute to Chairman Mao Tsetung, a leading figure of our times. Chairman Mao has rightly been acclaimed as a giant among men, and his death has robbed the world of a leader who, by precept and example, showed us all that selfless devotion and total commitment to the welfare of the people are the primary essentials of true leadership. On behalf of the Government and people of Ghana, let me once again convey our deepest condolences to the friendly Government and people of China for this irreparable and grievous loss.\n225.\tTo Ambassador Amerasinghe's predecessor, the distinguished Prime Minister of Luxembourg, allow me to place on record our thanks for a job well done. His conduct of the affairs of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly fulfilled our highest expectations.\n226.\tIn recent years, our Organization has been buffeted by extremes of fortune, but it has shown a wonderful resilience in the face of crises. Its ability to survive has been due largely to the wisdom and skill of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his able lieutenants who, in the most exacting situations, have toiled day and night, and toiled successfully, to vindicate the credibility of our Organization. The world owes them a debt of gratitude, and I believe that this can be paid not in gold or silver but by sincere and strenuous efforts on our part to promote the cause of peace.\n227.\tIt is with singular pleasure and deepest satisfaction that the delegation of Ghana welcomes the delegation of Seychelles into our midst. We in Ghana recall that it was to Seychelles that Prempehl, King of the former Ashanti Kingdom, now part of Ghana, was exiled by the British Government in 1900. Although an unhappy event, it does serve as a link between the colonial history of the two countries. We rejoice with the people of Seychelles over their successful elimination of alien domination.\n228.\tFor us in Ghana, the birth of every new State is an occasion for rejoicing, for it signifies the progressive eradication of the old virus of colonialism. No doubt the injection of new blood into our Organization will ensure for it a more vigorous and fruitful existence and, of course, bring it nearer to the desirable goal of universality.\n229.\tMy delegation will be delighted to give the delegation of Seychelles all the co-operation and assistance of which we are capable.\n230.\tThis Assembly had hoped to have the pleasure of congratulating the valiant people of Angola on their country's admission to membership in the United Nations. It is a matter of deep regret and sadness to us that, owing to considerations which have no bearing on the ability of Angola to undertake the obligations of membership, we have been denied that opportunity. We remain convinced that justice has a way of prevailing at the most unexpected of times and that, therefore, Angola's membership in this Organization is only a matter of time.\n231.\tThe Government of the United States has seen fit to veto the application of the People's Republic of Angola, apparently on the grounds that the presence of Soviet and Cuban experts, who are in that newly independent country at the invitation of its Government, somehow detracts from the precepts of sovereignty. The argument is unacceptable. Our view is that the veto of Angola's application for membership is objectionable not merely because it is a wrong use of power but also because it has encouraged armed bandits of the defeated FNLA  and UNIT A13 movements to launch incursions into the territory of the infant State, thereby destroying the efforts of African Heads of State to secure conditions for pacification and reconciliation of the people of Angola.\n232.\tIt is with the same feeling of frustration that we regard the continued delay which has attended the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in this Organization. All this has occurred as a result of the unjustified use of the veto power.\n233.\tIn the view of my delegation, veto powers have been vested in the permanent members of the Security Council in recognition of their special responsibility to the international community to promote a peaceful world environment. But veto powers degenerate into abuse, and their noble ends are defeated, if they are exercised with the aim of weakening the internal jurisdiction of the Government of a sovereign, independent State, or employed merely as an instrument in the regrettable politics of the cold war.\n234.\tThe international community is today confronted with problems of enormous dimensions. Prominent among these is the situation in southern Africa where the process of decolonization has reached a critical, but obviously final, stage. The racist minority regimes in Zimbabwe and Azania now stand as the remaining pockets of white settler domination on the continent. The motives of these two regimes may be complex and varied, but they have in them one common factor-fear of what might happen to them if they concede the principle of majority rule. Of course, the longer the oppression, the greater the fear, and the more dangerous and explosive the situation becomes. But what the ruling minorities in southern Africa should fear is not that power will fall into the hands of the majority, but that by their thoughtless attempts to perpetuate a monstrous social order and political system they are destroying their own chances of reconciliation within a framework of a multiracial community.\n235.\tFrom this rostrum and in many other forums over the years the voice of Ghana has been loud and explicit on the nature of the problems of southern Africa: we have condemned apartheid and have upheld the human values which alone, we believe, will create the peaceful and harmonious world community we all look forward to. Many of the speakers who have preceded me have once more recounted the facts and reiterated the well-known arguments in this Assembly. Therefore we will not labor the point or dwell on the past. We should rather wish to look at the chances that still exist for a peaceful solution and the consequences of our failure to take the right action now.\n236.\tIt is in this light that we welcome what appear to be some positive developments in the situation in southern Africa arising from the recent diplomatic initiative of the Secretary of State of the United States, the wise counsels of the Presidents of the front-line African States, the co-operation of the British Government and the sympathy of others. For a realistic assessment of the situation, however, my delegation cannot fail to emphasize the importance of the armed struggle launched by the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania to the changes in attitude that seem to be developing among the racist die-hards; nor should we ignore the exceptional courage of the children of Soweto who sacrificed their young lives in the cause of freedom and human dignity. They died so that their parents, their brothers and sisters will live as human beings, with the dignity and self-respect of the human person and, above all, in freedom in the land of their birth.\n237.\tThat is what the African struggle is all about. We believe in this struggle. We all have one common objective: the establishment of a multiracial community based on equal opportunities and equal rights for all. To this end and for a speedy establishment of majority rule in Zimbabwe, the delegation of Ghana proposes: first, that a constitutional conference should be held under the aegis of the United Kingdom Government to decide on the transfer of administrative power to the majority of Zimbabwe on the basis of the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\"; secondly, that in the interim, before majority administration, the rebellion in Southern Rhodesia, which has been euphemistically described as a \\\"unilateral declaration of independence, give place to order and legality, thus permitting sovereignty in the Territory, in fact as well as in law, clearly to revert to the United Kingdom as the administering Power; thirdly, that no lifting of sanctions should be considered until an interim government reflecting the views of the Zimbabwe people as a whole so requests; fourthly, that there should be no relaxation of the pressures on the rebel minority regime till satisfactory arrangements for interim government have been agreed to under the third of these proposals; fifthly, that the armed struggle should cease only when the first four conditions have been fully and irreversibly fulfilled; sixthly, that before then this Organization and the international community should progressively increase their support for the freedom fighters. In our view, there is no other way we can ensure that freedom and racial harmony will come peacefully to Zimbabwe than by the adoption of these proposals.\n238.\tOn the question of Namibia, I had the privilege to address the Security Council last Friday  and to outline the views of my Government. As we all know, South Africa was given up to the last day of August this year to quit Namibia and hand over the Territory to the United Nations to enable free elections to be organized in the Territory. To date, the only South African reaction has been an empty document, the so-called \\\"declaration of intent\\\" produced by the hand-picked ethnic, as opposed to broadly based national, representation, which met at the so-called constitutional conference at Turnhalle. Let me here recapitulate the essential points in my statement to the Security Council.\n239.\tGhana gives its full support to the conditions spelt out by Mr. Nujoma, President of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], on 28 September 1976 before the Security Council, that is: first, that South Africa agrees to talk with SWAPO regarding the modalities of the transfer of administrative power to the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO without prejudice to the constitution of South Africa's delegation to the talks; secondly, that those talks must be under the auspices of the United Nations and should be outside Namibia or any part of South Africa; thirdly, that, before the talks, all Namibian political prisoners must be released; and fourthly, that all South African armed forces should be withdrawn before the talks to enable Namibians to express themselves freely.\n240.\tIf South Africa refuses to accept these conditions aimed at a peaceful settlement of the issue, my delegation would consider that the end of the road has been reached and this Organization should take the appropriate action in keeping with our commitments to the Charter of the United Nations. We say this because we believe that this is yet another chance for South Africa to show its good faith and to demonstrate its respect for the decisions of this Organization and its component bodies. Otherwise the membership of that country will continue to be more of a liability than an asset to this Organization. If that happens, my delegation proposes to the Security Council: first, that South Africa be forthwith suspended or expelled from the United Nations and remain so suspended or expelled till it decides to comply with the decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly with regard to Namibia, and that all necessary measures be taken to enable the United Nations Council for Namibia to discharge its responsibilities; secondly that the General Assembly re-affirm its recognition of SWAPO as the only legitimate organization representing the whole of Namibia and give it every support to establish its control over that Territory with the assistance of the United Nations Council for Namibia; and, thirdly, that the Council decide to take action against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.\n241.\tGhana continues to hold the view that freedom in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia should not be attained at the cost of continued enslavement of the people of Azania. Thus, lest an erroneous impression be created in the minds of some that the racist regime of South Africa by its recent conduct regarding Zimbabwe is playing a positive role in the search for a peaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa, let me here and now state that the apartheid system is the one major obstacle to peace in southern Africa.\n242.\tThe disturbances in African townships in Azania and the current events in Zimbabwe and Namibia must convince the whole world that Africa is on the move and no force on earth can arrest the inexorable march of human history to its ultimate fulfillment in southern Africa. It is our desire, in making these proposals, that the United Nations should now act effectively and decisively on the side of right. What is at issue in southern Africa should be clear to all. It is not communism or any other \\\"ism\\\" or ideology, as the racist and minority regimes would want the rest of the world to believe; it is a demand tor human dignity and equal opportunities. It is in this light, and in this light alone, that we should view the situation.\n243.\tThe human rights situation in the world has admittedly undergone some radical transformation for the better in the period since the last war and, more particularly, since the wind of change began to blow through the continent of Africa. Nevertheless, in parts of our world there are still many people who are denied the enjoyment of even elementary rights. Men, women and children continue to die in great numbers because they are deprived of the basic necessities to sustain life, necessities which in other parts of the world have come to be taken for granted.\n244.\tThe support which Ghana has provided and continues to provide for the liberation effort and in the struggle for human dignity is in conformity with our historical circumstances. Equally valid and true to this tradition is our offer to act as host in 1978 to the world conference to combat racism and racial discrimination, which has been envisaged as the high-water mark of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. This offer represents our modest contribution to the realization of the purposes and objectives of the Decade, and we trust that all countries which value human decency and dignity and abhor racism and racial discrimination will contribute effectively towards ensuring a successful conference in Accra.\n245.\tThe tragic conflict in Lebanon has further complicated the situation in the Middle East. Ghana is saddened over the fate that has befallen that beautiful and prosperous country, and we entertain the.fervent hope that reason will soon ensure peace and harmony in Lebanon. But, even without a Lebanese crisis, the over-all situation in the Middle East remains as explosive and as dangerous as ever, and the ingenuity of this Organization should be directed to finding a just and permanent solution as quickly as possible.\n246.\tMr. Kissinger's statement that the time might now be propitious for an attempt at an over-all settlement and the Soviet Union's suggestion for the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East should pave the way for fresh initiatives for a permanent peace in the Middle East. Not only must those two super-Powers bring their undoubtedly enormous influence to bear constructively on any impending negotiations, but all the nations here represented must contribute their share towards the search for a solution that will be just for the long-suffering Palestinian people and ensure peace and security for all the States in the region.\n247.\tGhana is committed to the cause of peace in the Middle East, and while the search for a solution goes on we shall continue to maintain our troops serving with the United Nations Emergency Force in the area for as long as their presence is required.\n248.\tThe Aegean Sea is also fast becoming a trouble area, threatening to add a new dimension to the Cyprus crisis-the root-cause of instability in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the view of my delegation, a settlement in Cyprus must consist in the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island, the return of all refugees to their homes in safety, respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island, and active promotion of talks between the two communities leading to the achievement of harmonious relationships between the two major communities on the island. We also trust that those directly involved will endeavor to remove the causes of tension in the Aegean Sea.\n249.\tOur annual review of the world situation compels us once again to renew our faith in the principles and purposes of our Charter and our commitment to the attainment of a world that is free from all elements which militate against the attainment of mankind's ultimate objective of peace and security. Because the issue of disarmament has implications affecting international peace and security, Ghana has traditionally made that issue one of the most important aspects of its foreign policy. It is a sad reflection of our sense of priorities that in a world which is still largely beset with poverty and ignorance the arms race alone consumes almost $300 billion annually, while the net flow of official development assistance amounts to only $15 billion a year. It is realities of this kind which make it imperative for countries such as mine, though young and developing, to resist the temptation of standing by as helpless spectators of the increasing acquisition and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction.\n250.\tIt is true that the 1970s which we have proclaimed a Disarmament Decade have seen the conclusion of a number of important agreements on disarmament. The advent of the era of \\\"detente\\\" has also contributed to the thawing of the cold-war climate between the major Powers and induced some restraint in their quest for global influence. But the arms race continues unabated and the incessant calls of developing countries for a world disarmament conference have gone unheeded.\n251.\tIt is painfully obvious, as it has always been, that any confrontation of strength between any two of the big Powers will have consequences from which neither they nor we can claim immunity. The notion that military strength deters aggression has hardly any credibility in an interdependent world and deserves to be repudiated. It is a notion which undermines all efforts aimed at achieving a disarmed world. What the world needs now-perhaps more than at any other time in history is courageous, imaginative and responsible leadership, which alone can ensure that mankind can live in a world which is not haunted by threats, real or imagined, of an impending catastrophe.\n252.\tIn the circumstances, a world disarmament conference cannot be delayed any longer. Such a conference must provide a forum for frank and constructive discussion of all aspects of arms and disarmament, including the custody and disposal of plutonium which nuclear power plants are now producing at an alarming rate.\n253.\tMy delegation welcomes the efforts of the great Powers to achieve detente in Europe. But we should like to emphasize that the process must not be confined to Europe, nor should it be made to operate merely as a regulating mechanism in the >very sensitive relations between the super-Powers.\n254.\tThe process must be universal in character if a reduction in tension is to be achieved. Areas of conflict still exist in South-East Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. In recent years, limited but costly wars have been fought in the areas in which, directly or indirectly, States possessing nuclear weapons have been involved. The involvement of those States has largely been dictated by the outmoded concept of \\\"spheres of influence\\\" and cold-war politics.\n255.\tIf the third world is to share in the benefits of detente, the various Powers must scrupulously observe the principle of mutual access in their relations with developing countries. We recognize that in the third world various Powers have acquired areas of primary interest, dictated by economic or historical affiliations; but such interests should not be seen in the framework of spheres of influence. The difference between primary and exclusive interests must be acknowledged by all. The right of developing countries to be non-aligned and to pursue political, ideological or economic relations with all the major Powers must be respected. In an interdependent world, developing countries cannot, any more than industrialized ones, develop in complete isolation from the centers of world economic power. But major-Power involvement in our affairs can only escape becoming politicized and militarized if there is an implicit agreement among those Powers both to generalize their relationships and to maintain the principle of mutual access, and if each super-Power refrains from the massive military support of selected areas in the third world as a necessary part of its global military strategy. Any such policy of selective military support by big Powers is bound to generate a regional arms race among the client States, as well as producing undesirable consequences for big-Power detente. Policies designed to contain communism, and doctrines of limited sovereignty do not promote the cause of developing countries; they have no relevance, to the aspirations of their peoples. If anything, they breed conflicts of interest and threaten peace and security in the third world.\n256.\tEntente as a means of promoting peace must also be employed in the settlement of all international issues, including the lingering problem of under-development and exploitation.\n257.\tThe glaring inequalities and imbalances in the inter-national economic structure, together with the ever widening gap between the developed and developing countries, continues to be a source of grave concern. Many resolutions have been adopted by international organizations relating to the establishment of the new international economic order founded on genuine partnership and recognition of our global interdependence. But, because of a lack of political will, particularly on the part of the industrialized countries, progress towards the implementation of these resolutions has been minimal. No headway has been made at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris. The results of the fourth session of UNCTAD fell far short of the expectations aroused by the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.\n258.\tMeanwhile, the economic situation of most of the developing countries has continued to worsen, their external payment position has deteriorated and the resultant burden of debt has reached unmanageable proportions. The majority of these countries are going through sharp crises in regard to the maintenance of minimal living standards for their peoples as well as of the momentum of development. The prospects are that these conditions will persist through-out the remainder of the present decade. In particular, the hopes placed in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] have failed to be realized. The reasons for this failure are not far to seek. They lie principally in the lack of readiness on the part of many important developed countries to adjust their policies as recommended in the Strategy with a view to achieving the agreed objectives.\n259.\tFurthermore, the upheavals that have taken place in the world economy over the past three or four years have aggravated the external constraints on the economic growth of a large number of developing countries. Indeed, these upheavals, which were not foreseen when the Strategy was conceived, have cast serious doubt on the validity in present circumstances of the policy prescriptions comprising the international development effort. It has now become clear that a new and more effective development strategy is required, a strategy which would have to be supported by a drastic upgrading of the development issue in the order of priorities of the developed countries.\n260.\tSuch a strategy should no longer set the required policy measures within the existing framework of inter-national economic relations. To do so would be to support a framework which has been largely discredited, one which embodies and perpetuates an unequal economic relationship involving the economic dependency and under-development of third-world countries. What is needed is a strategy that would reflect a restructuring of the inter-national economic system on the basis of the Declaration and Program of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly; a strategy which would be inspired by the need for balance and partnership rather than dependency in the economic relations between developed and developing countries; and, not least, a strategy embodying the concept of collective self-reliance, which would make the developing countries less dependent on the developed countries for their economic and social progress through the strengthening of trade and economic co-operation among themselves. It is in consonance with these beliefs that Ghana has participated in the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Lome Convention of 28 February 1975 between the countries of the European Economic Community and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. It is in the same spirit that we actively supported the establishment of the Economic Community of West African States.\n261.\tThe international community now recognizes the distinction between economic growth in the narrow sense of an increase in the gross product of developing countries and economic development in the wide sense of improvement in the living standards of their people. To achieve economic and social progress in this fundamental sense, my Government is committed to policies of national self- reliance based on the realities of Ghana and specifically directed both at accelerating growth in all sectors, particularly agriculture, and at reducing inequalities in the distribution of the benefits of economic growth. For we view such policy measures as an important counterpart to a revised international development strategy that would promote the realization of the new international economic order.\n262.\tThe history of the United Nations is the history of humanity's struggle for dignity and brotherhood. It is a continuing struggle for freedom and justice against fear, hunger, disease, illiteracy and exploitation. Ours is a unique endeavor to create, out of the remarkable diversity of races, cultures, opinions and attitudes of our little world, a dynamic unity of purpose and a philosophy for the attainment of peace and security. Thirty-one years is a short period in the history of the human race. It is no surprise, therefore, that we still have to meet every so often for almost interminable discussions and arguments in an effort to reach the goals we have set ourselves. The more important consideration, however, is whether we have the will to persevere. I think we have. Additionally, there is no lack of resources. Let us therefore continue to give and take in our negotiations and discussions for the good of the entire human race.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic congratulates Mr. Amerasinghe upon his election and wishes him success in his responsible work.\n100.\tWe should also like to congratulate the Republic of Seychelles on its admission to the United Nations and to wish its people success in the building of a new life.\n101.\tThe course of this debate and the contents of the previous general political debates in the General Assembly of the United Nations have .made it possible for us to draw the conclusion that the noble principles of peace, international security, freedom and independence, equality and co-operation of the peoples proclaimed by the Great October Socialist Revolution are receiving ever broader support every year.\n102.\tLike a sort of political barometer, the general debate reflects the beneficial changes which have occurred recently in international life. The clouds bearing the threat of a new world war have become noticeably less dense. The peoples of the world are increasingly enjoying the benefits of the Leninist principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, which are being put into effect, as well as the benefits of international detente. The favorable changes in the world are a result of the purposeful and persistent peaceful foreign policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of the Soviet State, of other countries of the socialist community and of all the progressive forces of our time.\n103.\tThe great interest in the United Nations shown in the new and important proposals of the Soviet Union put forward here by Comrade A. A. Gromyko [7th meeting], member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, is only natural. The concrete actions and measures provided for in those proposals are based on the program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples approved at the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n466\n104.\tThe decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of the congresses of the fraternal parties of the other countries in the socialist community and the document entitled \\\"For peace, security, cooperation and social progress in Europe\\\", adopted by the Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Europe show that the socialist States and Communists are In the vanguard of those fighting for peace, freedom, equality, brotherhood and the happiness of all peoples. They have taken initiatives and made constant efforts to strengthen peace and international security and disarmament up to and including general and complete disarmament, to eliminate existing hotbeds of war, to deepen and give substance to international detente, consistently to implement the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, and of the non-use of force in international relations, to eliminate colonialism and racism and their consequences and to organize equitable and mutually beneficial economic, scientific, technological and cultural co-operation among all States.\n105.\tAs Comrade Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has pointed out:\n\\\"In upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence, we are fighting for what is dearest of all to billions of people on earth: for the right to life itself, to save mankind from the danger of annihilation in the flames of war. At the same time, and by so doing, we are fighting to ensure favorable international conditions for the promotion of the cause of the social progress of all countries and peoples.\\\"\n106.\tThe foreign policy of the USSR and other States of the socialist community is in keeping with the interests of all peoples. It has never aimed and does not aim at seeking any unilateral advantages or the establishment of political or any other kind of domination over other peoples or countries. It is a policy of peace and international co-operation, freedom and independence of peoples, which reflects the noble ideals of the most advanced and just social system.\n107.\tIt is gratifying that in the course of the general debate the majority of delegations have based their statements on attitudes which are in keeping with the needs, of the times and the United Nations Charter. We hope that this will allow us to adopt constructive decisions and recommendations on a broad range of questions which are being considered at this session as well as to indicate fruitful ways and means of working within the framework of the United Nations in the future.\n108.\tWhile noting the usually constructive character of the general debate now under way, we cannot fail to see that the positions of a number of delegations do not indicate any clear approach to the basic problems of strengthening international peace and co-operation and the questions of disarmament which the General Assembly must take up. In a number of cases, under the cover of general phraseology and declarations, attempts are in fact being made to justify aggressors, colonialists and racists, to avoid the settlement of urgent tasks, to substitute certain questions of secondary importance and to whitewash their negative approach to the fundamental problems.\n109.\tThe interests of all people require that we do everything possible to deepen international detente and extend it to all parts of the world. Important proposals have been made here on specific forms of comprehensive co-operation among States. These proposals are valuable and realistic because they are based on the profound substance and objective of detente, namely, precluding the use or threat of force in disputes and conflicts between States, averting the threat of a new world war and organizing mutually advantageous co-operation between various countries, with strict observance of the principles of non-interference in one another's internal affairs and respect for independence and sovereignty.\n110.\tOf primary importance is the proposal of the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations [see A/31 243]. The source of this initiative is to be found in the first foreign policy act of the land of Soviets, namely, the Decree of Peace. This initiative reflects the deeply humane nature of the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet State for almost 60 years now.\n111.\tThe draft treaty submitted by the Soviet Union as an annex to its proposal stipulates that its participants, including the nuclear Powers, will undertake to refrain from the use or threat of force involving any types of weapon and to refrain from assisting, encouraging or inducing others to use or threaten force. The clear-cut articles of the draft treaty take into account existing multilateral and bilateral agreements, the present state of relations among States and the aspiration of the peoples of the world to make renunciation of the use of force an immutable law of international life.\n112.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR urges other delegations actively to join in die work of defining specific steps to lead to the implementation of these proposals in the interests of the peace and security of the peoples of the world. The conclusion of the treaty on the non-use of force, and its strict observance, would further the solution on a new basis of many important problems on which negotiations are under way, the fulfillment of the cherished dream of humanity to banish war from man's life, and the realization of the desire of all peoples, in the words of the United Nations Charter, \\\"to live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\".\n113.\tThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has laid an excellent foundation for ensuring peace on the continent-a continent which has given birth to two world wars. This document, which was worked out collectively and has consolidated achievements in the improvement of the political climate, outlined the. long-term prospects for the realistic and responsible conduct of inter-State affairs, particularly in Europe, and, from the standpoint of possibilities, to a great extent for the solution of problems of an international character. The Final Act prompts States to reduce international tensions, to cease military conflicts in those areas of the world where they still exist, and to develop and deepen mutually advantageous and equitable co-operation in all spheres.\n114.\tUnfortunately, there are certain people in the West who are trying to evade the principles elaborated and the understandings reached at the pars-European Conference. Attempts have been made to interpret arbitrarily various provisions of this document which was worked out collectively, to distort their purport and to undermine the general orientation of that Final Act.\n115.\tThe Soviet Union and other socialist States are strictly observing the letter and spirit of all provisions of the Final Act; they have put forward proposals designed to implement the understandings reached at Helsinki. Comrade Brezhnev, in his interview on French television on 5 October 1976, in which he sol forth the Soviet Union's position of principle on important international problems, said, inter alia, in connexion with the Final Act:\n\\\"As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, we respect and are carrying out in full the understandings reached at Helsinki. I repeat: in full. The important thing in these agreements is everything connected with the strengthening of security and peace. But, naturally, we in no way wish to detract from the importance of co-operation in economics, science and technology, culture and information, and in the development of personal contacts and in the implementation of measures of confidence.\\\"\nThe Soviet Union, as is well known, has proposed the convening of pan-European congresses or inter-State conferences on the questions of the protection of the human environment, the development of transport and energy, in other words, problems affecting the interests of all European States.\n116.\tThe Byelorussian people, a people which knows only too well the terrible cost of war, and which values above all the benefits of peace, has a vital interest in the full and consistent implementation of all provisions of the Final Act of the pan-European Conference. In struggling for peace and international security, the countries of the socialist community have a clear-cut objective: not only the outlawing of war, but also the elimination of the very possibility of the outbreak of war, and the elimination, on the basis of international agreements, of the material means of waging war.\n117.\tTo the credit of the United Nations there are a number of international treaties and conventions, as well as resolutions, which taken together contribute to curbing the pace of the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race, and to confining it to certain spheres. They also contain a broad program of further measures in the field of disarmament. We welcome the completion of a draft convention, agreed on in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques, and we shall seek its adoption at this session of the General Assembly [A/31/27, annex I, para. 5].\n118.\tUnfortunately, however, as has already been pointed out by many speakers in the general debate, progress in the field of disarmament is clearly inadequate. Soma States, including two nuclear Powers, are still not parties to the existing treaties and conventions which limit or prevent the arms race. The implementation of the decisions of the General Assembly with regard to the need to produce agreements providing for a general and complete cessation of nuclear weapon testing, the elimination of chemical means of warfare, and the prohibition of the development of new types and system sf weapons of mass destruction has been unjustifiably delayed.\n119.\tThe resolution [3093 (XXVIII)] on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and other States with a major economic and military potential, and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries is a resolution which has not yet been carried out. The military expenditures of a number of Western countries continue to grow; the business of trading in the instruments of death is prospering. Certain nuclear Powers are sabotaging the decision of the United Nations on the desirability of preparing for and convening a world disarmament conference. Such a situation makes it particularly imperative to implement the most important measures outlined in the memorandum of the Soviet Union on matters pertaining to the ending of the arms race and to disarmament [see AI31/232J. This document provides for realistic ways for States to agree upon the reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction, conventional weapons and armed forces, the reduction of military expenditures and the establishment of zones of peace. The memorandum proposes effective ways and means of conducting negotiations in order to achieve radical movement in the solution of disarmament problems.\n120.\tIn order to make progress towards disarmament, the joint action of all peace-loving forces is essential in order to expose and isolate the opponents of disarmament and to create conditions that would preclude the possibility of a new world war. In this respect, we take a very favorable view of the World Conference for the cessation of the arms race and for disarmament and detente, which was held from' 23 to 26 September last at Helsinki. Of great importance is the campaign for the collection of signatures for the new Stockholm appeal of the World Peace Council for the cessation of the arms race and for disarmament. More than 6.5 million people have signed it in the Byelorussian SSR\u2014that is, practically the whole adult population of the Republic.\n121.\tIt may be noted with satisfaction that a positive approach is prevailing in the United Nations as to ways and means of eliminating existing hotbeds of military conflicts.\n122: In the Middle East, there is a need for the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; the implementation of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to self-determination and the creation of their own State; the ensuring of the right to independent existence and security of all States which are direct parties to the conflict; the granting to them of appropriate international guarantees; and the cessation of the state of war between the various Arab countries and Israel. There is also growing understanding that such a just and durable settlement in the Middle East can be ensured by the Geneva Peace Conference of the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned, including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n123. With regard to the tragedy which the Lebanese people is suffering as a result of the intrigues of imperialism and Zionism, foreign interference in Lebanon must be halted, and the conflict must be solved by peaceful means by the Lebanese themselves, on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.\n124. In Cyprus, what is necessary is the implementation of the relevant decisions of the Security Council and resolutions of the General Assembly. We should take reasonable account of the interests and rights of both communities in Cyprus and observe unconditionally respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and prevent any attempts to impose on the Cypriots decisions which are alien to them.\n125. It is the bounden duty of the United Nations to force those who have engendered conflict or who have an interest in fanning the flames of conflict to respect the will of the peace-loving peoples of the world and to observe strictly the United Nations Charter.\n126: Many States quite rightly consider that the proper way of preventing new conflicts is to ensure security on the basis of joint actions by countries in various regions, including Asia, the largest continent, where over half of mankind lives. Recently, many favorable changes have occurred in Asia. The victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea have substantially improved the situation in South-East Asia and strengthened the cause of peace and security in this region.\n127.\tThe Vietnamese people have realized their cherished dream of the reunification of their State and have proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR warmly congratulates the fraternal Vietnamese people on this achievement and wishes them the speediest possible healing of the wounds of war and success in their building of a socialist society. We resolutely support the application of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for admission to the United Nations, and we express the hope that no new fabricated obstacles, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of admission to membership in the United Nations, will be created.\n128.\tFavorable conditions are now being created for the intensification of the struggle for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and for an independent, peaceful reunification of Korea, that is, the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX). There are, further, growing demands for the elimination of foreign military bases in the Indian Ocean and on the whole Asian continent.\n129: We are witnessing a favorable process of development of relations between the Soviet Union, other socialist States and the countries of Asia as well as between the countries of that region. The United Nations should promote consolidation of security in Asia on the basis of such principles as renunciation of the use of force, respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers, non\u00acinterference in internal affairs, and development of economic and other types of co-operation in conditions of full equality and mutual benefit.\n130. Anti-imperialist forces and the United Nations are entitled to regard as one of their achievements the collapse of the system of colonial oppression. However, the task of totally eliminating all hotbeds of colonialism and racism and the imperialist practice of encroaching upon the independence of peoples is something which still awaits solution. The outstanding victory of the Angolan people over the forces of international reaction, colonialism and racism has played an important part in intensifying international efforts in the struggle against colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. We are confident that the People's Republic of Angola will take its place in the United Nations.\n131.\tIn spite of mass repression and brutal tenor, the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and the Republic of South Africa has entered a decisive phase. Alarmed by this, and maneuvering in an alliance with racists and local reactionaries, imperialist circles of the West have undertaken active measures to preserve their crumbling positions there and the interests of the international monopolies. By means of very clever tricks and maneuvers, they have attempted to dampen the flame of the liberation struggle and to split the ranks of the African peoples and distract their attention from the solution of urgent tasks. No one should allow himself to be duped by the attempts of certain Western Powers to pose as ardent champions of the elimination of colonialism and racism now that the final collapse of colonialism and racism has already been determined.\n132.\tAll the achievements in the field of decolonization are a triumph of the joint actions of socialism and all anti-imperialist forces, among which the non-aligned countries occupy an important place. It is pointed out in the decisions of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries that they regard as their most important duty that of struggling against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism. The Conference welcomed progress in detente and urged that the process of detente should be extended to all parts of the world.\n133.\tThe socialist States consider that progress towards independence and social progress is closely linked with the implementation of fundamental human rights. They have every reason to pride themselves on the degree of the freely guaranteed rights of their peoples. In a socialist society, the working people have rid themselves for ever of exploitation and oppression, crises and unemployment, social and national inequality, and illiteracy and the absence of social prospects. They have wide opportunities of access to the treasures of national and world science and culture, to all the achievement; of the human genius. Everywhere, people are aware of the constant care on the part of society and the State for their health, well-being and secure old age. Under socialism, people live in conditions of genuine freedom and democracy; they are sure of the present and of the future; they work with enthusiasm to create a communist society and their living standards are constantly rising. The spiritual values and moral health of the people are protected from every kind of anti-social infringement or misinformation. The interests and rights of citizens in our society are carefully protected by State and governmental bodies, in whose activities the working people participate on a Urge scale, as well as by public organizations which the people themselves have created.\n134.\tOur people have been raised in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and they express their whole-hearted solidarity with the struggle of die African peoples against racism and apartheid. They demand the cessation of the atrocities of the Fascist junta in Chile and the immediate release of that ardent champion of freedom, Luis Corvaldn and other Chilean democrats. The Soviet people are fighting actively for respect for human rights throughout the world; they resolutely oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries and, naturally, they will not permit anyone to interfere in their affairs.\n135.\tAs we know, there are still people to be found in the West who are fond of mischief-making, of looking for Violations of human rights where none exist. They are inclined not to notice the most flagrant mass violations of human rights in Chile, in the occupied Arab territories, in Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and the Republic of South Africa. They are not averse to justifying the piratical actions of the Israeli military against Uganda and the sinister alliance of the South African racists and the Zionists. They are also advocates of their own and international monopolies, which are continuing to derive enormous profits from the young independent States and to exploit those peoples who are still languishing under the yoke of colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism. At the same time, everyone knows that in their own countries the most urgent social problems are still awaiting solution, that many elementary human rights are flouted, that corruption and bribery are rampant, and that moral degeneration is eating away at the bourgeois society.\n136.\tThe socialist States, which have united their efforts in order to bring about accelerated social and economic progress and the equalization of the level of development of the countries members of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance, are the most dynamic force in the world. The high rates of growth of productive forces, the growing efficiency of public production, the constant rise in the people's living standards, demonstrate the tremendous creative possibilities and potential of the socialist system.\n137.\tThe Byelorussian SSR has achieved impressive successes in economic and social development. During the period of the last five-year plan alone, from 1971 to 1975, the national income of the Republic increased 47 per cent and the industrial output 64 per cent.\n138.\tIn expanding their participation in international economic, scientific and technological co-operation the socialist countries are striving for the removal of discrimination and other artificial obstacles in international trade, the elimination of all manifestations of inequality, \\\"diktat\\\" and exploitation in international economic relations. When at sessions of the General Assembly, UNCTAD, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and other international organizations the developing countries put forward ways of solving the fundamental problems of their development, they meet with the understanding and necessary support of the States of the socialist community, which constantly affirm in international relations the principles of equality and mutual benefit. This has been fully and cogently stressed in the statement by the Soviet Government on the restructuring of international economic relations.\n139.\tIt is the opinion of the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR that on the whole the United Nations has real opportunities to solve the problems confronting it. Relying upon the unity and cohesion of all anti-imperialist forces and by strict adherence to its Charter and the progressive decisions adopted by the Organization on the initiative of peace-loving forces, the United Nations can and must increase its contribution to the struggle for peace and international co-operation, for the freedom and independence of peoples and for making the detente that has been achieved stable and irreversible. I wish to express the hope that the thirty-first session of the General Assembly will become an important landmark in this respect.\n"
