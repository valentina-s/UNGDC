        "file_text": "The Bahamas\ndelegation sincerely congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on\nhis election to the presidency of this Millennium\nAssembly and assures him and the members of his\nBureau of its full cooperation and support.\nI wish also to commend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of\nNamibia, who presided over the fifty-fourth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nThe Bahamas delegation also wishes to pay\nspecial tribute to the Co-Chairpersons of the\nMillennium Summit, Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of\nFinland, and Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the\nRepublic of Namibia. Their combined wisdom and\nfocused leadership contributed in no small part to the\nsuccess of the Millennium Summit.\nThe Bahamas is pleased to welcome Tuvalu as the\nnewest Member of this Organization. Tuvalu's\nmembership is a sign of the confidence that the United\nNations continues to enjoy among nations of the world\nas the best hope for the realization of the aspirations of\nall peoples.\nWe applaud the Secretary-General's continuing\ncommitment to the United Nations. This was\nparticularly demonstrated by his bold proposals for the\nreform and revitalization of the Organization, which\nculminated in the practical, responsive and visionary\nMillennium Summit Declaration. The Declaration was\nunanimously adopted by an unprecedented number of\nheads of State or Government. In this Millennium\nDeclaration, world leaders collectively and succinctly\n22\n\noutlined the labyrinth of issues on the global agenda\nfor which solutions are essential in the twenty-first\ncentury. It is now our responsibility to implement it in\ngood faith. It cannot be business as usual in this United\nNations.\nThe Millennium Declaration placed globalization\nhigh on the list of issues requiring urgent attention. As\na process offering opportunities for growth and\ndevelopment, globalization has never been challenged.\nIt is a grim reality, however, that few have profited, and\nsome, particularly smaller economies, have become\nmarginalized and even more vulnerable.\nFor many of the small island developing States of\nthe Caribbean, their mainstay industries, particularly\nbananas and financial services, have come under\nextreme pressure in this rapidly globalizing world.\nWith respect to financial services, the Bahamas has\nalways cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with\ninternational efforts to combat money laundering.\nCurrently we are amending our legislation and\nreinforcing our regulatory regime so as to fully comply\nwith international best practices.\nWhile the Bahamas will move expeditiously to\ncorrect deficiencies in our financial services industry,\nwe call upon the Financial Action Task Force on\nMoney Laundering (FATF) and the other concerned\nfinancial agencies established by developed countries\nto immediately adopt open and transparent procedures\nto recognize when such deficiencies have been\ncorrected and to then take the necessary action as a\nmatter of priority.\nAdditionally, it has been a source of serious\nconcern to us in the Bahamas that one group of\ncountries, the Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD), would seek to unilaterally\ndetermine what constitutes \u201charmful tax competition\u201d\nin respect to financial services. We urge those countries\nto cooperate in resolving these issues on the basis of\nconstructive multilateral dialogue, given that the\npressures applied in this and other areas not only\ndisrupt growth and development, but could well lead to\nthe reversal of the gains made in the development\nprocess.\nThe intensity of protests in Seattle and in\nWashington, D.C., have mirrored the frustration of\nmany developing countries in a globalization process\nwhich appears to be biased towards the rich and\npowerful and to widen the gap between haves and\nhave-nots. Yet no country can opt out of globalization.\nNor can we ignore the challenge its potentially\ndevastating consequences present for peace and\nsecurity. The United Nations resolve that globalization\nmust be fully inclusive and equitable should be\nbuttressed with effective action to ensure a vibrant\nglobal economic order in which all countries, large and\nsmall, developed and developing, mutually benefit.\nThe Bahamas is now an observer in the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) and will move purposefully\ntowards full membership. We have chosen to take this\ncourse of action because we intend to participate fully\nin the WTO processes. These processes should, and\nmust, make globalization and trade liberalization\ninclusive and equitable instruments for development.\nWe made this commitment at the highest level at the\nMillennium Summit.\nThere is another commitment in the Millennium\nDeclaration that is of critical importance to small\nisland developing States such as the Bahamas and other\nmembers of the Caribbean Community. The\nMillennium Declaration reaffirms the United Nations\nresolve to address the special needs of the small island\ndeveloping States by implementing both the Barbados\nProgramme of Action and the outcome of the twentysecond special session of the General Assembly on this\nplan. It did so in recognition of the vulnerability of\ntheir economies to external shocks and their\nsusceptibility to climate change, sea level rise and\nnatural disasters.\nI wish to re-emphasize here that the call in the\nBarbados plan is for action. In line with the\nMillennium Declaration and their own national efforts,\nthe small island developing States now expect action,\nthrough initiatives such as global disaster management\nstrategies and a vulnerability index. Such initiatives\nmust take fully into account the socio-economic\ndevelopment and survival of small island developing\nStates. For Caribbean Community (CARICOM) small\nStates, we also hope to see the development of an\nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea\nadvanced.\nWe would also, in this United Nations, urge our\npartners in the developed world not to continue to put\nour countries at risk by shipping nuclear and hazardous\nwastes through the Caribbean Sea. We reiterate this\nappeal in the face of recent evidence that suggests that\n23\n\nthe highly professed safety measures touted by the\nnuclear-power industry are questionable.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\ncommitted themselves to overcoming many seemingly\nintractable problems for which effective responses can\nonly be of a global nature.\nThe world's drug problem, and the trafficking in\nsmall arms and light weapons, are issues for which the\nglobal community urgently needs results. While these\ntwin evils are, in our view, closely linked, every\nindication is that the trafficking in firearms is taking on\na life of its own. The introduction of firearms into\nordinary, non-drug related criminal activity, and even\ndomestic conflict, is perhaps the greatest single threat\nto peace and stability in the Bahamas today.\nTherefore, the Bahamas looks forward to next\nyear's United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We\nare confident that the commitments made in our\nMillennium Declaration will motivate us to grasp this\nsignificant opportunity for concerted action. We\nespecially urge developed countries in which firearms\nare manufactured to take the steps necessary to prevent\nillicit arms trafficking.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\ncommitted themselves to the eradication of poverty,\nhunger and disease, and to making the right to\ndevelopment a reality for all. This commitment\ncompels us to act on several fronts to achieve our\nobjectives. We must, for example, reach agreement to\nensure the success of the high-level international and\nintergovernmental event on financing for development,\nto be held in the year 2001.\nOur commitment means that we must ensure that\ntechnological advances benefit not just the few, but all\nof humankind. We must work more assiduously\ntowards the elimination of human rights violations,\nincluding violence against women and the trafficking\nin women and children. We must ensure equal rights\nfor men and women, to bring down barriers to\ndevelopment. For countries such as the Bahamas,\nforced to bear the brunt of sustained illegal migration,\nthe United Nations must collectively address not only\nthe challenges of migration flows worldwide, but also\nthe reprehensible practice of alien-smuggling.\nOur commitment means that we must achieve a\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\nAddressing the unfolding human tragedy of HIV/\nAIDS is also an important front on which the\nMillennium Declaration charges us to work. The\npernicious effect of this disease, particularly on the\neconomically productive sectors of society, has had a\ndevastating impact on families, communities and\nnations globally. However, the major burden that AIDS\npresents, particularly for health care systems, has been\nmost profoundly felt in developing countries, where it\nthreatens to limit and reverse development efforts.\nAdequate resources must be provided to confront HIV/\nAIDS, particularly in Africa. In this regard, the\npharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to play its\nnecessary role.\nThe Bahamas welcomed the recently convened\nconference in Barbados under the auspices of the\nWorld Bank, UNAIDS, the Pan American Health\nOrganization/World Health Organization (PAHO/\nWHO), the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), CARICOM and the Canadian International\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), which brought together\nhigh-level Caribbean health, education, economic\ndevelopment and labour policy-makers. The Bahamas\nis committed to doing its part in addressing this serious\nproblem and has offered to host a regional centre to\nassist in combating this HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nThe agenda set for the United Nations by world\nleaders is a formidable one. Forgive me if I restate the\nobvious \u2014 the Secretary-General cannot carry out the\ncrucial mandates we ourselves have entrusted to him\nunless and until he is assured of adequate and\npredictable resources on a timely basis. At the same\ntime, the quotas on the basis of which the Organization\nreceives its resources must be assessed in a fair,\ntransparent and equitable manner. Only in this way will\nwe be able to give renewed impetus to the vibrant\nprocess of administrative and budgetary reform\ncurrently under way. By so doing, we will also break\nthe cycle of the Organization's inability to implement\nthe mandates that we ourselves have collectively set.\nFurthermore, we must arrest the process whereby\nmany issues, including some of critical concern to\ndeveloping countries, have been moved out of the\nambit of this universal Organization into narrower,\nspecial interest organizations. These organizations\nharmonize and seek the interest of their Member States.\nTherefore, the decisions they take can run counter, not\nonly to the interest of non-Member States, but also to\nthat of global society as a whole.\n24\n\nAllow me to raise one more serious concern - the\nsafety and security of our international civil service,\nthe dedicated men and women who are the embodiment\nof the United Nations global outreach. In this respect,\nwe extend our profound condolences to the families of\nthe staff members who lost their lives as a result of the\nrecent attack on the United Nations office in West\nTimor. We also join other delegations in condemning\nthis attack and in urging the Government of Indonesia\nto spare no effort in bringing those responsible to\njustice. We also extend condolences to the family of\nthe United Nations refugee worker killed in an attack\nin Guinea. In situations such as these, we must show\nthat we can meet the concerns of our peoples and our\nworld.\nThrough the historic Millennium Declaration,\nheads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith in\nthe United Nations and its Charter as indispensable\nfoundations for a more peaceful, prosperous and just\nworld. They also emphasized that the United Nations is\nthe pre-eminent global organization and has a central\nrole in setting and acting upon the global agenda.\nHeads of State and Government equally provided us\nwith a concise, focused and realistic blueprint for\naction by the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury. They have charged the Secretary-General to\nkeep a score-card, the results of which will determine\nwhether we have been true and honourable custodians\nof the United Nations Charter. It is imperative for us to\ndemonstrate individually, and through our collective\nefforts, that we can leave for succeeding generations\nthe kind of world envisioned in our Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am\nvery pleased on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of Guinea to convey to Mr. Harri Holkeri\nof Finland our warmest congratulations on his\nunanimous election to preside over our deliberations at\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His\nelection highlighted his merits, his personal qualities\nand his rich experience in international affairs. It also\nreflected the high esteem in which the international\ncommunity holds his great country, Finland, whose\ncommitment to the ideals of peace, justice, progress\nand the advancement of women is well known and\nappreciated by one and all. As a member of the General\nCommittee at this session, my delegation wishes to\nassure the President of its support and full cooperation.\nIt gives me pleasure also to pay tribute to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, who\nhonourably carried out his weighty responsibilities in\nthe service of the Organization.\nLet me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose exemplary work at the helm of\nthe Organization merits our highest appreciation and\nour support. I take this opportunity moreover to thank\nthe Secretary-General for his report (A/54/2000)\nentitled \u201cWe the peoples: the role of the United Nations\nin the twenty-first century\u201d. That remarkable document\ntakes account of all the current concerns of Member\nStates.\nI welcome the admission of the State of Tuvalu as\nthe one hundred eighty-ninth Member of the\nOrganization. This reinforces the universality of the\nUnited Nations.\nThis session of the General Assembly is a historic\none. It is taking place just as the Organization has\nsuccessfully concluded the Millennium Summit, which\nbrought together in this Hall nearly all the world's\nleaders. The outcome of that important Summit is a\nsource of hope for our peoples at the dawn of the new\nmillennium.\nJust one week ago, from this very rostrum, the\nPrime Minister of Guinea informed the international\ncommunity of a barbarous act of aggression against the\nRepublic of Guinea, an act of aggression whose sole\naim was to destabilize my country. Deadly, devastating\nattacks have been carried out against the peaceful\npopulation of Guinea. These were led by armed gangs\nfrom Liberia, but it is regrettable to have to note that\nanother fraternal African country, Burkina Faso, has\nalso been involved in the aggression. The Republic of\nGuinea, a land of peace and hospitality, which has paid\nan enormous price by receiving hundreds of thousands\nof refugees and which is working for the restoration of\npeace and harmony in West Africa, has thus been the\nvictim of aggression by the same people who caused\nthe genocide and mutilations in Liberia and in Sierra\nLeone.\n41\n\nI urgently call on the international community\nstrongly to condemn this aggression, which is part of a\nplan to destabilize the subregion. It is this that justifies\nmy Government's request to the Security Council that\nvigorous measures be taken to guarantee peace,\nsecurity and stability in the West African region.\nThe Government of Guinea has had to face the\nsevere consequences of the massive presence of\n800,000 on its territory for the past decade, and it has\nbeen obliged to divert resources from our country's\neconomic development programmes. That is why my\nGovernment is most grateful for the United Nations\ninitiative to convene a conference for support and\nsolidarity with respect to Guinea. On behalf of my\nGovernment, I wish once again to convey my\ndelegation's sincere thanks to the Secretary-General\nand to all others who have contributed to this important\ninitiative. My country looks forward with great interest\nto the completion of this initiative with the convening\nof a second meeting, scheduled to be held in November\nat Geneva.\nThis is the proper moment for my delegation to\nturn to the thorny question of conflict in Africa.\nIndeed, many of the crises that have emerged on our\ncontinent pose a threat to peace and constitute a grave\nviolation of the principles and purposes of the United\nNations. The scope of these crises and their proliferation\njeopardizes all efforts at national development and at\nachieving subregional integration. I take this opportunity to\nwelcome the report (A/55/305) of the Panel on United\nNations Peace Operations, chaired by Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi. Its recommendations enabled the Security\nCouncil to adopt an important resolution on ensuring an\neffective role for the Council in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, particularly in Africa. My\ndelegation hopes that the new provisions of that resolution\nwill be used to guarantee the effectiveness of United\nNations peacekeeping operations.\nAmong the central priorities of Africa, which\nremains the theatre of many conflicts, is the\nstrengthening of its capacity to prevent, manage and\nresolve conflicts. Thus, whether it be the conflict\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea or the situation in the\nGreat Lakes region, in Angola or in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, there have been significant\nbreakthroughs in the pursuit of peaceful, just and\nlasting solutions, thanks to concerted action by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\nNations.\nIn the West African region, the quest for peace in\nSierra Leone is continuing with the commendable\nassistance of States members of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and\nwith the active support of the United Nations, through\nthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL). My delegation expresses its full\nsupport for Security Council resolution 1306 (2000),\nwhich placed an embargo on the illegal sale of\ndiamonds from conflict zones. We appeal urgently to\nall States and to all specialized agencies to cooperate\nactively in the effective implementation of that\nresolution.\nThe proliferation and uncontrolled distribution of\nlight weapons is another subject of grave concern, and\nis a major factor complicating and prolonging conflicts\nin Africa and, more tragically, encouraging the\nrecruitment of child soldiers. Indeed, the resurgence of\nrebel movements and the expansion of large-scale\nbanditry in our countries have been made possible by\nthat phenomenon. The firm support of the international\ncommunity is required to eradicate it. In that\nconnection, my delegation is pleased at the initiatives\ntaken by the United Nations and by the OAU to support\nthe efforts of our States to combat this scourge, which\nthreatens the stability of our continent.\nThe beginning of the third millennium brings\nmany challenges and hopes. It brings the hope of\nseeing a plan for the settlement to the conflict in\nWestern Sahara, thanks to the joint efforts of the OAU\nand the United Nations, and the hope of finally seeing\nIsrael and its Arab neighbours give peace a chance\nthrough a just and lasting settlement to the crisis,\ntaking into account the legitimate aspirations of the\nPalestinian people, as well as the respect for the rights\nand dignity of all peoples in the region.\nThe question of development remains one of the\nmajor challenges of this century, and as such it must\nremain at the centre of our Organization's concerns.\nAt a time when a portion of the planet has\ncontentedly crossed the threshold of this new\nmillennium and is embarking, under the rubric of\nglobalization, on what is called \u201cthe new economy\u201d, a\nmajor portion of the world \u2014 indeed, the largest\nportion \u2014 continues to live in poverty, suffering the\nperverse effects of this globalization.\nWith regard to the alarming situation prevailing\non the African continent, the main concern of the\n42\n\npeoples of the United Nations must be Africa, so that\nthe root causes of its non-development can be\neradicated and so that it can be enabled to eliminate\npoverty and enhance its capacities in order for it to\nhave better access to markets. To do that, debt\ncancellation, an increase in official development\nassistance and better attention to its specific needs\nshould make it possible to integrate the African\ncontinent into the world economy. That is why my\ndelegation, based on the correlation between peace and\ndevelopment, is pleased at the recent decisions taken\nby the G-8 in Okinawa, aimed at more effectively\ncombating poverty and at bridging the digital gap\nbetween the North and the South and at humanizing\nglobalization.\nIn that respect, my country calls for more\nsolidarity on the part of the rich countries, and we\ndeeply hope that \u2014 over and above professions of\ngood faith \u2014 concrete measures will be taken to allow\nthe developing countries, particularly those in Africa,\nto experience sustained growth leading to sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWith that in mind, my delegation appeals to all its\ndevelopment partners to contribute, by means of more\ngenerous and better-targeted aid, to strengthening the\ninstitutional capacities of our States and to creating\nadequate infrastructures, which guarantee balanced\ndevelopment and success in the struggle against\npoverty.\nThe Republic of Guinea is very much concerned\nby the ravages of the AIDS virus. We believe that this\nbattle must further mobilize the international\ncommunity so that the necessary sacrifices can be made\nto halt this scourge, which has taken more victims in\nAfrica than anywhere else in the world. That is why my\ndelegation supports the important decisions that\nresulted from the recent International Conference held\nin Durban, South Africa.\nThe protection of fundamental human rights, the\nsatisfaction of priority human needs and social justice\nmust remain at the forefront of United Nations\nconcerns. The United Nations, in its irreplaceable role\nas an instrument for the promotion of cooperation and\nunderstanding between peoples, must strengthen the\nculture of peace and sharing.\nToday it is unanimously acknowledged that the\nUnited Nations can continue to play an effective role\nonly if there is a necessary reform of its organs, in\nparticular the Security Council, which has the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. The aspirations of strengthening its\nauthority and ensuring more equitable representation in\nthe Council for the Organization's Members have been\nreiterated many times by the overwhelming majority of\nUnited Nations Members, and recently by virtually all\nof the heads of State or Government during the\nMillennium Summit. We must also restore to the\nGeneral Assembly its central role as the main\ndeliberative body and, finally, reform the other organs,\nwith a view to a greater revitalization of the entire\nUnited Nations system. These are the aspirations of the\npeoples of the United Nations \u2014 to enable this\nOrganization to face the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIn his statement at the Millennium Summit, the\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Guinea reiterated the\ntotal commitment of our country to the principles of\nthe United Nations and to the Charter. In this\nAssembly, I would like to reaffirm this commitment,\nwhich has never been found wanting in the history of\nmy country. Under the leadership of its President,\nGeneral Lansana Cont\u00e9, a man of peace and dialogue,\nGuinea has always struggled to uplift human dignity, to\ndefend freedom, to restore peace and to cultivate\nharmony among peoples.\nGuinea will continue, side by side with other\nMember States of our Organization, to work resolutely\nto free humankind from the spectre of war, violence,\nexclusion and intolerance, and for a world of peace,\njustice and solidarity for all."

        "file_text": "Allow me first to\nassociate myself with the statement by my colleague,\nthe French Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of\nthe European Union. May I also congratulate you,\nMr. Vice-President, and through you, President\nHolkeri, on your election to preside over this\nmillennium Assembly.\nA few days ago, leaders from all over the world\ngathered at the Millennium Summit. They gathered to\nreaffirm their faith in the Charter and to give direction\nto the United Nations in the twenty-first century. The\nCharter remains as relevant as ever with its mandate to\npromote peace and security, create an international\ncommunity based on the rule of law, uphold respect for\nhuman rights and promote social development.\nThe new millennium brings new challenges to the\nUnited Nations in an ever more globalized world.\nIncreased communication between countries and\npeoples reinforces the need for common norms of\nsocial and economic behaviour. The global United\nNations conferences within the last decade bear witness\nto the value of the United Nations as a unique norm\nsetting forum. The follow up conferences to the social\nSummit in Copenhagen and the Beijing Conference on\nWomen are cases in point.\nThese United Nations summits have advanced our\nunderstanding of the interaction between peace,\ndevelopment and human rights. The United Nations\nprocess on financing for development offers an\nopportunity for renewed commitment and action. The\nrelationship between social development and\npromotion of human rights is today recognized. The\nbest preventive action against conflict and strife is to\nensure sound economic and social development based\non good governance, respect for human rights and\nprotection of minorities.\nAn encouraging and innovative feature is the\ndecision adopted by the Economic and Social Council\nin July to establish a permanent forum on indigenous\nissues thereby advancing the aspirations of indigenous\npeoples. The Danish Government and the home rule\nGovernment of Greenland welcome this recent\ndevelopment. We will actively support the work of the\npermanent forum.\nI welcome the fact that the Security Council has\nshown increasing attention to humanitarian issues. The\nopen meeting in the Council on Africa in January gave\nnew prominence to the humanitarian challenges for this\ncontinent. In the past year, the Council has taken up\nissues as diverse as AIDS in Africa, protection of\ncivilians in armed conflicts and children in armed\nconflict. These initiatives increase our awareness of the\nroot causes of conflict.\nThe international community must shoulder its\nresponsibility in relation to the AIDS epidemic in sub-\nSaharan Africa. The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS could\nseal the fate of more than 30 million Africans over the\nnext five years and epidemic undermines decades of\ndevelopment efforts and dissolves the social texture of\nnations. It could destabilize entire regions. The AIDS\nepidemic is not a local problem. It is a matter of\nsecurity of global importance. Africa has enormous\npotential but millions continue to survive on less than\none dollar a day.\nThe growing transfer of private capital rarely\nflows to the countries in Africa. We must do more to\nintegrate Africa into the world economy. Trade\nopportunities must be improved. We must give free\naccess to the markets of industrialized countries, as\nwell as to products where African countries have a\ngenuine competitive advantage.\nThe legal framework of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) must take into account the special\ndifficulties of developing countries. Trade-related\ntechnical assistance must be improved.\nPeace and security, we know, are fundamental\nconditions for economic and social development. War,\ninternal strife and political unrest have devastated large\nparts of Africa, causing untold human suffering and\ndestruction. No one should expect easy solutions, but\nwe must work together to prevent and resolve armed\nconflicts in Africa.\nWe witness an increased African effort in the\nfield of peace and security. The international\ncommunity must support this trend through our active\ninvolvement. We must assist in capacity-building by\nrelevant African organizations, and by backing United\nNations peacekeeping efforts. Africa itself must create\nthe conditions for international involvement. We\nwelcome the initiatives by the Security Council to\ncreate common ground for United Nations\npeacekeeping operations by inviting the parties\ninvolved to discussions and special sessions of the\nCouncil in New York.\nAlthough the Camp David talks did not bring\nabout an agreement in the Middle East, they\nrepresented a major step forward. They helped to\nnarrow down differences on key issues. A\nbreakthrough has never before seemed so close at hand.\nTime, however, is quickly running out. I urge the\nparties to seize this historic opportunity. I salute the\npolitical courage displayed by the Israeli and the\nPalestinian leadership in their efforts to achieve a\ndurable solution. I welcome the recent decision by the\nPalestinian Central Council to defer the decision on the\nquestion of statehood in the interest of further\nnegotiations.\nDemocracy is a peacemaker. Democracies are\nmuch less prone to violent conflicts. The Secretary-\nGeneral recently called attention to what he called fig\nleaf democracies. The fig leaf of elections does not by\nitself turn a dictatorship into a democracy. Elections\ncan even lead to a backlash as frustrations rise and\ntensions turn into violence.\nDenmark increasingly turns her efforts towards\nthe prevention and management of violent conflicts in\nline with our comprehensive engagement in developing\ncountries and active involvement in United Nations\npeacekeeping activities. We will strengthen this ability\nto react quickly and effectively.\nWe will also continue to support regional\ncooperation also when it comes to countering the\nuncontrolled spread of small arms. Landmines are\nsubstantial obstacles to development. Increased efforts\nby the United Nations, Governments and non-\ngovernmental organizations are necessary. Right now,\nnew momentum is needed. The second meeting of\nStates Parties to the Ottawa Convention provides an\nimportant opportunity.\nPeace operations are no longer a question of\nmerely keeping the warring parties apart or monitoring\nceasefires. They are a comprehensive and complex\nundertaking involving disarmament, demobilization of\ncombatants, supervision of elections, monitoring of\nhuman rights and training of local police among others.\nWe must enable the United Nations to adapt to the new\nrealities, do things better and avoid such failures as\nhappened in Rwanda. I fully support the\nrecommendations in the Brahimi Report on United\nNations peace operations. We must provide stronger\npolitical and financial support to the Organization. I\nwelcome the proposed shift towards the use of civilian\npolice and the rule of law, as I welcome the focus on\nrapid deployment of military and civilian personnel.\nPolice and judicial experts are indispensable to\nrebuilding the economy in civil society, and their work\nmust be based on a solid peace-building strategy. Close\ncooperation between the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations is called for. We must\nestablish a partnership between the United Nations and\nregional actors.\nLast year the Secretary-General called upon\nMember States to pursue more effective policies to stop\n33\n\norganized mass murder and violations of human rights.\nI fully support this view. We cannot leave large groups\nof people unaided where national authorities do not\nlive up to their responsibilities. Conflicts in Kosovo\nand East Timor raise serious questions with regard to\nsome of the classic principles of international law, the\nprinciple of State sovereignty, the principle of respect\nfor human rights and the principle of the non-use of\nforce in international relations. On the one hand, we\nhad a basic rule of international law incorporated into\nthe United Nations Charter \u00f3 that the use of force in\ninternational relations is prohibited unless authorized\nby the Security Council or in self-defence. On the other\nhand, many countries find that there is a political and\nmoral obligation to act in the face of atrocities causing\nlarge-scale human suffering within another State.\nThere is no clear-cut solution to this dilemma.\nBut surely no legal principle, including sovereignty,\ncan be used as a shield to commit crimes against\nhumanity and other serious violations of human rights.\nThe Security Council has a moral obligation to act on\nbehalf of the international community. We must\nremember that the United Nations was founded, in the\nwords of the Charter, in order to reaffirm faith in\nfundamental human rights. Any intervention reflects a\nfailure of prevention. As a last resort, the international\ncommunity must have the ability to act in the face of\norganized mass murder or ethnic-cleansing, even if the\nSecurity Council is blocked. The challenge is to keep\nopen the option of humanitarian intervention without\nSecurity Council authorization in extreme cases, but to\ndo so without jeopardizing the international legal order.\nWe must ensure that the Security Council\nfunctions as effectively as possible. If not, the\ninfluence of the Council will be diminished. The\npermanent members of the Security Council should\napply the right of veto only in matters of vital\nimportance. Therefore, I reiterate my proposal to\nestablish a procedural rule; a rule according to which a\npermanent member of the Security Council would have\nto state the reasons why it has decided to exercise its\nright of veto in a given situation. Furthermore, the\nMember State should state on which grounds it\nconsiders that matters of vital importance are at stake. I\nhope that this idea can be further developed and that it\ncan gain broad support.\nI have addressed new challenges and possibilities\nat the start of the new millennium. Let me end by\nreminding this Assembly that old challenges still need\nto be addressed. Weapons of mass destruction are a\nlethal legacy of the cold war. They need our continued\nattention. Certain States are still pursuing the\nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and\nbuilding a missile capacity. There is a need for further\nimprovement of the international non-proliferation\nregimes. Peace, development and human rights have\nbeen the essentials in the work of the United Nations\nfrom the very beginning. They remain essential. The\nprimary responsibility for a more peaceful, prosperous\nand just world rests with Governments, but the United\nNations is here to help us. The Millennium Summit\nconfirmed our common will to work together as truly\nunited nations.\nI cannot leave this Assembly without expressing\nmy deep concern at the situation in Burma. The\ntreatment of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is a disgrace, and\nI call on the regime in Burma to immediately restore\nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom of speech,\nmovement and communication."

        "file_text": "It\ngives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of this General\nAssembly session. We are confident that the posts you\nhave assumed in your country and the international\nrespect that you enjoy will facilitate the task entrusted\nto you in leading the deliberations of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia for his\nefforts in leading the work of the previous session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. I would be remiss if I failed to\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nefforts to maintain the principles and purposes of the\nCharter and for the distinguished role he has played in\ncrystallizing the idea of convening the Millennium\nSummit last week. It was indeed an unusual event in\nUnited Nations history.\nThe historic Millennium Summit Declaration\nconfirmed unequivocally and clearly the commitment\nof all the Heads of State and Government of the world\nto the principles and purposes of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. We believe that the absence of any\nsubstantial difference between the Charter and the\nDeclaration is an important achievement in itself. The\nhistoric Declaration issued by the Millennium Summit\nmay be considered, in one way or another, as a\nrenewed vote of confidence in the Charter, particularly,\nas the world has recently witnessed major changes and\ndangerous challenges. One may therefore conclude that\nthe principles and purposes adopted by peoples and\nnations do not undergo major changes with the passage\nof time.\nIt would be wrong to underestimate the\nsignificance of this conclusion for the history of the\nUnited Nations. The end of the cold war did not\nprevent the peoples and nations of the world from\ndenouncing and condemning crimes of aggression,\nethnic-cleansing, foreign occupation, oppression,\nextremism, injustice, corruption, racism and double\nstandards. Nor did this make us hesitate to glorify\nmany noble objectives, such as freedom, peace,\nequality, solidarity, tolerance, human rights and social\njustice.\nIt is fortunate that third world countries and poor\ncountries host large populations with bountiful\nresources and great heritage. This constitutes a safety\nnet for those countries that were able to contribute to\nmaintaining the principles and purposes of the United\nNations when drafting the Millennium Declaration.\nThis explains the lack of any reference to the new\nworld order, either in the Millennium Summit\nDeclaration or in any other official text. Regrettably,\nhowever, this becomes evident in reality, whereby\nhegemony seems to have the upper hand in the\ninternational arena.\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations was\nthe main topic on the Summit's agenda. This role\nwould also become clear in reforming the Security\n18\n\nCouncil and expanding its membership. The United\nNations membership considers the Council the\nOrganization's primary organ. This reform process\nshould be accomplished by expanding the Security\nCouncil membership, the granting of equitable and fair\ngeographical representation and the gradual phasing\nout of the use of the right of veto, which contradicts the\nconcept of democracy, particularly when its aim is\nnothing short of undermining the democratic process.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations have\ncontributed to creating conditions conducive to ending\nthe deterioration of security conditions in many\ncountries of the world. Throughout the past years, the\nSyrian Arab Republic has done everything it could to\npreserve the security and safety of United Nations\npeacekeeping personnel and to ensure that they\nsuccessfully carry out their missions and mandates. But\npeacekeeping operations must be confined to enforcing\nUnited Nations resolutions and those of international\nlegitimacy. The Security Council has therefore to\nenforce its resolutions so that peacekeeping operations\nwill not simply become operations to impose the status\nquo, which makes the achievement of true peace a very\nelusive objective.\nThe peace process launched in Madrid has been\nlosing its momentum, incentive and compass, day after\nday and year after year. The Security Council, which\nhas the authority and international legitimacy to\nenforce its own resolutions, has been kept out of the\nMiddle East peace process. It has become a silent\nwitness to the fact that the peace process in the Middle\nEast has reached a dead end.\nIt has become quite obvious to all those involved\nin the peace process, both inside and outside our\nregion, that continued Israeli occupation of Arab\nterritories  which is sometimes explained by Israel's\npsychological need for security and at other times by\nsuperstitious myths  is the major obstacle on the road\nto peace. Those futile claims, which have no\nfoundation in reality whatsoever, have caused the peace\nprocess to become an endless negotiating process with\nneither end nor resolution in sight.\nAt any rate, the serious and carefully considered\nnegotiations that Syria has conducted have proven to\nthe international community at large, and to Arabs in\nparticular, two main things: first, that Israel is neither\ndesirous of, nor serious about, pursuing a just and\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with United\nNations resolutions; and, secondly, that Syria has the\nright to a full return of the entire Golan, to the 4 June\n1967 line, without concessions or compromises.\nWe would like to mention another fact known to\nour foes and friends alike. That fact is that Syria has\nunreservedly supported every Arab and Palestinian\nright during every stage of the peace talks. It did not\ntake those positions to embarrass anyone or to\nnegotiate on their behalf. As a matter of principle,\nSyria has been, and continues to be, committed to the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to\ntheir lands, to self-determination, and to establish their\nindependent State on their national soil. On that basis,\nSyria presented its position clearly and firmly at the\nmeeting of the Jerusalem Committee that was convened\nin Morocco at the end of last month in support of the\nrights of Muslims and Arabs to full and\nuncompromised Palestinian sovereignty over Al-Quds\nAl-Sharif.\nThe Arabs are an ancient and time-honoured\nnation known for its religious tolerance. But tolerance\nis one thing and conceding one's rights is something\nelse. Territory and sovereignty are matters of national\ndignity that can never be forfeited or compromised.\nAt the Millennium Summit, the countries of the\nworld expressed their belief that we live today in an\nage of international law and under the United Nations\nCharter, international legitimacy and human rights, and\nnot in an age of the law of the jungle and futile\nreligious claims to justify the usurpation of other\npeoples' land by force. This requires from the\ninternational community and the United Nations a\nmore firm and non-selective stand in defending the\nCharter and international law and in prompting Israel\nto respect international legitimacy and international\nconventions and to implement the resolutions of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe brotherly Lebanese people have achieved a\nhistoric milestone, thanks to their solidarity and that of\ntheir State, in strongly resisting Israeli occupation.\nSyria stood by Lebanon firmly in order to ensure the\nfull implementation of resolution 425 (1978). Syria\nwill always stand by Lebanon and support all its\nnational issues, especially the ones concerning the\nreturn of all its territory and the return of its hostages\nheld in Israeli jails. In this regard, we urge the donor\ncountries to fulfil their commitments to help Lebanon\nrebuild what Israel has destroyed, particularly the\n19\n\ndamage it caused during its occupation of southern\nLebanon.\nFrom this international forum, Syria would like\nonce again to stress the great importance it attaches to\nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq. We call for\nrelieving the suffering of the Iraqi people by lifting the\neconomic sanctions that only affect the people. We also\nstand against any measures taken against Iraq outside\nthe context of United Nations resolutions so that those\nresolutions will retain the necessary credibility to bring\nabout their implementation.\nWe also deem it necessary to find a just and\nhumane solution to the question of Kuwaiti and other\nprisoners of war, within a practical framework agreed\nupon between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi sides. We do not\nwant the issue of prisoners of war and missing persons\nto remain outside the human and political framework\nthat will allow us to arrive at a solution.\nSyria also calls upon the Security Council to\nquickly and permanently lift the sanctions it imposed\nagainst Libya. Libya has delivered on all its\ncommitments under Security Council resolutions. We\nfully support Libya's demands.\nIn view of the strong, brotherly relations between\nSyria, the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, we call upon the two neighbouring\ncountries to pursue negotiations to resolve peacefully\nthe dispute over the three islands on the basis of the\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and mutual respect.\nSyria believes that the establishment of a trilateral\ncommittee to pave the way for direct negotiations\nbetween Iran and the United Arab Emirates through the\ncreation of favourable conditions is a practical\ninitiative. We hope that it will allow the two parties to\narrive at a satisfactory conclusion.\nWe would like to welcome the achievements of\nthe representatives of Somalia in forming a temporary\nSomali parliament and electing Mr. AbdiKassim Salad\nHassan as President of democratic Somalia. We\nconsider these achievements as major pillars for the\nrestoration of Somali State institutions. We call upon\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to\nhelp Somalis carry out the tasks of reconstruction and\nrehabilitation.\nThe continued tragic situation in Afghanistan is a\nsource of great concern to us. We are convinced that\nthe problem of Afghanistan can only be solved by\nstopping the fighting and beginning negotiations aimed\nat achieving national reconciliation. It must also be\nsolved by finding an acceptable and permanent\npolitical settlement that brings about security and\nstability for the Afghan people. Many Arab and Islamic\ncountries fear that continued and senseless fighting in\nAfghanistan may lead to undermining the concept of\nthe State in that country and to destroying its heritage\nand whatever is left of its historic traditions.\nSyria welcomes the discussions convened at the\nhighest level in Pyongyang in June 2000. We express\nthe hope that this rapprochement between the two\nKoreas will contribute to achieving the aspirations of\nthe Korean people in reunifying the peninsula through\npeaceful means.\nThere was a consensus in the statements delivered\nat the Millennium Summit and in the Summit\nDeclaration about the need to exert all possible efforts\nto rid humanity of the humiliating and inhumane\nconditions of extreme poverty, in which more than a\nbillion people live. The Summit stressed the\ncommitment of Member States to basic human rights,\nas well as to the right of every country to development.\nWe think this will require developing a new economic\ninternational order that is just, fair and democratic. It\nwill also require finding a multilateral commercial and\nfinancial system characterized by transparency,\nequality and non-discrimination. We must also find the\nbest mechanism possible to solve developmental\nproblems, especially on the African continent. Such a\nsystem should also give preferential treatment to\ndeveloping countries in order to facilitate investment\nand the transfer of technology and know-how. That\nwould allow for full, effective and equal participation\nby the South in the process of decision-making at the\ninternational level. Although these requests seem far-\nfetched now, they will in the final analysis serve all\nparties and States, whether they be rich or poor, in the\nNorth or in the South.\nWe had fervently hoped that a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East would have\nbeen achieved by the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury and with the ushering in of this new\nmillennium. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. Peace\nwill remain our strategic choice and that of all peoples\nwho aspire to a bright future in which peace, security\nand prosperity prevail for human beings everywhere."

        "file_text": "As head of the delegation of the\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, and on behalf of His\nExcellency Don Santiago Nsobeya Efuman, Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and\nFrancophone Affairs, I am honoured to address the\nAssembly.\nFirst, I congratulate you, Sir, former Prime\nMinister of Finland, on your election to preside over\nthe deliberations of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfifth session. We also sincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister\nRepublic of Namibia, on the excellent work\naccomplished during the previous session and on his\nacclaimed activities in coordinating the preparations\nfor the Millennium Summit, which has just ended.\nI also take this opportunity to extend particular\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, and his team for their full commitment to\npromoting the mandate of the United Nations, as well\nas for the plan to strengthen its future work, as\nreflected in his outstanding report.\nWe warmly welcome the Republic of Tuvalu to\nthe United Nations.\nJust two weeks ago we celebrated within these\nfour walls the most important event in the history of\nhumankind, when our heads of State and Government\nestablished general guidelines that must govern the\nfuture of our Organization, and that form a strong\nfoundation on which we can, and must, work. We must\nnow follow up all the proposals and recommendations\nmade by our leaders, with the firm goal of\nimplementing them, which would result in a promising\nfuture for all nations \u2014 those of the North and South\nand East and West.\nHis Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,\nPresident of the Republic, head of State and founding\nchairman of the Democratic Party of Equatorial\nGuinea, in his address on the first day of the\nMillennium Summit, affirmed that the turn of the\ncentury showed us a threatened world, one constantly\nin danger of collapse and in a permanent state of\nuncertainty about its destiny and the survival of\nhumankind, one that conveyed an apocalyptic feeling\nthat was shared by all alike \u2014 nations large and small,\nrich and poor.\nIn order to follow up the proposals and\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit, we must\nstart with the fact that democracy begins at home. In\nour specific case, that means the United Nations, which\nis our shared home, where the voice of the majority\nmust prevail; that is a basic principle of the historic\nSan Francisco Charter of 1945.\nEquatorial Guinea therefore joins the call for\nurgent, much needed reform and empowerment of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 an appropriate formula for achieving\nthe fair and just representation of the African continent\nand other regions of the world, which we regard as a\nfundamental issue, particularly with regard to the\nSecurity Council. If this is not achieved, an\nenvironment of distrust may result, as well as a\nweakening of the role of our great Organization and its\nall-important task of promoting and ensuring\ninternational peace and security.\nAt present, some individuals enjoy a level of\nwealth which in the past was inconceivable, while the\n22\n\nvictims of poverty continue to suffer intolerable forms\nof deprivation. The poor remain marginalized and\nexcluded, and day by day their ranks are increasing\nconsiderably. Almost a quarter of the world's\npopulation now lives in poverty.\nToday, pensions and social security protect many\nindividuals from poverty, but poverty in old age\nremains prevalent around the world. Poverty must be\nthe main concern in United Nations endeavours. The\nstruggle against poverty must be strengthened, and if\npossible poverty must be eradicated, because the\nsubject of poverty eradication is an ethical, social,\npolitical and economic imperative of humankind, as is\nfinding solutions to the conflicts and fratricidal wars\nthat take millions of victims in different parts of the\nworld.\nPoverty eradication requires an improvement in\neconomic growth and in employment opportunities.\nThe causes of poverty must also be tackled in the\ncontext of sectoral strategies, such as strategies for the\nenvironment, food security, health, education,\npopulation, immigration, housing, development of\nhuman resources, rural development, drinking water\nand sanitation.\nPoverty eradication is therefore one of the\nprimary tasks to which the peoples of the twenty-first\ncentury aspire, as an action which will promote the\ndevelopment and prosperity of the human being and\nwill consolidate the culture of democracy and the\nrespect for human rights.\nOther problems that need analysis and solutions\nfrom the international community are the rights of the\nchild, the integration of women in development and the\nthorny issue of the foreign debt. As for the rights of the\nchild, we must see to it that the activities and the\nfollow-up of the World Summit for Children are\nintegrated with economic actions to be implemented as\na result of the other United Nations conferences held in\nthe 1990s. In this respect, we must see to it that there is\nrenewed thinking about the obligations stemming from\nthe ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild by each country and a renewed commitment to\nthem. This must guide our actions in the future.\nAs for the subject of women, we must eliminate\nall discriminatory practices against women and respect\nthe procedures and the provisions that are inherent in\nthe convention on this subject, as well as the\nrecommendations stemming from the Fourth World\nConference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 and\nfrom the special session of the General Assembly held\nin June 2000.\nOn foreign debt, we fervently appeal to donors\nthat they cancel the foreign debt of the developing\ncountries with the understanding that the funds\nreleased will be injected into the most vulnerable\nsectors in the economies of those countries, such as\neducation, health, water and sanitation.\nWe are gratified that among the major areas of\nprogress in the twentieth century we see a growing\nawareness in humankind regarding respect for and\npromotion of human rights, democracy and good\ngovernance. In our country, because of the imperative\nof survival and the objectives of well-being and\nprogress, we will continue on the agreed path towards\nthe necessary restoration of all the rights to which our\nvulnerable and marginal groups aspire, in other words\nwomen, children, the disabled, refugees and those\npersons displaced by crisis and disasters. At the present\ntime in Malabo, the capital of our nation, we have\nofficially established the Centre for the Promotion of\nHuman Rights and the Committee in Support of the\nEquatorial Guinean Child. This Committee was\nestablished under the chairmanship of the First Lady of\nthe nation, Her Excellency Mrs. Constancia Mangue de\nObiang.\nWe have also experienced democracy in a spirit\nof joy with fraternity and without divisiveness, as is\ndescribed by our national anthem, and also without\ninternal upheaval. The national constitution, known as\nthe Magna Carta of Akonibe, clearly stipulates the\nestablishment and institutionalization of political\npluralism in Equatorial Guinea. This has made it\npossible for a number of political parties to be\nestablished. These parties have signed a national\ncovenant with the political party which is in power\nwith the purpose of establishing and strengthening\nmechanisms for dialogue among the parties. At the\npresent time, all are participating actively in aspiring to\npolitical power in the country. In this respect we thank\nGod, the Creator, for having inspired us in this model\nof participatory and peaceful democracy.\nIn September 1997 at the Congressional Palace of\nBata, the National Economic Conference was held with\nthe participation of all social sectors in our country. In\nthe final report of this important event, we find the\nrecommendations for programmes and projects to be\n23\n\nimplemented by the Government in the short, medium\nand long-term as our economic development strategy.\nWe cannot conceal our concern at the steady\ndecline in international cooperation resources towards\nEquatorial Guinea, as we have recently seen in many of\nthe projects and programmes that are implemented in\nthe country with external resources. In this respect we\nwant to avail ourselves of this forum to invite the\ninternational community to steadily increase the\nvolume of international cooperation activities in\nEquatorial Guinea.\nWith the primary purpose of ensuring peace and\nsecurity in our subregion, we hope that the United\nNations will support the appropriate mechanisms for\nthe maintenance of peace, security, stability,\ncooperation and development in the Central African\nsubregion, following the political will of the heads of\nState of that subregion, inspired by the establishment\nof the Council of Peace and Security in Central Africa\n(COPAX), a body for political and military agreement\namong the member countries of the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS).\nAs regards the promotion of measures for the\nmaintenance and the strengthening of peace and\nsecurity, we have, within COPAX, a Central African\nMultinational Force (FOMAC) and an Early Warning\nMechanism for Central Africa (MARAC). The\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has\ncontributed with determination to financing these\ninstitutions so that they can function properly.\nWe sincerely regret the armed conflicts that exist\nat the present time on the African continent and in\nother parts of the world, for example, the case of\nAngola, the situation of the countries in the Great\nLakes region and the crisis in Sierra Leone. We\nwelcome the ceasefire in the conflict between Ethiopia\nand Eritrea, and it is our hope that the parties will\nundertake dialogue with a view to a lasting peace.\nLikewise, we view with satisfaction the restoration of\npeace and authority in the sister republic of Somalia. In\nthis respect, we commend the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the League of Arab\nStates, the Islamic Conference and all of those who\ndirectly or indirectly contributed to the arduous task of\nrestoring peace to that country.\nWe strongly condemn the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. We support the struggle\nagainst crime and the struggle against the global\nproblem of drugs and related crimes and against illicit\narms trafficking and international terrorism. We fully\nsupport the initiative reaffirmed by the Central\nAmerican countries in their commitment to make\nCentral America a region of peace, freedom,\ndemocracy and development and particularly to\ngradually and progressively stimulate the Central\nAmerican Union to ensure a promising future for that\nregion.\nIn the Middle East, we congratulate the\ncommendable political work done by the President of\nthe United States Bill Clinton to mediate a lasting\npeace in the region. We hope that a proper\ninterpretation and implementation of the proposals and\nrecommendations of our leaders at the Summit, as well\nas the outstanding statements made at this\ndistinguished Assembly, will guide us towards a better\nand more prosperous future for all the nations of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The Government of Bolivia has given me the task of\nconveying its most sincere congratulations to you, Sir,\non your election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-fifth session, which is a recognition of your\npersonal merits and a tribute to your country. At the\nsame time, I thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his work\nduring the fifty-fourth session and for his dedication\nduring the preparations for the Millennium Summit and\nthe Millennium Assembly.\nSpecial thanks must also go to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his report preparatory to the\nMillennium Summit, the content of which has given us\nan opportunity to reflect upon and address specific\nissues with which the United Nations has been\nconcerned in its 55 years of existence.\nWe also welcome the recent admission of Tuvalu\nas a new, fully fledged Member of our Organization.\n10\n\nThe recent Millennium Summit reaffirmed the\nrecognition by the international community of the\nimportance and significance of, and the prospects for,\nthe United Nations Organization. It also highlighted the\nurgency of adapting it to, and equipping it for, the new\nrealities in which we live, which are certainly quite\ndifferent from the situation and circumstances that\nprevailed when our Organization came into being.\nThe concerns of peoples and Governments today\nare also different. Poverty, underdevelopment and\nexacerbated inequalities contribute to new divisions,\nwhich threaten to lead to violence. These realities must\nbe corrected, because they have the potential of\nspawning conflicts that, if allowed to persist, could\nseriously jeopardize the world's economic and political\nstability, and, it goes without saying, international\npeace and security.\nOur Organization needs to be strengthened if it is\nsuccessfully to channel the expectations and\nopportunities of globalization while controlling, and\nindeed preventing, the dangers implicit in it, especially\nfor the more vulnerable economies, which are now\nthreatened by new forms of exclusion.\nThe United Nations must be renewed so that it\ncan continue to be the effective instrument for dialogue\nthat is required to build a world in which greater\nsecurity and solidarity prevail.\nWe must consequently redefine the\nOrganization's priorities in such a way as to make it\nconducive to clear-sighted and effective action. This\nwill require substantial reform of the system's\neconomic and financial bodies, modernization of the\nGeneral Assembly's methods of work, and the\nadaptation of the Security Council to these new\nrealities. Other, equally important tasks include\nensuring that the necessary resources are available to\nthe Organization; obtaining financing for development\nand peacekeeping operations; and adjusting the scale of\nassessments in accordance with the basic principle of a\ncountry's capacity to pay.\nA few short days ago, at the Millennium Summit,\nthe President of Bolivia, Hugo B\u00e1nzer Su\u00e1rez, referred\nto the close relationship between freedom and poverty,\nand between poverty and violence. He called for the\nfight against poverty to be waged in accordance with\nthe principle of shared responsibility and with a\ngenuine commitment to democracy, in order to mitigate\npresent inequalities, which are threatening to intensify.\nIt is unfair, in an open economy, for markets to be\nclosed and for discriminatory measures to be applied\nwith protectionist intent. It is also vital to favour\ncountries with small-scale economies through greater\ncapital inflows and debt relief programmes.\nScience and technology must become the heritage\nof humankind. Scientific and technological knowledge\nmust not widen already existing gaps and divisions.\nAt the historic meeting of South American\nPresidents, held recently in Brasilia, the heads of State\nof the region stressed the importance of access to the\nnew information and knowledge age, which will open\nthe way for our countries to strengthen a system of\ncontinuing education that ensures education at all\nlevels for the all sectors of society and permits\nunrestricted access to knowledge and information.\nDemocracy, which essentially seeks to organize\nlife in society, is a vital concept that changes and is\nupdated in tune with the changing pace of societies\nthemselves, without in any way detracting from its\nfundamental values. Convinced as we are that\ndemocracy must go beyond electoral formalities and\nthat sovereignty is vested in the people and expressed\nthrough its representatives, we in Bolivia have declared\nthe principle of political dialogue and consultation to\nbe the basis of a pluralistic and participatory\ndemocratic system.\nIn that context, the practice of holding a national\ndialogue was instituted during the administration of\nPresident B\u00e1nzer. That mechanism is aimed at\nestablishing a new relationship of joint efforts and\nshared responsibility between Government institutions,\nthe political system and organizations throughout\nsociety. The creation of key State policies grew out of\nthe first such national dialogue, held in 1997.\nThis year, a national dialogue has been initiated\nonce again to lend fresh impetus to institutional\nreforms and to put together a national anti-poverty\nprogramme. A new plan, involving over 3,000\ninhabitants in townships across Bolivia, is being\nelaborated whose objective is to assign rights and\nresponsibilities that, within the framework of a market\neconomy, will make it possible for us to combat the\npoverty that still afflicts vast sectors of our population,\ndespite nearly 20 years of life under democracy.\nShortly after taking office, in August 1997,\nPresident B\u00e1nzer Su\u00e1rez vowed that during his\n\n\nmandate Bolivia would be removed from the drug-\ntrafficking loop once and for all, through the\nimplementation of an integrated policy that\nencompasses alternative development, the eradication\nof illegal coca crops, confiscation, prevention and\nrehabilitation.\nDespite doubts as to the feasibility of this plan,\nwe can now affirm that we will be fulfilling our\ncommitments ahead of time. In 1997, there were\napproximately 38,000 hectares of illegal coca\ncultivation in Bolivia. Today, more than 80 per cent of\nsuch illegal crops have been eradicated.\nOur concern now is essentially whether we can\nsustain these achievements. Conditions must be created\nwhich in future will obviate a return to coca-leaf\nproduction as a result of the lack of jobs and income.\nOur major efforts now are aimed at alternative\ndevelopment, to see to it that illegal coca income is\nreplaced by legal earnings from other productive\nactivities. If we do not achieve concrete results, we run\nthe risk of seeing those persons who cannot hope to\nfind any other means of subsistence fall once again\nprey to the temptation of cultivating coca. That would\nconstitute a surrender to the drug dealers and signify a\ndefeat not only for Bolivia but for the world\ncommunity.\nWhat Bolivia needs, then, is support in two basic\nareas: first, in the area of investment, to promote our\neconomic growth in the sectors that generate the most\njob opportunities; and secondly, in the opening of\nsecure markets for our exports.\nAt previous sessions of the Assembly, Bolivia has\naired the historical, political and economic arguments\non which it bases its absolute need to regain the\nmaritime status that gave rise to its existence as an\nindependent country. To that end, Bolivia has been\nencouraging direct dialogue with the Republic of Chile.\nAs a consequence of prior contacts, the Foreign\nMinisters of Bolivia and Chile met in Portugal in\nFebruary this year, where an agreement was reached to\nprepare a working programme, to be formalized in the\nsubsequent stages of dialogue, that will incorporate,\nwithout exclusion of any kind, the essential points of a\nbilateral relationship and seek to surmount the\ndifferences that have impeded full integration between\nBolivia and Chile, the main obstacle to which has\ncertainly been Bolivia's unresolved maritime demand.\nIn a significant advance, on the occasion of the recent\nmeeting of Presidents of South America, the Presidents\nof Bolivia and Chile, Hugo B\u00e1nzer and Ricardo Lagos,\nreiterated the willingness of their Governments to enter\ninto dialogue on all topics relating to bilateral relations,\nwithout exception, in order to create a climate of\nmutual trust enabling the establishment of closer ties\nbased on the structure and positions maintained by the\ntwo countries.\nThe world community, the Americas in particular,\nis following with great expectation the course of this\ndiplomatic process and the progress achieved therein.\nThe proposal to hold a dialogue on all topics without\nexception is a challenge to the creativity of those\ninvolved and puts to the test our political will to correct\nonce and for all an unjust situation that has prevailed\nsince 1879. Furthermore, Latin America's capacity to\nsettle its own disputes in a fair, peaceful and negotiated\nway will be strengthened and progress thus made on\nthe road to regional integration.\nIn that context, we propose the implementation of\na programme to promote the integrated development of\nwestern Bolivia and northern Chile. We are also\nconfident that Peru will participate in this programme\nin order to mobilize the resources and capabilities of\nthe three countries of the region. In this way, a\ncontribution will be made to linking the Atlantic and\nPacific basins. The persistence of Bolivia's landlocked\nstatus at the heart of the continent is, without doubt, an\nobstacle to the creation of a major opportunity for\nthoroughgoing understanding and dialogue in the South\nAmerican region and minimizes the effectiveness of\nwork to promote integration being carried out in the\narea.\nThis occasion provides a fitting opportunity for\nus to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\ninterest in relations between Bolivia and Chile, which\nhas been brought to the attention of the authorities of\nboth countries. The Secretary-General has expressed\nhis satisfaction with respect to the conversations held,\naccording to the terms laid down by the parties, at the\nlevels of heads of State, Foreign Ministers and other\nauthorities of Bolivia and Chile.\nMy country pledges to make every effort to\ntranslate the desire recently expressed by the Presidents\nof Bolivia and Chile into action that will enable us,\nBolivians and Chileans alike, to advance towards the\nresolution of our differences, with a view to the future\nand in a spirit of brotherhood.\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I also take this occasion\nto welcome the new Member, Tuvalu, to our midst.\nThe fifty-fifth session opened with the historic\nMillennium Summit and the adoption of a visionary\nDeclaration offering the cardinal principles that should\ngovern relations among nations. It charted a course\nthat, if followed, will ensure durable peace and security\nas well as common progress and prosperity for all\nhumanity. It, hopefully, began a new chapter in the\nhistory of the United Nations. Undeniably, expectations\nare raised that the Organization will overcome the\npervasive and interrelated obstacles to peace and\ndevelopment, while strongly reaffirming and\npreserving the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter. We know that these goals can be\nachieved, but it is crucial that Member States, civil\nsociety, international organizations and the private\nsector cooperate and work together for that purpose.\nThese efforts must be supported by the\nempowerment of the Organization, entailing more than\ncharting a new structure and new mechanisms, or\nproviding additional resources. It demands a\nwillingness to provide genuine authority and\nlegitimacy to the United Nations by setting new norms\nand agendas as needed. It also urgently calls for reform\nof the Security Council. New prospects for that effort\nmay have emerged in the joint statement of the Heads\n\n\nof State or Government of the permanent members of\nthe Council on 7 September. In that statement they\npledged to foster a more transparent and broadly\nrepresentative Council to enhance its effectiveness for\npeace and security.\nOne major issue confronting us is the lack of\nprogress on the elimination of nuclear weapons. We are\neven more concerned to see a new rationalization for\ntheir continued use, coupled with repeated assertions of\ntheir legitimacy and necessity, and to see the danger of\nthe deployment of anti-ballistic missile defence\nsystems. This lack of progress increases the prospects\nof a new nuclear arms race which will threaten the\nexisting arms control agreements and the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Ridding\nthe world of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons,\npending their total abolition, is the greatest challenge\nof our time.\nIn contributing to peace and security, Indonesia\nhas since 1957 actively participated in and contributed\nto the various peacekeeping operations of the United\nNations. In anticipating the new and emerging\nproblems identified by the Secretary-General and, in\nparticular, the report (A/55/305) of the Brahimi panel,\nwe are in the process of responding to the new\nrequirements with a view to bolstering the numbers,\nquality and effectiveness of our participation in future\nUnited Nations missions.\nArmed conflict and tensions persist in many parts\nof the world. In the Middle East we must continue to\nfocus our attention on the core of the conflict, namely,\nthe legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to\nsecure their inalienable rights to self-determination and\nsovereign statehood in their own homeland, with\nJerusalem as its capital. In this context, my delegation\ncommends the Palestinian leaders for their\nstatesmanlike approach. They have demonstrated their\ncommitment to peace through the decision to share the\ncity of Jerusalem, while remaining committed to their\nnational rights, in order to reach a compromise. Hence,\nit behoves Israel to make a similar compromise so that\na final settlement can be achieved. The withdrawal of\nIsrael last June from southern Lebanon, following more\nthan two decades of occupation, has finally restored the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon within\nits internationally recognized boundaries. My\ndelegation also hopes for a resumption of the Israeli-\nSyrian peace talks, based on the Madrid peace formula.\nIn various regions of the world, however, we see\nmany positive developments which reflect a new spirit\nof cooperation and compromise. These are exemplified\nby, among other things, the summit meeting of the two\nleaders of North and South Korea, the formation of a\nnew Government in Somalia, and the ceasefire\nagreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is my\ndelegation's expectation that the same spirit of\ncooperation and compromise will prevail in easing the\nimpact of sanctions on the people of Iraq. It is also an\nimperative on humanitarian grounds to address the\nissue of missing persons of the parties concerned\nduring the Gulf war.\nIn the afterglow of the Millennium Summit and\nthe first South Summit, which took place in August in\nHavana, there was a distinct sense of optimism that the\nenormous power and promise of globalization and the\ninformation revolution could be harnessed in the\nservice of development and in combating poverty. In\nthis regard, the declarations and programmes of action\nprovide us with an excellent blueprint for charting the\npath ahead. Today, particularly in the developing\ncountries, millions remain untouched by the benefits of\nglobalization and the information revolution and, being\nbypassed and marginalized, can greatly provoke\ninstability. Thus, rather than enjoying generalized\npeace and prosperity, the world at the turn of the\ncentury continues to be disfigured by ruthless conflicts,\nwrenching poverty, blatant inequalities and problems\nincluding hunger, illiteracy and disease. While\ndeclarations and programmes of action are of critical\nimportance for changing this reality, their\nimplementation is the key. I am convinced that there\ncan be no alternative to productive dialogue to achieve\nthis aim; such dialogue must be based on mutual\ninterests and benefits, shared responsibility and\ngenuine partnership.\nOne of the core issues of development on which\nglobalization has had a great impact and which requires\nsuch dialogue is that of financing for development, an\nissue that has assumed immense importance in the new\nglobal economy. While enormous financial flows have\ncharacterized the global financial system, the basic\nproblem for the majority of developing countries is that\nthey are not in a position to benefit from such flows\nand must instead depend on official development\nassistance, which has sharply declined. Hence the\nimportance of the forthcoming international high-level\n12\n\nevent on financing for development that is to be held in\n2001.\nAnother area in which globalization has had a\ngreat impact, one closely associated with financing for\ndevelopment, is the issue of the indebtedness of the\ndeveloping countries which often seriously undermines\ntheir development efforts, particularly in this era of\nglobalization. Regrettably, the numerous debt strategies\nand initiatives employed over the years have failed to\nresolve this problem.\nEqually important in this age of information is the\nneed to harness the potential of the information and\ncommunication technologies in the service of\ndevelopment. Progress was made in placing this critical\nissue on the agenda of the United Nations when for the\nfirst time the high-level segment of the Economic and\nSocial Council this year considered information and\ncommunication technologies (ICT) for development as\nits major theme. The outcome, particularly the\nministerial declaration, underlined the critical\nimportance of unlocking the vast potential of\ninformation and communication technologies for all\nhumanity.\nMore than ever before, due largely to\nglobalization, we must strive for sustainable\ndevelopment as set out in Agenda 21, adopted in Rio\nde Janeiro in 1992. The outcome of that Conference\ncommitted the international community to meet the\neconomic needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability of the planet to provide for\nthe needs of future generations. But almost a decade\nlater, with the exception of a number of conventions\nthat have been enacted, relatively little has been\nachieved in fully implementing Agenda 21, known as\nRio+10. It is therefore important that we seriously\nprepare for the ten-year review of its implementation.\nIn doing so we should be able to generate the highest\npolitical commitment to help to ensure the full\nimplementation of the Agenda. In this regard, I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that Indonesia's offer\nto host Rio+10 has been strongly supported by the\nMinisterial Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment of Asia and the Pacific.\nOnly a short time ago the five-year reviews were\nheld on the Copenhagen conference on social\ndevelopment and the Beijing conference on women.\nFrom those two special sessions we learned valuable\nlessons. We learned that for many people social\ndevelopment remains an elusive goal and that only\nthrough gender equality and women's empowerment\ncan true prosperity be achieved.\nClearly the time has come to move beyond\nrhetoric and fully implement the commitments of the\nvarious international conferences of the 1990s. We\nmust also work towards eradicating ethnic and racial\ndiscrimination, religious intolerance and xenophobia,\nwhich threaten to undermine all progress \u2014 political,\neconomic and social. The forthcoming World\nConference against Racism in 2001 therefore presents\nan opportunity that must be seized.\nWe are committed to ensuring that humanitarian\nassistance is available wherever and whenever needed\nthroughout the world. The plight of refugees and\ndisplaced persons must continue to hold a prominent\nposition on the global agenda, with each nation\nmeeting its responsibilities to render aid and assistance\nin times of natural disaster, civil conflict or other\nemergency situations.\nWe must work also to ensure the integrity of\nhumanitarian missions. The murder of staff of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) in Atambua, West Timor, has\nshocked and saddened the world, and nowhere more\nthan Indonesia. That humanitarian workers should\nbecome victims in the performance of their work is\nunacceptable. Let me be clear in stating that this crime\nshould not go unpunished. The necessary measures\nmust be taken to ensure that such a heinous crime is\nnever again repeated. This tragedy should not,\nhowever, result in a withdrawal of humanitarian\nassistance, thus compounding the loss. We should work\ntogether to resolve any and all obstacles to the safe\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance.\nInternational cooperation in the millennium is\nunavoidable and indispensable. The quality, extent and\ntimeliness of such cooperation will make the difference\nbetween despair and progress. In this setting, the\nsignificance of the United Nations should be evident\nand accepted. Preserving the role of the Organization\nrequires the participation of all Member States, large\nand small. Beyond declarations, it is time to translate\nour ideas into action. Achievement is required in the\ntwenty-first century. That was the message of the\nMillennium Summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf\nof the people of Djibouti, it is a great pleasure indeed\nto extend our sincere greetings to one and all at this\nMillennium Assembly. May I also, Mr. President,\nconvey our congratulations on your election. Your vast\nand varied experience will serve the Assembly well.\nI should also like to express our appreciation to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia,\nfor the excellent work done and the achievements\nregistered. He showed great skill and commitment in\nhis task. Clearly the accomplishments of the fifty-\n\n\nfourth session were, to a large extent, due to his\nleadership, dedication and tireless efforts.\nNo organization, particularly one such as the\nUnited Nations, can survive for any length of time if\nbeset, as it is, with mounting demands and dwindling\nresources, and without deft, tenacious and imaginative\nleadership. The trials and tribulations of the United\nNations have continued unabated during the past year.\nIt has had to restore peace and to tackle wars, conflicts,\nnatural disasters and disease while also addressing\ndevelopment. The list of difficulties goes on. Yet the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has managed to\nstrengthen the Organization and make it better suited to\nmeet the demands of the times. Under his enlightened\nguidance, the United Nations continues to play a\ncredible and meaningful international role. We are\nfortunate indeed.\nThis being the last General Assembly session of\nthe decade, the century and indeed the millennium, it is\nthe ideal time for us to reflect on the state of the world\nand of its peoples. There has been an all-pervading\ndesire on the part of the United Nations and its\nMember States, to see fresh momentum in order to\ngenerate the necessary energy to deal with the new\nmillennium and address critical issues. We have come\nto realize that the strength of our resolve and our\ndetermination to deal with the challenge of securing a\nbetter, safer and healthier world for its inhabitants will\nbe decisive for the future of humankind. In many\nrespects, however, it is still an open question.\nIt is perhaps a sign of the times when any\noverview of the world today must give prominence to\nthe fact that the world is being ravaged by a disease,\nnamely AIDS. This deadly epidemic is continuing to\nspread. We are all aware of its terrible toll, particularly\nin Africa, where it is decimating youth, the\nprofessional classes, the labour force and health-care\nsystems. The will of the international community will\nbe put to the test, and we will see how it responds in\ncrisis situations.\nLast year I noted that dialogue had been renewed\nbetween Palestine and Israel, which opened a\npromising opportunity for charting a new course in the\nMiddle East. While it is true that the recent Camp\nDavid peace talks are still suspended, nonetheless a\ngreat deal was accomplished in terms of fully exploring\nthe scope and diversity of the issues under\nconsideration. There was at least a workable level of\ntrust and a clear willingness to discuss the key \u201cfinal\nstatus\u201d issues of borders, settlements, water, refugees,\nstatehood and, above all, the status of Jerusalem. It is\ndifficult, however, to imagine any resolution or\nsettlement that would not include Palestinian control of\nEast Jerusalem. Israel's continued claim to the entire\ncity, which would include control of Muslim holy sites\nin the Old City, adjoining Muslim and Christian\nquarters and selected Arab villages, would be\ncounterproductive to peace.\nAny mention of the Middle East must, of course,\ninclude a reference to the enormous loss suffered by\nSyria and the world at large with the death of the long-\nserving President of Syria, Hafez Al-Assad. We wish\nthe new President, Bashar Al-Assad, all the best in his\nefforts to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious\nfather.\nIn my address last year, I touched upon the spread\nand intensity of wars; rebel and splinter movements;\nand factional fighting in Africa. Sadly, while there have\nbeen some encouraging developments, a basic\nuncertainty remains. Fortunately, fighting between\nDjibouti's neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, has ceased,\nand troop redeployment and the deployment of United\nNations observers are expected to take place soon\nunder the ceasefire arrived at under the auspices of the\nOrganization of African Unity. The level of death and\ndestruction in these hostilities simply defies the\nimagination, and the sight of so many civilians\ndisplaced from their homes and deprived of their\nlivelihood, crowded into camps on both sides, is truly a\ndisheartening experience. It is high time for the\nmember countries of the Intergovernmental Authority\non Development (IGAD) to opt for a comprehensive\npeace and cessation of hostilities in this subregion, in\norder collectively to focus on development and address\nthe serious challenges posed by environmental\ndisasters, such as the current looming drought.\nAs concerns other parts of Africa, the persisting\nconflict in Angola is still with us, although\nGovernment forces appear to be gaining the upper\nhand. Regarding the conflict in Sierra Leone, the\nsudden international concern to see that the belligerents\nare not allowed to sell the precious minerals of their\ncountry on the world market should, it is to be hoped,\nreduce their capacity to wage war. This may be\nparticularly true for both these countries. We are\npleased to see the measures being taken by the De\nBeers group and the Belgian authorities to close\n12\n\ninternational access to these bloodstained commodities.\nSimilar action must be taken with respect to other\ncommodities as well.\nUndoubtedly, the most ominous threat to the\ncontinent at present lies in its centre, in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, where the ceasefire arranged\nlast year has suffered a number of setbacks. The United\nNations has been unable to deploy troops as envisaged.\nTalks between the Government and the opposition\nappear to have broken off, raising the dangerous\nspectre of a return to civil war, which could be\ndisastrous for the entire continent. The distraught\npeople of that nation deserve a respite from instability\nand insecurity in order to be able to enjoy normal lives.\nIn all these critical areas, be it the AIDS crisis,\never-growing poverty, wars, the environment, human\nrights abuses, weapons of mass destruction or lack of\ndevelopment, the United Nations remains the only\nOrganization with the requisite experience and know-\nhow to focus and refine the disparate efforts of\nhumankind.\nDecisions regarding the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security lie with the Security\nCouncil, which, with the explosion of United Nations\nmembership over the last three decades, has become a\nnot very representative body. If we are to restore\nconfidence in its decisions, there has to be, at all costs,\nan expansion in its membership, both permanent and\nnon-permanent, with the extension of permanent\nmembership to both developed and non-developed\ncountries. The Council should also have access to\nbetter information on unstable regions, and a rapid\nresponse capability. Furthermore, when serious\nhumanitarian crises are unfolding, measures to limit the\nspread and impact of conflict should be taken on a\nselective, case-by-case basis, but across the board by\nall Members.\nLike last year, I again intend to dwell on the\nproblem of Somalia, and I again request the indulgence\nof the Assembly. At that time, Somalia was on the\nverge of total disintegration, following years of\npolitical paralysis. Urgent measures were needed to\nreverse this tragedy, a tragedy to which the\ninternational community had grown largely indifferent.\nThe mood was simply one of waiting for the warlords\nto eliminate one another until a victor emerged with\nwhom business could be done. In the meantime, those\nindividuals carried out systematic dismantling,\ndestruction and looting of the Somali nation, ignoring\nconsistent calls to change their reckless and criminal\nbehaviour.\nThis, however, cannot be tolerated any longer.\nThe people have spoken at last. They have decided\nagainst endless uncertainty and aberration. They were\nsapped of their strength. The people have now opted\nfor government, law and order, and a better future. We\nurge the international community, therefore, to respect\nthe will of the Somali people, and to refuse to continue\nto cooperate with those destructive elements that made\nSomalia synonymous with chaos and violence.\nSomalia as a nation, as an entity, seemed\ncondemned to a slow death, unable to expect either\nregional or international intervention or a positive\nchange in the behaviour of the warlords. Saving\nSomalia, therefore, necessitated moving away from the\nusual practice, which revolved around a few, familiar,\nself-anointed representatives of the people. Rather than\nprovide them with yet another opportunity to play their\ngame of deception, I suggested that it was time to move\nbeyond them; time to empower the Somali people; time\nthe Somali people assumed responsibility for their own\ndestiny. There needed to be a conference of all the\nactors, the ultimate objective of which would be the re-\nestablishment of peace, government, legitimacy and\nreconstruction. I believe that a true reconciliation of all\nsegments of Somali society would tap into the popular\nmood of the Somali people, who overwhelmingly\nrejected the status quo. There was at last a burning\ndesire for change; a change that would transform the\nlives of the people and would restore respect, dignity\nand integrity; one that meant peace, security and\ndevelopment. For the first time, there was an\nalternative in sight: not the power of the gun, but the\npower of the people.\nThe peace process was designed to embrace the\nwhole country, including regions that enjoyed relative\npeace and stability. It was to be comprehensive,\ninclusive and transparent, excluding no individual,\ngroup, sector or region.\nBut beyond comprehensive reconciliation, the\ngoal was to create a national framework leading to an\nadministration that represented the people fairly,\nprotected their basic rights and values and guaranteed\nliberty and justice for all. Somalia, after all, was a\nnation that had gone without a government during the\nlongest period of State collapse in the modern era. It\n13\n\nwas a country where the law of the gun, lust for power\nand vengeance dominated the landscape, until fear and\nruthlessness had decimated every opportunity for\npeace. The predictable outcome was a social and\ninstitutional collapse without parallel in this century.\nThe key aspect of the Djibouti-led IGAD peace\nprocess was its bottom-up approach, which emphasized\ncommunity participation in discussions, slowly\nconsolidating the gains achieved. This process not only\nwas cumbersome, slow, painful, frustrating and visibly\nfragile at times, but also endured international\nscepticism and indifference. All along, we insisted on\nthe openness, independence and integrity of the process\nto enable the majority of unarmed Somalis, including\nelders, traditional and religious leaders, scholars,\nwomen, politicians, the youth and the civil society at\nlarge, to own the process. Accordingly, our efforts were\ndirected towards safeguarding the conceptual\nframework and rejecting all conditional offers of\nassistance, material or otherwise, while always\nremaining open or receptive to ideas or proposals that\ndeepened and enriched the process.\nThe conference itself represented the culmination\nof a series of consultations, meetings, symposiums and\ncontacts that took place over the first six months of the\nyear. Its objective was to overcome and resolve some\nof the most divisive and emotional national issues. The\nelaborate, extensive and admittedly costly preparations\nwere necessary to heal the painful past and formulate\nsensible humanitarian and political guarantees and\nsafeguards. Never again should there be toleration of\nthe kind of hateful human rights violations and gross\nabuses of power that had destroyed the country.\nWhile the process took time and went through\nseveral phases, it enabled delegates to address all\naspects of Somalia's collapse, spurred by the strong\ndesire for peace prevailing in the country.\nThe cornerstone of the process was the key role\nplayed by the traditional leaders, particularly in the\nachievement of the broadest possible reconciliation\namong the Somali clans. For long stretches of time,\namounting to years, there had been virtually no contact\nbetween them, allowing each to pile up grievances\nthroughout the conflict. Slowly and painfully, the\nconference persistently addressed complex political\nissues, while striving to overcome deep animosities and\nimplacable attitudes.\nThe very critical first phase of the conference\nbegan on 2 May and concluded in early June. It was the\nmost important phase, for we must bear in mind that\nmore than 200 elders and traditional leaders from every\npart of the country were coming together for the first\ntime \u2014 not the first time in 10 years, but the first time\nin the entire existence of Somalia as a State \u2014 seeking\nto overcome a decade of frustration, fear, anger,\nsuspicion and mistrust, without ever having had contact\nwith each other before. Slowly, this legacy of the past\nwas overcome and replaced with a common purpose:\nthe search for a new destiny and a sense of the need to\nact at all costs. Through the wisdom, persistence and\nsincerity of these elders, it was possible to complete\nthe reconciliation and to establish solid structures for\nthe second phase. The core political choices could then\nbe made.\nThe second phase began on 15 June, with the\nparticipation of over 2,000 delegates. The setting of\nthis conference bore no resemblance to any in the past,\nbecause this one took place in a giant tent. There were\nno class or social distinctions evident among the\nparticipants, who included women, representatives of\nall minorities, a number of warlords and, of course, the\nentire clan mosaic of Somalia. Proceedings were\ncovered by satellite and on the Internet in order to\nenable Somalis everywhere in the world to keep abreast\nof developments. Participants outnumbered the\nresidents in Arta, the hill-top resort town, which was\nthe venue for the conference. Nearly every resident\ncontributed to the conference one way or another,\nparticularly in accommodating this huge and sudden\ninflux of visitors.\nThis phase of the conference made it possible to\naddress many issues, from civil strife, human rights,\nhealing and reconciliation, the economy, the political\nstructure, disarmament, transitional mechanisms such\nas the interim constitution, the legislation, the\ngovernment and the judiciary system. Slowly, an\nirreversible momentum, a feeling of rebirth, took\nshape. In a real sense, it was Somalia's second\nindependence, this time not from colonialism but from\nchaos and utter hopelessness.\nAfter one month of intensive drafting and debate,\nan interim constitution, or charter, was adopted. It\nestablished the number of representatives, including a\nquota for women, in the new assembly and the\nmodalities for their election. This major step in the\nprocess signalled the beginning of a truly nationwide\n14\n\nreconciliation effort, as it contained a series of\naccommodations, including a clan-based system as the\npolitical mechanism for power sharing during the\nthree-year interim authority. The resulting transitional\nnational authority could therefore be a highly workable\nvehicle for both the parties who are for the process and\nthe troublemakers. No one, though, should take either\nthe reconciliation process or the new institutions as\nshielding any individual from past misdeeds or war\ncrimes. This is among the challenges that will confront\nfuture constitutional Governments of Somalia.\nLet me say that 26 August 2000 is a date which\nwill forever stir the hearts and spirits of Somalis. It was\non this date that Somalia's interim parliament elected\nthe country's first president in more than a decade.\nStarting with a field of 25 candidates, voting was\ncompleted after several rounds and more than ten hours\nof bargaining and negotiating in order to secure cross-\nclan support within the Assembly to win the necessary\nmajority. Interest among Somali viewers for the\nconference and the elections was certainly heightened\nby up-to-the-minute radio and satellite coverage, which\npermitted Somalis everywhere to follow the elections\nand the debates that had preceded them since the\nbeginning of the process.\nThe man chosen from among the candidates is\nhere with us today. This man in the news is Abdikassim\nSalad Hassan, the new President of Somalia, a\nseasoned, urbane, and a highly experienced politician,\nwho has already demonstrated his rare skills through a\nseries of visits and engagements, both inside Somalia\nand externally. I wholeheartedly congratulate him and\nwelcome him and his delegation most warmly in this\nAssembly.\nWhat a joy to see Somalia retake its rightful place\namong the community of nations! The realization of\nhaving a president at last fills Somalis everywhere with\nemotional exuberance. People are dancing and singing\nin the streets in what was described as a spontaneous\nnational holiday. We wish to express our deepest\ngratitude to the member States of IGAD and to Yemen\nwho were represented at the highest level to witness\nthe swearing-in ceremony of the new president; we are\nequally grateful to Saudi Arabia, France, Egypt, Libya,\nItaly, Kuwait, the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), the League of Arab States and the United\nNations for having sent high level delegations. And, of\ncourse, we wish to thank the entire diplomatic\ncommunity in Djibouti for their presence and steadfast\nsupport.\nUndoubtedly, we fully acknowledge the realism\nand genuine understanding so readily displayed\nthroughout this process by the other immediate\nneighbours of Somalia, namely Kenya and Ethiopia.\nWe have also received tremendous comfort from the\ncontinued encouragement and support from the\nSecretary-General and his able staff both in New York\nand in the region, particularly, from his Special\nRepresentative, Mr. David Stephen, and his staff,\nwhose presence in the conference throughout the\nprocess proved remarkably beneficial. Equally, the\nunfailing commitment demonstrated by the Security\nCouncil throughout its series of statements since the\nlaunch of the initiative has been a source of constant\ncomfort.\nObviously, the peace process invariably enjoyed\nfull and unambiguous backing of IGAD, OAU, the\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic\nConference and the European Union. We are deeply\nappreciative of their steady and principled stand. The\nSomali people will be forever grateful. Following the\nformation of the new Somali parliament, the Security\nCouncil reiterated that the preservation of the territorial\nintegrity of the country was the precondition for overall\nnormalization in Somalia and recommended that\nregional organizations work towards that end.\nSome discordant voices have been raised\nquestioning the acceptance of the new Government and\nits ability to return to Somalia. Some scoffed it would\nbe a phantom government-in-exile, lacking legitimacy\nand resources. However, the triumphant return as well\nas the ecstatic welcome from the public of the new\nPresident-elect, Abdikassim, into Mogadishu, the\ncentre of conflict, and the unprecedented show of\nsupport from all militiamen, including those allied to\nfaction leaders, put the baseless stories to rest once and\nforever.\nFor those individuals who chose to oppose the\ncreation of a representative and democratic\nGovernment, presumably because they are no longer at\ncentre stage in Somalia, they need to come to terms\nwith reality. A generous hand has been extended to all\nthose people to join their peace-loving neighbours in\nsupporting the talks, and now the Government. In fact,\nI personally invited and met with several of them in\nDjibouti for discussions in order to assure them there\n15\n\nwas a place for everyone in the new Somalia under its\nproposed federal structure. Now, with a Government in\nplace, the ball is in their court. We can only hope that\nthey will make good use of the remaining opportunity\nfor reconciliation and accommodation by placing the\ncountry first before their personal interests.\nThe rebirth of Somalia opens unlimited\npossibilities for Somalis throughout the world to\nrebuild their country. With the expected gradual return\nto normality in the country, the diaspora will have the\nincentive to invest in their homeland, bringing the\ncapital and expertise needed to create employment\nopportunities for the youth.\nIt is to be hoped that the international community\nwill mobilize emergency assistance for Somalia to\nenable the Government to lead the country, re-establish\nitself and re-create basic institutions and capacities. In\nthe meantime, planning for medium- and long-term\ndevelopment must begin with the support of\ninternational financial institutions, the donor\ncommunity, the United Nations and regional\norganizations.\nFinally, let me state with all candour that for us in\nDjibouti this process has strained our meagre\nresources, but neither our resolve nor our faith. It has\nchallenged our courage and perseverance, but our\ncommitment has not wavered. Our people have made\nan exemplary effort and sacrifice.\nMay this endurance test of our people, and of the\nSomali people as well, serve as a source of inspiration\nand mark the beginning of what could be a major\naccomplishment for the Horn of Africa, and indeed for\nAfrica and mankind as a whole."

While in the past century\nhuman civilization's main task was that of survival,\ntoday we are confronted with significantly more\ndifficult problems which are much more varied in\nterms of their scope and orientation.\nThe strategy of survival must give way to a\nstrategy of sustainable development aimed at ensuring\nthe prosperity of humankind. It must be based on the\nrecognition of the indivisibility of international\nsecurity, the use of modern scientific and technological\nachievements for the benefit of the entire international\n6\n\ncommunity, and a gradual closing of the development\ngap between the various States.\nThese ambitious goals can be achieved only\nthrough the preservation and strengthening of strategic\nstability in its very broadest sense.\nStrategic stability means further progress in the\ndisarmament process, reliable prevention of the spread\nof weapons of mass destruction. Today nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are no longer the\nsubject of exclusive interaction between Russia, the\nUnited States and other nuclear Powers. What is\nneeded is the effective involvement of multilateral\nUnited Nations mechanisms and the entire world\ncommunity in those processes.\nThe outcome of the Millennium Summit provides\nadditional opportunities for the achievement of a major\nbreakthrough in disarmament in the twenty-first\ncentury. This will require consistent joint efforts aimed\nat strict compliance with the agreements already\nconcluded; a step-by-step reduction and eventual\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction under\neffective international control, and the limitation of\nother types of armaments; and prevention of the arms\nrace in new spheres.\nThe time has come to give a new impetus to the\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament, which has\nproved in practice the effectiveness of multilateral\ndiplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations.\nRussia advocates the resumption of substantive work at\nthat forum on major issues on the disarmament agenda.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) provides an indispensable international\nlegal basis for nuclear disarmament. This has once\nagain been reaffirmed in full by the 2000 Review\nConference. Russia will work to ensure that the\ndecisions of the Millennium Assembly promote the\npractical implementation of the agreements reached\nduring that Conference. It is precisely for that purpose\nthat the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir\nPutin, put forward an initiative on the development and\nimplementation, under the auspices of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of an international\nproject designed to phase out the use of enriched\nuranium and pure plutonium in the civilian nuclear\nenergy sector.\nWe are satisfied to note the increasing number of\nStates acceding to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\n(CTBT). Its speedy entry into force is in the interests of\nthe entire international community. Having ratified the\nTreaty, we call on those that have yet not done so to\nfollow suit.\nWe expect that the United States will follow\nRussia in completing ratification of the Treaty on the\nFurther Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\nOffensive Arms (START II), which will help make it\noperational. We are ready to actively continue the\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and to move towards\nthe conclusion of a START III Treaty with an even\nlower threshold of nuclear warheads \u2014 down to 1,500\nunits. But this will be feasible only if the 1972 Anti-\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains intact. It is\nuniversally acknowledged that this major Treaty\nconcerns the vital security interests of the international\ncommunity as a whole. Its preservation is a key\nelement of global stability and a strong barrier to the\narms race in regard to nuclear weapons, missiles and\nother weapons of mass destruction.\nRussia will be introducing a draft resolution in\nsupport of the ABM Treaty. We hope that, as was the\ncase last year, our initiative will receive broad support\nwithin the United Nations.\nA peaceful earth needs a peaceful outer space. At\nthe Millennium Summit the President of Russia\nproposed the convening in Moscow of an international\nconference on the prevention of the weaponization of\nouter space, to take place in the spring of 2001, when\nthe fortieth anniversary of the first manned flight to\nouter space is to be commemorated. We hope that this\nproposal will be actively supported.\nStrategic stability means reliable safeguarding of\ninternational information security and counteracting\nthe use of scientific and technological achievements for\npurposes incompatible with universal progress and the\nmaintenance of international peace. Aware of the great\nimportance of resolving these most urgent issues,\nRussia will introduce for consideration by the General\nAssembly a draft resolution entitled \u201cDevelopments in\nthe field of informatization and telecommunications in\nthe context of international information security\u201d.\nStrategic stability also means enhancing peace\nand security on all continents, settling existing regional\nconflicts and preventing new ones and cutting off\nexternal support for them. Millions of people must be\nspared the death and suffering caused by local crises.\n7\n\nHow can this goal be achieved? It is only through\nthe joint efforts of all States collectively responsible\nfor the world's destiny. Experience has shown that\nunilateral enforcement actions cannot guarantee a\nlasting and fair settlement of crisis situations.\nThe notions of sovereignty and the territorial\nintegrity of States are still very much alive. Disregard\nfor these principles and military intervention\ncircumventing the Security Council, whatever\nhumanitarian pretexts may be used, undermine the very\nfoundations of the world order and pave the way for\narbitrariness in international affairs.\nThe prevention and settlement of crises should\nbecome a key element of international security in the\ntwenty-first century. When there is collective\ndetermination and goodwill, even the most complex\nand major problems lend themselves to a political\nresolution.\nAll of this calls for improvement of the\npeacekeeping potential of our Organization. People in\n\u201chotbeds\u201d of the planet \u2014 from Africa and Lebanon to\nEast Timor \u2014 rightly associate with the United Nations\n\u201cBlue Helmets\u201d their hopes for an end to bloody\nconflicts and for the beginning of complex\nreconciliation processes. They expect rapid and\neffective steps from us.\nWe hope that the Millennium Assembly will\nprovide us with an opportunity to engage in a\ncomprehensive analysis of the work of United Nations\npeacekeeping mechanisms and outline ways to increase\ntheir efficiency. Such is the objective of the report\n(A/55/305) prepared under the aegis of the Secretary-\nGeneral by the Brahimi Panel. It is important to\nconsiderably enhance the United Nations capacity for\nthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping operations.\nThis can be done through the early completion of the\nsystem of standby arrangements. Peacekeeping units of\nthe United Nations Secretariat need to be strengthened,\nwith provision for professional planning, control and\ncommand of operations.\nRussia consistently advocates the expansion of\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\nstructures in the field of peacekeeping. Chapter VIII of\nthe United Nations Charter remains the basis for such\ninteraction. Any regional or \u201ccoalition\u201d operation\nshould be conducted under conditions of transparency\nand of reporting to the United Nations Security\nCouncil, whereas operations with enforcement\nelements should be carried out only with the\nauthorization of the Security Council.\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\nis a major regional partner of the United Nations in\npeacekeeping. In many respects, it was the close\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CIS\nthat made it possible to successfully resolve the\nconflict in Tajikistan. Such interaction will\nundoubtedly intensify along with the development of\nthe CIS anti-crisis potential. At the same time, for a\nstable peace to prevail in the conflict-affected regions\nin the CIS area the volume of international economic\nand humanitarian aid for their rehabilitation should be\nincreased.\nRussia attaches primary importance to the\nexpansion of cooperation between the United Nations\nand regional and subregional mechanisms in Africa to\nprovide for more effective crisis response on the\ncontinent. This is evidenced by the Russian\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations in a number of\nAfrican countries.\nThe entire experience of United Nations\npeacekeeping activities in recent years clearly shows\nthe priority of political and diplomatic methods of\nconflict settlement. It is precisely these methods that\nmake it possible to minimize the suffering of the\ncivilian population and to find ways to a stable peace.\nStrategic stability means the security and\ntranquillity of civil society and of the individual. This\ntask can be accomplished only through the combined\nefforts of the international community to counter\ncontemporary threats and challenges. These include,\ninter alia, aggressive separatism and religious\nextremism, illicit arms trafficking and organized crime.\nSuch an abhorrent manifestation of extremism as\ninternational terrorism poses a direct threat to security\nand stability. Today, terrorists of every stripe\nsometimes act in a more organized fashion than does\nthe world community confronting them. We expect that\nthe United Nations will step up its mobilization of\ninternational capacities to counteract terrorism. Such\ncooperation must be based on the clear principles set\nforth in the Security Council resolution 1269 (1999):\nno support whatsoever, no safe havens for terrorists,\nthe inevitability of punishment for every terrorist act.\nAs to those who violate these principles the Security\nCouncil must be ready to take measures against them\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter.\n8\n\nRussia intends to ratify the Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Financing elaborated under\nUnited Nations auspices. There is an urgent need to\ncomplete work on the convention for the suppression of\nacts of nuclear terrorism, and that work on a\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention should be\nstepped up.\nTerrorism is often closely linked with drug\ntrafficking and organized crime. We welcome the\ncompletion of the development of an international\nconvention against organized crime. Russia intends to\nsign it in the nearest future. We also support the\nproposal on drafting an international convention on the\nfight against corruption.\nStrategic stability means promoting human rights\nand freedoms everywhere. This area is an important\ncomponent of the United Nations activities aimed at\nestablishing a new world order based on international\nlaw.\nRussia contributes significantly to strengthening\nthe universal legal regime. Our country has signed the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\nSpeaking of pooling the efforts of States to\nresolve the twofold task of maintaining international\nsecurity and ensuring human security, human rights and\nfreedoms, we should constantly bear in mind that in the\ntwentieth century the rule of the ideology of racial\nhatred cost mankind scores of millions of human lives.\nUnfortunately, today, 55 years after the great victory it\nis still premature to speak of total eradication of the\nbacillus of national superiority.\nWe cannot accept a situation in which people do\nnot have the right to use their mother tongue, are\ndeprived of their citizenship and jobs on ethnic\ngrounds, when fighters against fascism are put behind\nbars while former fascists find favour with the\nauthorities. The Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nshould firmly respond to all such manifestations.\nStrategic stability must be based on a solid\nmaterial foundation. The twenty-first century will go\ndown in history as the century of mankind's\nbreakthrough to a qualitatively new level of\ndevelopment only if we manage to preserve peace and\ninternational security and at the same time impart\nnecessary dynamism and depth to the process of\neconomic and technological equalization between the\nenormous number of developing countries and the\ncomparatively small group of leading countries. This\ngoal cannot be achieved overnight. This will require \u2014\nunder the unifying and guiding hand of the United\nNations \u2014 a mechanism for collective democratic\nmanagement of the international monetary, trade and\neconomic systems. They must become more rational\nand fair and be targeted against poverty and\nunderdevelopment.\nIt is important to make the most of those\nopportunities which have been opened up by the new\ntechnological revolution in order to initiate the process\nof bridging the gap in the levels of development.\nInformation and communications technologies whose\npotential for speeding up global development is only\ncomparable to the invention of written language can\nserve as a driving force of that process. A chance has\nemerged to skip over several traditional stages of\ndevelopment through the introduction of global\ncomputer literacy and information technologies.\nMankind, equipped with this powerful instrument, will\nobtain a real opportunity to begin creating conditions\nfor a decent life and the all-around development of\nhuman beings everywhere on earth.\nStrategic stability means the preservation of a\nclean and healthy environment for the present and\nfuture generations. The United Nations has done a\ngreat deal to mobilize international efforts in that\nimportant field. The \u201cRio+10\u201d Forum, to be held in\n2002, will provide an opportunity not only to sum up\nthe results of those activities but also to outline a\nfuture-oriented follow-up programme.\nRussia supports the expansion of international\ncooperation within the United Nations framework in\nthe areas of biodiversity, climate, combating\ndesertification, as well as of forest preservation.\nThe recent increase over the last few years in the\nnumber of natural and man-made disasters and the\nconsequent growth of the scope of human and material\nlosses have made disaster management one of the most\nformidable global challenges facing mankind. While\nintensifying the United Nations efforts to promote\ninternational cooperation in this field, special attention\nmust be paid to the use of state-of-the-art specialized\ntechnologies for disaster management and to the search\nfor innovative mechanisms for their use in the interests\nof the entire international community.\n9\n\nThe United Nations \u2014 a unique universal forum\nin every respect, which has demonstrated in practice its\ncentral role in managing international affairs \u2014 should\nbecome a guarantor of such comprehensive strategic\nstability. Russia welcomes the consensus reached at the\nMillennium Summit on consolidating the United\nNations as the axis of the present world order. The time\nhas come for concrete collective measures to transform\nthe Organization into a sort of operational headquarters\nfor coordinating activities aimed at ensuring a new\nstrategic stability based on the principles of\nmultilateralism, equality and solidarity in resolving\nglobal problems.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once\nagain that the Russian Federation, for its part, is open\nto the closest interaction with all members of the\ninternational community in order to make strategic\nstability a cornerstone of the world order in the twenty-\nfirst century and the United Nations its reliable\nguarantor.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I join all those who have welcomed\nthe start of this fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. Endorsing the Millennium Declaration of\nthe Millennium Summit, I reiterate its message: Let\nus \u2014 the peoples of the United Nations, faced with\nnew challenges; brothers and sisters, partners linked by\nand in our support for the principles of our\nOrganization; with the expectations and constraints of\nour countries and peoples, yearning for peace and well-\nbeing; likewise facing the requirements of\nglobalization and the manifold risks of conflict and\nmarginalization \u2014 be united in our action; let us say:\n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d, inspired by new hope and new\nmomentum, are for a better millennium.\nThe delegation of Madagascar congratulates you,\nMr. President, on your unanimous election to preside\nover the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, a\ntribute both to your eminent diplomatic qualities and to\nyour country, Finland.\nWe also pay tribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the\ndedication and determination he displayed in presiding\nover the fifty-fourth session.\nWe convey our congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on his efforts he has made. His actions will\nbenefit all the citizens of the world, who are all anxious\nto leave deprivation and poverty behind.\nI also take this opportunity to thank, from this\nrostrum, the United Nations, for having adopted\nresolution 54/96 M of 14 March 2000, as well as all the\ncountries and organizations that helped Madagascar\nfollowing the cyclone damage at the beginning of this\nyear.\nWith regard to restructuring the United Nations, it\nis high time to enact such proposals as enlarging that\ncornerstone of collective peace that is the Security\nCouncil, streamlining the institutional structure to\nmake it work better, and improving the financial\nstructure with a view to a more equitable assessment of\ncontributions. The power of the veto, which in itself\nconstitutes a nullification of democracy, is\nincompatible with the founding principles of our\nOrganization.\nWe know that, unfortunately, Africa is a place of\nperpetual conflict, but a new impetus is manifesting\nitself in the search for lasting peace and reconciliation.\nWith regard to the crisis in Comoros, Madagascar\nrespects the position expressed by the Organization for\nAfrican Unity (OAU) at its thirty-sixth Assembly of\nHeads of State and Government, held at Lom\u00e9. The\nAntananarivo Agreement of April 1999 remains the\nviable solution for bringing to an end the separatist\ncrisis in Anjouan, a crisis that was caused by the\nunconstitutionality of the regime currently in power.\nMadagascar welcomes the efforts undertaken in\nBurundi by President Nelson Mandela in his capacity\n18\n\nas mediator and facilitator. Those efforts led to the\nsigning of the Arusha agreement, which we hope will\nallow the people of Burundi to be united once again\nand to find peace and a new impetus for development.\nMadagascar has long supported the struggle for\nself-determination of the Sahraoui people and\nencourages the implementation of the United Nations\nSettlement Plan as the only viable mechanism able to\nresolve the differences between the two parties.\nWe welcome the outcome of the mediation efforts\nundertaken by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of the\nRepublic of Djibouti. Thanks to those efforts, Somalia\nis now beginning to find peace after more than a\ndecade as a non-State. The election by the parliament\nin Djibouti on 25 August 2000 of Mr. Abdikassim\nSalad Hassan as the new President is a step towards\nagreement. The people of Somalia can now embark\nupon the process of restoring a State of law and civil\npeace through their own efforts and with the support of\nthe international community.\nThe desire in recent months for dialogue between\nthe two Koreas is encouraging. We welcome the\nsummit conference held in Pyongyang in June 2000 to\ndiscuss peaceful reunification that led to the signing of\na joint North-South declaration. The family reunions\nthat took place after half a century of separation were\nmoving, and such meetings should be facilitated in the\nfuture. The decision to have the athletes of the North\nand South march together at the Olympic Games in\nSydney reflects a desire for reconciliation.\nMadagascar is a peaceful island in the Indian\nOcean. Through me, my country reiterates its\ncommitment to carrying out disarmament. We are\ncounting on the implementation of the conventions\nprohibiting the production, proliferation and illicit\nsales of weapons of all kinds. On 25 August 1999,\nMadagascar ratified the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of\nAnti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\nFurthermore, our Parliament's ratification process for\nthe Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has\nbegun.\nThe proliferation of light weapons is one of the\ncauses of the spread of conflict. My country therefore\nfully supports the convening in 2001 of an international\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations on\nthe illicit trafficking in light weapons in all its aspects.\nWe pay tribute to the United Nations peace\nvolunteers who were victims of the recent terrorist act\nof aggression in West Timor. We underscore the need\nfor a joint strategy to deal with the current wave of\nviolence. Thus on 1 October 1999, Madagascar signed\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings. We look forward to a speedy\nconclusion of the draft convention for the suppression\nof acts of nuclear terrorism.\nMadagascar strongly supports the\nrecommendations of the Brahimi report and looks\nforward to their effective and speedy implementation\nso as to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of our\nOrganization. We should stress the training, equipping\nand safety of peace volunteers. In this connection, the\ncountries concerned and neighbouring States should\nmake their contributions. Adopting a comprehensive\napproach to conflict prevention is necessary because\nthe problem needs to be tackled at the source.\nBecause we support democracy and the\nobservance of human rights and the rights of citizens,\nMadagascar joined in the decision taken at Algiers in\n1999 during the thirty-fifth OAU Assembly of Heads\nof State and Government to condemn the taking of\npower through unconstitutional means. A resolution of\nthe thirty-sixth Assembly, which was held at Lom\u00e9,\nurges the international community to condemn with\none voice such anti-democratic practices and to enact\nsanctions against regimes that result from such\npractices.\nIn the new millennium, let us ensure that children\nremain at the heart of our collective efforts. The\ntwenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,\non social development, held in June 2000 at Geneva,\nemphasized the need to protect children, to inform\nthem of their rights and to educate them fully in order\nto prepare them for citizenship.\nIn order to mark the Millennium Summit, on 7\nSeptember 2000, Madagascar signed Optional\nProtocols: one to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild, on the involvement of children in armed\nconflict, and another to the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen. Gender equality is for us an ongoing\nchallenge.\nWe condemn anything that runs counter to the\nprogress of human beings, and we endorse the common\nstruggle against social scourges and transnational\n19\n\ncrime. We also wish to draw attention to the upsurge in\nsuch new areas of concern as sex tourism, paedophilia\nand the spread of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, together with\nmy sister Ministers for Social Affairs, we spoke out in\nfavour of a united struggle against those scourges in a\nletter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\nWhat Africa needs is easier access to care and\nmedications. Without opposing in any way the noble\nprinciple of freedom of thought and expression, we\ndeplore the ill effects of any type of physical or moral\naggression that is the result of the proliferation of cults,\nand media representations of obscene and immoral\nimages. In this regard, legal instruments should be\ndesigned and implemented to create parameters for the\nelectronic dissemination of material that poses a threat\nto morality.\n\nThe signing by Madagascar on 7 September last\nof the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\nRights of the Child on the sale of children, child\nprostitution and child pornography attests to our\ndetermination to work to safeguard the family unit and\nfamily values, which are a source of human dignity and\nwhich guarantee stable sustainable social development.\nIn this context, Madagascar adopted a law in 1999\nwhich outlaws paedophilia.\nMadagascar has also involved itself in the various\nstages of the negotiations that led to the adoption and\nthe signing, on 14 September 2000, of the Protocol on\nBiosafety, the objective of which is to avert the dangers\nof using genetically modified substances. Madagascar\nis also against any use of the research relating to the\ncloning of human beings.\nThe economic and social difficulties facing my\ncountry are made worse by the uncertainty and changes\nin the international system. We must therefore\nstrengthen international dialogue on the basis of\npartnership and shared responsibility. We are\nconvinced that the promotion of a culture of peace and\nof mutual understanding will help bring about a\nharmonious world. Accordingly, Madagascar supports\nGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22, which proclaimed\n2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations.\nWe hope that this session will outline strategies\nthat are consonant with the requirements of\ndevelopment and of human security, in keeping with\nthe plan of action proposed by the Secretary-General in\nhis report.\nAn overall rethinking of development is\nnecessary, because it is in everyone's interests to\nincrease the purchasing power of the developing\ncountries, so that in the near future they can become\nequal partners as well as a potential market. We\ndeplore the glaring inequalities that exist today: our\npeoples are suffering from famine and malnutrition,\nwhereas some others are enjoying amazing\noverproduction. This imbalance does nothing to\npromote commercial and financial flows. We therefore\nsupport the Millennium Summit Declaration, which\nproposes the adoption of a duty-free admission policy\nfor products exported by the developing countries, an\nincrease in official development assistance, and the\nimplementation of a debt relief and forgiveness\nprogramme.\nThe holding in May 2001 of the third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\nshould lead to decisions that ultimately will help to\neliminate the least-developed-country category from\nthe scale of world economic values.\nAccordingly, we support the principles of self-\nconfidence and of mutual trust in the establishment of a\nmonetary fund \u2014 a development fund \u2014 and a\ncommodity price stabilization fund. This initiative\nseeks to both reduce the vulnerability of the developing\ncountries to exogenous factors and to decrease the\ndependence of our economies on those of the\ndeveloped countries.\nConcerning Africa specifically, regional and\ncontinental integration is vital in order to avoid\nmarginalization. In this respect, Madagascar signed the\ndraft Charter of the African Union, which is the\nexpression of the rebirth of a responsible, sovereign\nAfrica.\nImportant meetings await us in 2001, including\nthe high-level intergovernmental meeting on financing\nfor development and the special session to follow up on\nthe World Summit for Children, which are all\nopportunities to give real meaning to the commitments\nundertaken during this Millennium Assembly.\nWe have come to this historic session convinced\nthat it will breathe new life into our Organization and\nprovide the basis for a dynamic for peace and\n20\n\ncooperation. We have come here because we have\nconfidence in concerted action to meet today's\nchallenges. We have come here because we have hope\nin a viable future free from need in a world of well-\nbeing and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin, Sir, by\ncongratulating you on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish you\nall the best in carrying out your duties. I would also\nlike to welcome the Republic of Tuvalu to the United\nNations.\nLast week my Prime Minister, Mart Laar, spoke\nto the Millennium Summit on a number of issues\nEstonia sees as being especially salient to the United\nNations this year. In my brief remarks today, I would\nlike to underline four in particular: first, the need to\nreform the Security Council; secondly, efforts to raise\nthe effectiveness of peacekeeping; thirdly, the\nimportance of narrowing the global gap between rich\nand poor; and, fourthly, the role of information\ntechnology in furthering development.\nThe first concerns efforts to reform the Security\nCouncil. The strong executive power vested in the\nCouncil was originally designed for the Council to\nprovide a venue for speedy decisions and subsequent\naction. In practice, however, the Council is\nincreasingly prone to indecisive waffling, which in turn\nundermines its own authority and credibility, and thus\nits effectiveness. In order to combat that effect, Estonia\nbelieves that the voting procedures and mechanisms\ngoverning the work of the United Nations most\npowerful body must be revamped.\nOne such procedure that deserves our attention is\nthe veto. Some permanent members of the Security\nCouncil have used the veto, or have threatened to do\nso, in order to advance their own domestic and foreign\npolicy interests, irrelevant to the particular issue at\nhand. Because the Security Council derives its\nlegitimacy from all Member States, it is the duty of the\npermanent members to exercise their veto power\nresponsibly.\nThe composition of the Council, which still\nreflects the power relationships current in 1945, is\nanother issue that calls out for resolution. From the\ninception of the United Nations that year until just a\ndecade ago the people of my country were afforded\nonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the United\nNations through tears in the fabric of the Iron Curtain.\nWhen we finally re-established our independence, in\n1991, we emerged onto the international arena only to\n27\n\ndiscover that the Security Council, judging by its\ncomposition, was still stuck back in 1945. This strikes\nEstonia as being anachronistic, if not wrongheaded.\nThe guarantors of, and greatest contributors to, stability\nin the world have in the course of half a century\nchanged fundamentally. We need not fear opening a\ndiscussion on whether the moral and legal reasoning\nunderlying Security Council membership in the wake\nof the Second World War is still appropriate for the\ntwenty-first century. If countries have fundamentally\nchanged, so should, and so can, the United Nations.\nMy second point regards peacekeeping. Earlier\nthis year my Government decided to forgo the discount\nrate that meant paying only 20 per cent of our\npeacekeeping assessment. Instead, we voluntarily and\nunilaterally opted to shoulder 100 per cent of what is\nexpected of us. This is because Estonia regards\npeacekeeping as being among the United Nations most\ncrucial assignments in fulfilling its historical mandate\nof collective security. Security cannot be had at\ndiscount prices. That is why Estonia is willing to pay\nmore for what we hope will be a better product.\nPaying our own way is not enough to raise the\neffectiveness of peacekeeping, however. What we\nrequire, as Prime Minister Tony Blair said here last\nweek, is a far broader concept of security. The Security\nCouncil took an important step last week towards\nensuring the security of people and frontiers with its\nunanimous resolution to overhaul United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. Those changes should create\na more potent and better financed force that can react\nquickly where needed.\nMy third point focuses on the need to increase\nequality around the globe. In his millennium report, the\nSecretary-General called on all of us to focus on the\neradication of poverty. We can go a long way towards\nlevelling the playing field for all peoples by alleviating\ndebt and allocating more resources for development\nassistance. It is not as simple as that, however. As my\nPrime Minister, Mart Laar, said here last week, these\nefforts must go hand in hand with good governance and\nopen markets. Without a commitment to these two\nelements, no amount of aid or debt relief will bring us\ncloser to our intended goal.\nThe idea that open governments and open\nmarkets are a prerequisite for good economic\nperformance leads me to my fourth and final point,\nnamely, the role of information and communications\ntechnology in furthering development. In his\nmillennium report, the Secretary-General rightly\nstressed the need to ensure that the fruits of new\ntechnologies, especially information technology, are\navailable to all.\nI personally took part in the High-level Panel of\nExperts on Information and Communication\nTechnology, held here at the United Nations last April,\nbecause we have some experience in these matters.\nEstonia has the honour of finding itself among the 20\nmost computerized nations in the world. More\nimportantly, we have done this not as a rich country,\nbut as a nation with rather modest means.\nAmong the Panel's most important findings was\nthe undisputed, if not terribly original, conclusion that\ninformation technology programmes are, in fact,\nbeneficial for development. Computer technology can\nbe a wedge, or it can be a bridge. It need not follow\nthat poor nations fall ever behind. Policies can be\nimplemented, as we have discovered, that turn the\n\u201cdigital divide\u201d into a \u201cdigital dividend\u201d.\nWe have seen this in my country firsthand\nthrough our Tiger Leap programme whereby every\nschool in Estonia has, for some time now, been\nconnected to the Internet. Even more clearly, we have\nwitnessed how access to information technology has\nbrought new possibilities to rural areas, the areas which\noften bear the brunt of change. This is why Estonia\nwholeheartedly endorses, and will actively participate\nin, the United Nations plans to assist all Members in\nmaking the information technology dream a reality."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly, and to express my strong conviction that,\nunder your guidance, the work of this session will be\nconducted successfully. I would also like to take this\nopportunity to express my great appreciation for the\nwork carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, and for his competent guidance of the\nprevious session.\nAt the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a\nsovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to\nmaking its modest contribution, in the activities of the\ncommunity of countries Members of the United\nNations, to greater peace, stability, security and\neconomic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating\ninternal political and economic stability, as well as by\npursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving\nconstructive cooperation with the countries of South-\nEastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session,\nAlbania has been taking further steps towards\nconsolidating its democratic institutions and\nconstitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its\neconomy and consolidating and ensuring respect for\nhuman rights. Because of the efficient measures\nundertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to\nthe help provided by our partners, Albania is\nrecovering from the consequences of last year's\nconflict in Kosovo.\nAlbania has become an open and safe country for\nforeign investment. The policies of the Albanian\nGovernment to privatize strategic sectors and absorb\nforeign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of\nsecurity and public order, as well as the fight against\norganized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that\nare appreciated not only within my country, but\nelsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the\nestablishment of the office of Ombudsman have further\nraised the level of protection of and respect for human\nrights in Albania.\nAlbania is currently on the eve of local elections,\nwhich will be of fundamental importance for the future\ndevelopment of the country  not because of the\nresults so much as because of the way in which the\nelections will be conducted. For this reason, the\nAlbanian Government, in close cooperation with\nspecialized international institutions, such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nthe Council of Europe, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and others, has made every\neffort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and\ndemocratic.\nAlbania has clearly expressed its intention to play\na primary and constructive role in the common\nattempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and\nstable region, clearly aiming at European integration.\nThe policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a\nrequirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent\nexpression of goodwill and mutual interest in the\n8\n\nprotection of democratic institutions, fundamental\nfreedoms, stability and prosperity in the region.\nConsequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded\ntowards the creation of stable relations of mutual\ncooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to\nbe a primary strategy for future European integration.\nRelations with these countries have been\ninstitutionalized not only bilaterally, but also\nmultilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these\nrelations common economic, political and security\ninterests, as well as respect for human freedoms and\nrights, including those of national minorities living in\nthe territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to\nmake inter-Balkan relations follow the model of\nexisting relations among European Union member\ncountries, with the free movement of people, goods and\ncapital.\nMore than a year after the bloody conflict in\nKosovo that endangered peace and stability in the\nregion, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that\nthe situation in Kosovo has improved significantly\nsince the beginning of the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of\nthe Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the\nUnited Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands\nof refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by\nthe war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the\neconomy and of the common administration\ninstitutions has begun and the political situation and\norder in the country have improved significantly.\nThe current situation in Kosovo contradicts the\nsceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and\nthere, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against\nthe establishment of the United Nations administration\nthere. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a\nyear ago will not fade, but will make us more\nconscious of the catastrophic consequences that the\nchauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to\nan innocent civilian population.\nIn order to make a contribution to the founding of\na democratic society in Kosovo in which human and\nnational rights are fully respected, we have established\nvery close relations with the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their\nrepresentatives. Albanians, even more than other\npeople in the region, wish for and will welcome the\ndemocratization of Serbia, because, historically, they\nhave suffered more than others from Serbian\nnationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up\nwith reality, and we have to be realistic.\nFollowing very attentively the preparations for\nlocal elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government\nexpresses its conviction that the political forces in\nKosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in\naccordance with democratic principles and values,\nwithout acts of political violence. We would also like\nto express our sincere will for the full participation of\nthe Serb community and of the other minorities in\nKosovo in this electoral process because, as we have\npreviously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and\nmulticultural Kosovo.\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\nthe entire international community to apply stronger\npressure against the Milosevi\u0107 regime in order to force\nhim to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners\nand hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help\nbring the criminals who caused the massacres against\nthe Kosovar population before the United Nations\nTribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to\nstrengthen the international police presence and to\nwork on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect\nany kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it.\nI would also like to reiterate that the realization\nof United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the\npromises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar\neconomy is of special importance. It should be\nincluded in regional cooperation projects, especially in\nthe framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\nEurope.\nAlthough the Balkan political scenery has\nchanged, and the countries of the region are engaged in\na process of cooperation, there still exists a source of\ntension and conflict in the region, a source that has\nconsequences for the countries of the region and\nbeyond. It is Milosevi\u0107's regime. He was not satisfied\nby the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he\npersonally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is\ndestroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining\nYugoslavia.\nNext week, presidential and parliamentary\nelections will be held in Serbia. The current situation\nthere indicates that very little chance exists for them to\nbe free and fair. The recent amendments to the\nYugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the\nopposition and the student movement and the\n9\n\ncensorship and closing down of independent media are\nexplicit facts proving that Milosevi\u0107 may transform\nthese elections into a tool for illegally maintaining\npower.\nLike all the rest of the international community,\nthe Albanian Government looks forward to genuine\ndemocratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces\nthat possess new visions for the future of their country\nand of the whole region.\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, I would like\nto thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General, for the positive developments in\nKosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to\nstabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic\ninstitutions there.\nAs a neighbouring country, Albania closely\nfollows developments in Montenegro. It condemns\nMilosevi\u0107's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to\nundermine the democratic and integrative processes\nthat are being undertaken by the legitimate\nMontenegrin leadership. Following the good-\nneighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the\nAlbanian Government has recently developed\nintensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current\nrelations have reached the highest level ever known,\nhaving been extended to areas of mutual interest, such\nas political, economic and trade cooperation, the free\nmovement of people and so forth. It is our intention to\nfurther extend and strengthen these relations in the\nfuture.\nThe countries in our region are involved in an\nalready irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration.\nNot only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now\naware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe,\nof the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is\nnot integrated into the European Union. The regional\nconflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to\nunderstand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not\nonly in the interest of its countries, but also in the\ninterest of the European Union itself. An economically\ndeveloped and democratically consolidated Balkans\ncannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The\nEuropean integration of the Balkans and its\ndevelopment consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no\nimportance whether a country tries to protect its\ndemocratic institutions, laws, public order or respect\nhuman rights; it can never attain the desired success if\nit is not economically developed.\nWe are conscious that European integration is not\nan easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and\ndifficult path. Before being integrated into the\nEuropean Union, all the countries of our region should\nfirst be integrated among themselves, and existing\nsocieties in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect\nthe best features of European civilization. In order to\nachieve this, we should first combat and overcome\nextreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and\npolicies, because Europeanization means\ncooperation, tolerance and integration.\nThe end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a\nturning point for the future of the Balkans. The\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best\nresponse to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like\nthe European Union member countries, consider this\ninitiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration\nof South-Eastern Europe into the European structures.\nThe Albanian Government regards the implementation\nof the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities.\nAlbania is highly appreciated by its international\npartners for the engagement and the responsibility it\nhas shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the\nStability Pact projects. We hope that the strong\npolitical will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end\nof the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by\nthe will to finalize financial support for the rapid\nimplementation of the Stability Pact projects.\nAlbania's achievements in its domestic and\nforeign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its\nfurther integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The\nAlbanian people have a clear European orientation, and\nthat is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10\nyears have enjoyed their total support for their\nEuropean integration policy. The present Albanian\nGovernment, representing and expressing the will of\nthe people, has continuously fulfilled all the required\nconditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a\nhigher level of relations with the European Union. We\nhope that in the near future the institutions of the\nEuropean Union will approve the status report that the\nAlbanian Government presented at Brussels several\nmonths ago. This approval will pave the way for the\nbeginning of negotiations to reach Albania's\nassociation and stability agreement with the European\nUnion. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade\nOrganization in July this year was also an encouraging\nand very optimistic event in this respect.\n10\n\nThe Albanian Government has welcomed the\ninitiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of\nthe European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in\nNovember this year. It is another affirmation of\ncommon efforts to further advance the democratization\nand integration processes in the region and the\nconsolidation of security and stability there.\nThe new century has started. We should keep on\nfacing old problems, along with our new challenges.\nSome of those may be local crises, organized crime,\ntraffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so\nforth, all of which require practical and well-oriented\ncooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of\nthe world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia\nand so forth, made the role of such organizations as the\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the\nother hand, the world has entered the era of\nglobalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is\nunavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring\nnegative consequences, especially to small and poor\ncountries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is\nnecessary to compile and to implement global\nstrategies, and the United Nations can easily do that.\nOnly a week has passed since one of the most\ndistinguished events for the international community,\nthe Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all\nthe leaders of the world, where they affirmed their\ngoodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the\nnew millennium and in strengthening the United\nNations. The Albanian Government hails the results of\nthe Summit and expresses its conviction that all United\nNations Member countries should unite all their forces\nfor the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the\nfinal Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report:\nWe must do more than talk about our\nfuture, however. We must start to create it.\n(A/54/2000, para. 17)\nIt is time to take concrete steps in this direction.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on\nbehalf of the delegation of His Majesty King Mswati\nIII, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the Government\nand the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland, may I\nextend hearty congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri of\nthe Republic of Finland on his election as President of\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also\nwish to pay my country's rich tribute to Mr. Holkeri's\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for his\nexemplary stewardship of the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\nquietly and peacefully, according to the wishes of our\npeople. Against a backdrop of difficult economic\ncircumstances, we have declared the year 2000 our\nYear of Delivery in a number of key economic, social\nand political areas. In the coming weeks, the\nCommission that is reviewing the national Constitution\nwill complete its work, and we look forward to\nreceiving its report. Those recommendations will be\nthe result of an extensive and all-inclusive process of\nconsultations and will reflect precisely the wishes of\nthe entire Swazi nation. We believe this national\nexercise will further enhance the unity of the Swazi\npeople and provide the best possible foundation for our\ncontinuing peace and stability.\nOn the economic front, we continue to make\nevery effort to achieve sustainable growth and to\nreduce the level of poverty among our people. In\naddition to encouraging both local and foreign\ninvestment, the Government this year launched an\nambitious programme of initiatives called the\nMillennium Project, targeting the tourism and\nmanufacturing industry subsectors. This project is\ndesigned to maximize the potential of the Kingdom in\nthese areas and to reduce the current unacceptably high\nlevel of unemployment, which is threatening to\nundermine all our best efforts at development.\nAmong the many challenges we face as a\ndeveloping nation, there is no question that the\nHIV/AIDS crisis presents the most serious threat to our\nhopes of improving the lives of our people. In the last\nyears of the twentieth century, much of the progress we\nhave achieved in 32 years of independence in social\nwelfare is being reversed by the rapid spread of this\nmost terrible disease. HIV/AIDS represents the single\nmost important issue facing our nation today, and we\ndesperately need the support of the international\ncommunity in our efforts to contain the threat to our\nvery existence as a nation. We look to the United\nNations to take a much stronger leadership role in this\nglobal crisis, and to help us to mobilize resources to\nreverse the catastrophic spread of the pandemic.\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland joined other developing countries in\nexpressing concern at the negative effects of\nglobalization on our economies, especially in the\ncontext of the widening gap between the rich and the\npoor countries. We are, however, reassured by\nSummit's agreement to take measures to ensure that\nglobal trends such as globalization should have at their\nheart the principle of equitable benefit for all nations,\nregardless of size, level of development or economic\nstrength.\nThus, in recent years, we have waited with great\nexpectation to benefit from initiatives, particularly in\nthe area of preferential trade access, that have been\nbroadcast by our international friends and partners as\nmeasures that are designed to help the developing\nworld to overcome the negative effects of\nglobalization.\nMy delegation is optimistic, therefore, that the\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit will indeed\nserve as an historic occasion of strengthening\ninternational peace and security, as well as the\nprosperity of our people, in order to establish a fair\ninternational order. Beginning with this session, what\nremains for all of us now is to see to it that the wishes\nof the founding fathers of the United Nations are\nfulfilled. Those wishes, ambitious as they may be, are\nnot unreachable and can be achieved. This session,\ntherefore, has the task of setting the pace for the\ndialogue that lies ahead. Both the Millennium Summit\nand this session of the General Assembly will have a\n34\n\ndirect impact on the success of the United Nations in\nachieving the goals set by those great visionary leaders.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\nthe Organization has held several global conferences.\nHowever, the implementation of commitments in some\ncases is regrettably slow. One of the priorities for the\nUnited Nations should be an effective, integrated and\ncoordinated implementation and follow-up of all these\nconferences. The implementation should be further\nenhanced within the existing machinery of the United\nNations through improving its functions.\nPeace-building is a prevention task of growing\nimportance. With the disaster that befell the United\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), the\nUnited Nations is facing one of the most\ncomprehensive tasks in its history, which perhaps has\nmade the need to review peacekeeping operations more\nimperative. We remain concerned about the serious\nnegative impact of the proliferation of conflicts in the\nworld, particularly in Africa, on development capacity\nand on progress towards economic, social and political\ntransformation. The situation in those countries\naffected by conflicts is appalling and deserves the\nOrganization's urgent attention.\nIn Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nRwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Angola, among\nothers, have been the scene of terrible turmoil, mass\nmurders, destruction of property and much suffering on\nthe part of refugees over the years. The Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) have done\nmuch to contain and resolve some of these conflicts;\nand the United Nations has also rendered its support.\nWhile some progress has been made in resolving some\nof these conflicts, much still needs to be done,\nespecially by the parties involved. The latter have a\nresponsibility to observe agreements concluded and\nmust work closely together with the United Nations\nand the regional organizations involved so that peace\nprocesses can be brought to a successful conclusion.\nWith regard to the Middle East, we are\nencouraged by the continued efforts by President\nClinton and other leaders to bring both Israel and\nPalestine to the negotiating table. We are hopeful that a\nlong-lasting solution, which has eluded the region for\nso long, will be found soon.\nThere is now more than ever a pressing need to\nfinally carry out the long overdue substantial reform of\nthe Security Council. The Council must fully recognize\nthe new realities of the global landscape. It must have a\nmore representative composition, and above all, it must\nbe equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of today.\nReform must involve enlargement to include both more\npermanent and non-permanent members, as well as\nstrengthening its decision-making powers.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland unreservedly supports\nboth the Non-Aligned Movement and the African\nGroup positions in as far as the review of the\ncomposition and working methods of the Security\nCouncil is concerned. We do trust that the ongoing\ndebate in the working group set up for this purpose will\ncontinue and that it will yield the much-expected\nresults. The stage which the negotiations have now\nreached is such that it requires the commitment of all\nMember States if indeed the Security Council is to be\nequipped with all the tools it needs to be equitably\nrepresentative. Participation of the United Nations\nmembership at large in the decision-making process,\ntransparency in its work and imposition of Charter\nrestraints on the veto, with the aim of its eventual\nabolition, are indispensable imperatives.\nThe enhancement of the relevance of the United\nNations requires, first and foremost, strengthening the\nrole and increasing the efficiency of the General\nAssembly through focusing its deliberations on\ncontemporary challenges and problems facing the\nworld, engaging it in timely and effective decision-\nmaking to address global economic and political issues\nand enabling it to seriously examine and effectively\nreact to the work of the other organs of the United\nNations, particularly the Security Council. In this\ncontext, we believe that the General Assembly, as the\nsole democratic universal and transparent organ, is the\nproper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the\nimplications of the emerging debates on collective\naction.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joins others in\nwelcoming the Republic of Tuvalu as a new member of\nthe Organization. The addition of Tuvalu brings closer\nto fruition the hope of the founding fathers to see a\nUnited Nations comprised of all the countries of the\nworld. The United Nations is the only body that deals\nwith all fields of human activity. It has been a catalyst\nof many initiatives that have improved the lives of\npeoples across the world.\n35\n\nIn the same spirit of universality in which we\nwelcome Tuvalu, the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to\nreiterate its appeal to the United Nations regarding the\nquestion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The\nKingdom of Swaziland has in the past been in the\nforefront arguing in favour of the readmission of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, and our position remains\nunchanged. The case for including the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan in the activities of the United Nations\nand its associated agencies takes on even greater\nrelevance in the light of the peaceful transition of\nGovernment following the successful expression of the\nwishes of the people of Taiwan in the elections earlier\nthis year.\nThose 23 million people rightly consider it\nunacceptable that they are not represented in the one\nOrganization that should be truly global, and that they\ndeserve a review of the special circumstances\nsurrounding their bid. The Republic of China on\nTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness to\nparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace,\ndevelopment and stability, and we believe that the rest\nof the world is poorer for being denied their\ninvolvement. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that\nthis new millennium provides the perfect opportunity\nto raise this issue and to restore the right of the people\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate fully\nin the activities of our Organization.\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations. Its\nobjectives and values are universal. We must spare no\neffort in seeing to it that the United Nations continues\nto meet the current and evolving needs of its entire\nmembership. It must become the core instrument of\neffective and fair global governance, if it is to be\ncompletely transformed to be what its founding fathers\nhad envisaged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption\nof your important position. I would also like to\nwelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\nNations.\nNorway is committed to a strong and effective\nUnited Nations. For decades, we have pursued a policy\nof translating our commitment to the United Nations\ninto substantial contributions to the various activities\nof the United Nations system. That is why some 60,000\nNorwegians have served in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. That is why Norway today\ncontributes 1,500 military and civilian personnel to\nUnited Nations and United Nations-mandated\npeacekeeping operations around the world. That is why\nwe are supporting the peace and reconciliation efforts\nof the United Nations in the Middle East, Colombia,\nCyprus and Sudan. And that is why a relatively small\ncountry of 4.5 million inhabitants is one of the largest\ndonors of voluntary contributions to the economic,\nsocial and humanitarian programmes of the United\nNations. This year, Norway is providing $1.3 billion\ndollars for development cooperation. My Government\nplans to increase that amount substantially over the\nnext few years. A large part of that will be channelled\nthrough the United Nations system.\nAt the first session of the General Assembly in\nthe twenty-first century, and after the successful\nMillennium Assembly last week, it is time to take stock\nand act upon the decisions we have made. Here is what\nNorway will give priority to in the time ahead.\nWe will focus on the root causes of conflict and\nput the fight against poverty, underdevelopment and\nenvironmental degradation at the top of our agenda.\nFinancing for development is essential. Norway\nreached the 0.7 per cent target more than 20 years ago.\nWe are currently devoting 0.9 per cent of our gross\nnational product for official development assistance,\nand my Government has pledged to reach a full one per\ncent.\nWe will increase our support through the\nmultilateral development agencies, including our\n6\n\nsupport to the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP).\nWe will continue to advocate a more\ncomprehensive approach to peace-building. Conflict\nprevention, humanitarian relief and long-term\ndevelopment cannot be regarded as separate tasks.\nThey must be part of an integrated and coherent\nstrategy of human security.\nWe will continue to combat malaria, tuberculosis\nand other diseases. Malaria alone takes two lives every\nminute  of every day of every year, mainly those of\nchildren and pregnant women. We will significantly\nincrease our contribution to the vaccination of children,\nso that they do not die of easily curable diseases.\nWe will intensify our efforts to help contain and\nreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, which in many\ncountries has become the single largest threat to\ndevelopment. We will focus even more strongly on\nAfrica, as Africa needs a new and better deal. We call\nfor a renewed commitment to Africa and are prepared\nto contribute substantially to this effort.\nThe United Nations has mounted more peace\noperations during the last 10 years than during the\nprevious four decades combined. We have witnessed\nsignificant successes, but also uncovered disturbing\nand tragic weaknesses. Far too often  and frequently\nat great cost to the people we were supposed to\nprotect  the United Nations has relied on last-minute\nefforts and ad hoc arrangements. The rich and powerful\nMember States must honour their promises to the weak\nand defenceless.\nNorway supports the recommendations in the\nreport of the United Nations Panel on Peace\nOperations, headed by Ambassador Brahimi. We stand\nready to engage in a broad dialogue on how to ensure\nthe speedy and efficient implementation of the\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report.\nTogether with our partners, we will push forward\ntowards non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. We will work for further reductions in\nnuclear arsenals with a view to eliminating them,\nbuilding on the important results of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review\nConference here in New York.\nWe will continue to combat illicit trade and the\nspread of small arms. We should make full use of the\nopportunity provided by the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All its Aspects to take firm steps to\ncurtail this deadly traffic.\nNone of this can be done, however, if we do not\nsecure a sound financial basis for the United Nations\nitself. We must put United Nations finances on a more\nsecure and predictable footing. We must close the gap\nbetween the tasks we ask the United Nations to carry\nout and the resources we make available to it. Zero\ngrowth is clearly not sufficient. We cannot expect the\nUnited Nations to carry out new and additional tasks\nwithout additional funding.\nNo one must be allowed to commit war crimes or\ncrimes against humanity with impunity. Norway\ntherefore strongly supports the Statute establishing an\nInternational Criminal Court. Now we must seek its\nspeedy implementation.\nTo effectively meet our common challenges, we\nmust build new partnerships between the United\nNations, civil society and the private sector. The\nGlobal Compact' is one such initiative. The Global\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization' (GAVI) is\nanother. Early next year Norway will host an\ninternational conference in Oslo on the role of the\nprivate sector in promoting investment and economic\ndevelopment in the least developed countries.\nWe will continue to support efforts to enable\ndeveloping countries to take full advantage of the\nbenefits of multilateral cooperation. In particular, we\nwould like to assist the least developed countries \nincluding small island developing States  to benefit\nmore fully from joint international efforts, including\nthe legal regime for the seas and oceans established by\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nGlobalization provides opportunities for\nunprecedented growth, but it can also lead to\nmarginalization and isolation. In our globalized world,\nmarkets have become global much faster than politics.\nThere is an urgent need to adapt the international\ntrading and financial systems so that every country can\nobtain its fair share of the benefits of globalization.\nIn our shrinking world, providing humanitarian\naid and emergency relief to people in need is the\nresponsibility of every Government. Norway will\nincrease its humanitarian efforts  which are already\namong the most intensive in the world  both\n7\n\nbilaterally and through United Nations agencies and\nnon-governmental organizations.\nWe will to the best of our ability continue to\nfacilitate peace efforts in countries where the parties to\na conflict request our involvement. Ultimately,\nhowever, the responsibility for lasting peace rests with\nthe parties themselves.\nFinally, we reiterate our call for reform and\nenlargement of the Security Council in terms of both\npermanent and non-permanent members. Broader\nmembership and increased transparency are essential to\nthe legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council.\nFor the first time since 1979, Norway is seeking a\nseat on the Security Council. We hope to be elected,\nafter 22 years, based on our contributions to the United\nNations and on the principles of fair rotation. We\ntherefore ask for the support of the Assembly. Norway\nwill deeply respect a mandate from the Assembly. We\nwill be attentive to its voices and concerns. We will\nremain committed to help those who suffer from\npoverty and war, disasters and famine to place a strong\nUnited Nations at the centre of world affairs, to ensure\nthat those who have the strongest backs bear the\nheaviest burden. We ask the Assembly to allow us to\nserve all Members."

While assuring you of the\nreadiness of our delegation to fully cooperate with you,\nwe would like to wish you the utmost success as you\ncarry out your responsibilities.\nAllow me also to express my thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the remarkable\nrole he played during the previous General Assembly\nsession. His efforts made it possible to achieve positive\nresults in the review and resolution of many issues.\nThe Millennium Assembly takes place at a time\nwhen the world is at the crossroads of two different\neras. This makes it particularly important that this\nfifty-fifth session provide us with the opportunity to\ntake stock of what we have achieved together and to\nbegin developing a forward-looking strategy that will\nallow us to face the current challenges. We can identify\nand face these challenges only within the framework of\na multidimensional, international partnership in the\npolitical, economic, social and development spheres.\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his peers\nwho met at the Millennium Summit have underlined\nthe main challenges that the international community\nmust face. These challenges should set priorities for\nour joint efforts in the next stage, so that we can make\nthe next millennium a millennium of international\npartnership, of the development of joint strategies, of\nthe promotion of societies and satisfying their multiple\nneeds, of the struggle against poverty and epidemics, of\nconflict prevention and of the establishment of a lasting\n13\n\nbasis for peace and international security. In other\nwords we should make this millennium truly a\nmillennium of the common future of mankind.\nThe Declaration adopted by the Millennium\nSummit is a document of historical importance. It\npaves the way for the future work of the international\ncommunity within the framework of the principles and\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. In the\nDeclaration world leaders reaffirmed these purposes\nand principles and renewed their commitment to them.\nThey also reaffirmed their adherence to the United\nNations as the only forum for the expression of the\ninternational community's choices for the future and as\nthe ideal instrument for achieving our collective\naspirations.\nAt the end of the last millennium there were\nseveral major summits \u2014 including the Millennium\nSummit, the South Summit, the Non-aligned\nMovement summit and the two special sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to social development and\nwomen. The results of these summits and meetings, the\nvisions expressed and the decisions taken regarding the\nfuture of international relations provide an important\npoint of reference that makes it possible to develop a\nglobal and consensual strategy in order to build a true\npartnership between peoples and nations. The goal of\nthis partnership should be to take up the future\nchallenges together.\nAmong the lessons we have learned from these\nhistoric meetings was the consensus reached by all\ncountries on the need for a renewed vision of the\nworking methods that we have followed every year in\nrecent decades in order to adapt to the requirements of\nour time, when different aspects of international life in\nthe political, economic and social spheres are all\ninterlinked.\nThe challenges of our modern world require a\nglobal vision and common action that would take into\naccount the link between peace, security and\nsustainable development based on a political approach\nthat combines democracy, human rights and good\ngovernance, as well as overall strategies for the fight\nagainst poverty on an international scale. Indeed,\npoverty has been identified by major international\nauthorities and also in the statements that emerged\nfrom the Millennium Summit and the Security Council\nas well as by the Secretary-General in his reports to the\nMillennium Summit and to the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session as one of the main causes of\ninternational economic imbalance and as a source of\ninstability, conflict and tension in many regions of the\nworld.\nIn our opinion, the international community is\ncalled upon today to objectively develop a concept of\ninternational peace and security as well as the means to\npreserve them. It is called upon to adopt a broader\nconcept that takes into account not only the direct\ncauses of wars, conflicts and tensions, but also their\nentrenched roots and the means to resolve them in\norder to ensure their prevention and to guarantee peace\nand security. The last decade has shown the magnitude\nof the means that are required to resolve conflicts and\ntensions throughout the world. This has generated a\nweakening of international will when true and direct\nparticipation in the quest for solutions to the many\nconflicts was needed.\nThe United Nations, despite its limited resources,\nremains the main actor that can resolve these conflicts.\nPrevious experiences have taught us, among other\nthings, that the principle of conflict prevention remains\nthe best way to avoid conflicts and the resultant human\ntragedy and economic and social damage, which are\ndifficult to remedy.\nIndeed, within this international forum, we must\nwork with regional organizations and international\nfinancial institutions to implement a strategic plan of\naction with new dimensions that would enshrine the\nprinciple of prevention as the main way to avoid\nconflicts and to deal with their deep and structural\ncauses, through a global vision that would take into\naccount the pressing needs of economic and social\ndevelopment. Experience has proved that stability and\ninternal harmony within and between countries will not\nbe achieved without national development and\ninterdependent interests.\nIt is difficult indeed to imagine how a society can\nengage in internal violence or get involved in an\nexternal conflict if its interests are protected and if it\nenjoys well-being and prosperity \u2014 both fundamental\nconditions for peace and stability.\nThis vision conforms to the reform process under\nway at the United Nations, in the Security Council and\nat international financial institutions that have realized\nthat the cost of prevention is far lower than the cost of\npost-conflict reconstruction, especially since certain\n14\n\nconsequences, those that affect human beings, are\ndifficult to remedy.\nIt is therefore high time that industrialized\ncountries and international financial institutions\nhonoured their commitments towards disadvantaged\nregions and countries in the form of official\ndevelopment assistance, by encouraging foreign\ninvestment and by settling the debt problem, including\nthe servicing of the debt, in order to meet the\nrequirements of development and to contribute\neffectively to formalizing the idea of prevention based\non multifaceted international aid.\nBefore concluding my comments on the matter of\npeacekeeping and international security in this new\ninternational environment, I would like to underline the\nfollowing. First, there is a need to introduce necessary\nreforms into United Nations procedures when it comes\nto peacekeeping operations, especially since the\nactivities of our Organization are no longer limited to\ntraditional missions, but also encompass disarming and\nreintegrating combatants, removing landmines,\nestablishing State institutions and monitoring elections.\nThese new missions require greater material and\nhuman resources, as well as collective efforts. Of\ncourse, this requires a substantial strengthening of\nUnited Nations preventive capabilities.\nExperience has shown that the success of\npeacekeeping operations depends on the prior consent\nof the parties concerned, on a clear mandate and on the\navailability of necessary resources.\nWe have also observed through our experience in\npeacekeeping operations that serious problems do exist,\nespecially when it comes to delays in reimbursing\ncontributing countries.\nThe report of the group of experts, developed\nunder the chairmanship of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\ncontains important recommendations that command our\nattention and deserve in-depth study, especially since\nthey deal with all aspects of peacekeeping operations.\nSecondly, the role of the Security Council in\npeacekeeping and international security is crucial and\nindispensable. It draws its strength from the fact that it\nis a universal tool and that it embodies international\nlegality.\nAs always since the 1960s, Tunisia remains ready\nto meet the United Nations calls, as well as those of the\ninternational community, to take part in peacekeeping\noperations throughout the world. Given the priority of\nthe security of personnel serving in peacekeeping\noperations, in July Tunisia ratified the United Nations\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel.\nThe need to introduce reforms to the Security\nCouncil is dictated today by international\ndevelopments that have taken place since the adoption\nof the Charter. In this context, increasing the number of\npermanent and non-permanent members of that body\non the basis of equitable geographic distribution is an\nurgent demand. We would like to stress the need to\nreach a consensus that would make it possible to\nincrease the number of permanent members.\nIn this regard, I would like to recall that Tunisia\nsupports the candidacy of Japan, Germany and other\ncountries. An eventual solution should preserve the\ninterests of all international parties and make it\npossible to satisfy the demands of developing countries\nand, above all, African countries, which are entitled to\ntwo permanent seats on the Security Council, to be\ndistributed according to the rule of rotation. It is also\nnecessary to improve the working methods of the\nCouncil in order to ensure that its work is marked by\ntransparency and effectiveness. Since acceding to the\nSecurity Council as a non-permanent member, Tunisia\nhas tried to ensure that its contribution to the work of\nthat body is based on dialogue with the other members\nin order to bring viewpoints closer together and to\nreach results that would guarantee the success of all\nendeavours to safeguard peace and international\nsecurity.\nAlong the same lines, with respect to the role of\nthe Security Council, we cannot overlook the question\nof humanitarian intervention, which has been the\nsubject of widening debate in recent years and whose\nreview calls for particular and sustained attention.\nWe stress the need for an in-depth examination of\nall aspects of this matter. Indeed, if a particular\nhumanitarian situation requires urgent intervention so\nthat it does not deteriorate, such intervention cannot\ntake place outside the framework of international law,\nthe basic principles and norms of international relations\nand the provisions of the United Nations Charter. State\nsovereignty remains a fundamental tenet that can never\nbe overlooked or ignored, because any violation of this\n15\n\nprinciple would alter the balance of international\nrelations and risk the spread of anarchy.\nThe question of sanctions is one of the most\nimportant issues that United Nations bodies, including\nthe Security Council, have to face. The experience of\nthe past decade has shown that the use of sanctions\nmust be modified so as to alleviate their impact on\npeoples, while certain criteria, such as their use as a\nlast resort after all other peaceful means have been\nexhausted, must be applied.\nIn cases in which the imposition of sanctions is\nnecessary, their duration should be limited. We should\nalso define clear conditions for the lifting or\nsuspension of sanctions and undertake an ongoing\nassessment of their humanitarian effects on the\npopulation of the target countries, as well as their\ndirect impact on the interests of third countries.\nIn this connection, with regard to Iraq, Tunisia\nhas always reaffirmed the need to unite all our efforts\nin order to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute\nthat would make it possible to end the embargo,\nreintegrate Iraq into the community of nations, put an\nend to the tragic suffering of the Iraqi people resulting\nfrom the sanctions imposed over the past 10 years and\nhelp to direct the efforts of the countries of the region\nand their peoples towards the achievement of\ndevelopment and stability. All parties must cooperate\nin order to resolve the other humanitarian aspects of\nthe problem, in particular the issue and fate of missing\nKuwaiti nationals.\nWith regard to the Lockerbie affair, the recent\ndevelopments following the implementation of the\nagreement concluded on the matter and the suspension\nof the embargo imposed on Libya, it is time for\nsanctions to be lifted completely and definitively in\norder to allow the Jamahiriya to continue its overall\ndevelopment process and to support the Arab Maghreb\nUnion (AMU) as it strives to achieve the integration\nand complementarity on which all of its member States\nplace great importance. Tunisia has made the AMU a\nstrategic choice. It is constantly working to promote\nthe Union and to strengthen its foundations and\nstructures. With the help of its partners in the Union, it\nhas tried to give this regional organization new impetus\nso that it can respond to the historic aspirations of its\npeoples.\nWith regard to the Middle East, we would like to\nexpress our regret that the negotiations at the Camp\nDavid summit meeting held in July stalled without an\nagreement that would guarantee a fair settlement of the\nPalestinian cause. Tunisia, which from the outset has\nsupported the peace process on all tracks, is convinced\nthat it is time to give concrete form to the legitimate\naspirations of the Palestinian people to build an\nindependent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital, in accordance with international law and the\nterms of reference of the peace process based on the\nprinciple of land for peace. Tunisia hopes that the\nAmerican Administration will continue its good\noffices, and that other influential parties, such as the\nEuropean Union, Russia and Japan, will step up their\nefforts to help the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli\nGovernment reach an agreement that would make it\npossible to establish a just and lasting peace and\nguarantee the national rights of the Palestinian people\nin accordance with General Assembly and Security\nCouncil resolutions, in particular Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nAchieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast will also depend on progress on the Syrian track.\nIsrael is called upon to withdraw from the Golan and to\ncomply fully with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973). Israel is also called upon to\nrespect the international borders of Lebanon and to\nrefrain from violating the borders drawn by the United\nNations.\nOur States are encouraged to try to identify ways\nand means to face the phenomenon of globalization,\nwith its consequences and economic and social\nrepercussions, and to adapt to it in order to ensure that\nits dividends are shared and to spare our peoples,\nespecially peoples of the South, the negative fallout\nfrom it.\nThe African continent is a region suffering most\nfrom development problems, despite major reforms\nundertaken by the countries of the continent in\ndifferent areas. Despite the efforts made by certain\nAfrican countries, Africa is still suffering from a severe\nlack of resources and assistance which prevents it from\njoining the global development process. In this context,\none of the greatest challenges is to prevent the\nmarginalization of the economies of developing\ncountries and to ensure an international environment\nconducive to access to international markets and to an\nincreased share of international trade. This will require\nthe international community to provide the necessary\nimpetus in the area of investment and financing if these\n16\n\nStates are to develop, and to increase official\ndevelopment assistance, which has not only remained\nbelow 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the\ncountries of the North, but is actually decreasing, while\nthe external debt crisis and debt servicing continue to\nburden developing countries.\nIn this context, we recall the initiative of\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, calling for the\nrecycling of debts in development projects, which\nwould make it possible to reduce the debt burden and\nhelp the countries concerned.\nI also take this opportunity to recall the appeal\nmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 1995 for\nthe creation of a partnership and development contract\nbetween the countries of the south and north shores of\nthe Mediterranean. This appeal is an extension of\nPresident Ben Ali's initiative, launched in 1989 from\nthis lofty rostrum, for a global contract of peace and\nprogress between the countries of the North and South\naimed at strengthening cooperation and creating new\nprospects for stability and progress in the world.\nGiven the major progress achieved in the\nscientific and technological spheres in recent decades,\nthe millennium on which we are embarking will\nundoubtedly be one of science, technology and\ncommunications, necessitating the sharing of the\nbenefits of progress, including in the field of\ncomputers, which will create great prospects for the\nharmonious and balanced development of countries.\nIn this context, I recall Tunisia's initiative to hold\na world summit on the information society, and its\nproposal, in the framework of the International\nTelecommunication Union, to host such a summit in\n2003. I renew my appeal to all Member States and to\nthe parties and institutions interested in this field to\nsupport this initiative and contribute as much as\npossible to organizing the summit in Tunisia.\nPeace and security are part of a concept with\ncomplementary dimensions; it is no longer limited to\nthe outbreak, management and resolution of conflicts,\nbut, rather, encompasses everything that contributes to\nstrengthening stability and offers opportunities for\ndevelopment and prosperity. Furthermore, exclusion\nand marginalization, in all their aspects, undoubtedly\nlead to extremism and open the way to tension and\nviolence. We know today that the struggle against\npoverty has assumed considerable importance. Indeed,\nwhile many societies enjoy well-being and prosperity,\nlarge fringes of the world's population experience\npoverty and destitution, which are alien to moral values\nand human rights. Furthermore, abject poverty is one\nof the most dangerous sources of conflict and\ninstability. The fight against this planetary scourge and\nthe violence and internal and inter-State conflicts that it\nengenders is a universal duty and a moral obligation\nthat all international parties must assume.\nIn this context, I wish to reiterate the appeal\nlaunched by His Excellency President Zine El Abidine\nBen Ali for the creation of a world solidarity fund, as\nan instrument to complement existing international\nmechanisms, without replacing them. This fund could\nbe financed by donations and voluntary assistance from\nthe international community, and its objective would be\nto finance field programmes to fight poverty directly\nand urgently.\nPresident Ben Ali has made this proposal based\non the success of the experience of the National\nSolidarity Fund, 26.26, set up in Tunisia in 1992,\nwhich helped lower the rate of poverty in our country\nfrom 22 per cent to 6 per cent. This proposal has been\nfavourably received by member countries of the region\nand France, as well as by 12 international and regional\norganizations, such as the Group of 77, the Non-\nAligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, the South Summit and the General\nAssembly special session on social development. With\nthe international community's awareness of the need to\nfight poverty, and given the wide support that the\nproposal to create a world solidarity fund enjoys,\nTunisia would like to present, during the current\nsession, a draft resolution in this regard, which it hopes\nwill obtain all the support necessary from Member\nStates.\nTunisia has always attached great importance to\ndemocracy and good governance, because it is\nconvinced that these values are an integral part of any\nrebirth and development. Since the change of 7\nNovember 1987, we have introduced fundamental\nreforms to promote these values. Indeed, the principles\nof human rights, the culture of tolerance and respect for\nthe right to difference are the bases of change in\nTunisia, which has enriched the values of international\nsolidarity and collective responsibility at all levels:\npolitical, economic and social.\nThe existence of a national solidarity fund is the\nbest reflection of the importance of this aspect in\n17\n\nnational life. An individual's awareness of his\nresponsibility towards the future of his homeland\nimplies solidarity and cooperation with all components\nof society, making it possible to remedy the problems\nof exclusion and marginalization in society.\nDemocracy, human rights, good governance and\nnational solidarity are interlinked values that must take\ninto account the characteristics and specific features of\neach society, since there is no standard model that can\nbe applied to everyone everywhere. This vision, which\nhas been enshrined at various international forums\nwould, thanks to the positive results seen in different\ncountries, including Tunisia, be likely to constitute one\nof the main concepts we have been called upon to\nadopt consensually and to implement in the new\nmillennium.\nIndeed, the right of peoples to freedom and\ndemocracy is a concept that has become a daily\npractice in many countries and must be consolidated,\ntaking into account the requirements of growth and\nprogress that themselves constitute a fundamental\ncondition for peace and stability. In this context,\ninternational partnership is a common denominator that\nmust guide our action in the next millennium.\nFinally, allow me to express the hope that this\nsession will mark the rebirth of solidarity among all\ncomponents of the international community, within\nwhich the United Nations will play a leading role\nthrough its outreach and its ongoing harmonious\nactions. Our objective would be that our action should\ncontain a human global dimension to establish a\ncommon strategy and conditions for security, stability,\ndevelopment and prosperity on the basis of the\ncommon interests of all peoples everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me\nto join previous speakers in congratulating you on your\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session\nof the General Assembly. Nauru, like your\nGovernment, has full confidence in your ability to\nconduct the affairs the Assembly effectively and\nefficiently. Through you, Sir, Nauru congratulates the\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, for a job well\ndone which climaxed with the successful and\nunprecedented Millennium Summit.\nThe Republic of Nauru has just passed its first\nanniversary as a Member of this esteemed Organization\nwith a Permanent Mission in New York that is just nine\nmonths old. The admission of our brother island from\nthe Pacific, Tuvalu, as the 189th Member of the\nOrganization, is a most welcome development. On\nbehalf of my Government, I extend to Tuvalu our warm\nwelcome into the brotherhood of nations.\nMy delegation commends the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, and his team at the Secretariat for\ntheir well-crafted report entitled \u201cWe the peoples: the\nrole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d.\nThe report has captured, in one document, the agony\nand ecstasy of the United Nations as it journeyed\nthrough its triumphs and failures over the past 55 years\nof its existence.\nThe purpose of our presence in this parliament of\nthe peoples of the United Nations is not to bask in the\necstasy of past achievements but to pledge anew our\ncommitment and determination to face the problems\nthat continue to confront humanity, and to support the\nlaunching of the United Nations on a new crusade to\nengage the tempestuous challenges encapsulated in\nchapter VII of the Secretary-General's report. In\nconjunction with this, the heads of State or\nGovernment of Member States have mandated the\nAssembly, by their solemn act of adopting the outcome\ndocument, to implement the call for action.\nIt is further encouraging to hear Foreign\nMinisters expound upon and reinforce the\ncommitments that their respective heads of State or\n22\n\nGovernment made at the Millennium Summit. It is now\nfor the doers to deliver the goods, so to speak. It is here\nthat the greatest challenges lie. It is indisputable that\nthe issues before us are not new but are unfinished\nbusiness, and the most difficult on which to make\nprogress. The problem is in the interaction between\nMember States for the purpose of delivering agreed\ninstruments that will act as platforms by which\nMember States will be obligated to adopt and\nimplement at the national level.\nIt is therefore my delegation's strong view that\nour first priority is to revitalize and further strengthen\nthe foundation for collaboration and cooperation\namong Member States on the one hand, and between\nthe United Nations and the appropriate\nintergovernmental organizations and non-governmental\norganizations on the other. That is, not only must we\nresolve to provide the United Nations with the\nallocated resources and processes to perform its tasks\neffectively, but we must also repair the negative\nundercurrents and detrimental practices that inhibit the\nachievement of desired outcomes.\nIn this regard, Nauru considers the following\nactions to be necessary steps towards this goal.\nFirst, we must revitalize the work and restore the\nauthority of the General Assembly as the only\nuniversally representative body of the United Nations.\nSecond, there is a need to address the ongoing\nmarginalization of the smaller and less affluent\nMember States.\nThird, we must expedite the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Nauru believes that an expansion in\nSecurity Council membership is the politically correct\naction to take, and we urge participants and facilitators\nalike to expedite the work of the Working Group.\nFourth, the preference for unanimity as the means\nof deciding on issues under consideration is, in our\nview, a major factor behind the delay in reaching\nagreed solutions and has on more than one occasion\nresulted in the dilution of outcomes. Setting such a\nhigh standard, when the principal organs of the United\nNations come to decisions on a two-thirds majority\nbasis, is self-defeating. Nauru takes the view that a\nunanimous outcome should be a target only, and not a\nrule.\nFifth, financial resources need to be shored up.\nThe timely and unconditional payment of assessed\ncontributions will enable the United Nations to\ndischarge its responsibilities in a timely manner.\nVoluntary contributions are also a very essential source\nof funds to support the work of the subsidiary bodies\nand agencies through trust funds established under the\nUnited Nations. Nauru commends those Member States\nthat contribute to such trust funds over and above their\nassessed contributions, and we also recognize and\npraise the important contribution that private trust\nfunds such as the Ted Turner Foundation make to the\nwork of the United Nations and its main agencies.\nSixth, a number of covenants remain dormant due\neither to the lack of signatories to bring them into force\nor to the lack of ratification by States that have signed.\nWe thus call for all States to make a commitment to\nbringing outstanding international agreements into\nforce.\nSeventh, the Secretary-General's reform\ninitiatives of 1997 must be brought to bear in the\nshortest time possible so that the limited resources of\nthe United Nations are put to work more on the\nprogrammes of action and less on running the\nadministrative machineries. We urge that the\nSecretariat continue to review its operations on a\ntimely basis as it strives to do more with less.\nThe President of the Republic of Nauru, in his\nintervention in the round-table discussion, expressed\nhis disappointment that the core responsibilities of the\nUnited Nations regarding the rights of peoples to self-\ndetermination and freedom from alien domination did\nnot rank as importantly as the other issues currently\nbefore us. The fact that there are still 17 countries\nlisted in the Special Political and Decolonization\nCommittee, coupled with the non-settlement of long-\nstanding disputes between States over their borders,\nand the continuing existence of stateless people, may\nbe indicative of the priority that these issues receive\nwithin the United Nations.\nFor Nauru, the continued refusal of the United\nNations to deal with the plight of the millions of\nChinese on the island of Taiwan is tantamount to\navoiding its core responsibilities. By no stretch of the\nimagination could we be convinced that the Republic\nof China on Taiwan is a province of China. Nauru has\nno doubt that the condition that unification should take\nplace through \u201cpeaceful\u201d means, adopted by the United\nStates and its allies as part of their \u201cone China\u201d policy,\nhas helped maintain relative calm in the region. It is\n23\n\nincumbent upon the United Nations, under the\nappropriate Articles of the Charter, and the\ninternational community to find a lasting solution to\nthe problem. The United Nations cannot claim to be a\ntruly universally representative world body as long as\nthe people of Taiwan continue to be excluded from this\nOrganization.\nEast Timor is a classic case of the United Nations\nnot paying attention to the concerns of the Pacific\nregion. Undoubtedly, had the United Nations, through\nthe Security Council, acted at the time it was prompted\nto do so by the Governments of the region, the human\ncarnage and immeasurable damage to property would\nhave been far less, and perhaps even avoided\naltogether.\nIt is in this vein that Nauru is raising the matter of\nWest Papua. Our head of State stated Nauru's position\non the issue in his intervention at the Millennium\nSummit, and I will therefore not repeat it here.\nHowever, the Nauru Mission to the United Nations has\nbeen instructed to take the necessary steps towards\nputting together a resolution on West Papua's call for a\nnew and democratically run referendum on the\nquestion of independence from Indonesia, in the spirit\nof the 1962 New York Agreement between the\nNetherlands and Indonesia. We ask for the Assembly's\nsupport of this just cause.\nFlowing from these issues of security and peace\nis the issue of the safety and survival of humankind\nfrom weapons of mass destruction, illicit trade in small\narms and light weapons and the pandemic of the\nHIV/AIDS virus. Despite the establishment of several\ninitiatives by the United Nations in its effort to make\nprogress on and expedite the question of disarmament,\nit is sad to note that progress is at a snail's pace, due\nmainly to resistance by most nuclear-weapon States to\ndisarm. In the Pacific region, which has been declared\na nuclear-weapon-free zone by the Rarotonga Treaty,\nthe transboundary shipment of nuclear fuel and other\nradioactive material in the waters of States parties to\nthe Waigani Convention are banned. Our efforts\nthrough the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\nprocess, as well as bilateral and multilateral initiatives\nto protect our ecosystem and seas against accidents\nfrom these shipments in the high seas of our region,\nhave been met with strong opposition by shipping\nStates that, unlike us, are not dependent on the sea and\nits ecosystem for their livelihoods.\nIn this regard, Nauru supports the call by the\nSecretary-General to convene a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly to address the nuclear disarmament\nissue, as we are not satisfied with the pace of progress\nin the other forums.\nAt the other end of the scale, small arms and light\nweapons obtained through illicit trade account for\nmuch of the political, ethnic and criminal killings and\nhuman suffering that occur in the less affluent\ncountries of the world. The tranquil South Pacific has\nnot been spared from this deadly trade. The United\nNations will be convening the first Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nits Aspects next year, and it is our hope that Member\nStates will not put national political interests ahead of\nthe desires of the international community to eradicate\nthis illegal and offensive activity.\nInternational efforts to contain the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic from spreading have not been successful in\nthe least developed and developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa. The prohibitive cost of treatment\nand social attitudes are the major constraints that these\ncountries face in combating the pandemic. We are\nsatisfied with the efforts of the United Nations to\ncombat the epidemic, efforts that are largely being\ncarried out through the World Health Organization and\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.\nHowever, it is obvious that the United Nations needs\nthe help of affluent countries to provide medicine and\nmedical experts in support of its efforts. In this regard,\nNauru has joined in the sponsorship of a draft\nresolution calling on the General Assembly to take up\nthe issue and deal with it under its authority.\nPoverty continues to be the major concern for the\ndeveloping world. The fact that the number of least\ndeveloped countries is stagnant at 48, with the\npossibility of another 3 countries being added to the\nlist, is testimony to the fact that current programmes\nare not working. The Secretary General's report\nentitled \u201cWe the peoples\u201d lists some ambitious\ninitiatives to accomplish freedom from want for\nhumanity. We strongly endorse the call for setting time-\nbound goals in making resolute commitments to the\nworld's poorest and most vulnerable. Next year's\nconference on least developed countries and financing\nfor development will be our first test since the\nMillennium Summit of our sincerity to move from\nrhetoric to action on the important issue of poverty\nalleviation.\n24\n\nThe Pacific is a region that demands special\nattention. Projections by the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific estimate growth\nin the Pacific region to be only about 2 per cent during\nthe next three years, as compared to around 6 per cent\nfor the rest of Asia. My own country is expected to\nexperience several more years of negative growth, as\nour single resource and industry \u2014 phosphate \u2014\ncomes to the end of its natural life.\nSmall island developing States, and the Pacific\nislands in particular, face special difficulties is making\nthe transition to globalization. They will need time to\nadjust to changes in the external trade regime and to\nthe consequent changes in their economies. Our\nparticular vulnerabilities should be recognized as\njustifying special consideration to deal with such issues\nas the global process of trade liberalization. The\nremoval of special protective regimes continues to\noccur.\nThe South Pacific Applied Geoscience\nCommission has been developing an environmental\nvulnerability index with input from both the United\nNations and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Nauru,\nalong with the other small island developing States in\nthe Pacific, is gratified at the support it has received\nfrom several developed countries to finance the project\nto fruition. We urge that this work be incorporated into\nthe work of the United Nations, especially into the\nwork of the Committee for Development Policy and\nthat of the Bretton Woods institutions.\nFor all of us in the Pacific, the ocean is our major\nresource. It provides us with food, income from the\nsale of fish stocks caught in our respective zones and,\nthrough the natural cycle of evaporation and\ncondensation, it is also a vital source of our fresh\nwater. It may also prove to be the source of the demise\nof many low-lying Pacific islands from global warming\nand the resultant rise in sea levels. The Rio Conference\nin 1992 provided the foundations for international\naction. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that\nDeplete the Ozone Layer is an important step forward.\nBut those responses may prove to be too few, too\nlittle and too late for many small islands. We urge the\ncommunity of nations to implement the 1997 Kyoto\nProtocol. Nations and the private sector must\nincorporate \u201cgreen accounting\u201d into their practices in\norder to integrate the environment into economic\npolicy. Suitable regulations and incentives need to be\ndesigned into the web of governance.\nAgenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of\nAction continue to be the guiding principles for the\nsustainable development of our region and the\nprotection of our environments. My delegation is\npleased to note that the World Bank has adopted much\nof the relevant language in its programmes but it, and\nthe rest of the developed countries, need to commit to\nmaintain and, where possible, to expand overall levels\nof support for small States' development, in terms of\nboth advocacy and the provision of technical\nassistance.\nFishing offers the best hope for the future\nsustenance of the smaller island countries that have no\nmineral resources and/or tourism to contribute to the\nnational treasury. Nauru therefore reaffirms the\nimportance of the sustainable integrated management\nand conservation of living marine resources in the\nworld's oceans, and the obligations of States to\ncooperate to that end. We again call for an end to\nunsustainable and damaging practices, such as drift-net\nfishing, offshore dumping and high-seas pollution.\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a threat to\nthe economic development of coastal States in the\nPacific, Caribbean and Latin American regions, whose\nnational incomes are heavily dependent on the export\nof fish. The efforts by the United Nations to convene\nthe first open-ended informal consultative process on\nthe oceans and the Law of the Sea has enabled States to\naddress those issues with a view to reporting the\ndeliberations of the consultation to the General\nAssembly for its consideration and further action.\nAnother area where small States, including our\nown, have been successful in generating income for the\nnational treasury is in the provision of onshore and\noffshore financial services. However, pressure has been\napplied by the Financial Action Task Force on Money\nLaundering and the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) to blacklist\ncountries that do not meet the anti-money-laundering\nstandards of those international bodies. We understand\nand accept the need to have an anti-money-laundering\nregime, and many small island States have gone a long\nway to implement those requirements.\nFor its part, the Government of Nauru recently\nissued a letter of commitment to the United Nations\nOffice for Drug Control and Crime Prevention to\n25\n\nundertake the United Nations minimum performance\nstandards on anti-money-laundering initiatives.\nRegrettably, the compliance level has been raised\nunilaterally by the OECD to include harmful tax\ncompetition \u2014 which has nothing to do with money-\nlaundering and other financial crimes. This is wrong in\ninternational law and violates both the letter and spirit\nof many United Nations resolutions regarding the\nintervention of international organizations in the\ndomestic jurisdiction of States. Such unilateral action\nis not acceptable to Nauru.\nFor the Pacific region, the question of the\nequitable representation of the 11 Pacific island\ncountries in the bodies and commissions of the United\nNations is of vital importance. Until 20 years ago, it\nmay have been reasonable to have Australia and New\nZealand in the Group of Western European and other\nStates and a handful of Pacific islands in the Asian\nGroup. However, with the increase in membership\nsince that time, and the addition of a number of Pacific\nisland nations in recent times, it is incumbent upon the\nUnited Nations to review the groupings.\nOceania is a distinct and internationally\nrecognized region of the world. The Asian Group\npresently constitutes member countries from the\nMiddle East, Central Asia, China, Japan, the two\nKoreas, the member countries of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Pacific\nisland countries. The 11 Pacific island countries are\ndrowning in the Asian Group, while Australia and New\nZealand, the godfathers of the Pacific island countries,\nare marooned in the Group of Western European and\nother States.\nThe parliaments of the ASEAN member\ncountries, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Pacific\nisland countries are members of a regional body called\nthe Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union. It is a well-\nrecognized body in the various regional and\ninternational parliamentary forums. This model could\nbe used as the basis for a new regional group within the\nUnited Nations, with the inclusion of Australia and\nNew Zealand. In our view, this new grouping would\nprovide the best opportunity for those Member States\nto be equitably represented in the work of the United\nNations.\nIn conclusion, Nauru would like to reiterate the\nimportance of Member States making concerted efforts\nto strengthen the fundamentals of multilateralism. At\nthe same time, the United Nations must assert its\nleadership role through the coordination of all key\nplayers in keeping the peace and fighting poverty and\ntransboundary crimes, as well as with regard to\nhumanitarian initiatives, the protection of human rights\nand the rights of the child, and in the fight against\ninequity and inequality. Only through such\ncollaborative efforts can we move the United Nations\nin the direction that our leaders have agreed it must go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I join other delegations in\ncongratulating Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on his\nelection to preside over the proceedings of the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly, and on Finland's\nable service as Co-Chairperson of the Millennium\nSummit. My delegation's appreciation is extended also\nto the outgoing President, the Foreign Minister of\nNamibia.\nI take this opportunity also to express the distinct\npleasure of the Government of Barbados at the fact that\nanother member of the fraternity of small island\ndeveloping States, Tuvalu, has recently taken its place\nat our table.\nFive short years ago, the United Nations\ncelebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a massive\ngathering of world leaders not much different from the\nevent which engaged our attention for the better part of\nlast week. Then as now, the report card was weighed;\nthen as now, amid critical assessment of its deficiencies\nand calls for bold reform, the Organization's continued\nvalidity was ultimately recognized and its unique and\ninherently positive role in multilateral relations\nemphatically supported.\nWe hope that this time the Millennium Summit\nwill have served as more than just a familiar echo\nreverberating, unchanged, at five-year intervals\nthrough these chambers, magnified among the myriad\nmurmurs that linger from other occasions of\n25\n\nspecialized summitry. For there is nothing inherently\nmagical about the passing of a millennium, or a decade,\nor even a quinquennium. Indeed, the proliferation of\nplus fives in this place is enough to confound the\nentire fraternity of mathematicians and accountants.\nAnd none of us is totally confident that the final\nreckoning will leave us on the plus side of the ledger.\nOn the contrary, it seems, sadly, that we have become\nconsumed by the show, not the substance; the process,\nnot the result; the plan, not the implementation.\nIn this, the last year of the second Christian\nmillennium, as we review the progress of the peoples\nof the planet over the past century, we find that, on\nbalance, humankind has not done very well. In many\nfundamental ways, the twentieth century has not lived\nup to the promises and expectations that an era marked\nby such far-reaching technological change and\ninnovation should have produced. In contrast, it has\nushered in a time of unprecedented violence and\nsuffering, visited mainly upon innocent civilians by\ninternational and internal warfare fought with\nincreasingly sophisticated and deadly weaponry.\nThe end of the ideological divide has not been\nfollowed by an era of peace and development, as we\nhad all anticipated, but by a horrendous upsurge in\ngenocidal, religious and ethnic conflicts. The threat of\nnuclear proliferation and biological warfare has only\npartially receded, and the scourges of terrorism, narco-\ntrafficking and transnational crime continue to scar\ninnocent lives and threaten democratic governance.\nWhile a few thousand souls live in obscene luxury, half\nof the world's population subsist on less than two\ndollars a day, and millions remain desperately poor,\nwith no prospects of bequeathing a better life to their\nchildren. The new plague of the twentieth century,\nAIDS, continues its decimation, with disproportionate\neffects upon the poor in the developing world. In sum,\nour modern civilization has not evolved into a caring\nand enlightened species, but rather into one that has\noften abused the positive aspects of its heightened\ncapacity and modernization to the detriment of\nhumanity and of the earth.\nWe well know that the United Nations is not, and\ncannot be, the panacea for all the problems of the\ntwenty-first century, but we are convinced that it can\nand should serve as a mechanism through which the\nGovernments of the world, and their people, can work\nin common cause to find real solutions to the most\npressing global problems and challenges. In our\nincreasingly interdependent world, there is little chance\nof success for unilateral action. This applies equally to\nthe Organization's mandates for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and those for the\npromotion of economic development and social\nprogress.\nSince the Organization's creation in 1945, the\ninternational landscape has changed considerably.\nInternecine and intra-territorial conflicts based on\nreligious and ethnic differences have escalated, and the\nUnited Nations has seen its peacekeeping role used\nmore in the last decade than ever before. At the same\ntime, the effectiveness of that peacemaking and\npeacekeeping capacity has been called into question by\ninternational public opinion and Governments alike.\nWe continue to expect miracles of the United Nations\nin ending the bloodshed in the most troubled corners of\nthe world, but we seldom provide it with the tools, the\nfinancing and the appropriate mandate to allow for\ntimely and decisive action. Without this support,\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts will remain\nreactive, and not preventive.\nOne of the most complex issues currently being\ndebated in the context of an enhanced role for the\ninternational community in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is the clash between\nthe opposing tenets of sovereignty and humanitarian\nintervention. My delegation believes that this is a\nmatter of such fundamental importance that it requires\nin-depth discussion and the elaboration, by broad-based\nconsensus, of clear new rules under international law.\nFor while we do not believe that the international\ncommunity can stand idly by in the face of massive and\ngenocidal violations of the human rights of citizens by\npower-hungry tyrants, we must at the same time ensure\nthat any international response to such situations is not\ninfluenced primarily by the national ambitions of third\nStates.\nDecisions must be based on clearly defined\ncriteria, informed by an objective verification of the\nfacts. Action must be confined to the saving of lives,\nnot the overthrowing of Governments. Humanitarian\nintervention, however compelling the circumstances,\nmust never be used as a guise for unwarranted\ninterference in internal State governance.\nThe balance sheet for the twentieth century in the\narea of economic and social development is similarly\nmixed. While the United Nations, through its\n26\n\nspecialized agencies and programmes, has made great\nstrides in the fight against hunger, disease and\ndeprivation, that progress has not been evenly\ndistributed. The goal of the alleviation and ultimate\neradication of poverty remains largely unfulfilled, with\ndesperate consequences for the growing numbers of the\nworld's population who live in extreme poverty.\nStructural adjustment, the errant compass of the so-\ncalled lost decade of the 1980s, has taken its heavy\nsocial toll. So, too, has the burden of debt, which,\ndespite the promise of debt forgiveness for the least\ndeveloped countries and special initiatives for the\nhighly indebted poor countries, continues to constrain\nfuture economic prospects for a large number of\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, the decline in\nofficial development assistance has had a direct impact\non the most vulnerable sectors of society  I refer to\nwomen, children, the elderly and the infirm.\nThe Secretary-General has challenged the\ninternational community to set a target for the halving\nof the numbers of the population living in extreme\npoverty by 2015. For this to be achieved, there is an\nurgent need for a higher level of political will and a\nshared commitment to create the necessary social and\neconomic framework to enable the poor and\ndispossessed to redirect their lives.\nEducation remains the most powerful tool for\nensuring social progress and the betterment of living\nstandards for the underprivileged. It is therefore one of\nthe most disappointing truths of this closing century\nthat the international community has failed in its\ncollective endeavour to eradicate illiteracy, especially\namong children. Although in the developing world the\nadult literacy rate has increased by half, from 48 per\ncent in 1970 to 72 per cent in 1998, the information\nrevolution now threatens to create a new category of\nfunctional illiterates. The eradication of illiteracy and\nthe provision of at least primary basic schooling are\neminently achievable goals.\nAs an engine of social mobility, education stands\nas the most important component in ensuring the\nsuccess of an individual and of a society. It is the\ngreatest social liberator and facilitator of peace and is\none of the fundamental pillars supporting democracy,\ncompetitiveness and social stability.\nThe development of my country, Barbados,\nprovides ample proof of how education can empower a\npeople and foster upward mobility for each succeeding\ngeneration. Education has always been one of the\nhighest priorities for the Government of Barbados and\na major source of budget expenditure. We are one of\nthe very few countries where access to education is\nfree at point of delivery, mandatory up to 16 years of\nage and universal at the primary, secondary and tertiary\nlevels. Currently, the Government of Barbados is\nembarked upon an ambitious programme within the\nschools known as EDUTECH 2000, which aims to\nensure that every child is equipped to function\nsuccessfully in the new information age.\nAs we approach the new century, the world faces\nprobably one of the most disastrous threats to its\nsustainability, a threat which has ended the lives of an\nunimaginable number of persons, crippled the\neconomies and threatened the productive workforce of\nsouthern Africa, and taken an increasing toll in Asia\nand in my own subregion, the Caribbean. I am referring\nto the pandemic of AIDS/HIV.\nCurrent estimates indicate that there are over 33.4\nmillion people worldwide who are now infected with\nthe disease. In the Caribbean region alone, that figure\nnumbers some 330,000, which is an astounding and\nfrightening statistic to contemplate for a country like\nBarbados, with a population of 267,000 people. Our\nregion has the highest prevalence per capita in the\nwestern hemisphere, and a prevalence second only to\nthat of sub-Saharan Africa. It has been reported by the\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\n(UNAIDS) that, every day, there are 16,000 new HIV\ninfections and that 95 per cent of all reported AIDS\ncases occur in the developing world.\nThe AIDS pandemic is, in our view, the gravest\neconomic and social crisis facing the global community\nas we enter the twenty-first century. Many of our\nleaders and policy-makers are only now beginning to\ngrasp the enormity of the problem and to fully\nappreciate the devastating impact which AIDS is\nhaving, and will continue to have, on the economic\nsustainability of every country, from the smallest, most\nundeveloped nation to the largest, most economically\nviable State, because AIDS is not only a human and a\nsocial tragedy  it is also an economic one. It attacks\nour present workforce not only in its productive, but\nalso in its reproductive capacity, thus simultaneously\ndecimating the economic potential of two generations.\nIt is a sobering reality that AIDS is now the leading\ncause of death among young men in the Caribbean, and\nit is projected that the disease may cause a decline in\n27\n\nthe region's gross domestic product by as much as 4 to\n6 per cent over the next decade.\nWe cannot tackle this grave crisis solely on the\nbasis of current strategies and financial flows.\nContaining the spread of AIDS and dealing with its\neconomic impact is an immediate priority which will\nrequire a major commitment of human and financial\nresources. In this regard, I am pleased to note the\nserious attention now being given to the crisis by the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank\nand other international financial institutions. Just\nyesterday in Barbados, a major conference was\nconvened under the auspices of the World Bank,\nUNAIDS, the Pan American Health\nOrganization/WHO, the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the Caribbean Community and the\nCanadian International Development Agency to bring\ntogether high-level Caribbean health, education,\neconomic development and labour-policy makers to\nmap out a new crisis strategy for the Caribbean region.\nBarbados applauds the recommendations of the\nSecretary-General that the United Nations should adopt\nas an explicit goal the reduction of HIV-infection rates\nin persons 15 to 24 years of age by 25 per cent within\nthe most affected countries before the year 2005 and by\n25 per cent globally by 2010. The United Nations must\nmake AIDS education and research a priority for the\ncoming century. Determined leadership is needed to\npersuade Governments and international\npharmaceutical companies that a partnership must be\ndeveloped to combat the disease, both through research\nand through the provision of drugs at reasonable cost to\nthose who are most in need.\nThe trafficking in and abuse of illegal drugs have\nparalysed the development of many of our societies.\nThey have also eroded the productivity of the work\nforce and led to social discord, violence and a\nconspicuous erosion of values and respect for the rule\nof law. The countries of the Caribbean have not\nremained untouched by this affliction, both as\ntranshipment and, more recently, sadly, as consuming\nStates.\nIn the fight against this menace, the United\nNations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) has\nplayed a crucial role and its subregional office in\nBarbados deserves special mention for its active\nsupport for our own efforts. In Barbados, UNDCP\nassistance has been invaluable in the establishment of\nthe Integrated Drug Programme through our domestic\nNational Council on Substance Abuse and also in\nfacilitating our community outreach efforts. Of\nparticular note too, has been its role in the\nestablishment of an Anti-Money Laundering Authority\nin Barbados.\nAs a small island developing State, Barbados is\nvery aware that the natural environment performs for\nus free basic services without which human beings\ncould not survive. At the same time, certain industrial\nand technological advances have threatened the\nbiodiversity of many of the small island developing\nStates. Therefore, for ecological reasons and for\nreasons of sovereignty and sustainable development,\nBarbados, on behalf of the Association of Caribbean\nStates, last year launched an initiative leading to the\nadoption of resolution 54/225 on promoting an\nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea\narea in the context of sustainable development. We are\ngrateful for the recognition by the General Assembly of\nthe efforts of the Caribbean to protect and preserve our\nmost precious resource.\nThe functions of the Caribbean Sea are many and\nmulti-layered. It is the source of our food, it is the main\nattraction which drives our tourism markets and it is\nour primary and most reliable link with the outside\nworld. The destruction that would be caused if there\nwere an accident involving nuclear waste or oil in our\nwaters would be beyond catastrophic and it would take\ncenturies for our environment to fully recover. We look\nforward to continued assistance from the international\ncommunity in helping us to achieve the objectives of\nthat resolution to maintain and protect this, our most\nvital natural resource. It remains the ultimate goal of\nthe region to have the Caribbean Sea recognized as a\nspecial area within the context of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIn this spirit, Barbados also welcomes the newly\nestablished United Nations Open-ended Informal\nConsultative Process on Ocean Affairs and intends to\nbe an active participant in the consultative process. We\nwelcome the efforts of the General Assembly to\naddress the problems of over-exploitation of living\nmarine resources and the degradation of the marine\nenvironment.\nThe collective efforts of our Governments to\nalleviate poverty and disease and to help our human\ncapital to take full advantage of the opportunities for\n28\n\neconomic and social advancement take place within the\nparameters of a challenging new international order.\nNaturally, I refer to the phenomenon of globalization.\nGlobalization is not entirely new. It has existed in\nvarious incarnations among trading nations throughout\nhistory. What makes the modern incarnation different,\nhowever, is the manner in which the accompanying\ninformation revolution is making possible the\nintegration of trade, investment, finance, production\nand services across national boundaries. What also\ndistinguishes it is the philosophy of multilateralism,\nwhich offers all countries, developed and developing, a\nsay  at least in theory  in shaping the rules which\nwill henceforth govern international economic\ntransactions. Nor is globalization as a concept\ninherently negative. The precepts of expanding market\naccess, trade liberalization, increased technological\nadvancement and more efficient and effective\nmechanisms of manufacturing and agriculture are all\npositive elements. It is in the rigid application of these\nelements, however, and their application without regard\nto the social dimension of development, that distortions\nhave arisen which threaten to widen further the income\ngap between the developed and the developing worlds.\nI reiterate that the true challenge of the new\nmultilateralism will be to ensure that globalization does\nnot become an instrument of oppression for the peoples\nof the developing world, but, rather, becomes a means\nof offering a better life to all of our peoples.\nIn our efforts to sensitize the developed world to\nthe need for adequate transitional measures for\ndeveloping countries and for recognition of the special\nvulnerabilities of small economies, Barbados has\nfrequently pointed to the fact that our Caribbean\ncountries are being asked to undertake in 10 years a\nprocess which was carried out by the advanced\nindustrialized societies over a period of more than 40\nyears, spread over eight rounds of multilateral trade\nnegotiations between 1947 and 1994. In this regard, we\nhave emphasized that, however clinically sound a\nprocedure might be, the compression of its application\ninto too short a time period can often be a fatal therapy.\nOne of the greatest essential inequalities of the\ncontemporary global economy is that, while the\ndeveloped world was allowed an extended period over\nwhich to properly phase in trade liberalization, to its\nbenefit, smaller, less endowed societies with less scope\nto absorb the shocks of adjustment are expected to\nmake a potentially beneficial adjustment over an\nincredibly short period of time. It would not have\nworked for the developed world; it will not now work\nfor the developing, and is in fact the consideration\nwhich argues the case for longer phase-in periods to\napply the changes in the global trading regime.\nBarbados is not opposed to globalization. We\nhave already indeed begun the process of restructuring\nour economy and repositioning our society to meet that\nchallenge. But our efforts, we believe, must be met by\na similar display of good faith on the part of the World\nTrade Organization, which must, as my Government\nhas repeatedly stated, review, repair and reform itself,\nadopt an ideology that is developmental and embrace a\ndevelopmental agenda that is progressive and balanced\nin its substance, its processes and its outcomes.\nThat display of good faith is also necessary in\npromoting constructive and mutually beneficial\ndialogue between the industrialized countries and their\ndeveloping country partners on the crucial matter of the\nregulation of international financial centres in their\njurisdictions. My country has spoken extensively in\nother forums about our serious concerns over the\nunilateral manner in which the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development has\nproceeded on its so-called harmful tax competition\ninitiative, and on the real motives underlying this\nunfortunate move. The setting of international rules in\nthe area of financial services cannot properly be done\nby a grouping of 29 countries to the exclusion of all\nother interested parties. In this age of enlightened\nmultilateralism there is no place for the application of\nunilateral, extra-territorial solutions to international\neconomic developments.\nOn balance, we must not allow our frustration at\nthe many missed opportunities to obscure the fact that\nthe twentieth century has produced much that is\npositive. As we look forward, in the words of the Prime\nMinister of Barbados, the Right Honourable Owen\nArthur:\nWe face the prospect that the simultaneous\noperation of the enormous power of technological\nchange, the dismantling of barriers to the\nmovement of output, capital, ideas and skills, and\nthe emergence of rules-based, consensus-driven\ninstitutions of global scope will create a new\nglobal society that is capable of affording\ndevelopment to all, and of putting the scourge of\npoverty behind us for ever. We will leave the\n\ntwentieth century and enter the twenty-first\nconscious of the dangers, but excited by the\nprospects."

        "file_text": "The individual human\nbeing must always be at the centre of our work.\nBurmese students fighting for democracy, victims of\nethnic violence in Kosovo, women in Afghanistan\ndenied their right to education and equality, children\ndying of curable diseases, people simply trying to\nsurvive in the utmost poverty  have given us our\ntask. Meeting the needs of the peoples and realizing\ntheir aspirations remain the starting point, the purpose\nand the vision of our Organization.\nBut the United Nations will only be what we, its\nMembers, allow it to be. This year's General Assembly\nsession provides an occasion to revitalize our much\nneeded, but often criticized, global Organization. The\nSecretary-General's excellent report on the role of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century provides a\nfirm basis for the creation of a truly modern United\nNations  a United Nations with maintained\nlegitimacy and increased credibility, greater efficiency\nand continued global relevance.\nGlobalization opens the market for those who\nhave the resources and instruments to benefit from it.\nGlobalization makes knowledge and information\navailable to those who have the tools and skills to make\nuse of the new technology. Globalization brings\nopportunities to improve life for all people, but it has\nalso led to an increasing gap between those who can\ntake advantage and those left behind.\nSafeguarding the universal and indivisible rights\nand values of humanity is a key responsibility for the\nUnited Nations in the age of globalized economy,\ntechnology and communications.\nThe world community has to do its utmost to\nintegrate the least developed countries into the global\neconomy. Solidarity and responsibility from all\ncountries are necessary for reaching international\ndevelopment targets and for contributing to an\nimproved standard of living for all people. Solidarity\nand responsibility are essential in fighting two of the\ngreatest threats to development and human security in\nour time: poverty and HIV/AIDS. We need to work\nwith a wide range of measures to overcome these\nthreats.\nSustained and increased official development\nassistance remains of vital importance. Today only four\ncountries, Sweden among them, meet the United\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income\nin development aid.\nBut we must also look at financing for\ndevelopment in a broader perspective. Domestic\nresources, trade, international finance and official\ndevelopment assistance must all be taken into account.\nSweden wants an integrated approach to development.\nWe welcome the fact that the United Nations, the\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and others are\nworking together in preparing next year's high-level\nevents on these issues.\nThe start of new negotiations under the WTO can\nbe an important contribution to growth and\ndevelopment. Let us together make sure that such\nnegotiations truly turn into a development round. The\nmajor trading nations have already committed\nthemselves to giving free market access to products\nfrom the least developed countries. It is time to put\nthese commitments into effect.\nThere is no contradiction between development\nand respect for human rights. On the contrary,\ndevelopment benefits from respect for the human rights\nand participation of all citizens, and discrimination and\noppression are threats to development. For women in\nmany parts of the world, discrimination means being\n25\n\nexcluded from participation in the economic and\npolitical fields; their potential contribution is lost. Two\nthirds of all illiterates are women. For millions of\nwomen, domestic violence is a daily reality. This is not\nin accordance with the basic values of our international\ncommunity and it is a major obstacle to sustainable\ndevelopment. The legal basis for ending discrimination\nexists with the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women and the new\nagreement of the special session in June.\nFor the children, next year's special session of the\nGeneral Assembly provides an excellent opportunity to\nset a global and concrete agenda. The Convention on\nthe Rights of the Child is the basis for this agenda to\nreduce forcefully maternal mortality, to give more\nchildren access to primary school and to promote the\nparticipation of young people in shaping our societies.\nGirls must be given the same rights and opportunities\nas boys. I thus welcome the Secretary-General's new\nsystem-wide girls' education initiative.\nA growing problem in many countries and\nregions is the traffic in human beings, especially\nexposing women and children to sexual exploitation\nand to forced labour. These criminal acts call for our\nimmediate attention and a forceful reaction from the\ninternational community. We need and actively seek\ncloser cooperation between Europe, Asia and others in\norder to develop strong and efficient measures to fight\nthis appalling violation of human rights.\nRespect for human dignity requires an end to the\nuse of the death penalty. This brutal and irrevocable\nform of punishment has no place in a modern, civilized\nsociety. It is time for the international community to\nfully recognize the most fundamental human right and\nabolish the death penalty.\nDisrespect for democracy and human rights paves\nthe way for crisis and conflict. National sovereignty is\nfirmly coupled with a Government's responsibility to\nprotect and promote human rights. It is the duty of the\ninternational community and our duty as political\nleaders to act and react when human rights and\nfundamental freedoms are violated. We cannot idly\nstand by when people are being brutalized behind\nnational borders.\nIn many armed conflicts, deliberate terror\ndirected against civilians is used to create fear. Women\nsuffer from violence and rape. Children are denied their\ndignity and childhood when forced to become soldiers.\nMen are imprisoned in concentration camps, forced to\ntake sides or killed. Lives and families are ruined and\nthe perpetrators often go unpunished. Sierra Leone is\none example, Kosovo another.\nStrengthening international law and humanitarian\nlaw does increase the protection of the individual. It\nalso creates confidence amongst people, since it\ndemonstrates that a culture of impunity will not be\ntolerated. A good example was the decision by the\nSecurity Council to set up a special court to try those\nresponsible for war crimes during the conflict in Sierra\nLeone.\nThe establishment of an International Criminal\nCourt will give us a safer and more just world.\nSuspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity can\nand will be tried in accordance with international law\nwhenever national courts are unable or unwilling to do\nso. There is a strong need for joint and early action to\nmake the International Criminal Court operational.\nThe past year saw a new honesty in drawing\nconclusions from previous mistakes and I want to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for having initiated\nthe studies of our failures in Bosnia and Rwanda. The\nlessons learned from the chilling reports on the\nmassacre in Srebrenica and on the genocide in Rwanda,\nas well as from the senseless terror in East Timor, must\nbe put to constructive use for the future.\nNational sovereignty must not be used as an\nexcuse to prevent the United Nations from taking\nnecessary measures when fundamental humanitarian\nvalues are at stake. It is our common responsibility to\nmake sure that commitments are made and that the\nresources for peace operations are available when\nneeded. My Government warmly welcomes the\nrecommendations in the Brahimi report, for example\nconcerning core funding for United Nations\nHeadquarters support for peacekeeping operations. By\nimplementing the many recommendations in the report,\nthe United Nations capacity to act will be significantly\nstrengthened.\nIf the Security Council cannot act in an urgent\nsituation, due to a veto or the threat of a veto, its\ncredibility and its legitimacy suffer. Necessary action\nought not to be hindered or blocked by a veto. Now is\nthe time for the permanent members to agree on a\nmoratorium on the use of the veto.\n26\n\nThe credibility of the Security Council is of vital\ninterest not only to its members, but to the United\nNations membership at large. All efforts should be\nmade to use the Security Council as a forum for\nnegotiations and decisions in order to avoid not only\nthe unnecessary threat of or use of the veto, but also\nunilateral action whereby the Council is circumvented.\nA modern United Nations requires a Security Council\nthat reflects the realities of today's international\nrelations. The Council should therefore be enlarged to\nmake room for an increased representation of\ncountries, not least from the developing world. We\nshould also be prepared to periodically review the\ncomposition of the Security Council. At stake is the\nglobal relevance of the Security Council in a world\nvastly different from that of 1945.\nThe recent developments on the Korean peninsula\nshow that long-lasting tension can also be challenged\nthrough enlightened statesmanship. But the absence of\narmed conflict does not equal lasting peace. It is\nessential to address the root causes of violent conflict\nby building democracy and safeguarding human rights,\nby promoting economic and social development and by\nremoving trade barriers and debt burdens.\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations in\npreventing and, if needed, managing conflicts. The\nUnited Nations provides legitimacy for global action,\nbut the United Nations alone cannot meet the needs and\ndemands in this area. Cooperation between the United\nNations and regional entities could be further\ndeveloped. Sweden believes that the civilian and\nmilitary capacity for crisis management and conflict\nprevention now being developed by the European\nUnion (EU) could be put to use in the future by the\nUnited Nations. We will continue to work for close\ncooperation between the EU and the United Nations on\nthese matters during the Swedish presidency of the EU\nin the spring of 2001.\nDuring the past year, the Security Council has\nplaced emphasis on early action and on the need to\nfocus on the prevention of violent conflicts. Sweden\nstrongly supports this shift towards identifying and\ntaking early measures. We are prepared to work with\nother countries to support the Secretary-General in the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive conflict prevention\nstrategy.\nImproved interaction between the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, other\nUnited Nations bodies and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, including the use of joint fact-finding\nmissions, will facilitate early action. Sweden would\nlike to see the establishment of a standing fact-finding\nmechanism at the disposal of the Secretary-General, as\na complement to Security Council missions. Such a\nmechanism could be utilized at an early stage in an\nemerging crisis situation, without undue delays.\nAnother part of a United Nations strategy should\nbe to explore and develop the link between democracy\nand prevention of violent conflict. Democracy offers\npeaceful ways of handling conflicts and different\ninterests. Democratization is a process in which the\nholding of elections should only be the first step in a\nlong-term international commitment. Establishing\npeace and democracy takes a lot more than free and\nfair elections, even if that is the beginning. The\nsanctions instrument needs to be refined to become\ntruly effective. By now, we have ample evidence that\nsweeping economic sanctions frequently do more harm\nthan good. The guiding principle should be to exert the\nstrongest possible pressure on the decision-makers,\nwhile no effort should be spared to avoid negative\neffects on civilians. Every future sanctions regime\nought to consist of sharp and enforceable measures,\ndirected against the factors that cause and fuel crisis or\nconflict. Sweden stands ready to contribute actively to\nthe debate on how this instrument of the United\nNations Charter can be made more efficient.\nTo promote disarmament and prevent the\nproliferation of weapons of mass-destruction remains a\nmajor challenge for the United Nations and its Member\nStates. The result of this year's Review Conference of\nthe Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT) gives certain hope in this regard. For the first\ntime in many years, a consensus document on the\nagenda for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\nwas adopted. For the first time ever, the nuclear-\nweapon States unconditionally pledged to totally\neliminate their nuclear arsenals. For the first time, a\nnumber of practical steps were identified for how to\nwork towards this goal.\nA world free from nuclear weapons will not be\nachieved overnight. Nor are these steps to be taken in a\ndistant future or held hostage to States' perception of\nthe appropriate strategic balance. The momentum\nachieved at the NPT Conference has to be sustained.\nThe countries of the New Agenda Coalition will work\nfor the implementation of the NPT results. All States\n27\n\nought to immediately cease production of nuclear\nweapons and fissile material for weapons purposes.\nThe Conference on Disarmament should now start its\nwork on a ban on such material. The world\ncommunity's efforts to prevent the further production\nof nuclear weapons must not be blocked by China,\nIndia, Pakistan or any other State. It is high time to\nbring the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty into force.\nWe expect all States to live up to their commitments.\nThe United States' plans for a national missile\ndefence system causes concern. In today's globalized\nworld, we must always take account of the global\neffects of our decisions. It is hard to see how a possible\nthreat, from a few States, would best be countered by a\nmissile shield that may or may not work, and which\nrisks setting off a renewed arms race, with immense\ncosts in terms of wasted resources and loss of human\nsecurity. The recent announcement by the United States\nadministration to postpone the decision on the national\nmissile defence system was therefore welcome. A more\nsecure world ought to be built on cooperation rather\nthan on isolation and confrontation. The Anti-Ballistic\nMissile Treaty is crucial to global security and must not\nbe jeopardized.\nA major cause of concern is also the uncontrolled\nand destabilizing spread of small arms and light\nweapons. The international conference on illicit traffic\nin small arms and light weapons next year will be an\nimportant opportunity to address the issue in a\ncomprehensive way. It should result in a concrete\naction-plan in the global, regional and national context.\nThe United Nations today is stronger and leaner\nthan three years ago when the Secretary-General\nlaunched his reform programme. But there is still work\nto be done, for example regarding the interplay\nbetween the main bodies of the United Nations. We\nshould give the Secretary-General the full authority to\nact in his leadership role. We support the Secretary-\nGeneral's proposal for a shorter, more focused agenda\nfor the General Assembly and restructuring of its work.\nAnother main issue for the Millennium Assembly is to\nreach an agreement on the scales of assessment for the\nregular United Nations budget and for peacekeeping\noperations. While it is imperative that all members pay\ntheir dues on time, in full and without conditions,\nSweden believes that a review of United Nations\ncontributions should be done. The aim however must\nalways be a fairer distribution of the financial burden\namong Member States, adapted to today's realities, and\nwith capacity to pay as the guiding principle.\nThe United Nations must not be used as a\nscapegoat when the real problem is lack of political\nwill or hesitance from us Member States to provide\nnecessary resources. Accordingly, any call for action\nmust be followed by a pledge to provide the personnel\nor financial means.\nThe United Nations, with its global character and\nlegitimacy, can make a difference for mankind as well\nas for the individual. Behind the much used term\nglobalization there are billions of people. They want us\nto provide hope. They expect us to act responsibly.\nThey need to see concrete results. We are here,\nrepresenting them, on a mission to make the United\nNations a true guardian of human dignity."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset, I would like to extend my congratulations to His\nExcellency on his election as President of the current\nsession of the General Assembly, wishing him all\nsuccess in conducting its deliberations and in arriving\nat conclusions beneficial to the international\ncommunity. I would like also to express our deep\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\nhis successful efforts in conducting the business of the\nfifty-fourth session. Furthermore, I would like to\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of our Organization, for his report\nand his incessant efforts in the service of the purposes\nand principles of the Organization, with a view to\nenhancing its role and increasing its effectiveness in\nthe international arena.\nThe General Assembly holds its fifty-fifth session\nin the wake of the Millennium Summit, which\nwitnessed a historic meeting of world leaders held\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. The\nsignificance and meaning of the Summit affirm the\ncommitment of the international community to the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. This\nshould lead to the enhancement of its role as the best\nframework for providing Member States with suitable\nmechanisms to organize and regulate international\nrelations on the basis of cooperative partnership,\nparticularly after the end of the cold war era and its\nconcepts of polarization and balance of power, which\nhad in the past instituted division and confrontation,\ndepleted huge resources and caused widespread\nsuffering in vast areas of the world.\nSince the establishment of the United Nations the\nworld has witnessed developments that require a\nreview of the methods and policies adopted so far.\nFirst, calls for democracy and efforts to establish it and\nmake it a way of life within States should be consistent\nwith the establishment of democracy in international\nrelations and within the United Nations itself. It is not\nlogical to continue urging and calling for the\nestablishment of democracy on one level while\nrejecting it on the international arena, where in fact\nthere is a dire need for democracy in order to achieve\nequality among the Members of this organization \u2014\nrich and poor, strong and weak.\nDuring the past few years the United Nations has\nwitnessed some changes in its methods of work. First\nand foremost we must emphasize the need to preserve\nthe role of the General Assembly. The power of the\nSecurity Council, the executive arm of the Assembly\nfor peace and security issues, should not be increased\nat the expense of the role of the General Assembly and\nits various other organs, which are supposed to provide\nbalance and collective representation of the\ninternational will.\nClearly, there is international consensus that the\npresent composition of the Security Council does not\nprovide equitable representation of the international\ncommunity and that there is a need to correct this\n29\n\nsituation. Since all States have expressed their\npositions through extended debates, the actions\nrequired have become clearer and more specific.\nAll Member States, both developed and\ndeveloping, agree that globalization and the abolition\nof borders and obstacles to economic exchanges\npresent opportunities and pose risks. Although\nglobalization facilitates the flow of goods and services\nas well as of ideas, it has presented the developing\nworld with challenges related to deepening the gap\nbetween it and the developed world, particularly in\nview of differences in their respective levels of\nscientific and technological development.\nGlobalization has also put the identity and\nsovereignty of developing States and peoples to a\npainful test. Additionally, it has shown how difficult it\nis for developing countries to meet the requirements of\nintegration into the world economy. While a majority\nof developing countries were struggling to enter the\nindustrial era, they witnessed the entry of the\ndeveloped world into an era of information technology.\nWhile they were striving to provide basic services, like\ninfrastructure, health care, social welfare and\neducation, they witnessed the frightening acceleration\nof technological and economic changes \u2014 a\nphenomenon that thwarted their hopes of catching up\nwith developed countries.\nWhile globalization, openness and economic\nintegration make the world a unified economic\nenvironment, widening differences and deepening\ninequalities will inescapably cause damage to all in the\nlong run. This situation makes it imperative to\nreformulate economic relations on the basis of\ncooperation and partnership. It also requires action to\nreduce differences, rectify economic imbalances and\nhelp developing countries adjust their economies to\nmeet the requirements of globalization and integration.\nFurthermore, the experience of mankind has proved\nthat poverty and huge economic and social disparities\nhave always been the root causes of instability and\nconfrontation.\nThe Middle East peace process is going through\nan extremely sensitive phase. During the past few\nweeks and months, major, commendable efforts have\nbeen made to make Palestinian-Israeli negotiations\nbear fruit \u2014 arriving at a lasting settlement between\nthe two parties.\nJordan has made an essential contribution in all\nphases of the peace process. This contribution was\nmotivated by Jordan's conviction that peace is the only\nreal option for all States and peoples of the region.\nIndeed, geographic and demographic realities make it\nimpossible for any party to settle the conflict by\nimposing its will or consecrating the status quo in its\nfavour. Therefore, there is no alternative to establishing\npeace on the basis of law, international legitimacy,\njustice and equality.\nDespite the failure of the recent Camp David\nsummit to produce an agreement between the\nPalestinians and the Israelis, it has enabled the parties\nto narrow the gap dividing their positions and made the\nrequirements for reaching a settlement clearer. This\nconfirms the need to continue the efforts by the United\nStates in particular and the international community in\ngeneral to build on what has been achieved so far.\nThe achievement of lasting peace in the region\nrequires the realization of the national rights of the\nPalestinian people, primarily the right to independence\nand the establishment of their State on their national\nterritory, with the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital.\nThis means reaching implementable and\nsustainable solutions to the main issues, which are the\nsubject of the permanent-status negotiations. Regarding\nthe issue of territory, Israeli forces must withdraw from\nthe Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 242\n(1967), so that a Palestinian state may be established\non those territories, with internationally recognized\nborders. Any security arrangements that may be agreed\nupon must not be based on any claim of sovereignty as\na result of occupation.\nThe solution of the refugee problem must also be\nbased on rules of international law and the various\ninternational conventions and on the basis of General\nAssembly resolution 194 (III), which emphasizes the\nright of return and compensation to the refugees.\nPersons who were displaced as a result of the June\n1967 war must be able to return to their homes in\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 237\n(1967).\nThe issue of Jerusalem is the key to peace in the\nregion, and it must be solved on the premise that East\nJerusalem is Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\nto which resolution 242 (1967) applies. East Jerusalem\nshould be under Palestinian sovereignty so that it may\n30\n\nbecome the capital of the independent State of\nPalestine. Arab and Muslim rights to the Islamic and\nChristian holy places in Jerusalem must be preserved.\nIn no way can Israeli sovereignty over these holy\nplaces be accepted.\nThe status of Jerusalem and its spiritual and\nreligious importance make it imperative that the city be\nan open city where freedom of worship and access to\nthe holy places is guaranteed for all believers in God.\nJordan has suffered immensely during the past\nfive decades as a result of the situation arising from the\nPalestine question, particularly the refugee problem.\nThere are more than 1.5 million refugees living in\nJordan. This amounts to 41 per cent of all refugees\nregistered with the United Nations Relief and Works\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\n(UNRWA). This is in addition to the people displaced\nas a result of the June 1967 war. As a result of the\nrefugee situation, Jordan has shouldered heavy\nfinancial, economic and social burdens.\nJordan will be subject to pressures that will\nthreaten its stability and that of the region if the\nsettlement does not satisfy its legitimate vital interests.\nRefugees and displaced persons in Jordan will only\naccept a settlement that recognizes their fundamental\nrights to return and to compensation.\nIt is well known that the vast majority of these\nrefugees have Jordanian citizenship as a result of the\nunity that was established between the Hashemite\nKingdom of Jordan and the West Bank in 1950. The\ndeclaration of unity at the time provided for the\npreservation of all Arab rights in Palestine and for the\ninalienability of the rights of the refugees.\nUpholding the right of return will, therefore,\nenable every refugee to exercise freely his or her\npersonal choice. Jordan must safeguard and preserve\nthe rights of its citizens, which is its responsibility\nunder national and international laws. Any solution that\ndoes not satisfy the rights of Jordan and its citizens will\nnot lead to the establishment of a just and lasting\npeace.\nSince the question of the refugees and their\ncontinued suffering has caused grave damage to Jordan\nand placed heavy burdens on it, Jordan demands\nrectification of the damage and losses that it has\nincurred. This rectification needs to include suitable\nand adequate compensation. Jordan will endeavour, by\nall possible means, to ensure that its legitimate claims\nwith regard to this issue are considered.\nIt is worth mentioning that the Jordanian-Israeli\npeace treaty stipulates that the solution of the refugee\nproblem must be based on international law and that it\nshould be dealt with bilaterally and in parallel with the\npermanent status negotiations. It also established a\nmechanism to deal with all financial claims between\nthe two parties.\nThe rights of refugees and displaced persons to\nreturn and to compensation, and the rights of Jordan\nunder international law and the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, take precedence over other\nconsiderations. Jordan, therefore, will only accept a\nsettlement that will preserve its legitimate rights and\nensure a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.\nOtherwise, the conflict will remain open and volatile,\nperpetuating the seeds of instability in the region. The\nposition of the refugees in Jordan is vital to the success\nof any settlement to be reached.\nAlso on the question of refugees, Jordan once\nagain emphasizes the importance of supporting\nUNRWA to enable it to carry out its mandate, which\nmust continue until a solution to this question is fully\nimplemented. Jordan, as host to the largest number of\nrefugees and the largest donor to UNWRA, expresses\nits appreciation of the Agency's role and calls upon the\ninternational community to provide it with the needed\nfinancial resources to carry out its humanitarian tasks,\nparticularly at this sensitive phase of the peace process.\nIt also expresses appreciation to the donor States for\ntheir contributions.\nPeace in the Middle East cannot last unless it is\ncomprehensive. This makes the establishment of peace\non the Syrian track essential and a sine qua non for\npeace in the region as a whole. Negotiations on this\ntrack must, therefore, resume in order to reach an\nagreement ensuring the return to Syria of the occupied\nGolan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 in\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973).\nIsrael's withdrawal from southern Lebanon on the\nbasis of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) is a\npositive development that will hopefully serve as a\nfoundation for the implementation of other Security\nCouncil resolutions, leading to the achievement of a\ncomprehensive peace in the region, which has suffered\nfor many decades from the depletion of its resources\n31\n\nand the energies of its peoples. Only peace will provide\nsecurity for all. It should lead to ending the arms race\nand to using the resources for the development of the\nregion and making it free from weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nTen years have passed since the beginning of the\nGulf crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. As a\nresult, the region as a whole continues to suffer. Iraq\ncontinues to pay a heavy price as a result of continued\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on it, which caused\nand continue to cause unprecedented mass suffering for\nthe Iraqi people.\nJordan calls for launching a new thinking and a\nnew look at the situation in Iraq in order to put an end\nto the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially since the\ncollective sanctions, which are the severest of their\nkind in United Nations history, have not achieved their\ngoal of consolidating peace and security. They have\ninstead led to results that, in the long run, will give rise\nto dangers threatening the region as a whole. The need\nto implement and comply with Security Council\nresolutions does not conflict with the maintenance of\nIraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor with\nrefraining from action that violates those resolutions.\nIraq is an integral part of the region and its continued\nsubjugation affects security and stability in the region\nas a whole. Jordan calls for the settlement of all matters\nrelated to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on the basis of full\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including those dealing with Kuwaiti and\nother prisoners of war, and missing persons.\nJordan continues to suffer severe economic\nhardships as a result of compliance with relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. Large segments of\nJordan's economy have, as a result, sustained huge\nlosses. It is, therefore, imperative to put an end to the\nnegative effects of the sanctions on Jordan by showing\nbetter understanding of its situation, reviewing the\npolicies and methods used in dealing with the sanctions\nregime and giving a more just interpretation to the\nrelevant resolutions.\nBecause of our strong belief in the role of the\nUnited Nations, Jordanian armed forces participate\neffectively in its peacekeeping operations in several\nareas around the world. As a result, Jordan today is the\nsecond largest troop contributor to peacekeeping\noperations. While commending the report (A/55/305)\nof Mr. Brahimi's Panel on United Nations peace\noperations, Jordan wishes to reiterate the need for the\nprovision of adequate means and resources to enable\npeacekeepers to achieve their noble objectives. We call\nfor a constructive and thorough discussion of the report\nin order to produce the best possible means to attain\nthat goal. In this spirit, we underscore the importance\nof conducting consultations with States that contribute\nto peacekeeping operations, before the adoption of\nmajor decisions concerning and affecting the status of\ntheir forces.\nOn another note, we feel that the startling\ndevelopments witnessed by our world today, at various\nlevels, make it increasingly necessary to rely on the\nUnited Nations to develop and establish norms in all\nmatters pertaining to human security. The ongoing\ndialogue on the need to establish complementarity and\nbalance between State sovereignty and human rights\nonly reflects the importance of this issue. Sovereignty\nshould not provide a cover for violating human rights.\nHence, greater emphasis should be placed on the\nimportance of objectivity, non-selectivity and\nimpartiality when dealing with human rights issues.\nIt is illogical to continue to keep silent about the\nsuffering of whole nations whose dignity is being\nundermined and whose human rights are being\nviolated, while prominence is almost always given to\nother partial issues for purely political considerations.\nWith the onset of the third millennium the world\nis entering a new epoch that necessitates the formation\nof a new pattern of relations in the international arena\nbased on our collective responsibility to develop and\nsafeguard what has been achieved so far. Our world\nneeds to establish a new paradigm of international\nrelations based not on confrontation and exclusion, but\non new foundations of openness and real partnership.\nIntegration, which encompasses the overlapping\nand interdependence of interests, presupposes\npartnership and solidarity among nations to help them\nmanage change and ease the lack of confidence and\nhesitation associated with the fear of failure. The\ninternational community's willingness to encourage\nand support the will to change will certainly reinforce\nthe capacity to deal with such change with minimum\nlosses and convince those taking such a risk that\ntoday's world is not based on a zero-sum option and\nthat the challenge that we all face is: How can man,\nregardless of ethnic background, economic situation or\nreligious belief be the primary beneficiary of the\n32\n\ndevelopment achieved by humanity in modern times?\nThis is the acid test we all face today. Will we succeed?"

        "file_text": "In\nthis, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr.\nHolkeri on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to\nemphasize the great friendship that unites the\nArgentine Republic and Finland.\nI also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to\nArgentina, for the constructive way in which he\npresided over the Assembly's work at the last session.\nWe also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon\nits entry into the United Nations and extend our\nfriendship and cooperation to its people.\nThis debate is taking place after a very productive\nexchange of opinions at the highest level during the\nMillennium Summit, which we hope will mark,\ntogether with the final Declaration, the beginning of a\nnew era leading to a more equitable world and a more\neffective Organization, in accordance with objectives\nset out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d. For my country, this is also an\nopportunity to set out before the General Assembly the\nprinciples and objectives of our foreign policy.\nThe Government of President Fernando de la\nR\u00faa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has\ndrafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it\nreceived from the Argentine people. This policy aims\nat strengthening our integration with neighbouring\ncountries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and\npromoting economic development, social progress, free\ntrade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction.\nArgentina is determined to participate on the\ninternational scene jointly to build a peaceful and\nstable world based on the values of representative\ndemocracy, the rule of law, the protection and\npromotion of human rights, respect for the\nenvironment, economic liberalization, social progress,\ninternational cooperation and the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, pursuant to the\npurposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was\nstated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are\nshared by the vast majority of Members of this\nOrganization.\nOn the basis of its ongoing interests, the\nGovernment has set as a priority objective its political\nand economic integration with the other States\nmembers of the Southern Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) \u2014 Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay \u2014\nand associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have\nagreed with these countries to consolidate\nMERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to\npromote greater integration on the basis of balance and\nequity. We have made significant progress towards the\nexpansion of our markets since the signing of the\nTreaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the\ndetermination of the member countries to implement an\nopen trade policy in their economic programmes.\n25\n\nThe creation of MERCOSUR was a political\ndecision transcending the economic sphere.\nMERCOSUR provides a political forum within which\ntrust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in\nall areas foster the increasing complementarity and\nconvergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have\nbound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate\nmembers in the context of the Free Trade Area and we\ntrust that they will become full members in the near\nfuture.\nAs a consequence of the broadening political and\neconomic dimensions of our integration project, we are\nalso witnessing the convergence of approaches to\ndefence and security in our region. This contributes to\na continental perspective based on confidence and\ncooperation. We and our neighbours have made\nprogress towards the creation of the joint\nMERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace.\nArgentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America\nreflecting the peaceful and cooperative security\nnecessary to harmonious development.\nAt the same time, as a member of the Rio Group,\nwhich has now grown to include Costa Rica, the\nDominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,\nHonduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its\nhigh-level political consultations and cooperation in\norder to maintain peace, strengthen representative\ndemocracy and promote sustainable development in the\nregion. It is our firm intention that our countries shall\nenjoy greater participation in the global economy. At\nthe recent summit convened in Brasilia to\ncommemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery\nof Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American\ncountries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and\nharmony that marks its relations on the basis of these\nprinciples and objectives.\nThe consolidation of democratic stability in Latin\nAmerica continues to be a central policy of the\nArgentine Government. We do not interfere in the\ndomestic affairs of others and we respect international\nlaw. We promote the consolidation of democratic\nprocesses on the basis of our deep conviction that free,\nregular and transparent elections and a plurality of\npolitical parties are essential instruments for affirming\nand guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy.\nMy country also reaffirms its commitment to\neradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and\nto ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region.\nWe shall continue to pursue our joint action in the\nregional and global campaign against drug trafficking,\nterrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and\norganized crime.\nThe Argentine Republic has a natural interest in\nthe South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation\nin the zone of peace and cooperation of the South\nAtlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin\nAmerican countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting\nheld in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action\nwas adopted to implement our shared objectives in the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation,\ndevelopment, the conservation of fishery resources, the\nfight against drug trafficking and the protection of the\nenvironment.\nMy country is in favour of free trade in order to\nachieve development and the eradication of poverty.\nThe Argentine Government believes that protectionism\nnot only generates the deflection of trade and the\nclosure of markets, but also constitutes a form of\ndiscrimination. Argentina urges the entire international\ncommunity to commit itself seriously to eliminating\ndistortions of trade and will continue to fight for these\nobjectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is\nbeing made in negotiations on the free trade agreement\nof the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area\nby the year 2005.\nIn the World Trade Organization, our country has\nprovided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new\nround to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in\nagriculture.\nArgentina also continues to support negotiations\nto develop political and economic association between\nMERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in\nthis framework, the gradual liberalization of\nagricultural trade and services.\nWe are constantly seeking new ways to integrate\nourselves with the world. The realities of technological\nchange and continual innovation require developing\ncountries to adapt to a scheme of international\neconomic integration based on a new paradigm of\nproduction. The challenge is to ensure the access of the\nleast developed countries to this process of constant\ntechnological change and innovation. There can be no\ndoubt that the international community \u2014 in particular\nthe United Nations \u2014 must cooperate to promote the\ntransfer of technology from developed to developing\ncountries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that\n26\n\ntechnological innovations reach those countries with\nfewer resources.\nIn his report \u201cWe the peoples\u201d, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this\ntask. Without the adequate dissemination of and access\nto the new technologies of the digital revolution, we\nwill see the gap between rich and poor widen.\nIndividual States and the international community as a\nwhole must therefore find solutions that guarantee\ngreater fairness in the use of digital information.\nArgentina remains fully committed to the\ninternational community's efforts to protect the\nenvironment from the negative impact of human\nactivities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to\nthe principles of sustainable development agreed upon\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development \u2014 principles that were\nreflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment\nand in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the\nimportance of making adequate preparation \u2014 during\nthis very fifty-fifth General Assembly \u2014 for the\nconference to be held in 2002 to review the\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\nMoreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate\nthe international legal regimes in the field of\nenvironmental protection. In this context, and bearing\nin mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric\nwarming on the global ecosystem and on human life,\nwe attach special importance to the entry into force, as\nsoon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\nThe twenty-first century was preceded by a\nprolonged strategic and ideological confrontation,\nwhich has given way to a moment in history in which\nrepresentative democracy, human rights and open\neconomies are shared values. At the same time, we are\nfacing a more complex world that has yet to engender a\nstable international order. The explosion of serious\nintra-State conflicts \u2014 as we have seen in the Balkans\nor in Africa \u2014 are signs of the emergence of a new\nstage in conflicts \u2014 a stage in which, regrettably,\nconflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious\ndifferences.\nThe Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute\nto achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing\nand neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the\ndevelopment of nations. We believe that if this\nconsensus were based on greater democratization in\ninternational relations this would increase the efficacy\nand the functioning of the international system.\nSince it is impossible for individual States to face\nthese threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative\nsecurity policies to eliminate the potential risk of\nconflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of\nlegal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united\nfashion the immediate and underlying causes of\nconflicts, which often arise because of the lack of\neconomic opportunities and because of social\ninequalities.\nThe Members of the United Nations face the\nchallenge of finding a response to questions raised by\nrecent international crises, including the international\nhumanitarian crises. My country believes that the\nprinciple of non-intervention must be duly respected\nbecause it is the pillar underpinning relations between\nindependent States. At the same time, we cannot\nconceal our concern at the explosion of violence\nagainst ethnic, racial or religious minorities.\nIn particular we are concerned about the situation\nof vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons, and about the situation of children\nin armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the\ninternational community cannot remain indifferent and\nmust provide an adequate response to humanitarian\ncrises.\nWe must emphasize the role that can be played by\ninternational tribunals to create awareness that\nimpunity will not be tolerated. The International\nCriminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the\nformer Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been\ncreated, constitute important instruments of deterrence.\nIn addition to the internal reforms that the\nSecretary-General has initiated with singular success\nwithin his sphere of competence, the United Nations\nmust give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main\nand subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be\ndone in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and\neffectively with which solutions are found to the daily\nproblems facing the Organization.\nMaintenance of international peace and security\nis a primary responsibility of the Security Council,\nwhich must be strengthened. If these responsibilities\nare not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United\n27\n\nNations can be carried out with any certainty of\nsuccess.\nSince the inception of multilateral diplomacy,\nArgentina has defended the principle of the sovereign\nequality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our\ncountry maintains that the reform of the Security\nCouncil must be arrived at via consensus, and this\nconsensus must not entail new discrimination,\nprivileges or exclusions.\nThe vast majority of the international\ncommunity \u2014 seeking to ensure respect for the values\nof democracy and universality \u2014 believes that a new\nSecurity Council will have to allow for greater\nparticipation by all. This cannot be achieved if new\npermanent seats \u2014 like those established in 1945 \u2014\nare established. Reform of the Council must allow all\nStates a greater opportunity to participate in the\nCouncil, which must not be monopolized by only a few\ncountries. For this reason, Argentina supports\nexclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions\non the right of the veto, without losing sight of the\nultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We\nsupport the adoption of rules of procedure that\nguarantee transparency and the possibility of the\nparticipation of all Member States in this organ.\nOur support for the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our\nforeign policy. President de la R\u00faa reiterated the\nArgentine commitment to continue participating in\npeacekeeping operations established by the Security\nCouncil. The most recent conflicts have shown how\nimportant efficient training of the forces participating\nin these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina\nin 42 years of participating in these missions is\nreflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre\nfor training for peacekeeping operations. It has been\noperating since 1995, with the participation of\npersonnel from other Member States. We also\nestablished the centre for training of security forces for\nforeign missions. Argentina, which is currently\ninvolved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the\ndisposal of the United Nations its military and police\ntraining centres. We also support the initiatives to\nstrengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the\nOrganization, and we would support restructuring\nefforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support\nfor peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and\nin the field.\nMy country was pleased to receive the\nconclusions and recommendations recently issued by\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and\ncontained in the Brahimi report. These provide a\nvaluable basis for building international consensus\naimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization\nto prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish\npeace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the\nSpecial Committee for Peacekeeping Operations,\nsupports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a\ndetailed analysis of the recommendations contained in\nthe Brahimi report \u2014 including its possible financial\nimplications \u2014 with a view to achieving its early\nimplementation.\nMy Government is particularly concerned about\nthe problems related to the security and protection of\nthose who participate in peacekeeping operations and\nhumanitarian missions. The personnel of the United\nNations and associated personnel, as well as the\npersonnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian\nassistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as\nwe have seen recently in the tragic events that have\noccurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina,\nwhich is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged\nan improvement in the security situation of United\nNations personnel via the adoption of practical and\nlegal measures, including financial-planning and\nimplementation measures for these operations.\nIn this context we should also reiterate the duty of\nthe international community to provide assistance to\nthose countries facing emergency situations, which\narise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed\nconflicts. In this area a significant role can be played\nby the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d initiative, which involves the\nestablishment of bodies of specialized volunteers\norganized by the Members of the United Nations to\nprovide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are\nvictims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the\nserious problems that affect these people.\nWe should also mention the issue of AIDS which\nparticularly affects the poorest areas of the world.\nMore than 34 million people suffer from this illness\ntoday. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular,\nmore than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The\nillness and death of so many workers is draining\nalready weakened economies. The impact of this\nphenomenon on the future of the affected regions will\n28\n\nprobably mean greater marginalization and will\nundermine the foundations of stability, security and\npeace. The international community and this\nOrganization and its specialized agencies must\ncontribute urgently all available resources to the fight\nagainst this disease.\nI would like to refer in particular to the\nsovereignty dispute between my country and the\nUnited Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South\nGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the\nsurrounding seas.\nThe recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty\nover this part of our national territory, respecting the\ninterests of the inhabitants and international law, is a\nprecept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina.\nThis item is on the agenda of the Organization, which\nin numerous resolutions has requested the\nGovernments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to\nrenew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution\nto the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a\ncolonial situation imposed by force in 1833.\nToday, in accordance with that request, Argentina\nreiterates once again its complete willingness to renew\nbilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to\nresolve this question. We reiterate our support for the\nmission of good offices with which the General\nAssembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the\nparties in achieving this objective.\nThe world stage in the post-cold-war era is the\nscene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations\nof human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal\ntraffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we\nare seeing the unprecedented spread of representative\ndemocracy and economic and technological\nmodernization.\nAgainst this backdrop, our main task is to reach\nagreements that will enable us to face these challenges\nand seize these opportunities in the best way possible.\nEquipping the United Nations for the challenges\nof the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All\nMember States must undertake to fulfil this\ncommitment if our efforts are to be crowned with\nsuccess. Argentina is committed to this task and will\ncontinue making its contribution.\nOn 31 December next, my country will end its\nterm as a member of the Security Council. During its\ntwo-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to\ncontribute constructively to decision-making and\nconsensus-building on all items on the Council's\nagenda.\nOn the basis of our potential and bearing in mind\nthe features of the current international situation,\nArgentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to\ncontinue to play an active part in the consolidation of\npeace and international security and in the development\nof peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "India congratulates Mr. Harri\nHolkeri on his election as President of the first General\nAssembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that\nhe intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the\nmandate for the work of the Organization during his\npresidency.\nI take this opportunity to sincerely compliment\nand to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign\nMinister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his\nguidance of the General Assembly in the past year,\nwhich included three special sessions and, of course,\nmeticulous preparations for and a successful\nconclusion to the Millennium Summit.\nI join India's voice to those of other delegations\nin noting with appreciation the dedication with which\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United\nNations at a critical point.\nI am delighted on this occasion to warmly\nwelcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United\nNations.\nJust 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and\nGovernment assembled here for the Millennium\nSummit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as\nunique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium\nDeclaration that was then adopted encapsulates a\nshared vision that the international community work\ntogether in constructive cooperation to meet collective\nchallenges, within the framework of the United\nNations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister\nspoke, as did many others, of the need for the United\nNations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first\ncentury, to make it an effective instrument to translate\n17\n\nour vision into reality. The United Nations is the house\nthat we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that\nit is equal to our collective expectations and our joint\naspirations.\nPeace, collective security and development\ninspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the\ntwenty-first century with extraordinary collective\nintellectual and technical capabilities. These are our\nglobal tools for overcoming the challenges before us.\nPeace and security for all is not just possible but is well\nwithin our grasp. Stability and development are the\nessential building blocks for the maintenance of peace\nand security. Threats to peace can and do arise from\ndifferent sources. It is not just weapons of mass\ndestruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but\nalso dehumanizing poverty and lack of development.\nWe must act as confident nation States committed\nto collective action and international cooperation, for\nthese are our means to provide wider effects of peace\nand progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect\nfor State sovereignty and non-interference in internal\naffairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must\nabjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances\nwarrant action by the Security Council, that action\nmust be firmly rooted in Charter provisions.\nThe Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of\nproposals. We recommend that the General Assembly\nexamine this important report carefully and take\nappropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United\nNations function of peacekeeping.\nWe support the Middle East peace process and\nfind the trend encouraging.\nThe historic summit between the Republic of\nKorea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\ntoo, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula.\nDisarmament \u2014 global nuclear disarmament in\nparticular \u2014 is essential to engender a greater sense of\nsecurity among Member States. India has been and will\ncontinue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global\nnuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation.\nWe welcome the recommendation of the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report to the Millennium Summit to\nconvene an international conference on eliminating\nnuclear danger. We urge commencement of\nnegotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring\nabout a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains\nready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps,\nsuch as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering\nnuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as\nwell as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non-\nuse of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon\nStates.\nThe situation with regard to the entry into force\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of\nwork at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva\nshow the importance of building a consensus, both\nwithin and amongst nations, on issues that affect\nnational and international security. We are conscious\nthat 155 countries are at present signatories of the\nCTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing\ncommitment that India does not wish to stand in the\nway of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered\nto observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on\nfurther explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic\nobligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to\nengage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference\non Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban\nthe future production of fissile material for weapons\npurposes.\nThe illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of\nsmall arms, particularly by States to non-State actors\nand to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with\nterrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep\nconcern to the world community. When they are\ncombined with religious fanaticism and military\nadventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized\nnorms to which we strive to adhere. The international\ncommunity can no longer afford to permit these\npurveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue\nto inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look\nforward to a successful outcome of the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year.\nTerrorism is the global menace of our age. For\nsome, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has\nbeen the object of State-sponsored, cross-border\nterrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more\nthan a decade. Even as the international community\nworks together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we need to\ncontinually focus our attention on the users of such\nweapons \u2014 the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on\nhuman decency, a violation of the basic precepts of\ndemocracy and the very antithesis of what the United\nNations represents and stands for. Because its principal\n18\n\ntargets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant\nviolation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime\nagainst humanity. It is also a threat to international\npeace and security, especially when terrorists are\narmed, financed and backed by Governments or their\nagencies.\nI urge all Members to work to strengthen the\ninternational consensus and legal regimes against\nterrorism. We have proposed the draft of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. I\nurge all Members of the United Nations to give their\ntotal support to this initiative.\nLet me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our\nchoice to accomplish our global agenda: the United\nNations. There is but one United Nations; none\nreplicate it, nor can any replace it.\nThe membership of the United Nations has\nincreased manifold in the last half century, and today\nstands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to\nhave the same basic structure as in the colonized world\nof 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of\nthe Security Council in both permanent and non-\npermanent categories is self-evident. The impact of\nactions of the Security Council is felt, with near total\nexclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have\nlittle influence in its decision-making. We have a\nglobal consensus that the form taken by the Security\nCouncil in the aftermath of the Second World War is\noutmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an\nenlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more\nthan 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need\nfor a Council reformed in its representation. An\nunrepresentative Security Council will lack the range\nand depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and\nunderstanding of the realities that it will have to deal\nwith or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm\nIndia's willingness to take on the responsibilities of\npermanent membership.\nThe General Assembly is the most important\norgan of the United Nations. It is here that all States,\nirrespective of considerations of strength, economy or\nsize, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic\nprinciple of sovereign equality. There is a growing\nfeeling among Member States that the functioning and\nrole of the General Assembly has to be made more\neffective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce\ndistance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together\ninto a new global neighbourhood as never before in\nhistory, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead\nus to increasing interdependence, our canvas of\ninternational cooperation and collective action has\nrapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more\ncomplex. The General Assembly has therefore to be\ncentral in accepting this new responsibility, this new\nchallenge.\nEven as we week to strengthen democratic\nprinciples and practices in the United Nations, and\neven as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside\ndictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have\nunfortunately witnessed some instances of regression\nas well. Such acts move against the currents of our\ntimes. The international community should oppose\nthese assaults on the spirit of our times and\nuncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic\nimpulses, practices and norms. It should show its\nsolidarity with the people of such countries. The\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\ndeserve our commendation for the steps they have\ntaken in this regard.\nDevelopments in Fiji since 19 May this year have\ncaused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken\nby the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the\nconstitutionally elected democratic Government there.\nWe hope that Fiji will return immediately to the\nconstitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law\nat the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial\ndiscrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest.\nWe hope that the international community will exercise\nits collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back\nto the road of democracy and the rule of law.\nIt appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten\nAfghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country\ncontinues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the\nmirage of military success. It also continues because of\noutside support, military and financial, to the Taliban.\nThis conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist\nideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the\nAfghan people. This adversely affects the peace and\nsecurity of the entire neighbourhood, from West to\nCentral Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate\nfrom the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in\nthe shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of\narms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The\nTaliban and their mentor must heed the world's\ndemands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for\na comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that\n19\n\nrestores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests\nand aspirations of all sections of that society.\nWe have consistently called upon the United\nNations to increase its development orientation and\nengagement, which is a core responsibility. We\nwelcome and support the declaration of the Secretary-\nGeneral last week to the United Nations Development\nProgramme's ministerial meeting that deficit in\ndevelopment will put in jeopardy all other goals of the\nUnited Nations. To address the root causes of poverty\nmeaningfully, we need firm international commitments\nto re-order and reshape international relations, in\nconsequence providing for equitable opportunities to\ndeveloping countries for resource earnings. Our call is\neven more relevant in today's fast integrating world.\nDeveloping countries and their people cannot\nthrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We\ntherefore hope that the forthcoming conference on\nfinancing for development would endorse concrete\ninitiatives for mobilization of the required external\nresources for development, whether from trade or\nconcessional flows, and treat this as a shared global\ngoal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the\ndifference that would be made if there was universal\nadherence to the agreed official development\nassistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross\nNational Product(GNP), within a specified time frame.\nNowhere is this more important than in the\ncontinent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be\nadequately supported by the international community.\nWe believe that issues relating to the development of\nAfrican countries must remain at the forefront of the\nwork of the General Assembly.\nThe process of globalization, with revolutionary\nleaps in communications and the great advance in\ninformation technology and increased mobility of\ncapital, trade and technology, has produced new\npotential for sustained economic growth. The benefits\nof globalization have, however, not percolated to the\nvast sections who live mired in poverty, without\nshelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has\noften been accompanied by enhanced poverty,\nunemployment and consequent social disintegration.\nThis poses a major challenge. We have to determine an\ninclusive concept of growth and development. We have\nto strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense,\nand not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While\nGDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to\ngrowth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and\nenhancement of the quality of life and creation of real\nchoices must be integral to the process of assessing the\nsuccess of development efforts.\nIn India, we have formulated development\nstrategies on the premise that economic and social\npolicies must subserve the primacy of the human being,\nand in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth\nalone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee\nsocial justice is crucial. Development based on uneven\nrewards will not be supported by those who are not its\nbeneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric.\nThe fullest possible participation of the people in the\ndevelopment process is the best guarantee for the\nsuccess of any growth strategy.\nMany challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to\nsustained economic growth for developing countries\nabound. Protectionist tendencies in developed\ncountries, a lack of political will to implement\ncommitments undertaken regarding development\nfinance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of\ndeveloping countries aggravate the situation. Special\nand differential treatment for developing countries\nguaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO)\nprovisions must be translated into operational reality.\nDeveloped countries should not seek to restrict market\naccess to goods and services and free movement of\nnatural persons, especially at a time when developing\ncountries are being asked to open up their economies\nand compete in the international economic domain.\nAnother challenge relates to reconciling the needs\nof economic and industrial growth with the need for\npreservation and protection of the environment. A safe\nand healthy environment for our peoples is an\nimperative. At the same time, all development cannot\nbe sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental\npreservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and\nenvironmental conservation cannot and should not\nimply maintenance of poverty.\nDeveloping countries have done commendable\nwork in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the\ncontext of an exceptionally difficult global\nenvironment. The promised resources from developed\ncountries have failed to materialize. The transfer of\ntechnologies on preferential and concessional terms has\nnot been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed\non technology transfer even on commercial terms. The\nspecial session of the United Nations General\n20\n\nAssembly on the review and appraisal of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should\nconcentrate on finding solutions in addressing such\nunfulfilled commitments and providing reality and\noperational content to the declaration that \u201ceradication\nof poverty is the over-riding priority of developing\ncountries\u201d.\nChildren and issues relating to them are a priority.\nWe hope that the special session of the General\nAssembly next year will concentrate on the\nimplementation of the Declaration of the World\nSummit on Children.\nAdvancement of the democratic spirit and\novercoming challenges to it, growth with equity,\neconomic development with social justice and, as the\nprize that we seek, the creation of a world where\ninjustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and\nwelfare for all are among the goals that we should set\nfor ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The\nchallenge is nothing less than collective enlightened\nglobal ownership.\nThe General Assembly once again faces a heavy\nand challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let\nus wish ourselves success in our endeavours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to convey to the\nPresident my congratulations on his election to lead\nthis session of the General Assembly. He represents a\ncountry that shares with mine the ideals and principles\nthat favour peace, culture, human rights, solidarity and\nunderstanding.\nI hail the entrance of Tuvalu into our\nOrganization, and I congratulate the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\nthe skilful and intelligent manner in which the\nimportant work of the last session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe political events that occurred in the world in\nthe last decade speeded up changes on the international\nscene, ushering in new global structures and processes.\nThe disappearance of the ideological underpinnings of\nthe cold war produced profound transformations that\nchanged the geopolitical foundations that had prevailed\nin the twentieth century.\nThe consolidation of large economic blocs and\nthe technological revolution have had a palpable\nimpact on the pace of economic and social change\nthroughout the world. The free market and the new\ntechnologies have favoured competition and have\ngenerated the transnational expansion of banking and\nfinance, which has fundamentally changed the way the\nworld economy works.\nIn this global context, countries are joining the\ntrends of globalization from very different levels of\ndevelopment, and consequently, the opportunities and\nthe effects of these new processes turn out to be\nextremely unequal. Technological, financial and\nproductive disparities have deepened between the\ndeveloping countries and the industrialized nations,\nwhere most of this potential is concentrated.\nNotwithstanding the efforts of countries to adapt to and\nbecome integrated into a new international\nenvironment, inequities have grown and social\nproblems have mushroomed in an environment of\ndeteriorating international cooperation.\nThe Millennium Summit, which opened this\nsession of the General Assembly, proved to be a\nhistoric opportunity to consider in depth the challenges\ninherent in the new global trends, which are generating\na new international order, with its risks and its\npotential for peace and security, economic growth,\nsustainable development and human security. It has\nbecome clear in the light of these realities that no\ncountry can remain on the sidelines or be insulated\nfrom the major global changes, and that all States must\nface the great challenge of working together to regulate\nthe new processes within a universal endeavour to\nchannel the process of development to secure the\nbenefits of globalization, while meeting the needs of\nthe peoples.\nWithin this context of international responsibility\nas a priority, the United Nations has a dominant role to\nplay, as a universal forum for States to work together\nfor ideals and objectives common to all peoples and to\nstimulate international cooperation for sustainable\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\nIn the new century, the Organization's potential in\nworld affairs must be fully used. Ecuador trusts in an\neffective multilateral system whereby global norms for\nthe era of globalization are created in a democratic,\nparticipatory and systematic manner. With that\nobjective, the Summit acknowledged the representative\nnature of the United Nations in the fulfilment of its\nessential goals, within the framework of the new global\nprocesses and the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe interdependence of international political and\neconomic problems becomes significant in this great\ntask, creating a complex mix of matters to be\nconsidered on the international agenda of this global\ninstitution, the United Nations, which, because of its\nlegitimacy, has the responsibility for adopting\ncoordinated policies and implementing guidelines that\nensure the efficiency and timeliness of this\nOrganization's response to events and phenomena\noccurring in the world that directly affect international\nsecurity and stability.\nI wish to reiterate my congratulations to the\nSecretary-General on his valuable contribution to the\nwork of this Millennium Assembly through the\npresentation of his analytical report on the role of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. His thoughts\nare extremely useful in considering the role and the\nchallenges of the United Nations in the years ahead.\nI must also highlight the contribution of the Latin\nAmerican countries to the work of the Millennium\n18\n\nAssembly through the adoption of the Cartagena\nDeclaration by the heads of State or Government of the\nRio Group, and the contribution of the South Summit\nand the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, groups\nof which Ecuador is a member.\nEcuador shares the view regarding the advantages\nand opportunities relating to the United Nations\ninfluencing the management of international public\naffairs and cultivating the commitment of all actors to\napproach the new global processes and structures from\nthe perspective of human development.\nGlobalization and poverty must be tackled with\nthe priority that their profound consequences for\nhuman development require. The trends of\nglobalization today appear merely as an economic\nprocess, dehumanized and lacking in social\ndimensions. This process concerns itself with free\ntrade, competition and new information technologies,\nwithout an approach that guarantees that it works for\npeople and that opportunities for progress and the\nbenefits of the process will be distributed worldwide,\nto all countries.\nEcuador is experiencing one of the most acute\ncrises of its history. Its effects have had a grave impact\non State institutions and have led to instability in the\nprocess of consolidating democracy. Domestic and\nforeign factors combined in recent years have\ncontributed to aggravating the crisis through\nmacroeconomic imbalances that have severely battered\nthe economy and people of Ecuador. In this context of\nenormous difficulties, the conditions Ecuador had\nnegotiated for its foreign debt became extremely\ndifficult to meet. Those factors, together with the\nadjustment measures taken to confront the crisis, have\nhad a considerable impact on poverty.\nThis global forum must be aware of the enormous\ndifficulties imposed on highly indebted poor countries\nboth by disproportionate external debt servicing and by\nthe continuing obstacles to their export products, as\nwell as by the fluctuations in the international financial\nsystem that work against national efforts to create\nconditions of economic stability and sustainable\ndevelopment. In meeting its goal of bringing about a\njust and equitable international order, the General\nAssembly should find means to reduce the external\ndebt of developing countries, including heavily\nindebted medium-income countries affected by natural\ndisasters.\nEcuador has made great efforts to find a just and\nlasting solution to the problem of the excessive burden\nof foreign debt. Last August it took a first step in\nrenegotiating the Brady debt segment, and it concluded\nits negotiations with the Paris Club last week. We trust\nthat understanding and above all fairness will mark the\ncontinuation of this process so that a definitive solution\nmay be found for the problem of external debt, which\nis crushing developing countries and hindering the\nimplementation of priority social programmes in the\nareas of health, education and employment. The\nrestraining effect of debt is undoubtedly one of the\nmain obstacles in the fight to reduce poverty and attain\nthe goals set in this area by 2015.\nIt is necessary to have an economic and\ninstitutional order that provides outlets to countries\nwith small economies, which are the most vulnerable\nand likely to be affected by extreme crises.\nEcuador, committed to overall national\ndevelopment, resolutely supports United Nations\nactivities implementing financial and technical\ncooperation in support of countries' national efforts to\npromote sustainable development in order to bring\nabout a better future for all peoples. The United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) plays a role\nin that task as the main operational tool for the efforts\nof the Organization in support of national plans and\npriorities to alleviate poverty, contribute to democratic\ngovernance and strengthen national capacities for the\nbenefit of human development. I appeal to the\ninternational community to ensure that the Millennium\nAssembly gives resolute political backing to UNDP as\nthe central instrument for the overall management of\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century, and to ensure\nthat the Programme has the financial strength necessary\nto fully enable it to carry out its operational activities.\nThe situation of international trade also deserves\nour priority attention, as it has a direct influence on the\neconomic and social activities of nations. We call for\nthe elimination of trade barriers and obstacles, and\ndemand the application of norms that will make it\npossible to carry out trade in an open, predictable and\nequitable way. In accordance with our long-standing\ntradition of integration, we support the strengthening of\nthe Andean Community and its increased international\noutreach, in particular with regard to its relations with\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR),\nthe European Union, Russia and the Pacific Basin and\n19\n\nin the context of negotiations to create a free trade area\nof the Americas.\nEcuador shares the international community's\nconcern over the continued degradation of natural\nresources, the threats to the environment and the\ninadequate compliance with the commitments made at\nthe 1992 Earth Summit on sustainable development.\nGiven its economic, social and environmental\nimplications, we should insist on the need to give\npriority to sustainable development as a cross-cutting\nfactor in international relations, with regard both to\npolicies and cooperation. There is an imperative need\nto incorporate appropriate environmental technologies\nand to develop sustainable production patterns in order\nto strengthen national scientific and technological\ncapabilities. The Government of Ecuador has\nincorporated the concept of sustainable development\ninto its national legislation, promoted the adoption of\npolicies and action plans in that context and\nstrengthened its own environmental authority.\nThe phenomenon of drug trafficking, with its\nglobal effects, is another matter for the international\ncommunity, as it respects neither borders nor nations\nand poses widespread dangers to society. Drug\ntrafficking has developed a supranational system in\nwhich no particular nation can be viewed as the root\ncause of the problem. It is essential that we recognize\nthe principle of shared responsibility in coping with the\nreality of this phenomenon, and that we take the\nnecessary international steps to resolve it. Abiding by\nthis universal commitment, which has already been\nrecognized in the 1988 Convention against Illegal\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,\nis fundamental in our fight against this global problem,\none of the challenges confronting humankind.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, peace,\nsecurity and disarmament constitute other priority\nchallenges that the United Nations will continue to\nface. Ecuador advocates the peaceful resolution of\ninternational disputes and condemns the threat and use\nof force in relations between States, as we are\nconvinced that a system of peace and trust among\nnations must be based on the peaceful resolution of\ndisputes and on specific disarmament measures in the\ncontext of the purposes and principles of the Charter of\nthe United Nations and the norms of international law.\nIn its pursuit of the goals of peace and security,\nthe Security Council bears primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance and restoration of international peace.\nEcuador deems it a priority, in terms of the renewal of\nthe United Nations, to reform the Council's\ncomposition and methods of work. The Council's\nmission makes it vital that we correct the current\nimbalances in the Council's composition, improve its\ndecision-making machinery and lend greater\ntransparency to its methods of work.\nAnother challenge for the United Nations\nconcerns the role and the strengthening of\npeacekeeping operations. In recent years humankind\nhas witnessed the exacerbation of regional conflicts\nand the negative consequences of war in various parts\nof the globe. It is vital that joint action in the\nframework of this world Organization be strengthened,\nso that the use of force, when absolutely necessary, can\nbe applied in strict conformity with Chapter VII of the\nCharter. In this way the United Nations will be able to\nretain the international credibility it requires as the\nlegitimate forum for, and agent of, collective action to\npromote international peace and security.\nOne of the pillars of democracy in any society is\nstrict respect for human rights, the defence and\nprotection of which are the responsibility not only of\neach and every State but also of the international\ncommunity. The international community, therefore,\ncan no longer remain silent or indifferent; it must react,\nin a legitimate manner, to the massive violations of the\nrights of entire peoples that were perpetrated in the\nfinal years of the past century, which are a source of\nshame for humankind. Furthermore, it is totally\nunacceptable for one or more States to seek to\nrepresent the international community and to apply,\nunilaterally and by force, a non-existent \u201cright to\ninterference\u201d on the basis of humanitarian\nconsiderations.\nIn 1998 Ecuador promulgated a national human\nrights plan with a broad and democratic perspective.\nThe plan, which takes an integrated approach to the\nhuman being, was devised and prepared through a\nnationwide consultative process, with the full\ninvolvement of civil society and the public authorities.\nIn this context, the right to development constitutes a\nlegitimate aspiration that must be appropriately and\ndecisively spurred forward by the United Nations.\nEcuador, as a country that is acutely vulnerable to\na variety of natural disasters, accords particular\nimportance to the role of the United Nations system in\n20\n\nthe prevention, mitigation and reduction of the effects\nof such disasters, among them the impact of the El\nNi\u00f1o phenomenon. In the quest to move forward with\nresearch on this phenomenon \u2014 which in 1997 and\n1998 affected not only the South Pacific region but\nother areas of the world as well \u2014 the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council lent\ntheir support to the establishment of an International\nCentre for the Research of the El Ni\u00f1o Phenomenon, in\nthe city of Guayaqu'l, in Ecuador. I am pleased to\ninform the Assembly that my Government, as host\ncountry, has taken the steps necessary to proceed with\nthe establishment of that Centre in the next few\nmonths, as it is convinced of the scientific contribution\nthat such a United Nations-sponsored instrument can\nmake to humankind.\nEcuador reaffirms its commitment to\nmultilateralism and to the ideals that inspired the\nfounding of the United Nations. The challenges of the\ntwenty-first century must be confronted by all\ncountries jointly and in a spirit of solidarity. The\nMember States must see to it that this session of the\nAssembly makes a historic contribution to a universal\nendeavour to resolve global problems and to strengthen\ncollective security. The achievements of the United\nNations in this new century will hinge on a\nconstructive spirit of solidarity on the part of all peace-\nloving nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with the\ngreatest pleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency of this Millennium\nAssembly. I pay tribute also to the outgoing President,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and reiterate to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, my praise for his vision and\n10\n\nfor the remarkable and courageous manner in which he\nis carrying out his duties.\nMy French colleague has already addressed the\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of the\nEuropean Union, a statement with which my country\nfully associates itself.\nI will now touch upon questions of particular\nimportance to my country, Portugal.\nAs the Prime Minister stated here during the\nMillennium Summit, the United Nations finds itself at\na turning point which necessarily calls for the exercise\nof reflection on the future of the Organization. In this\nera of increasing globalization, we should give the\nUnited Nations the means to accomplish the missions\nthat we have entrusted it with, turning the Organization\ninto the foundation of a more stable, united and\ncohesive international community.\nThe international community faces three great\nchallenges at the turn of the millennium: to strengthen\nour action on behalf of peace, to contribute to the\neradication of extreme poverty, and to guarantee\nenvironmental conditions conducive to perpetuating\nlife on earth.\nThe increasing use of peacekeeping operations\nover the last decade, which we have encouraged,\nconclusively demonstrates their importance. The\nresults that we have obtained on the five continents tell\nus with certainty that we have chosen the right path. To\ncontinue this effort effectively, the United Nations\nmust have at its disposal the necessary resources, be\nthey financial, technical, civilian, political or military.\nA credible peacekeeping capacity is in itself a\ndeterrent to conflicts and therefore an integral part of\nthe global system of conflict prevention, of which the\nUnited Nations should be an essential component. In\nthis regard, Portugal welcomed with satisfaction the\nBrahimi report on peace operations. We believe that its\nlist of recommendations point the way to a process of\nreform that will strengthen the capacity of the United\nNations in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\npeace-building. We should take advantage of the\nmomentum that has been created and concentrate on\nobtaining concrete results within the next year or two.\nI would stress, however, that crucial questions\nwill always be of a political nature. We must muster the\nnecessary courage to broaden the scope of the\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. Let us not\ndeceive ourselves. As the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, stated, it is our function to intervene. Allow me\nto go ever further and to say that it is our duty to do\nso \u2014 to intervene in time, effectively and on the basis\nof international law.\nPortugal is ready to do so, as it has shown in the\npast. We have participated in peacekeeping operations\nin Mozambique, Angola, the Central African Republic\nand Guatemala, and today we are participating in\nUnited Nations missions in East Timor, Bosnia,\nKosovo and the Western Sahara, with more than 1,000\npeacekeepers. Portugal is currently the 11th-largest\ncontributor to the United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, and first among its European Union\npartners.\nDuring the Portuguese presidency of the\nEuropean Union, we gave decisive impetus to the\ncreation of the European Union's capacities to\nintervene, which we see as being offered in the service\nof international peace and cooperation. In the year\n2003, the Union will have at its disposal a force of\n50,000 to 60,000 military personnel, to which 5,000\npolice will be added, as well as a civilian structure for\ncrisis management.\nThis aspect of Portugal's external activities will\ncontinue to be favoured, and the importance we attach\nto them is equally reflected in our candidacy for the\npresidency of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe for the year 2002.\nIn a globalized world, the existence of\ntremendous  economic asymmetries is a factor of\npermanent tension and conflict. Indeed, about half of\nthe world's population lives on less than $2 a day.\nThe turn of the millennium is an opportunity for\nus to reaffirm our will to combat and eradicate poverty\non a global scale. It may be a utopian vision at this\npoint, but with our combined efforts it is a goal that\nmay be within our reach.\nIn the time that it takes to deliver each of these\nstatements in the General Assembly, around 300\nchildren under the age of 1 will die. Is this acceptable?\nObviously not. Could it be, then, that the human and\nfinancial resources necessary to fight this tragedy are\nso great that they force us into accepting it? The\nanswer again is no. Many of those deaths could be\navoided through better management and without an\n\n\nincrease in resources. Health, like education, should be\na priority sector for development assistance.\nIt is vital to combine efforts, policies and\ninstruments. Direct development assistance must be\ncomplemented by mechanisms to resolve the\nlongstanding problems of the poorest countries through\nreform of the regulatory institutions of the global\nfinancial and economic system and through agreements\nthat allow poor countries to access the markets of\ndeveloped countries without trade barriers.\nI should like to stress in particular the importance\nof developing cooperative mechanisms between the\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions,\nnamely a revitalized Economic and Social Council. Our\npriority should be to redefine the role of each\ninstitution and to avoid any duplication of effort in a\nfield where the United Nations should play a leading\nrole.\nIt is equally important to give responsibility to\nthe countries receiving aid by demanding that funds be\nused efficiently or requiring good governance. In this\nregard I should like to emphasize that the fight against\ncorruption should be a priority of all our Governments.\nThe Millennium Declaration states clearly that\nthe principal challenge today is to ensure that\nglobalization becomes a positive reality for the entire\npopulation of the world, and not a new factor of\nexclusion.\nOnly the United Nations is in a position to\npromote the partnership for change that Kofi Annan\nreferred to in his report entitled \u201cWe the peoples\u201d.\nPoverty, sadly, is also closely linked to infection\nand to contagious diseases such as AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis, which cause millions of deaths every year\nand which, in Africa, are laying waste to an entire\ngeneration and posing a tragic threat to future\ndevelopment. More than ever before, it is vital to\nmobilize the energies of civil society, institutions and\nthe international community at large to fight infection\nand contagious diseases. The European Union and the\nUnited States recently agreed, at Lisbon, to strengthen\ntheir cooperation in the fight against those scourges.\nTurning to the environment, we must always be\nmindful of the fact that economic growth and progress\nmust not be achieved at any cost, least of all at the cost\nof the future. The United Nations must continue to\nguide the way on environmental matters, as it has since\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But the\nresponse from States has fallen short \u2014 often very\nshort \u2014 of what we committed ourselves to do in\npolitical statements and even in international treaties.\nLet us not delude ourselves: the United Nations plays\nan instrumental role in this crucial, strategic area, as\nwas reaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration, but it is\nonly States that can produce results. This is not a job\nthat can be subcontracted to the United Nations.\nHere, civil society should use all its influence, by\nbringing pressure to bear on, and calling to account,\nGovernments that think they can deal with\nenvironmental issues by opting out, as though they\nwere simply matters of sovereignty. We can no longer\nthink in that way. Global warming affects us all. To\nface this common problem, we need common action on\na global scale.\nFor geographical, historical and political reasons,\nPortugal is a country that is linked to the oceans. For\nthat reason, we recognize their importance both to the\nland ecosystem and to the renewal of energy resources\nvital to the sustenance of millions of people. We\nwelcome the launching of an informal consultative\nprocess on the oceans and the law of the sea, and we\nattach particular importance to the debate on scientific\nresearch on marine matters.\nLet me speak briefly about an initiative to which\nmy country attaches great importance. In June, at\nWarsaw, a group of more than 100 countries, united by\nshared beliefs, endorsed a declaration entitled\n\u201cTowards a Community of Democracies\u201d. The\nparticipants recognized that there was no single model\nto determine how the will of a people should be\nrespected. The Community of Democracies will play a\nrole in uniting the efforts of all countries that believe a\nrepresentative democratic system to be the system that\nbest meets that objective.\nI wish now to speak of some regional matters that\nare of particular importance to my country. Africa is\none of the great priorities of Portuguese foreign policy.\nThe first Africa-Europe Summit was held during the\nPortuguese presidency of the European Union, and on\nthe basis of a Portuguese proposal. The Summit opened\nnew vistas in the relationship between Europe and\nAfrica which will surely make possible a joint process\nof reflection on the challenges and problems that the\n12\n\ntwo continents face. The second Africa-Europe Summit\nwill be held at Lisbon in 2003.\nWest Africa is at present one of our main\nconcerns on the continent. In that connection I would\nmention the situation in Casamance in Senegal; the\nrecent conflict in Guinea-Bissau, from which the\ncountry is only now beginning to recover; the serious\nconflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia; the problem of\nrefugees from those countries and their consequences\nfor Guinea; and the instability along the borders of all\nthose countries.\nThe persistence and potential spread of those\ntensions and conflicts seriously threaten the security of\nthe entire subregion of West Africa, which could have\ngrave political, economic and humanitarian\nconsequences. It is therefore necessary for the\ninternational community to give greater attention to\nthis sensitive region of Africa while there is still time.\nWith respect to Angola, we deeply regret the fact\nthat the war is continuing, which we believe is due to\nthe lack of implementation of the Bicesse and Lusaka\npeace agreements, and to UNITA's violation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In our view,\nthose instruments continue to be the reference point for\na political solution to the Angolan conflict. We\nwelcome the strengthening of the sanctions regime\nagainst UNITA and reiterate our pledge to cooperate\nwith the Security Council's sanctions Committee. We\nconsider that the presence of the United Nations on\nAngolan territory continues to be of fundamental\nimportance, from both a humanitarian and a political\nperspective. Only thus can the United Nations quickly\nstep in to support any political solution that may\nemerge. I welcome the intention of the Angolan\nGovernment to organize elections and to hold them in\n2001. Promotion of the values of tolerance and\ndialogue and of democratic principles is essential to\nguarantee a lasting peace.\nOne year after the referendum that allowed the\npeople of East Timor finally to exercise their right to\nself-determination, the United Nations faces a new\nchallenge: administering East Timor in its transitional\nperiod and creating the necessary foundations for a\nnew independent and democratic State that will be a\nfuture member of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations and of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries \u2014 and that we hope can be admitted to\nmembership of the United Nations by 2001. Portugal\nhas always supported East Timor and will continue to\ndo so. Our total financial assistance, not counting our\nparticipation in the military component of the United\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor, will\nreach an estimated $50 million this year, and will\nremain at that level in 2001 and 2002. Much remains to\nbe done, but the able leadership of Sergio Vieira de\nMello and the exceptional qualities of Xanana Gusm\u00e3o\nallow us to look to the future with optimism.\nThe tragic events that took place in Atambua on 6\nSeptember, in which three members of the staff of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees lost their lives, deserve unanimous\ncondemnation by the international community. They\ntestify to the impunity with which the militias act in\nWest Timor. Two days after those events, further\nmilitia activity took place along the border, which led\nto the death of 11 people, this time of Indonesian\nnationality, who were assisting various non-\ngovernmental organizations and international\norganizations. We welcome the swift response of the\nSecurity Council in adopting its resolution 1319 (2000)\nand in deciding to dispatch an evaluation mission to\nWest Timor.\nThe new democratic Government of Indonesia\nhas, in general, shown a spirit of cooperation. It is now\ntime for it to honour its commitment to re-establish law\nand order in West Timor, disarming and dismantling its\nmilitias. Their continued existence destabilizes the\ntransition process in East Timor and is an affront to the\ncivilian and military authorities of Indonesia,\ndisturbing the consolidation of the democratic regime\nin that country. For our part, we stand ready to work\nwith the Indonesian Government, helping it to resolve\nthis problem. It was in that spirit that the Portuguese\nPrime Minister proposed here last week a stability pact\nfor East Timor. It is in that spirit that we will\nparticipate in the quadripartite summit to be held soon\nat Jakarta, which will bring together high-level\nrepresentatives of Indonesia, East Timor, Australia and\nPortugal.\nGuaranteeing peace, fighting poverty, protecting\nthe environment and leaving a better world for future\ngenerations: that is our duty at the turn of the\nmillennium. Only through democracy can Governments\nrespond to those aspirations of our societies. Only a\nreformed and ever more democratic United Nations\nwill be able to help us face this common challenge."

        "file_text": "Exactly one week ago, the Millennium\nSummit was held in this very Hall, in which more than\n150 leaders, heads of State and Government took an\nactive and interactive part.\nThis Summit, which my delegation wishes to\nsalute once again, has played a great service in\nbringing together so many eminent personalities to\ntruly take stock of the state of the world through a stark\nre-reading of the mission of and the basic strategic\nobjectives assigned to the United Nations.\nWhat more can be said? How can it be better\nsaid?\nThe conclusions arrived at by our leaders, which\ngo to the very substance of the diverse and changing\nproblems that undermine humanity, frame the items\ninscribed on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session. They\nalso give us the opportunity to strike while the iron is\nhot and to embark immediately on their\nimplementation where it is possible.\nIn that context, the general debate in progress is a\nreal challenge; a challenge to stay the course, but also a\nchallenge to our ability to get down to basics.\n34\n\nBut before I go on, I wish to convey to the\nPresident, on behalf of my delegation, heartfelt warm\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of our\nAssembly. This election is a well-deserved tribute to\nhim and his country, Finland, with which Burkina Faso\nenjoys an excellent relationship of friendship and\ncooperation.\nMy country is a Bureau member and we wish to\nassure the Bureau of our full willingness to cooperate\nwith it.\nOur congratulations also go to His Excellency\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, on the effectiveness of his guidance of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to renew Burkina Faso's appreciation\nand support for the work of the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, who guides the work of our world\nOrganization with courage, lucidity and determination.\nThe waning millennium will no doubt forever be\netched in the memory of humankind. Unfortunately, it\nwill be etched in blood, as during it we witnessed, as\nvirtually powerless bystanders, the rise of slavery,\ncolonization and racial discrimination; the escalation of\nthe most atrocious kinds of war; the ongoing\ndegradation of the environment; and the deterioration\nof the terms of trade. But it will also be etched in gold,\nfor we witnessed prodigious scientific and\ntechnological progress and economic and industrial\ngrowth, even though the structure for sharing their\nfruits was slow moving and unfair.\nNo continent more than Africa, no people more\nthan Africans, bear more heavily today the stigma of\nthe scourges they have suffered, which will for ever\nmark them, or of their sharing but little  if\nanything  of the benefits of progress. My delegation\ntherefore believes that we should embrace that history\ntogether and in a spirit of solidarity, agree to be the\nliving and collective memory of it and learn its lessons\nso that we may strengthen our capacity to solve with\ngreater efficiency and equity the problems of security,\npeace, development and a better quality of life that\nmake up the core of our priorities. Whether that\ninvolves resolving the smouldering or open conflicts\nthat continue to decimate our populations and to force\nthem to flee by the thousands into exile, or whether it\nentails looking for lasting solutions to the problems of\nunderdevelopment, the unbearable debt burden, the\nAIDS pandemic, malaria or natural and environmental\ndisasters, we must, whatever the cost continually go\nback to our sources and history.\nI therefore make a solemn appeal to the\nconscience of the peoples of the United Nations to\nprevent hegemony and domination from being the\nhallmark of our Organization during the third\nmillennium. That would be a betrayal of this history,\nand make our collective memory a selective memory.\nAs the Assembly is aware, despite the progress\nmade during the second millennium, there still remain\nquestions and concerns among developing countries,\nparticularly those in Africa. Their questions and\nconcerns are not caused solely by the acceleration and\nunprecedented worsening of their continued\nimpoverishment. Unfortunately, they also stem from\nthe fact that today, at the dawn of the twenty-first\ncentury, international relations continue to be based\nessentially on force. That sad fact is made worse\nbecause, with the end of the cold war, we are passively\nand almost with a resigned attitude witnessing a single\nmind-set developing.\nAs most heads of State and Government have said\nfrom this rostrum, the time has come to undertake the\nnecessary reforms at the national, regional and\ninternational levels to build a more just, equitable,\nunified and fraternal world. Let us hope that the basic\nchallenge, I would even call it heroism, of the new\nmillennium will be to move forward together in\nsolidarity, calmly and democratically towards\nglobalization while we remain ourselves  that is,\nretain our intrinsic values and our dignity as free\nindividuals.\nWith regard to the United Nations, we are\nconvinced that making it more democratic is absolutely\nnecessary. That democratization must include a\nthorough reform of the decision-making processes of\nthe system, and of the Security Council in particular,\nand should go hand in hand with giving greater\nattention to development issues, particularly through a\nmore thorough examination of the idea of a\ndevelopment council, as proposed by the Millennium\nSummit. It also means making the Organization truly\nuniversal. In this regard, Burkina Faso welcomes the\nadmission of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. We\nalso think it is unfair to continue to marginalize the\nRepublic of China, a country that meets all the\nrequirements of a sovereign State to take its place in\nthe United Nations.\n35\n\nThroughout its history, and particularly since the\n1990s, Burkina Faso, learning from its own\nexperience  experience grounded in a culture of\ndialogue and negotiation  has based its contribution\non the quest for solutions to national and subregional\nconflicts on the basis of dialogue and agreement. We\nhave done so because we are convinced that dialogue\nand agreement  which are certainly not the weapons\nof the weak  are the only way to reach lasting peace.\nWe are therefore very surprised and disappointed\nthat for some time now my country has been forced to\nconfront accusations and all sorts of completely\nbaseless recriminations. Is this the result of a deliberate\ndesire to harm, or simply of misunderstanding? It is\nwrong and unfair that in efforts to find lasting solutions\nto conflicts one should yield to the easy temptation of\naccusation, recrimination, condemnation and exclusion.\nBurkina Faso has never hesitated to demonstrate its\ngood faith, to show its willingness to cooperate with\nthe United Nations and the international community, or\nto express its desire for transparency.\nThat is why we set up an inter-ministerial\ncommittee on Angola and Sierra Leone to follow up\nand monitor implementation of the sanctions decreed\nby the Security Council. We also invited the Council to\nundertake any investigations in Burkina Faso that it\ndeemed necessary to find the truth. Two United\nNations delegations therefore recently visited the\ncountry. Their leaders stated that they had\naccomplished their missions freely and peacefully.\nSimilarly, in the face of the recent surprising, to\nput it mildly, allegations by Guinea, we would like to\nreassure that beloved, fraternal country, as well as the\ninternational community, that Burkina Faso had no\npart, directly or indirectly, in those unfortunate events.\nWe repeat our readiness to welcome or support any\ninitiative that could shed light on this matter, which we\nfind profoundly distressing.\nAt the national level, Burkina Faso is resolutely\ncontinuing to consolidate and anchor the democratic\nprocess begun in 1990. That process is essentially\ncharacterized by the regular and systematic holding of\nelections at the municipal, legislative and presidential\nlevels, in objective, transparent and fair conditions\nrecognized by the international community; the\nstrengthening of public freedoms and the promotion of\nhuman rights; public financing of political parties,\nunions and an independent press; recognition of official\nstatus for the opposition; reform of the judicial system\nto allow it to play its full role in consolidating and\nregulating the rule of law; and strengthening\ndecentralization and local governance.\nTurning to the economy, our Government is\nconcentrating on a truly unified type of development.\nIts priorities are poverty eradication, environmental\nprotection, food self-sufficiency, and education and\nhealth for all.\nWe welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative, which seeks to reduce the debt\nof poor, highly indebted countries, and the election of\nour country to that body, which strengthens our anti-\npoverty strategy.\nAt the African level, Burkina Faso has\nconsistently worked to strengthen good-neighbourly\nrelations and to promote subregional and regional\nintegration as well as peace and security.\nThat is why we are committed to the institutional\nstability and the strengthening of the subregional\ncooperation or integration organizations of which we\nare a member, in particular the West African Economic\nand Monetary Union, the Economic Community of\nWest African States and the Economic Community of\nSahel-Saharan States. We hope that the latter will be\naccorded the status of observer at the United Nations.\nFor that reason we have spared no effort to help\ncreate the African Union, which the African peoples so\nfervently desired.\nThese are the main ideas that Burkina Faso\nwanted to share with the international community and\nwhich attest to our unswerving commitment to the\nideals of the United Nations and to our unshakable\nfaith in our common ability together to forge a better\nfuture  a glorious future for the whole of humankind.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election to\npreside over the work of the General Assembly, which\nattests both to his outstanding personal qualities and to\nthe admiration that the international community has for\nhis country, Finland. Allow me also to express our\ngratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for\nhis excellent work.\nJust a week ago, in this same Hall, our heads of\nState or Government held the Millennium Summit.\nThat historic event served as the framework for an in-\ndepth consideration of the role of the United Nations in\nthe next century and for the reiteration, at the highest\npolitical level, of the universal support for this\nOrganization.\nIt is now up to us to elaborate on our leaders'\nobservations and determine what is necessary to build a\nmore prosperous future, a more just society and an\nincreasingly human civilization.\nAt the outset of the new millennium, scientific\nand technological achievements in all fields are\nallowing us to glimpse an ever-brighter future.\nHowever, a double threat exists to progress towards\nthat goal. On one hand, it is endangered by uneven\ngrowth, which threatens to deepen the divide between\nthe wealthiest and the poorest. More effective measures\nmust be adopted to create a more just and equitable\nsociety and international community.\nOn the other hand, the future is also threatened by\nthe temptation of absolute materialism, which can be\nunderstood as the danger of reducing development to\nthe mere satisfaction of material needs. The risk of\ntransforming the human being into a commodity and\nthe temptation to seek wealth instead of happiness\nrepresent a continuing threat. We must establish a new\nsociety whose goal should be the promotion of the\nwell-being of all, as reflected in their full physical,\nintellectual and spiritual development. We must create\na society centred on ideas, creativity and abilities, and\nnot on power or wealth.\nThe United Nations can and should play a central\nrole in the construction of this new society. However,\nwe must note, honestly and courageously, that so far\nthe United Nations and the international community as\na whole have been held back by innumerable\nconstraints and restrictions and known many failures.\nMore than 50 years ago, at the founding of this\nOrganization, we committed ourselves to eradicating\nthe scourge of war, and we undertook to promote social\nprogress and better living conditions for all.\nUnfortunately, though, to date, the United Nations\nhas been unable to respond fully to these pleas. We\nreact to political and military crises with hollow\nstatements to the press. We condemn gross violations\nof human rights with procedural resolutions, which are\nthen forgotten on our shelves. We create organs,\ncommittees and tribunals without any real capacity for\naction and lacking the necessary resources to fulfil\ntheir mandates. We convene summits, conferences and\nmeetings that limit themselves to repeating empty\ndeclarations and passing commitments. We send\nmilitary observers who are unable to maintain peace\nbecause we do not provide them with the necessary\nresources or political support. Over and over again we\nadopt inadequate measures to resolve crises, hoping\nthat they will perform miracles. We send international\nexperts with development programmes that respond\nneither to the needs nor the desires of their recipients.\nThis Organization has imposed sanctions that affect\ninnocent civilians while at the same time inadvertently\nstrengthening criminal regimes.\nWe recognize, of course, that many of the United\nNations activities have been successful and\npraiseworthy. We cannot overlook the work of the\n22\n\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees or of the United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF) in favour of victims of war and of children,\nnor can we forget the heroic sacrifice of many Blue\nHelmets and humanitarian personnel. We must always\nkeep in mind the valuable mediation efforts and good\noffices provided to defuse armed conflicts. We must\nlearn from those peacekeeping operations that have\nbeen crowned with success in spite of all of the\ndifficulties. We must recall and respect the gradual\ncodification of human rights and of the need to provide\nthe highest possible standards of living.\nBut the world expects greater leadership from the\nUnited Nations. The world's peoples are calling for\nfirm and decisive action on the part of the international\ncommunity. Humanity is looking to us to fulfil the lofty\ngoals that we set for ourselves when we founded this\nOrganization.\nFor these reasons, new bases must be established\nfor the actions of the United Nations. The Organization\nmust be provided with a renewed political and\nphilosophical paradigm that will enable it to garner the\npolitical and material support it needs from all States in\norder effectively to achieve its goals.\nToday the United Nations requires all of our\nsupport. Each one of us is obliged, individually and\ncollectively, to provide the best living conditions\npossible to all our fellow citizens.\nThe primary objective of the United Nations in\nthe twenty-first century must be to promote full respect\nfor human rights. More than 50 years after the adoption\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\ncontinuing violation of those rights, through\ninexcusable killings for political, religious or ethnic\nmotives and through the displacement of millions of\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, is a matter\nfor profound concern. We are distressed also by the\nfact that thousands perish daily of starvation or easily\ncurable diseases. We are concerned at the fact that\nthousands of persons are still persecuted or\nincarcerated because of their political opinions and that\nfor those reasons hundreds are subject to the most\ndegrading torture or are forced to live in extreme\npoverty.\nThe persistence of war is the cause of inexcusable\natrocities and recurrent humanitarian crisis. The true\nvictims of war are not the fallen soldiers but the\ndisplaced or refugee children and elderly, the women\nwho are raped, the young people who are murdered, the\nmothers who lose their incomes, the innocent workers\nwhose workplaces are destroyed, the students whose\nschools are bombed, the sick who cannot go to hospital\nbecause there are no bridges and no medicines. In the\ncontemporary world, every armed conflict, every civil\nwar, every massive violation of human rights, every\nhumanitarian emergency, caused either by man or by\nnature, calls for coordinated international action\nthrough this Organization.\nIn that context, all States must politically and\nfinancially support United Nations activities to\neradicate the scourge of war. The Organization must\nregain leadership in maintaining international peace\nand security. It is imperative that all States strictly\nadhere to the prohibition of the use of force.\nFor those reasons, one of our tasks is to revitalize\nthe Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy\nand its capacity for action. That organ should never\ntransfer, abandon or renounce its primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\nTo the contrary, it is essential to ensure that it can\nperform its functions satisfactorily by providing it with\nthe necessary resources and political support.\nThe Security Council cannot renounce its role\nsimply because it is unable to find a quick or\ninexpensive solution to a crisis. We cannot accept the\nestablishment of peacekeeping operations that lack\npersonnel and resources to the point of being\nirrelevant. Nor can we accept the dispatch of personnel\nwho lack training or motivation and who become easy\nvictims of conflicts. By no means can we consent to the\nimposition of sanctions regimes that affect innocent\npopulations. When establishing a peacekeeping\nmission, the Security Council must define realistic\ngoals, so that mandates and resources will be\ncommensurate with the actual requirements of the\ncrisis it is to face.\nArmed conflicts and political crises are\nmultifaceted phenomena. Every emergency situation\npresents a series of political, military and economic\nproblems. True peace can be attained only when all\nindividuals enjoy proper living conditions, when they\npossess a sufficiently high level of economic\ndevelopment to meet their basic needs, when their\nfundamental human rights are respected and when their\ninterests and individual rights are guaranteed by\ndemocratic means.\n23\n\nTrue peace requires a culture and a climate that\nfoster mutual respect and that categorically reject\nviolence. In order to achieve peace, we must create a\nculture of peace. With a view to creating such a culture\nof peace, the United Nations must promote not only\npeace but also social justice, democracy and\ndevelopment. This should actively involve the Security\nCouncil, the General Assembly, the Economic and\nSocial Council, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the United\nNations Development Programme. We advocate in\nparticular the strengthening of the role of the Economic\nand Social Council so that it can effectively monitor\nand coordinate the implementation of the economic,\nsocial, cultural and environmental activities of the\nUnited Nations and of all its organs.\nIn this regard, international cooperation plays a\ncentral role in supporting local initiatives for\ndevelopment, democratization and the promotion of\nhuman rights. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a\ndecrease in international assistance in these fields\nwhile the demand continues to grow. To address this\nsituation, each nation has to take into its own hands the\ntask of creating the conditions necessary to attain\npeace, development and justice.\nWe believe that only if human rights are fully\nrespected will it be possible to create and sustain the\nconditions necessary for the full development of all\nmen and women. The promotion of democracy and\nsocial and economic development are also\nindispensable instruments to generate the material,\nsocial and spiritual conditions required for this\ncomprehensive development.\nOur experience has taught us that only democracy\ncan provide the necessary framework for the full\nrespect of human rights. Only democracy which grants\nall citizens equal rights and opportunities to participate\nin the political process can secure true peace. Only a\ndemocratic system which bestows on all people equal\nopportunities to enjoy the benefits of economic\ndevelopment and personal accomplishment will make\npossible sustainable and just development. For that\nreason, we celebrate the democratic consolidation that,\nthanks to recent elections after a long period under the\nsame ruling party, is being enjoyed by Mexico and by\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan \u2014 which deserves an\nappropriate place in international forums.\nAdditionally, our own national evolution has\ntaught us that the first step in such a policy is the\nelimination or reduction of military budgets. Costa\nRica abolished its army more than 50 years ago and has\nsince been free from armed conflict with its neighbours\nand from military oppression of its population.\nReduction of military expenditure is especially\nvaluable for developing States whose resources are\nlimited and cannot be mismanaged. In that context,\narmies are a heavy burden on national budgets and a\nconstant source of tension and repression. Would it not\nbe better to devote to health the $191 billion that\ndeveloping countries waste on their armed forces?\nWould it not be preferable to allocate to education the\n$22 billion dollars that are spent in arms transfers to\nthe third world? Our historical experience has made us\na witness to and an example of the multifaceted and\npositive relationship between disarmament and\ndevelopment.\nThe second step on the path to peace and\ndevelopment is to devote as many resources as possible\nto education and health. Only an educated people can\nlive in freedom; only a healthy people can work for\ndevelopment; only a cultured people can be a part of\nthe contemporary globalized world. For those reasons,\nwe must invest intensively and systematically in our\nhuman resources while also striving for economic\ndevelopment, social justice and the institutionalization\nof democracy.\nThe third step towards the future is to secure\nrespect for human rights and democracy to enable\npeoples to choose freely their own destinies and to\nfacilitate the coordination of all of society's actors. In\nmy country, we have deeply committed ourselves to\nthose principles, both in the national sphere through\nconstitutional provisions, and in the international arena\nthrough various international conventions and treaties.\nIn this regard, the issue of migrations is of the\ngreatest importance to my country. Costa Rica has\ngiven emphasis to the need to relocate the nationals of\neach country peacefully and in an orderly fashion to\nsatisfy their specific immigration and emigration\nneeds; to the movements of qualified human resources\nto promote economic, social and cultural progress in\nthe receiving countries; and to the orderly reintegration\nand resettlement of persons who, for one reason or\nanother, have been obliged to abandon their country or\nplace of origin or who have been forced to leave a\nnation that did not allow them to exercise their right\n24\n\nnot to emigrate. Therefore, we appreciate the key role\nplayed by the International Organization for Migration\n(IOM), and we advocate in particular that States that\nhave not yet done so make the necessary amendments\nto their domestic legislation in order to guarantee this\nright to all human beings.\nThere are three main elements in the process of\ndevelopment that we believe require greater attention.\nFirst, we should reconstruct society and its values,\nespecially through a renewed effort to acknowledge\nand protect the value of the family in its role as\nsociety's basic cell. Unfortunately, the family is the\nfirst victim of political and economic crisis, thus\nforcing its dissolution by the scattering of its members.\nFor this reason, we must emphasize that families are\nthe schools where the basic values of coexistence and\nrespect for the dignity of all other persons are taught,\nand that, without them, it is impossible to create a\nstable society.\nSecondly, it is necessary to make greater efforts\nto pursue sustainable development in all areas of\nhuman endeavour. In this sense, we are pleased to\nreport that Costa Rica has achieved significant\nadvances in the environmental field regarding the\npreservation of its rich biodiversity and the promotion\nof development in harmony with nature. We are one of\nthe first nations to have undertaken carbon fixation and\nthe sale of oxygen as an additional source of income\nfor development, on the basis of the sustainable use of\nour forests and recognition of the economic value of\nthe environmental services that they provide to all\nhumanity. In the same vein, we have incorporated the\nprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol into our domestic\nlegal system. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to\ngo towards fully sustainable development.\nSimilarly, Costa Rica is honoured to be the\nheadquarters of the Earth Council and the University\nfor Peace, which are working jointly to promote a\nconcept of development in greater harmony with the\nenvironment. We are confident that the University for\nPeace, in particular, can play a constructive role both in\nthe promotion of sustainable development as in the\ncreation of a culture of peace. Thanks to the work of its\nnew Council and in particular Mr. Maurice Strong, who\npresides over it, that institution can count on my\nGovernment's unwavering support.\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate our pledge to\noffer our country as the headquarters of the Secretariat\nof the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests. We are\nconfident that this new organ will finally secure the\ninternational community's coordinated and\ncomprehensive action with respect to forests.\nThirdly, it is necessary to ensure that economic\ndevelopment is sustainable. To achieve this goal, it is\nnecessary to modify the international economic order,\nwith a view to making it more just and balanced, so\nthat it can grant to the smaller developing countries\ngreater access to the benefits of the globalization\nprocess and the opportunities for development that it\ncreates. Open commercial mechanisms enabling\ncommerce and investment to be engines for economic\ngrowth should be established. In a parallel, we should\ntarget our developmental policies towards more\nefficient use of the digital revolution, which provides\nus with many opportunities to compete in the global\nmarket and to increase our production. In short, we\nmust democratize globalization.\nWe believe that knowledge and opportunities to\naccess information and the new technologies are\nessential today to generate well-being. In today's\nworld, marked by new technological frontiers, our\nendeavours should also be directed towards narrowing\nthe digital divide. We should seek to provide more just\nand equitable access to the opportunities open to us in\norder to transform economic and social activities. In\naccordance with this thesis, Costa Rica recently\ninitiated the programme \u201cCommunications without\nfrontiers\u201d, becoming the first nation to provide free e-\nmail to all its population.\nDemocracy, sustainable development and human\nrights constitute the three fundamental elements upon\nwhich the United Nations action must be based, as well\nas that of each of our nations. None is an end in itself;\nrather they are only a means to secure better living\nconditions for all people. The true goal of our action\ncentres on the human being; it is to guarantee greater\nhappiness for all persons, the greatest respect for their\ndignity and the necessary conditions for their full\nphysical, intellectual and spiritual development."

        "file_text": "Please allow me to extend my warm congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am confident\nthat, with your wisdom and experience, and with the\nsupport and coordinated efforts of the member States,\nthe Millennium Assembly will successfully complete\nall its work. At the same time, I would like to express\nmy appreciation and thanks to Mr. Gurirab for the\ncontribution he made as President of the General\nAssembly at its last session.\nThe Millennium Summit, which attracted\nworldwide attention, has just concluded. The United\nNations Millennium Declaration is a consensus reached\nby world leaders on how to meet the major challenges\nfacing mankind today. The Declaration reviews and\nsums up the course that the United Nations has\ntravelled over the past 55 years. More importantly, it\noffers a blueprint for the United Nations in the new\ncentury and the new millennium and important\nguidance to people around the world in their pursuit of\npeace, development and common progress. I would like\nto add my voice to the call to action made by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan at the closing ceremony\nof the Summit. We should work together to turn the\nconsensus reached at the Summit into action and usher\nin a new era of peace and development for people all\nover the world.\nIt is the primary mission of the United Nations in\nthe new century to uphold the purposes and principles\nof its Charter, promote democracy in international\nrelations, maintain world peace and stability and\nfacilitate the development and prosperity of all\ncountries. The United Nations Charter is a\nmanifestation of the peoples' aspiration to equality,\njustice and freedom. Over the past 55 years, the United\nNations has adhered to the Charter aims of\nsafeguarding peace, developing friendship and\npromoting cooperation, as well as the core principles\nguiding international relations, such as sovereign\nequality and non-interference in the internal affairs of\nStates. It is precisely for these reasons that the United\nNations has grown in strength and its membership\nincreased from 51 to 189. This Organization is still\nplaying an irreplaceable role in world affairs.\nThe history of the past 55 years has amply proved\nthe effectiveness of the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Today, global issues have\nmade our interests intertwined and modern technology\nhas made our communication easier. In these\ncircumstances, we need more than ever to face our\ncommon challenges together on the basis of equality,\nmutual respect and democratic consultation. The\npurposes and principles of the Charter are by no means\noutdated, but are rather of greater relevance today.\nDemocracy in international relations requires\ncompliance with the principle of sovereign equality, as\n5\n\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter. Countries\ndiffer in size, strength and wealth, but they are all\nequal members of the international community. None\nshould be discriminated against and their state\nsovereignty brooks no encroachment. The internal\naffairs of a country should be managed by the people of\nthat country and major world affairs should be decided\nby all countries through consultation. The response to\nglobal challenges calls for worldwide cooperation and\ncoordination. This is a necessity of our times and a\nprerequisite for the establishment of a fair and just new\ninternational political order. It is also the foundation\nand source of vitality for the United Nations in the new\ncentury.\nThe reform of the United Nations should give full\nexpression to democracy in international relations. The\nreform is aimed at better safeguarding the fundamental\nrights and interests of all Member States and,\nespecially, at truly reflecting the will of developing\ncountries, which make up the bulk of United Nations\nmembership. It should not merely satisfy the needs of a\nfew countries. The reform of the Security Council\nshould seek primarily to increase representation of\ndeveloping countries and should be based on extensive\ndeliberations among Member States. It is against the\nwill of the overwhelming majority of Member States to\nset arbitrar deadlines or to force the passage of\nimmature plans.\nThere is general agreement among the United\nNations Member States on basing the scale\nmethodology of regular budget and peacekeeping\nassessment on the principle of the capacity to pay. This\nmethodology is also one that has been confirmed time\nand again by the General Assembly through its\nresolutions and should therefore be abided by in\nwhatever circumstances. Any adjustment to this\nmethodology should take into full account the specific\neconomic conditions of developing countries. Such\nadjustments should be made only when there is\nconsensus among all Member States through extensive\nconsultation, thus facilitating the normal and sound\noperation of the United Nations.\nAnother important historical task facing the\nUnited Nations is to respond to globalization and to\nachieve the common development of mankind. The\ntwentieth century has seen both unprecedented\neconomic prosperity and the greatest polarization. In\nthe last decade of the century, economic globalization\nhas advanced at the fastest pace, while the gap between\nthe North and the South has continued to widen.\nAccording to the World Bank, the revenue of the low-\nincome countries accounts for only 6 per cent of the\nworld's total, although they make up more than half of\nthe world's population, while that of the developed\ncountries is 80 per cent with only one sixth of the\nworld population.\nIt is especially worrisome that there is an even\nwider gap between developing and developed countries\nin the field of advanced technology. The new economy\nis so far benefiting only the rich countries. Most\ndeveloping countries are still information have-nots.\nShould this situation be allowed to continue, many\ndeveloping countries will long remain deprived of the\nopportunity to participate in technological progress and\neconomic growth and the world will be further\npolarized.\nTo prevent poverty from swallowing up\nachievements of development and to prevent social\ninjustice from shaking the basis of global stability, the\nUnited Nations must play its due role in narrowing the\ngap between the rich and the poor and bringing about\ncommon prosperity to the world. It is an unavoidable\nmajor responsibility of the United Nations in the new\ncentury to promote the establishment of a new\ninternational economic order based on cooperation on\nan equal footing and aimed at common development\nand to ensure that economic globalization benefits\neverybody in the world.\nThe United Nations should give top priority to the\nissue of development, make efforts to change the\ncurrent situation in which global economic affairs are\ndominated by only a few countries and ensure\ndeveloping countries their right to equal participation\nin economic decision-making. In making or revising\nglobal economic rules of the game, consideration\nshould first be given to the need of developing\ncountries in order to facilitate their development and\nreduce the risks they may face when participating in\nglobalization. The United Nations should also mobilize\nall the resources available and encourage the\ninternational community to narrow the \u201cdigital divide\u201d,\nand it should help developing countries to seize, as far\nas they can, the opportunities brought about by the\nscientific and technological advancement driven by the\ninformation revolution. The United Nations also has\nthe responsibility for introducing new rules to the\nworld to make science and technology truly serve all of\n6\n\nmankind and the lofty cause of peace and development\nin the world.\nAs drastic and profound changes are taking place\nin the international situation, what kind of security\nconcept should be embraced is a major subject before\nthe United Nations and all its Member States. Global\nstrategic stability is the foundation on which world\nsecurity rests. And the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile\n(ABM) Treaty is an important cornerstone for global\nstrategic stability. Any move to undermine the totality\nand effectiveness of the Treaty will have a profound\nnegative impact on world peace and security. The\nproposal for a national missile defence system that is\nprohibited by the ABM Treaty is essentially aimed at\nseeking unilateral military and strategic supremacy, and\nthus a typical example of the cold war mentality. Such\na plan, if implemented, will only bring serious negative\nconsequences to the security of the whole world. The\nadoption by the General Assembly of the resolution on\npreservation of and compliance with the ABM Treaty\n(A/54/54 A) at its fifty-fourth session by an\noverwhelming majority is an indicator of the firm will\nof most countries in the world to maintain and strictly\nobserve the ABM Treaty. The United Nations should\ncontinue to show serious concern over the attempt by a\ncertain country to develop a missile defence system to\nthe detriment of global strategic stability, and it should\ntake necessary measures to stop this dangerous\ndevelopment.\nSecurity is mutual and relative. No country\nshould enhance its security at the expense of that of the\nothers. To seek absolute unilateral security is not\nfeasible and will lead to greater insecurity. With\nincreased international contacts and exchanges,\ncountries of the world will find themselves sharing\nmore common interests and facing more common\nchallenges. Security can only be realized through\ndialogue on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual\nunderstanding and mutual accommodation. It can only\nbe maintained on the basis of mutual respect and\npeaceful coexistence, and it can only be consolidated\nthrough mutually beneficial cooperation and common\ndevelopment. The only way to protect the fundamental\ninterests of all countries and enhance universal security\nis to replace the old security concept based on military\nalliances and military build-up with a new one that is\ncharacterized by equality, mutual trust, mutual benefit,\ncooperation and settlement of disputes through\ndialogue.\nIn recent years, China, Russia, Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have reached, within the\nframework of the Shanghai Five and through\nconsultation and cooperation based on equality, an\nagreement among themselves on confidence-building\nin the military field and reduction of military forces in\nthe border areas. This offers something useful for the\ninternational community to draw upon in its\nexploratory efforts for a new security concept.\nWe have noted with pleasure the positive changes\nin the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the\npositive outcome of the successful historic summit\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nand the Republic of Korea. It has shown once again\nthat dialogue and consultation based on equality serve\nto enhance mutual trust and improve relations between\nStates. We appreciate the efforts made by both the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the\nRepublic of Korea to promote peace, stability and\ndevelopment on the peninsula and in the region.\nWe deeply regret that the tripartite summit at\nCamp David failed to produce any agreement. We\nbelieve that the Middle East peace process will move\nforward as long as the parties concerned earnestly,\npatiently and unswervingly engage themselves in\nnegotiating and seriously implement the agreements\nthat have already be reached among them on the basis\nof the relevant United Nation resolutions, in\naccordance with the principle of land for peace and in\nthe spirit of mutual trust and mutual accommodation.\nIn the twentieth century, mankind suffered a great\ndeal from the scourges of war. In the twenty-first\ncentury, humanitarian crises of a massive scale must be\nprevented, and the tragedy of innocent people being\nslaughtered on a large scale must not be allowed to\nrepeat itself. The United Nations shoulders a primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of world peace, and\ntherefore it should work harder to stop conflicts and\neliminate wars.\nIn the present-day world, hegemony and power\npolitics still exist. Territorial disputes, ethnic feuds and\nreligious rifts have all led to incessant regional\nconflicts. Some countries and regions hope that the\nUnited Nations will assist them in stopping conflicts,\nwhich we fully understand. At the same time, we must\nnot fail to see the complexity of international\nintervention and the danger of inappropriate\nintervention. The United Nations intervention should\n7\n\naim at eliminating the root causes of a given conflict\nrather than delaying its settlement. It should aim at\nfacilitating reconciliation between the conflicting\nparties rather than deepening their hatred and hostility.\nWe are of the view that major powers and groups of\ncountries should respect the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the countries concerned rather than\nmeddling in their internal affairs or triggering new\nconflicts.\nIn the new circumstances, peacekeeping\noperations remain an important means for the United\nNations to fulfil its obligations in safeguarding world\npeace and security. In this regard, it is essential to\nensure and enhance the Security Council's\nresponsibility and political leadership in peacekeeping\noperations and to ensure the observance of the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should be\nlaunched with a sense of realism and within the\ncapacities of the United Nations. The limited resources\nshould be put to where they are most needed.\nHuman beings are the most precious among all\nthe creatures on earth. To promote human development\nand protect all the rights and interests of mankind is the\nprimary responsibility of all countries. China is the\nmost populous country in the world. The Chinese\nGovernment has taken upon itself to safeguard the\nindependence and dignity of the Chinese nation and to\nensure the almost 1.3 billion Chinese the right to a\ndecent life and all-round development. It has regarded\nthis as its sacred duty and will do all it can to achieve\nthis end.\nHuman rights improvement is an ongoing\nprocess. The human rights conditions of a country are\nup to the people of that country to assess and improve.\nSince people live under different circumstances, the\nform in which human rights are embodied changes with\nthese circumstances and with time. Therefore, how to\nprotect and promote human rights depends on the\nactual conditions and specific needs of a country. To\narbitrarily impose a fixed set of human rights rules,\nregardless of the differences in the specific\nenvironment and reality, will not serve the interests of\nthe people of any country. To interfere in other\ncountries' internal affairs in the name of protecting\nhuman rights in order to advance one's own political\nagenda is simply to blaspheme and betray the human\nrights cause.\nThe United Nations should vigorously encourage\ndialogues and exchanges among different civilizations\nand countries on human rights and discourage\nconfrontation and exclusion \u2014 which are the general\ntrend of the human rights movement. In providing\nhumanitarian assistance, the United Nations should\ngive equal priority to the prevention of conflicts and\nthe protection of human rights, on the one hand, and to\nthe reduction and elimination of poverty and the\npromotion of human development, on the other hand.\nIn this context, the United Nations should work in\nclose coordination and cooperation with the countries\nand Governments concerned, instead of bypassing\nthem, and ensure human rights for the majority of the\npeople. Otherwise, such operations will trigger a\nhumanitarian disaster of a greater scale. Only when the\nabove-mentioned principles are abided by can the\nUnited Nations play a useful role in protecting human\nrights.\nA few days ago, from this solemn podium\nChinese President Jiang Zemin proclaimed to the\nwhole world the Chinese people's firm determination\nto turn China into a strong, prosperous and united\ncountry with a high degree of democracy, and to\npromote world peace and development. In the past 20\nyears and more since the inception of reform and\nopening-up, China completed the first and second\nphases of its modernization strategy. With the advent of\nthe new century, China will begin the third phase of the\nstrategy and enter a new stage of accelerated\nmodernization. Once China becomes a member of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), there will be major\nbreakthroughs in its opening-up. China will honour its\ncommitments and seriously fulfil its obligations, while\nenjoying its rights.\nAlthough there will be difficulties, risks and\nchallenges on the road ahead, China is capable of\nremoving every obstacle and achieving its grand\nobjective of modernization. China will unswervingly\nstick to its independent foreign policy of peace and\nfurther develop its friendly relations with the rest of the\nworld on the basis of the five principles of peaceful\ncoexistence. A strong and developed China will not\nonly benefit more than a billion Chinese people but\nalso serve prosperity and progress worldwide.\nTo resolve the question of Taiwan once and for all\nand complete the reunification of the motherland is a\nshared aspiration of the entire Chinese people,\nincluding our Taiwan compatriots. Adherence to the\n8\n\nprinciple of peaceful reunification and one country, two\nsystems in resolving the Taiwan question will serve the\ndevelopment of the two sides on either side of the\nstraits, contribute to amity and unity among\ncompatriots on both sides, and facilitate peace and\nstability in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese\nGovernment and people have committed themselves\nmore strongly than anyone else to a peaceful\nreunification. They have demonstrated the utmost\nsincerity and made the greatest efforts to this end. We\nare convinced that \u2014 with the concerted efforts of the\nentire Chinese people, including those living in\nTaiwan \u2014 China will be able to realize its complete\nreunification at an earlier date.\nWe are entrusted with the important task of\ncharting a course for mankind for the coming century.\nLet us join hands and work together to build a more\nsecure, prosperous and progressive world in the new\ncentury."

        "file_text": "I wish at the\noutset to convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Harri\nHolkeri of Finland on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and to\nreaffirm our confidence in his ability to guide our work\nat this session. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which\nit is my privilege to head, assures the President of its\nfull cooperation. Our congratulations go also to his\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who fulfilled his\nmandate in a constructive manner, thus making an\nimportant contribution to the work of the General\nAssembly.\nWe wish also to express our trust and\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand to thank him for the important steps that have been\ntaken on his initiative towards substantive reform of\nthe United Nations and towards bolstering the\nOrganization's international credibility.\nThe universality of the United Nations gains\nwhenever a new Member State is admitted. By joining\nthe United Nations, Tuvalu has affirmed to the\ninternational community that it will shoulder\nresponsibility for the full exercise of its sovereignty. Its\naccession to membership has reinforced the\nrepresentative nature of this world forum.\nIn the third millennium, with our eyes focused on\na new century, we are passing through a historic period\nin which new and significant events give rise to new\nhopes on the international scene.\nThis diagnosis, however, encompasses both hope\nand scepticism, for it shows that the transitional period\nwe are living through involves factors of both\nintegration and disaggregation.\nIf, on the one hand, the end of bipolarism that\ndominated international relations diminished\nideological antagonisms, this new and unprecedented\nprocess, by undoing old political and strategic\nbalances, is promoting democratic impulses, freeing\nthe energy of States and creating space for a new\ninternational order more in line with our times.\nOn the other hand, the rise of nationalist\naspirations, supported by the yearning for the right to\nfree evolution, has had the effect of triggering old\nconflicts, some of them forgotten in time. This\nphenomenon has led to an exponential growth of\nconflicts that menaces the internal cohesion of States as\nwell as international peace and security.\nIt was predicted, and legitimately so, that the\ninternational economy would be able to take advantage\nof the peace dividend resulting from the end of the\narms race. It had been expected that those resources\nwould be invested in the poorest countries and, thus,\nwould have contributed to the acceleration of global\neconomic growth and development. Our perception,\nhowever, is that, due to the present state of\ninternational economic relations, those optimistic\nexpectations have not come to fruition.\nAs the international balance of power has\nchanged, the relative position that placed different\ncountries in the international, political and economic\npecking order has also changed. The very nature of\nrelations among States has also been transformed.\nHowever, the rules and practices giving structure to a\nnew international order are yet to be defined. Our\nperception is that this is the main unresolved issue.\nThis calls for the community of nations, through our\ncommon institutions, to work determinedly together in\norder to bring the present transition to a successful end.\nTo do so, it will be essential to empower the\nsystem of collective security embodied in the United\nNations. In particular, we attach great importance to\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and the\nrationalization of its agenda. We also feel there is a\nneed to reform the Security Council so that that organ,\nwhich has special responsibilities, will be able to fulfil\nits original mission and be reborn as the main political\ninstrument for action in the United Nations.\nExpectations without precedent devolve upon the\nUnited Nations. We should all strive to find a solution\nto the present structural and financial crises faced by\nthe Organization. It will be necessary to reactivate its\n\ndynamism in order to implement the 'Agenda for\nPeace' and to make the 'Agenda for Development' a\nreality.\nIt is widely known that Guinea-Bissau has just\novercome the gravest crisis the country has\nexperienced in its recent history. We are still\nconvalescing from the terrible effects of an absurd and\ndisastrous war. In addition to irreparable loss of life,\nGuinea-Bissau society was deeply traumatized by a\nconflict that almost destroyed the entire existing\ninfrastructure. Guinea-Bissau was made more\nimpoverished and more vulnerable. Its reconstruction,\nthe foundations of which are fragile, will be very\ndifficult, because even simple tasks have assumed\nurgent priority. The urgency and the sheer volume of\nthe effort needed to rebuild the country go far beyond\nthe limited possibilities of a Government that is near\nexhaustion. In order to succeed, that effort will need to\nbe supplemented by the effective participation of every\npartner of Guinea-Bissau.\nIn this new period of the restoration of\ndemocratic legality, the people of Guinea-Bissau have\nelected their new Government within the framework of\na pluralist democracy. The new National People's\nAssembly has approved a general programme of action,\nprepared by the Government, which defines a strategy\nfor sustainable development aimed at implementing the\npriorities identified, in cooperation with Guinea-\nBissau's partners. This programme of action and the\nproject of building a new society, required by the\nevolution of the situation in Guinea-Bissau, have been\nset out by Guinea-Bissau's new President, who was\nfreely elected by the people. Aware of the sacred\nresponsibility incumbent upon him, President Kumba\nYal\u00b7 has committed himself to upholding the\nprogramme of action.\nAs on past occasions when we were beneficiaries\nof timely and precious solidarity extended by the\ninternational community, we are hopeful that the\npolitical, economic and social progress of Guinea-\nBissau will be further supported and maintained.\nAmilcar Cabral, the founder of our nation,\nconsidered himself and the other Guinea-Bissau\nfreedom fighters to be combatants for the noble causes\nupheld by the United Nations. Today, after the heroic\nstruggle that led to our independence, and thanks also\nto the support received from the international\ncommunity and the United Nations, Guinea-Bissau is\nparticipating in the highest world diplomatic forums\nwith serenity and determination, embarking on an\nunrelenting search to improve on the heritage of our\nforebears.\nTherefore, acting with responsibility and\nspecificity, Guinea-Bissau has undertaken its own\ninitiatives, as well as presenting proposals aimed at the\ndefence of its interests and at contributing to the\nadvancement of the causes of peace and international\ncooperation. We recognize that in today's international\nsituation, rife with conflicts and contradictions, the\nUnited Nations remains, without a doubt, the necessary\nforum for the development of the activities undertaken\nby our Government to affirm the international presence\nof Guinea-Bissau.\nThe five African Portuguese-speaking countries,\njoined with Brazil, Portugal and Timor Lorosae  the\nlatter still being an observer  to form the Community\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries. This Lusophone\nCommunity is characterized by solidarity and\ntolerance, based upon shared sentiments and\nperceptions rooted in a melding of cultures that\nexpresses the experience of our respective peoples.\nWe would like to salute the development in the\nprocesses of democratization of Government structures\nthat is now occurring in Sao Tome and Principe,\nMozambique and Cape Verde, similar to what\nhappened in Guinea-Bissau. This will allow our\nGovernments to better respond to the legitimate\naspirations of our peoples.\nWe wish to express our solidarity with the\nAngolan Government and people, which have\nexperienced the nightmare of almost 40 years of war.\nWe support the efforts in search of peace and national\nreconciliation. We strongly favour the implementation\nby the United Nations of the Lusaka Protocol and the\nfull implementation of the sanctions established by the\nSecurity Council.\nIn our West African subregion, Guinea-Bissau has\ntried, and to a certain extent has attained, in terms of its\nwill for integration, a political commitment aimed at\nimproving our relations with neighbouring countries so\nas to promote the cause of peace. In this spirit, we\nrecognize that in its essence the conflict of Casamance\nis an internal issue of Senegal. As such, we also\nperceive its negative consequences on the neighbouring\nStates. Our country is ready to work in the search for a\njust solution to and peaceful resolution of that conflict.\n40\n\nWe feel, however, that we are neither a part of the\nproblem nor its source of origin. The constructive\nactions undertaken by Presidents Kumba Yal\u00b7 of\nGuinea-Bissau and Wade of Senegal, with the support\nof President Jammeh of the Gambia, allow us to look\nwith optimism to the future evolution of that issue.\nWe deeply deplore the tragedy that has befallen\nSierra Leone, a country of our subregion. The\nincreased violence in that country has resulted in a\nhumanitarian disaster. We urge the belligerent factions\nand the Government of Sierra Leone to cooperate with\nthe international community in order to find a\ndefinitive solution to that fratricidal conflict.\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and in the Great Lakes region continues to be a\nsource of concern to Guinea-Bissau. It is necessary to\nsummon the political will of the countries of the region\nto diminish the tension and to continue to search for a\njust solution.\nThe Lusaka accords are the result of the\nperseverance of the parties involved and should be\nimplemented rapidly and comprehensively. They are\nthe essential framework for the resolution of the\nconflict. We are convinced that the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1291 (2000), which\nestablished the United Nations Organization Mission in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, represents the\nroad to peace.\nIn the Horn of Africa, Guinea-Bissau welcomes\nthe acceptance by Ethiopia and Eritrea of the peace\nplan put forward by the Organization of African Unity.\nWe encourage both parties to persist on the path of\ndialog and negotiation and to continue to cooperate\nwith our continental organization.\nIn the immediate vicinity of our continent, the\nMiddle East peace process is entering a decisive\nperiod. This process and the quest for equanimity\nshould be accelerated in order to ensure a lasting and\njust peace that respects the inalienable right of the\nPalestinian people to an independent State of its own,\nas well as the right of all States of the region, including\nIsrael, to national independence.\nFar from the African continent, Guinea-Bissau\ncontinues to pay special attention to the issue of East\nTimor. We are linked to that territory by special\nhistoric and cultural bonds and we are therefore closely\nfollowing the work of the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor and the recent\nestablishment of a transitional Government. We hope\nthat the process will culminate in the full independence\nof Timor Lorosae and with its admission as a full\nMember of the United Nations.\nFinally, we believe that the situations created by\nthe imposition of embargoes against certain countries,\nin which sanctions affect the poorer sectors of the\npopulations, particularly women and children, should\nbe addressed through dialogue and negotiation with a\nview to finding a definitive solution.\nIn the age of globalization, we should not lose\nsight of the human being and its vital needs. If it is\nlegitimate that all parties have the right to expect profit\nfrom progress, it is also correct that we should seek\neconomic growth with social equity. Mankind faces\nmany challenges, among which achieving\ncomprehensive development is without doubt the most\nimportant, because the lack of development is the main\nsource of the conflicts that lead to the crises afflicting\nour planet. Therefore, if we wish globalization to live\nup to its promise, we should learn better to work and to\nact together in order to correct its negative effects.\nIt is urgently necessary to give momentum to the\nNorth-South dialogue on the basis of equality and to\ndevelop a wide network of South-South cooperation\nwith a view to minimizing the risks of globalization.\nThat effort must be fully supported by the international\ncommunity with a view to a true partnership for\ndevelopment. Such partnership, in our view, should\nenable us to find the modalities of a coherent\ninternational action to ensure sustainable economic\ngrowth in the context of true development.\nThe structural adjustment policies adopted by the\nmajority of African countries are, per se, clear proof of\ntheir willingness to improve the management of their\nnational economies. Nevertheless, in most cases, the\nresponse of our development partners has not been in\nline with the sacrifices demanded and the urgency of\nthe problems identified. From our point of view, it is\nnecessary to identify the mechanisms needed to\npromote a true social adjustment, keeping the human\nindividual as its central point of reference.\nIn this context, the collective challenge we face is\nto stress a dynamic image of international solidarity,\nwhich may be translated into effective action for social\nand economic cooperation in favour of developing\ncountries.\n41\n\nOur gathering here at the General Assembly\nrepresents the best opportunity to correct the\nimbalances that destabilize the global process. We need\nto muster the determination of all our countries in order\nto raise relations among States to the high level of\ndignity required by our shared future."

        "file_text": "I am conscious that\nthe central problem for all of us when we rise to speak\nto the General Assembly is that there are too many\nissues of concern to hope to address them all in one\nspeech. There is no shortage of challenges to the\nUnited Nations as we meet for the first time in a new\ncentury to debate the issues of a modern world.\nIt is a world united by the new technologies of\ncommunication. We have never had so much\nopportunity to share the know-how for economic\ngrowth. Yet our world has never before been so divided\nbetween rich and poor. In the year ahead, we must\nmake sure that all the United Nations agencies and its\ninternational financial institutions work together in a\ncoordinated way to promote development and to reduce\ndebt.\nIt is also a world bound together by growth in\ntrade between our countries. But we failed at Seattle to\nmake further progress on removing the obstacles to that\ntrade. In the year ahead, we must launch a world trade\ndevelopment round which is fair to those countries\nwhose main exports are agricultural rather than\nindustrial.\nIt is a world which faces a common threat to its\nglobal climate. We are each learning the alarming rate\nat which that climate is changing as the result of our\nown actions. Before the end of the year, we must try to\nreach agreement at the sixth Conference of the Parties\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change to bring into effect the Kyoto\nmeasures to stabilize climate change.\nEach of these is an important challenge. Each of\nthem is a strategic priority for our work programme for\nthe coming year. This morning, though, I wish to focus\nmy remarks on the central theme of the Millennium\nSummit and of this fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly.\nHow do we equip the United Nations with the\ncapacity in peacekeeping that matches the real\ndemands for it around our world?\nIn his opening address, the Secretary-General\ninvited us to give a swift response to the Brahimi\nreport on peacekeeping (A/55/305). The United\nKingdom is happy to respond to that invitation by\noffering our support for the report's conclusions and\npledging our commitment to its implementation. The\nreport begins by reminding us that the United Nations\nwas founded, in the words of its Charter, to save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war'. Too\noften, though, we have failed to save those who needed\nour protection from the suffering, the pain and the\nterror of brutal conflict. We must be frank in facing up\nto those failures if we are to learn their lessons. And\nwe must be determined to improve the capacity of this\nOrganization to keep the peace if we are to succeed in\nthe future.\nI want to set out six tasks which we must address\nif we are not to repeat past failures. First, we must\nequip the United Nations with a more effective and\nmore rapid capacity for peacekeeping. In the space of\nabout one year, the number of troops on United Nations\npeacekeeping missions around the globe has trebled.\nThe United Kingdom has forces operating in eight\ndifferent theatres where peacekeeping has been\nauthorized by the United Nations.\n8\n\nBut it is not the new size of our peacekeeping\neffort that demands changes. It is the different\ncharacter of the peacekeeping challenge. It used to be\nthe case that United Nations forces were typically\ndeployed to observe a ceasefire between two States\nboth of which wanted to end the fighting. Today, our\npeacekeepers are typically deployed within States, not\nbetween them, and often where one or more parties to\nthe conflict is not seriously committed to peace. In\nthose circumstances, United Nations peacekeepers need\na robust mandate. As the Brahimi report puts it, where\none side is violating a peace agreement, treating both\nsides equally can amount to complicity with evil.\nUnited Nations peacekeepers who witness violence\nagainst civilians should be presumed to be mandated to\nhalt it.\nBut if those peacekeepers are to act with\ndetermination, then we must equip them with the\ncapacity to do so. The United Nations needs a\nHeadquarters unit capable of rapid deployment within a\nfew weeks, not a few months, of a Security Council\nresolution. And each of us must develop the number of\ntroops who are trained in the principles and practice of\npeacekeeping whom we can commit to the United\nNations. That is why the United Kingdom has proposed\na permanent staff college for United Nations\npeacekeeping. The United Kingdom has offered to host\nsuch a resource for United Nations peacekeeping, if\nthat is welcome to other members of the General\nAssembly.\nThe second task is to be more rapid and more\nimaginative in tackling tension before it results in\nconflict. By definition, any mission to restore peace is\nan admission of failure to prevent conflict. As well as\ncoping with the consequences of conflict, we need to\naddress the root causes of conflict: poverty, bad\ngovernance and the denial of freedom or of minority\nrights. I welcome the Secretary-General's intention to\nsubmit a report on conflict prevention early next year.\nIt will be a natural companion to the Brahimi report. I\nhope it can enable us to develop an early warning\nsystem which will alert us to potential conflict and give\nour agencies the chance to offer help before it becomes\na real conflict.\nToo often, internal conflict is fuelled by the\nexternal demand for the illicit trade in diamonds or the\nevil trade in drugs. Measures to ban conflict diamonds\nfrom international sale or to defeat the drugs barons\nmust be key elements of any comprehensive strategy of\nconflict prevention.\nThe third task is to take tighter control of the\nflows of arms which supply conflict. As an\ninternational community, we have put much effort into\ncontrolling weapons of mass destruction. The good\nprogress we all made at the Review Conference of the\nStates Parties to the Treaty on the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) underlines the\nimportance which each of us attaches to this strategic\nissue. The United Kingdom has ratified the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, has reduced\nby half its planned strategic nuclear warheads, and has\nsupplied greater transparency on our nuclear arsenal.\nYet, over the past decade, the true weapons of\nmass destruction have been small arms, which have\nkilled 5 million people in conflicts around the globe.\nOverwhelmingly, those killed were civilians rather than\nsoldiers. And, overwhelmingly, they were killed in\ncountries which do not manufacture firearms. We must\nmake a success next year of the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in all its Aspects. We need to reach\nagreement to mark firearms at the point of production\nso that they can be traced. The United Kingdom would\nsupport at that conference the presumption that military\nfirearms should not be licensed for sale other than to\nlegitimate Government bodies. And we must seek the\nhelp of the international economic agencies, including\nthe World Bank, to fund and to reward with\ndevelopment aid the surrender of firearms.\nThe fourth task is to provide the United Nations\nwith the civilian resources to promote reconciliation\nand reconstruction. In Kosovo, and again now in East\nTimor, we have learned that the end of conflict is only\nthe starting point. When the troops have brought peace,\nwe need judges and administrators to bring justice and\ndevelopment. The peacekeepers must be followed by\npeace-builders. In particular, we need to muster the\ncivilian police who can establish law and order in place\nof violence and conflict. I was astonished to read in the\nBrahimi report that this mighty international\norganization has only nine civilian police on its\nHeadquarters staff, administering 8,600 civilian police\nin the field around the world. I am confident that every\none of them is the very best, in keeping with the\ntradition of United Nations staff. But if we are serious\nabout succeeding on the ground, we need a more\nserious back-up at the centre. Four times in the past\n9\n\ndecade, the United Nations has been called upon to\nundertake a transitional civilian administration. We\nneed a better, permanent, capacity here at the centre to\nsupport our operations in the field.\nThe fifth task is to enforce the international law\non crimes against humanity. If we are to have\ninternational justice, we must have an international\ncourt. The United Kingdom has given strong support to\nthe International Criminal Court, and we have just\npublished our draft legislation to ratify the treaty\nsetting up such a Court. The International Criminal\nCourt will send a strong warning to any future tyrants\nthat they will be called to account for their crimes\nbefore the bar of international justice. It will be one of\nthe most powerful advances for human rights since we\nagreed 50 years ago to the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\nAnd finally, we must strengthen the authority of\nthe United Nations. In 50 years, there has been no new\npermanent member of the Security Council. The\nSecurity Council needs to represent the world as it is in\nthis century, not the world as it was in the middle of the\nlast century. It needs to be made representative of the\n100 or more countries that have joined as Members\nsince the Security Council was set up. The United\nKingdom supports a doubling of the permanent\nmembership to include Germany, Japan and three\ncountries from each of the continents of Asia, Africa\nand Latin America. We also want more members\namong those who are elected, in order that the Security\nCouncil can be more representative of the General\nAssembly.\nFor seven years, we have been debating this\nquestion. It is becoming an issue of credibility for the\nUnited Nations. How can we pretend to end conflict if\nwe cannot end this disagreement among ourselves? A\nmore representative, modern Security Council would\nspeak with more authority when it challenges those\nwho breach the peace.\nI have been frank about where we must improve\nour capacity for peacekeeping and strengthen our will\nto halt conflict. But we should not underrate the\nimmense achievement of the United Nations. Our\nCharter begins by recalling the untold sorrow to\nmankind inflicted by two world wars. It was a Charter\nwritten by ministers and officials determined to end\nwar between States. And in this they were remarkably\nsuccessful. External aggression between States is now\nunusual.\nBut the benefits have been unevenly shared. The\nindustrialized nations have enjoyed half a century of\npeace. That has provided the security and good order in\nwhich their prosperity has advanced at a rate without\nprecedent in history. Yet, in the same half century,\npeople elsewhere in the globe have lived through\nviolence and conflict which have broken their human\nrights and impoverished their standards of living. It is\nlargely poor countries that now experience the scourge\nof war which our Charter sought to banish.\nThe challenge for the United Nations is to ensure\nthat the peace and security which have been enjoyed by\nmany Member States are shared by all. None of us can\nprevent humanitarian catastrophe by acting alone. But\nthis United Nations can, if we act together.\nThe Brahimi report tells us what we need to do.\nAs an organization, we publish many reports. Nobody\ncould fault the capacity of the United Nations to\nproduce reports. But we are not always as good at\nimplementing them. Let us make sure that the Brahimi\nreport does not gather dust on library shelves but is put\ninto practice before we meet again next year. Let us\nshow the determination and the conviction that the\nright in our Charter to be preserved from war is an\nequal right for the people of all our nations, large and\nsmall, rich and poor."

        "file_text": "First of all, on behalf\nof the Bulgarian delegation, I take this opportunity to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, and the other members\nof the presidency on assuming the particularly\nimportant task of presiding over this important\nmillennium session of the General Assembly and to\nwish you every success in guiding it to a successful\nconclusion.\nLet me start by saying that the Republic of\nBulgaria, as an associated country, aligns itself with the\nstatement delivered on behalf of the European Union.\nThis past year has been marked by a series of\nevents, culminating in the Millennium Summit. From\nthis General Assembly session we expect consensus\ndecisions aimed at a strengthened and more efficient\nUnited Nations, capable of bringing us closer to a\ncommon vision for a better future, rid of the scourge of\nconflict and war, poverty and disease, backwardness\nand under-development, and based on peace and\nsecurity, sustainable development and prosperity in the\ncontext of a dominating tendency towards a more\nglobalized and interdependent world. This truly is a\nformidable task. It cannot be achieved by or for a\nseparate country or region. It requires a broad and\nsustained effort to create a shared future, based upon\nour common humanity in all its diversity, as rightly\npointed out in the Millennium Declaration.\nOn the verge of the new millennium, it would not\nbe an exaggeration to say that humanity has achieved a\nlot. Nowadays we have at our disposal far better and\nefficient means to produce more goods and services, to\nfight diseases and live longer and better lives, to reap\nthe benefits of the new information technologies in all\nspheres of life. But at the same time, we cannot but\nrecognize that humanity is still confronted by\ntremendous challenges. Poverty and misery are still\ndominant over large parts of the world. People in so\nmany places are still exposed to conflict and violence.\nThe world is still threatened by weapons of mass\ndestruction. New threats, such as terrorism,\ninternational crime, illicit traffic in narcotics and small\narms, are coming to the fore. Also of particular concern\nare the changes in the world climate and environment,\nwhich are bringing disasters capable of destroying the\nhomes and livelihoods of millions.\nTo cope with these challenges we must act\ntogether. This is the reason why we need a\nstrengthened and effective United Nations, which could\nbe achieved through the shared responsibility and the\ngood political will of all its Member States. The\nMillennium Assembly is giving us the opportunity to\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and the\nfounding principles of the United Nations, to go ahead\nwith reforms and to strengthen its role and\neffectiveness, so as to make it serve us all better in\nmeeting the challenges we are confronted with at the\nbeginning of the new millennium.\n26\n\nBulgaria joins the other Member States in\nsupporting the proposals, contained in the Millennium\nReport of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan\n(A/54/2000) and aimed at the system-wide streamlining\nand strengthening of the Organization and at making it\nmore efficient and responsive to new realities. Of\nparticular importance in this regard is the strengthening\nand revitalization of the principal organs of the United\nNations, in particular the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\nRegarding the reform and the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council, we share the view that this process\nshould result in a more representative, effective and\nlegitimate Security Council, taking into consideration\nboth the increased number of the United Nations\nmembership and the enhanced role and political and\neconomic potential of certain States, like Germany and\nJapan, for example, which could assume the\nresponsibilities of permanent members. In our view, a\nreformed Council should be more transparent, open and\naccessible to the interested non-member States. A fair\nand balanced representation, including the Group of\nEastern European States, whose membership has\ndoubled in the last decade, should definitely be\nsecured. A decision on the enlargement of the Council\nand on its working methods should be supported by the\nbroadest possible consensus, including all the\npermanent members of the Security Council.\nDuring the past year, the international community\ncontinued to be engaged closely with the situation in\nsouth-east Europe. As a country, suffering most\ndirectly the impact of the developments in the region,\nBulgaria is particularly concerned with the situation in\nKosovo. We note that progress in implementing\nresolution 1244 (1999) of the Security Council has\nbeen achieved, particularly with regard to restoring\npeace and stability in the province. At the same time, it\nmust be recognized that in terms of multi-ethnic\ncoexistence the situation is still far from satisfying.\nContinuing ethnic violence is causing serious concern.\nParticularly worrying are the attacks against members\nof the international peacekeeping contingents and\nUnited Nations personnel. The situation requires\nresolute steps on behalf of all community leaders in\nKosovo to reject violence and to promote tolerance and\ncooperation in compliance with the adopted\ndeclarations. We see such an approach as a key\nprerequisite for building up an atmosphere of\nconfidence and ethnic tolerance.\nThe successful preparation and holding of\nmunicipal elections with the participation of all ethnic\nminorities, including refugees and displaced persons, is\nparticularly important for speeding up the political\nprocess in Kosovo and for securing lasting peace and\nstability.\nSince the very beginning of the Kosovo crisis,\nBulgaria has been actively engaged in the overall\nefforts of the international community to settle the\nconflict and ensure lasting peace and stability in the\nregion. As is well known, Bulgaria participates in the\ninternational peacekeeping forces in Kosovo and\nrenders logistical support to the peacekeeping Mission\nin the province. Furthermore, my country has been\nmobilizing significant resources, in accordance with\nour potential, to increase its contribution to\ninternational peace activities.\nIn response to the appeal to increase the size of\nthe United Nations civilian police force in Kosovo,\nBulgaria has increased its contingent to 60 police\nofficers, and is now considering the possibility of\nincreasing that number to 100. Bulgaria has sent an\nengineering platoon to join the international presence\nin the field. Bulgarian companies are engaged in the\nconstruction and assembling of houses to shelter\ndisplaced persons and refugees in Kosovo. Last, but\nnot least, Bulgaria has been supplying low-cost\nelectricity to Kosovo. The overall cost of these\nendeavours has so far reached $6 million.\nWe deem particularly important the involvement\nof all the countries of the region in the process of\nseeking settlement of the outstanding issues through\nthe process of multilateral and bilateral negotiations. In\nthis context, the informal meetings held at the level of\nprime ministers and the meetings of the foreign and\ndefence ministers of the countries neighbouring the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia that are devoted to\ndifferent aspects of cooperation are useful.\nOf particular importance to the post-conflict\nreconstruction of conflict-stricken areas is the\nelaboration and the implementation of a long-term\nstrategy for the economic reconstruction and\ndevelopment of the countries of the region through\ntheir integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic\nstructures. The speedy implementation of the different\nprojects within the framework of the Stability Pact for\nSouth-Eastern Europe could contribute significantly to\nthe economic development and stability of the region.\n27\n\nWe deem infrastructure projects as being  particularly\nimportant in that regard. Such projects will contribute\nto enhancing the transportation and communications\nlinks of the region and connecting them with the rest of\nEurope. Attracting investments and developing trade\nand the participation of companies from the region in\nthe reconstruction process are important as well.\nWe highly appreciate the progress achieved in\nstrengthening cooperation between the countries of the\nregion in such fields as fighting organized crime and\ncorruption, the illicit traffic in narcotics, curbing the\nuncontrolled possession of small arms, and so on. An\nimportant achievement of that cooperation is the\ncreation of a multinational peace force in south-eastern\nEurope, with joint headquarters in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\nWe are confident that the establishment of this force\nwill strengthen the spirit of confidence and cooperation\nin the region of south-eastern Europe.\nAn issue of special relevance to Bulgaria and\nalso, I believe, for other countries of the region, is the\nnegative impact on the national economy of the strict\nimplementation of the economic sanctions imposed\nuntil recently by the Security Council on the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. As is well known, Bulgaria\nstrictly abided by the decisions of the United Nations\nSecurity Council, and as a result suffered economic\nlosses commensurate with the country's foreign debt.\nThose losses still affect our economic development.\nGiven the continued relevance and importance of this\nissue under the present international setting, Bulgaria\nsupports the view that, since the provisions of the\nCharter have equal importance, the issue of assisting\nthird States affected by sanctions has to be taken into\nconsideration together with the imposition of sanctions.\nThe elaboration of a concrete mechanism for that\npurpose is therefore important for the United Nations,\nwhich must find ways and means of alleviating their\nnegative effects, in particular on third States. The\ninternational community as a whole should take care of\nthis. In our view, it is necessary that there be closer and\nmore direct participation in the whole process by all\nthird States that could potentially be adversely affected\nby the imposition of sanctions. We are confident that\nthe discussions on this issue at the present session,\nbased on the decisions already adopted and on the\nreport of the Secretary-General under resolution\n54/107, will result in more concrete decisions to that\nend.\nBulgaria not only supports international efforts to\novercome the crisis in south-eastern Europe, but it also\nfully supports the efforts aimed at resolving conflict\nsituations in Cyprus, the Middle East, the Caucuses,\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world. Bulgaria notes with\nsatisfaction the positive progress in the relations\nbetween South and North Korea.\nIn the context of the new challenges in the field\nof international peace and security, United Nations\npeacekeeping operations continue to be a crucial\nelement in the activities of the United Nations. My\ncountry supports the efforts of the international\ncommunity aimed at ensuring the necessary tools and\nresources required to promote conflict prevention, the\npeaceful resolution of disputes, and post-conflict\npeace-building and reconstruction. We are convinced\nthat the new generation of peacekeeping operations\nshould include in their mandates a proportionate\ncombination of political, military, humanitarian,\nreconstruction and other relevant activities.\nIn this regard, we believe that there are still\nunexploited opportunities to strengthen the cooperation\nof the United Nations and to make its cooperation with\nregional organizations in the field of preventive\ndiplomacy, crisis management and peacekeeping more\neffective on the basis of on their competitive\nadvantages. We share the concern of other Member\nStates over ensuring the United Nations ability to\ndeliver on its mounting array of peacekeeping\ncommitments, and we are committed to work together\nto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in this\nvital area.\nWe fully support the need to reform the United\nNations peacekeeping scale of assessments. I would\nlike to point out, as a clear demonstration of this fact,\nthat the Government of Bulgaria has decided to assume\nan additional financial commitment by increasing its\ncontribution to peacekeeping operations.\nAn issue closely linked to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is the fight against\nterrorism and international crime. Bulgaria attaches\nparamount importance to the efforts of the world\ncommunity in the fight against terrorism. We condemn\nall terrorist acts and lament the loss of life and the\ndestruction inflicted by such acts. We share the view\nthat the threat of terrorism is assuming a magnitude\nthat requires a decisive and joint response by the whole\ninternational community. Bulgaria supports the\n28\n\nactivities of the United Nations aimed at setting norms\nand standards for the fight against terrorism and\ninternational crime through the negotiation of various\nlegal instruments and by creating appropriate\ninstitutions for that purpose.\nWe consider that the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court is a significant\nachievement in that regard. I would like to reiterate my\ncountry's strong commitment to the fight against the\nmost serious kinds of international crime in all their\nforms. That commitment is a consistent part of\nBulgarian policy. We are confident that the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court will\nbe an efficient step by the international community\ntowards deterring the potential perpetrators from\ncommitting such acts.\nTogether with peacemaking and the building of a\nmore secure world, the broadening of the human aspect\nof development through democracy and participation\nhas been widely accepted and has become one of the\npriorities of the activities of the United Nations. The\nprinciple of the indivisibility of the universally\nrecognized civil, political, economic, social and\ncultural rights continues to be a key element of today's\nsystem of promotion and protection of human rights\nand freedoms. Bulgaria is confident that the activities\nof international forums in the field of human rights\nshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universal\nenjoyment of those rights on a global scale.\nThe principle of the indivisibility of universally\nrecognized civil, political, economic, social and\ncultural rights continues to be a key element in today's\nsystem of promotion and protection of human rights\nand freedoms. Bulgaria is convinced that the activities\nof international forums in the field of human rights\nshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universal\nenjoyment of those rights on a global scale. In this\nrespect, the monitoring and effective control of the\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms remain of crucial importance. Guided by this\nunderstanding, Bulgaria is now party to all universal\nhuman rights instruments that have established specific\nmonitoring bodies and has recognized their competence\nto consider communications from individuals.\nIn our view, the relevant experiences of some\nregional organizations with competence in the human\nrights field also could be taken into consideration. We\nshare the view that a more effective coordination and\nexchange of information and even joint efforts are\nneeded between the United Nations and regional\norganizations such as the Council of Europe and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE).\nA better implementation of international\nstandards could be achieved by improving existing\nmechanisms and by constructive and open dialogue on\nthe most sensitive issues, including those related to\nhuman rights in individual States. Accordingly, the\nBulgarian Government attaches great importance to the\nenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living\nabroad and considers respect for their rights as an\nessential element in the enhancement of relations.\nEnhanced socio-economic development is another\nimportant factor for securing stability and peace in the\nworld. The achievements registered in this field should\nbe recognized and encouraged. The review process,\nbased on the relevant ideas contained in the millennium\nreport of the Secretary-General, must result in the\nstrengthening of the coordinating role of the Economic\nand Social Council and of the entire machinery of this\nOrganization. Of particular relevance in this regard are\nthe steps aimed at the practical realization of the\nfollow-up measures to the major international\nconferences.\nBulgaria attaches major importance to the role of\nthe United Nations in the field of sustainable\ndevelopment and is following closely the United\nNations dialogue and the activities of the respective\nUnited Nations bodies and agencies on issues related to\ndemographics, social development, women, the fight\nagainst diseases and drugs, and so on.\nBulgaria is cooperating actively with the United\nNations system of specialized agencies and\nprogrammes. We are interested in further developing\nthis cooperation. We are looking forward to more\ndynamic and streamlined activities, especially through\nthe use of the potential of United Nations Development\nProgramme for capacity-building and assistance in the\ndevelopment and implementation of joint projects. In\nthis regard, the system of resident coordinators and the\nefforts to make that system more operational will\nundoubtedly play an important role.\nBulgaria shares the concern of the international\ncommunity regarding the spread of diseases, in\nparticular the AIDS virus. We support the activities of\nthe United Nations in this field, and we join our efforts\n29\n\nto those of Governments, non-governmental\norganizations, and academic and research institutions\nin the fight against this dangerous disease.\nDevelopment and economic growth are\nimpossible without full participation in global\neconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion, the\nUnited Nations and its institutions could play a more\nactive role with regard to the specific problems related\nto economic transition and reforms.\nDisarmament issues continue to play an important\nrole in overall efforts to secure a better world for future\ngenerations. The Bulgarian Government attaches high\npriority to international efforts to strengthen the\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. We call for an early\nentry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty as an important step in that direction and\nsupport the decision of the Conference on\nDisarmament to establish an ad hoc committee to\nconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.\nWe favour the strengthening of the Biological and\nToxin Weapons Convention and believe that a further\nacceleration of the negotiations and an early conclusion\nof the protocol to the Convention is required.\nAs a State party to the Chemical Weapons\nConvention, Bulgaria would like to contribute to\nincreasing the number of accessions to the Convention\nin order to achieve recognition of the prohibition of\nchemical weapons as a universal norm of international\nlaw. As a concrete effort to this end, we are hosting a\nregional seminar of the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons in Sofia from 28 to\n30 September of this year.\nWith regard to conventional arms, anti-personnel\nlandmines are widely recognized as a terrible weapon,\nwhich kills and maims hundreds of thousands of people\nworldwide. Convinced of the need for a total\nprohibition of anti-personnel mines, on 29 July 1999\nthe Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Ottawa\nConvention, thus contributing to its early entry into\nforce.\nWe are also ready to contribute to the efforts of\nthe international community to reduce conventional\nweapons, including small arms, especially their\nexcessive and destabilizing accumulation in areas of\nconflict. We regard universal participation in the\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms as an\nimportant step towards effective transparency, on both\na regional and a global scale.\nFor Bulgaria this past year has been a period of\ncontinued intensive efforts by the Government to build\non the economic stabilization that has been achieved\nand to move forward with structural reforms,\nmodernizing State administration, enforcing the rule of\nlaw in civil society and creating favourable conditions\nfor sustainable economic growth. The steps and\ninitiatives that have been undertaken in compliance\nwith the Government programme 'Bulgaria  2001'\nare directed at moving ahead with the integration of\nBulgaria into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\nBeing an integral part of Europe, Bulgaria regards\naccelerated accession to the European Union and full\nmembership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) as an expression of our sovereign political\nchoice based on broad public support. Since Bulgaria is\nendeavouring to promote and enhance the values of\ndemocracy, we are sincerely interested in seeing these\nvalues become widely accepted throughout South-\neastern Europe. The Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its\ninclusion in the process of enlargement of the European\nUnion, together with other associated countries from\nCentral and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus. The\nBulgarian Government is fully aware that our accession\nendeavours are contingent on the success of domestic\neconomic and legislative reforms.\nThe Bulgarian Government has developed a\nclear-cut national strategy to meet the criteria for\nNATO membership, based on a comprehensive national\nprogramme of preparation, which is being updated and\noptimized. Bulgaria has the political will and is\nundertaking concrete steps to translate and fulfil in\nregional terms the objectives of the Euro-Atlantic\nPartnership Council and the enhanced Partnership for\nPeace. Our positive attitude is reflected in the ongoing\nregional political dialogue and the practical follow-up\nmeasures to enhance regional security and defence\ncooperation in South-eastern Europe.\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to declare\nmy country's readiness to cooperate actively with all\nMember States for the successful implementation of\nthe lofty goals which we have before us at the present\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\ndiscussions on important agenda items will be\ntranslated into practical measures."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea, I should like first of all to congratulate\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I believe\nthat the present session will produce the desired results\nunder his leadership. I pay tribute to his predecessor\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who made a great contribution\nto the successful conclusion of the fifty-fourth session.\nI wish also to express our great appreciation for the\nefforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations.\nThe central role of the United Nations in the new\ncentury should be to establish international relations\nand order to make the new century independent,\npeaceful and prosperous. No country can either defend\nits national dignity or achieve social and economic\ndevelopment when its national sovereignty is violated.\n26\n\nThis is the lesson for mankind on the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt is the common aspiration of the world's peoples\nthat the twenty-first century should be a century of\nindependence, peace and development. Genuine peace\nand prosperity on our planet can be achieved only\nwhen the sovereignty of all countries is respected.\nWe regard independence as our life and soul. The\nidea of independence runs through all domestic and\nforeign policies and lines of the Government of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea. This is the\nbrilliant embodiment of the independent policy of the\ngreat leader General Kim Jong Il. The reality\nprevailing on the Korean peninsula clearly testifies to\nthe justness of the independent policies consistently\ncarried out by the Government of the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea.\nWithout independence, it is unthinkable that our\ncountry could overcome the manifold difficulties and\nadvance the building of a powerful nation convincingly\nalong the road chosen by its people.\nThe independent foreign policy of the\nGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea makes a tangible contribution to peace and\nstability in North-East Asia. It can be said that it is\nentirely because of our firm adherence to independence\nthat our country has been able to play a buffer-zone\nrole effectively in the intersection of the divergent\ngeopolitical interests of several countries. We take\npride in the independent foreign policy of our\nGovernment, as it contributes to maintaining the\nbalance of power and preventing a war in North-East\nAsia.\nThe independent policy of the Government of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea also gives full\nplay to its vitality in advancing the cause of peace and\nreunification on the Korean peninsula. The General\nAssembly at its twenty-eighth session in 1973\nunanimously welcomed the three principles of\nindependence, peaceful reunification and great national\nunity which had been agreed upon by the north and the\nsouth of the Korean peninsula. These three principles\nof national reunification are the grand programme of\nreunification put forward by President Kim Il Sung, the\ngreat leader of our people, and constitute the most\nessential component of the three-point charter for\nnational reunification defined by the respected General\nKim Jong Il.\nAt the historic Pyongyang meeting in June this\nyear, the leaders of the North and the South reaffirmed\nthese three principles of national reunification, and on\nthis basis the North-South joint declaration on solving\nthe reunification question independently by the\nconcerted efforts of our nation was made public. The\nsummit meeting and the resulting joint declaration\nrepresent a historic milestone, marking a turning-point\nin achieving the cause of independent reunification of\nour nation.\nAmidst the increased spirit of national\nindependence and reunification, North-South\nministerial talks for reconciliation and collaboration\nare being held and the reunions of separated families\nrealized. Mutual visits between the North and the South\nthrough, inter alia, direct flights between Pyongyang\nand Seoul are now commonplace, and a project is\nunderway to re-link the railways between the North and\nthe South of Korea.\nThis is the brilliant fruition of our independent\npolicy and the result of a warm love for the nation and\nstrong desire for reunification. It is none other than the\nKorean nation that is responsible for Korea's\nreunification question. Korea's reunification should be\nachieved independently by the concerted efforts of the\nKoreans in the North and the South, as stated in the\nNorth-South joint declaration. Reunification will come\nabout if both sides take realistic and practical measures\nfor establishing a reunified State by making the most of\ncommon elements of the federation and the\nconfederation proposed by the North and the South\nrespectively.\nThe independent reunification of our nation will\nsurely lead to a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula,\nand we believe that this will in turn contribute to peace\nand security in Asia and the rest of the world.\nThe turning point created on the Korean\npeninsula is a positive development of global\nsignificance. We consider that the present trend\ntowards the improvement of North-South relations and\nreunification is a process that should be valued for the\nsake of peace and security in North-East Asia as well.\nIf this process is to continue to gain momentum, the\ncountries concerned should work in support of the\nprocess, rather than disturbing it.\nThe United States has created our non-existent\n\u201cmissile threat\u201d in order to justify the establishment of\nits \u201ctheatre missile defense\u201d and \u201cnational missile\n27\n\ndefense\u201d systems. Nevertheless, it gives rise to\nworldwide concern about its danger.\nOur missile programme is of a peaceful nature,\nfor all intents and purposes. All countries have an equal\nsovereign right, recognized by the United Nations, to\nconduct research on and make use of the outer space. It\nis therefore totally unfair for the United States to take\nissue only with our rockets while many other countries\nare launching their own space rockets. If hostile\nrelations are removed and confidence is built between\nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States, there will be ways to address the\nconcerns on both sides.\nThe recent incident that prevented the President\nof the Presidium of our Supreme People's Assembly\nfrom attending the Millennium Summit is, after all, the\nmanifestation of the continued hostile policy pursued\nby the United States against the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, in labelling our country a\n\u201cterrorism-sponsoring nation\u201d. In this regard, we note\nthat the United States has recognized its responsibility\nfor the incident and given assurances that such\nincidents would not occur again. We also note the\nrecently stated United States position that it has no\nreason to perpetuate its hostile relations with our\ncountry. If this position is put into practice, we will be\nready to respond in a positive way at any time.\nAnother factor that casts a shadow on positive\ndevelopment on the Korean peninsula is the suspicious\nfuture of Japan. Whether Japan revives its militarist\nspectre or becomes a peace-loving country is a serious\nquestion directly linked to peace and stability in Asia,\nparticularly in its neighbouring Korean peninsula.\nContinued evasion by Japan on settling its past with\nour country is the main factor that makes us suspicious\nof its future orientation. Moreover, such suspicion is\nincreased as we witness Japanese moves to find\npretexts for justifying its rearmament by targeting our\ncountry as its \u201cenemy\u201d.\nShould Japan take the path of militarism, it will\nobviously strain its relations with other Asian countries\nand exert negative effects on the improvement of\nNorth-South relations. We hope Japan will not go in\nthis direction. Japan should find its future in a sincere\nand early settlement of its past. Now that the North-\nSouth joint declaration is being smoothly implemented,\nnew, sound international relations will be established in\nNorth-East Asia once the hostile relations between the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the United\nStates, and between the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea and Japan, are resolved.\nIn conformity with this encouraging process, the\nUnited Nations should also take practical measures to\ndismantle the \u201cUnited Nations Command\u201d, a legacy of\nthe cold war, thus making a due contribution to this\nprocess.\nIn order to establish fair international relations\nand an international order that will properly represent\nthe new century, it is important to successfully\novercome the challenges to the United Nations Charter.\nThe most serious challenge posed in international\nrelations at present is the emergence of the concept of\n\u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d.\nThe United Nations is based on the principle of\nsovereign equality. The Charter enshrines the principles\nof respect for sovereignty and non-interference in\ninternal affairs as a cornerstone of international\nrelations.\nThese are the major principles based on the\nreality in which big and small countries exist in the\nworld. All countries aspire to independence and\nstruggle to defend their national sovereignty.\nEncroachment upon the sovereignty of small countries\nby big Powers in exercise of power politics is an act of\nhigh-handedness, as already judged by the times.\n\u201cHumanitarian intervention\u201d is a dangerous concept\nthat could beautify such acts of high-handedness and\neliminate the essential spirit of the Charter.\nThe international relations of the new century\nshould serve to terminate arbitrariness and high-\nhandedness, such as threatening sovereign States by\nforce and imposing sanctions on them, and to fully\nimplement the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter. International peace and security\nshould be achieved by strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations, not by arbitrariness, high-handedness\nand intervention by any individual big Power.\nThe role of the United Nations in the field of\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, should\nbe enhanced. Despite an ever-growing desire and\nexpectation by international society for disarmament\nafter the end of the cold war, the disarmament process\nis at a standstill, faced with new challenges. Reality\nrequires that the nuclear disarmament process be turned\ninto a United Nations process, instead of being left to\n28\n\nthe nuclear-weapon States alone. We are of the view\nthat the fourth special session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament should be\nheld as early as possible, taking into due consideration\nthe demand of a large number of countries.\nAnother challenge to be effectively countered by\nthe United Nations in international relations is an\nattempt to politicize the human rights issue. Along with\nthe use of force, the human rights issue constitutes one\nof the two factors straining international relations. This\nis demonstrated in the reality in which United Nations\nmeetings that address human rights issues are often\nconverted into an arena of confrontation, not\ncooperation. In fact, there is no more grave human\nrights violation than abusing the human rights issue for\npolitical purposes. The United Nations should enhance\nits role decisively to ensure that fairness is fully\nobserved, and not acquiesce in the application of\ndouble standards when dealing with human rights\nissues.\nThe twenty-first century should be a century of\ndevelopment. Durable international peace and security\nare inconceivable without the eradication of poverty\nand the solution of social and economic problems. A\nfair international economic order which is conducive to\nsustainable economic development for the developing\ncountries should be established as early as possible. In\nparticular, it is imperative that the United Nations\nfurther the analysis and assessment of the nature and\ndanger of globalization, as well as its impact on the\ndeveloping countries, and take necessary measures. In\nthis regard, we believe that the Declaration and Action\nProgramme adopted at the South Summit held in Cuba\nlast April can serve as an excellent basis for that\npurpose.\nIn order for the United Nations to play a role\ncommensurate with the requirements of the new\ncentury, it should be democratized through reform of\nits structure. The main purpose of United Nations\nreform is to ensure democracy and strict observance of\nthe principles of justice and fairness in all its activities.\nThe General Assembly has now been relatively\ndemocratized, but it does not have sufficient authority.\nIn contrast, the Security Council has authority and\naction capability but falls short of the desired degree of\ndemocracy. In particular, the present structure of the\nSecurity Council leaves a vacuum which allows the\nUnited Nations to be used as a tool of high-handedness,\nfor the Council monopolizes decision-making power on\nsuch critical issues as enforcement action, including the\nuse of force. The twentieth century witnessed such\ncases on several occasions.\nWe hold that the enhancement of the authority of\nthe General Assembly is a prerequisite for ensuring\ndemocracy in United Nations activities. The Assembly\nmust be empowered at least to review the issues of\ninternational peace and security and to approve major\ndecisions and resolutions of the Security Council on\nthese issues.\nIn reforming the Security Council, priority should\nbe given to increasing the number of non-permanent\nseats, thus correcting the present imbalance in regional\nrepresentation. It is also imperative that effective ways\nbe sought to ensure strict observance of the principles\nof justice and fairness in United Nations activities.\nWe consider that one means to this end will be to\nrestore the confidence of the international community\nin the United Nations by redressing those issues\nmishandled in the past by the United Nations, in\ncontradiction to the purposes and principles of its\nCharter, by force of arbitrariness and high-handedness.\nIndependence, peace and friendship are the\nfundamental ideas of the foreign policy of the\nGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea. The Democratic People's Republic will remain\ntrue to this idea and faithfully discharge its obligations\nas a Member State of the United Nations, so that the\nUnited Nations can become a truly effective\norganization that creditably serves the aspirations and\nrequirements of the new century.\n"

        "file_text": "I convey to the\nPresident the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him\nSri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work.\nTo the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and\nadmiration for the masterly manner in which he served\nas President of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United\nNations.\nThe Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope\nthat its dreams and hopes for a better world will never\nfade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The\nPresident of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike\nKumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed,\n24\n\nthrough a message I had the honour to read out to the\nSummit, her hopes and her vision for the future of\nhumanity. Her words were these:\n\u201cPeace among all States and peace among\nall peoples within States so that all, and not only\nsome, may in safety, without fear, in dignity,\nwithout humiliation, in good health, and in\nmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy the\nwonders of life on this miracle we call the planet\nEarth.\u201d (A/55/PV.7)\nTherefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with\nemphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving,\nfor the future, those minimal and most fundamental\ncertainties that the Member States of the United\nNations have been able to establish \u2014 in particular, to\npreserve what was and continues to be the\nOrganization's very foundation: the entity we know as\nthe State. She pointed out that it was in the General\nAssembly that representatives of Governments, of\npeoples and of States gather together under a Charter\nthat assures States of their sovereign equality, their\npolitical independence and their territorial integrity.\nThese are the fundamentals of the United Nations\nsystem.\nAnd this is as it should be. States are the principal\norganizational entities into which the peoples of this\nplanet have gathered. The principal, overall\norganizational edifice of the international community is\nthe inter-States system.\nFor the entity we know as the State, there is no\nsubstitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization.\nIf States are diminished, so will this Organization be\ndiminished.\nThus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka\nthat everything possible be done to protect and\npreserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the\nstability and the well-being of the entity we know as\nthe State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity\nand political independence the Charter gave us its\nassurance.\nBefore proceeding any further I should make it\nclear \u2014 in view of recent statements on the part of\nspeakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with\nwhose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ \u2014\nthat those who assert the necessity of continued\nreaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of\nthe Charter must not be regarded \u2014 I repeat, must not\nbe regarded \u2014 as having in any way diminished their\ncommitment to the importance of universal adherence\nto human rights and all that is required for the dignity\nof the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the\npromotion and protection of the human rights of its\nown people and of all peoples everywhere.\nThere is, however, a substantial body of opinion,\nwithin which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the\nview that the way to proceed in the matter of human\nrights and the dignity of the individual is properly\nthrough continued and close cooperation between all\nStates, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The\nway of multilateralism or globalization, which appear\nexpressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the\nsovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall,\na commendable course. It is not a course whose\nworthiness in practice has as yet been established.\nIndeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the\nsovereignty of States have often had disastrous\nconsequences. With that initial clarification and a\nreminder that human rights are for the observance not\nonly of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall\nproceed with the remainder of my address.\nWe must bear in mind that the entities we know\nas States are national and international corporate\nentities of enormous complexity, differing in so many\nrespects from corporate entities of the private sector\nand, of course, differing as well from those\ninnumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which\nwe refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat\nsimplistically, as civil society.\nIf the management of a developed State with\nmore than adequate resources at its command is a\ncomplex undertaking, how much more complex would\nbe the management of a developing State without such\nresources and such infrastructures? Then there are\nthose developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their\nmulti-ethnic, multireligious societies where the\nlegacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than\none generation to erase.\nAside from the pressures inherent in the very\nnature and history of a State, let us not forget the\nadditional external pressures a State is subject to \u2014\neconomic, social and political, legitimate and\nillegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal \u2014\nthat the age of information and its consequences have\nbrought in their wake. These are external pressures that\nraise troubling uncertainties for many States and for\n25\n\ndeveloping States in particular, that are without the\nblessings of abundant resources and advanced\ninfrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the\nstructures of States and could come close to threatening\ntheir very existence.\nWhere the processes of globalization are\nexploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the\nillegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the\nreport from the Secretariat received by this Assembly\nthree years ago which drew attention to the threat to\nGovernment authority and civil society, to law and\norder and to legitimate economic and political\ninstitutions posed by transnational networks of crime,\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism having\naccess to sophisticated information technologies and\nweaponry.\nOf course, where there is the use of internal\narmed force against a State, as in my country, the\ncomplexities within a State compound themselves\nmany times over; and we know that the use of armed\nforce against a State is the greatest threat of all to its\npreservation and well-being. This is particularly so in\ndemocracies, whose very openness makes them most\nvulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long-\nstanding and unwavering commitment to democratic\nfundamentals.\nPeace among States, the primary purpose of the\nCharter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in\nfact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of\ngenerally observed rules of international law, under and\npursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of\narmed force by one State against another State, except\nin self-defence or as authorized by the Security\nCouncil.\nYet when we turn to peace within States, and the\nuse of armed force against a State internally, we see an\nentirely different, and an often confusing and\nfrustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each\na creature of its own history; the nature of each\ndetermined by its own surroundings. There is no\nsimplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario,\nno easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in\nmany different forms.\nThe relatively clear-cut format of a United\nNations response to inter-State armed conflicts \u2014\nmonitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an\nagreed cessation of hostilities \u2014 seems, for internal\narmed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable.\nThe Charter does not prescribe how this\nOrganization should proceed in cases of internal armed\nconflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2,\nparagraph 7, which says,\n\u201cNothing contained in the present Charter\nshall authorize the United Nations to intervene in\nmatters which are essentially within the domestic\njurisdiction of any State.\u201d\nIn view of the varieties, complexities and\nintricacies of internal armed conflicts, this\nOrganization appears to be without the necessary\nstructure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and\nresources \u2014 and often, it would seem \u2014 without the\nnecessary collective will.\nTo suggest that the United Nations should\nintervene in internal armed conflicts across the\nboard \u2014 a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of\nobvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local\ncircumstances \u2014 is wishful thinking of the most\nsimplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme.\nA proposition of such a nature ignores the\nfundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so\nimpressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of\nState of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his\nsummation of the deliberations of round table four: that\na democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental\nnecessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political\nprocesses, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the\ndemocratically expressed will of the populace of a\nState, which an armed terroristic attack on a\ndemocratic State so obviously constitutes.\nAt a more practical level, where would this\nOrganization \u2014 woefully under-financed for the\nfulfilment of its development objectives, which billions\naround this world expectantly await \u2014 obtain the\nfurther resources for such far-flung interventions in\ninternal domestic crises.\nCharter provisions and United Nations practice\naffirm that a State may act in individual or collective\nself-defence should there be an armed attack across its\nfrontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack,\nthe abilities of most States \u2014 or at least the abilities of\nmost developing States \u2014 to react with equivalent\narmed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the\nlaw of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order,\nare very limited. Traditional police services are\ninadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in\n26\n\nexperience. Few States have ready and affordable\naccess to the necessary information or intelligence.\nFew States are able to maintain military infrastructures\neffective against heavily armed guerrilla-type\nonslaughts and the horrors of terror.\nSuch has been the experience of my country. Sri\nLanka has for many years had within its territory an\narmed conflict that has complicated the lives of the\nentire population of the country. It is a conflict of an\nextraordinary nature. A very small group of armed\nfighters and supporters \u2014 numbering less than 15,000\npersons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to\nviolence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society\nand participatory governance; achieving, through the\npractice of systematic terror, national and international\nnotoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such\nproblems as they may have through dialogue \u2014\ncontinues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion\nagainst the State to fight for the establishment of a\nseparate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our\nterritory.\nA democratic State, because of its openness, its\nlaws, traditions and practices and its commitment to\ntolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the\ndeployment of force against it by any group within its\nboundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State\nanywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere.\nUnless all States, democratic States in particular, agree\nto come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy\nitself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will\nnot survive.\nWhen the security and integrity of one State is\nthreatened by an armed group within it, surely \u2014\nespecially in these contemporary times, with the cold\nwar far behind us \u2014 it behoves all other States to deny\nthat armed group any encouragement, any succour, any\nsafe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist\nactivities in one country, massive funds are raised with\nimpunity in other countries, often through knowing or\nunknowing front organizations or other entities that\nnow proliferate in many forms and in many countries,\nand often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or\ngroups ostensibly concerned with human rights or\nethnic, cultural or social matters.\nThe magnitude of the collection of funds abroad\nfor terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the\nreach of the international networks developed for that\npurpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to\nexceed the receipts of many transnational\nconglomerates \u2014 all free of tax. Revenues come, of\ncourse, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms\nor other merchandise, including the smuggling of\nhumans.\nBut there also exists a far more abundant and\nseemingly limitless reservoir of funds \u2014 namely,\nexpatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the\nwestern media has reported over the past few years\nfrom time to time, collections from expatriates abroad\nfor the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which\nis battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering\nin their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month\nfrom one country; $600,000 a month from another;\n$2.7 million a month from yet another; and large\nadditional funds from expatriates in still other\ncountries.\nIn 1988 an excellent study was published on\nfinancial havens, banking secrecy and money\nlaundering, a study by experts in the field,\ncommissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug\nControl and Crime Prevention. In order to implement\nadequately the provisions of the recently adopted\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by\nUnited Nations bodies on the collection of external\nfunds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion\nagainst a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes\nespecially necessary when the armed group battling a\nState is in blatant violation of the human rights and\nhumanitarian norms and standards \u2014 including those\nrelating to children and to children in armed conflict \u2014\nthat this Organization so correctly and so diligently\nespouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in\nhuman society.\nI proposed such a study at the fourth round table\nof the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was\nendorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of\nAlgeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of\nthe proceedings of our round table. I urge that the\ninternational community give favourable consideration\nto that proposal.\nAs the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled\nby such massive funds from abroad continues within a\nState, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to\nblur, not only among those in civil society, who are\noften uninformed, but even on the part of those in\npositions of international authority, within and outside\n27\n\nthis Organization, who should know better. The\nexistence of the internal armed conflict and the\nresulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of\nhostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention\nto the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal\ngroup that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the\nvictim.\nSuch a blurring of international perceptions in\nsome quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is\ndistressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those,\nsuch as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and\ncontinue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic\nway of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic,\nmultireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we\nwere once so blessed to enjoy.\nI hope that the thoughts that I have expressed\ntoday on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the\naffairs of developing States in the main, will show in\nsome measure why a sympathetic, rather than an\ninquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the\naffairs of States, as in all human relationships.\nAt a more general level, I would like, before I\nmove on from this part of my statement, to refer to two\nother relevant questions: the role of the General\nAssembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the only\nprincipal organ of the United Nations in which all\nMember States are represented, and the only principal\norgan whose terms of reference allow for consideration\nof any matter within the scope of the Charter.\nYet there is the perception among some that the\ncentre of gravity in decision-making on questions of\nmajor policy importance to the Organization appears to\nhave moved away from the General Assembly to an\nextent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly\nwelcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30\nof the Millennium Declaration of the central position of\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations,\nand the commitment of all nations to enable the\nGeneral Assembly to play that role effectively. The\npractical manner in which the General Assembly could\nplay that role will, of course, require very careful\nthought.\nThe ways in which \u201ccivil society\u201d, and the\ninnumerable entities that that expression encompasses,\ncould best contribute to the work of the United\nNations \u2014 in terms of data collection, research and\nanalysis and expertise \u2014 in a manner that does not\nprejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United\nNations, will also require most careful examination.\nSuch contributions should be made in a manner that is\nnot partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but,\nrather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral\nconsultant.\nMoreover, although civil society within a national\ncontext could be, and is, well accommodated in\ndomestic political processes, the manner in which civil\nsociety could be internationally accommodated within\nUnited Nations processes still remains a puzzle.\nAs in all human relationships, so also amongst\nStates: the strong do better than the weak, the rich\nbetter than the poor, the developed better than the\ndeveloping. This is the case most of all when times are\nhard. The marked decline in official development\nassistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the\nrich and the developed to meet their official\ndevelopment assistance pledges, show that for States,\nthere is no general safety net.\nIf there is one message from the Millennium\nSummit, and one that is now coming from this\nMillennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that\nglobalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that\nno panacea for all \u2014 certainly not for the developing\nworld. The benefits of globalization have by-passed\nmuch of the developing world. The poorest among us,\nspanning the continents of Africa, Central America and\nAsia, have experienced increasing marginalization.\nThere is little opportunity for developing countries to\nbe formative in the shaping of the world economy for\nthe future \u2014 in the deliberations that really matter.\nThus, although we are leaving the past century\nand the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their\npassing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by\nthe old, intractable economic and social tragedies that\nhave been with us since the dawn of time: poverty,\nilliteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the\nproblems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and\nthe growth of mega-cities.\nAmong these, poverty alleviation and poverty\nelimination remain for most of us in the developing\nworld the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful\npriority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of\nabundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in\nreal time across billions of television screens\nthroughout the world, undermines the very foundations\n28\n\nnecessary for the growth of humane societies and\nrefined governance.\nThe developing world needs to be accorded an\nadequate formative voice in the formulation of a new\ndevelopment chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus\nwe turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse,\nas it were, to this General Assembly, under whose\nactive supervisory authority there must be a revival of\na comprehensive North-South development dialogue \u2014\na dialogue that seems to be fading away.\nTo tell the countless starving and helpless\nmillions that a free global marketplace will show us the\nway is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough.\nResource deprivation over many generations and\nits debilitating consequences on adequate\ninfrastructural growth has severely damaged the\ncapacity of developing countries to cope with the\nmodern world.\nA new development chapter must provide for the\ncatastrophic negative contingencies, be they \u201cman-\nmade\u201d or otherwise, including such occurrences as the\npresent surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in\na decade that now place crushing burdens on the\nnational economies of developing countries struggling\ndesperately to contend with economic realities. They,\nlike Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil-\nproducing countries, which are certainly not insensitive\nto the plight of the developing world, will find it\npossible in some way to relieve such pressures in the\nvery near future.\nI should also wish at this juncture in my address\nto say a word about the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of\nSouth Asia \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,\nNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka \u2014 a body which is\ndeeply committed to the advancement of the economic\nand social well-being of our peoples, numbering now\nin the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through\nnational endeavour, but through regional and\ninternational cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current\nChair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the\nprogramme of activities laid down at the 1991\nColombo summit as best it can in difficult\ncircumstances. The people of our region are deeply\ncommitted to the goals of SAARC. They continue to\ninteract vigorously on a wide range of professional,\ncultural, educational and social activities,\nnotwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level\npolitical involvement that SAARC has suffered at this\ntime. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be\nlong before our movement is again able to play its full\nrole in the welfare of our peoples.\nI have just returned to New York from the\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children,\norganized so successfully by the Government of\nCanada and held at Winnipeg.\nI cannot conclude my address to the General\nAssembly this year without making at least a brief\nreference to the abominable crimes that are being\ncommitted against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka\nby the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They\nhave been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year-\nold children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri\nLankan Army. Some of these children have been\nprogrammed into suicide bombers. They are forced to\nwear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on\nthem to evade capture. This wretched practice\ncontinues unabated.\nIn 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the\nSecretary-General's Special Representative for\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu,\nvisited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger\nleaders. They assured him that they would not recruit\nany person under the age of 17 and would not send into\nbattle any person below the age of 18. A few months\nago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have\nbeen continuous reports of the recruitment and the use\nof children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they\ngave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant\nanswer to a question by an interviewer, the Special\nRepresentative said this:\n\u201cChildren who become soldiers lose their\ninnocence. Part of the reason why the fighting\ngroups will tend to reach out to children is\nbecause, of course, the adults may become\ndisillusioned, they may be killed off, they may\nrun away, so they reach the children who are less\nable to defend themselves. But there's a more\ncynical reason than that: children, because they\nare innocent, can be moulded into the most\nunquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into\nsuicide commandos, into committing the worst\natrocities. In other situations, it is ideology \u2014\ncome fight for the homeland, come fight for our\nethnic group, come fight for a new society \u2014 that\nmay appeal to families and to children. So there\n29\n\nare many reasons which facilitate the abuse of\nchildren in this way.\u201d\nI thank the Special Representative for having had\nthe courage to speak out on this important issue. To\nremain silent in the face of such criminality is to\nencourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us\nwho care about the children of the world to rally\nagainst the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm\ncynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one\nthat abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the\nrepresentative of the United Nations Children's Fund in\nSri Lanka told journalists \u2014 and I thank him for his\nstatement \u2014 that the situation of children in the areas\nheld by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave\ntheir assurance to the United Nations Special\nRepresentative. Parents have reported that their\nchildren have been recruited. It is a serious problem.\nHe observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of\nTamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people\nthat they have taken measures to prevent children\nbelow 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take\ntheir promises seriously.\nA respected and courageous human rights group\nin Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who\nused to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent\nreport that since last May a fresh child-recruitment\ncampaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers.\nAccording to their report, children as young as 10 years\nare being forcibly conscripted, age being no\nconsideration as long as the child was able to carry a\ngun. In recent days and months the international press\nhas focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in\nSri Lanka.\nA few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its\ninstrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on\nthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol\nhas noted that the Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in\ncombat a war crime in both international and non-\ninternational armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors\nalso accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State\nparties to cooperate in preventing and combating such\ncrimes.\nAccordingly, today, in this General Assembly of\nthe United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to\nratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties\non whose territory the LTTE has offices and front\norganizations to take strong punitive action against\nsuch establishments, and to declare the LTTE a\ncriminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal\nactivity in respect of the use of child soldiers through\nfunds generated on the territories of other State parties,\nwhich are obliged to cooperate in terms of the\nConvention and the Protocol.\nThe Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with\nan impassioned plea to the world to move urgently\nfrom words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands\nof children who are abused, maimed, displaced,\ntraumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if\nanything should stir the conscience of mankind it is\nsurely the plight of these children. Let it not be said\nthat yet again we have failed \u2014 failed to hear and heed\nthe anguished cry of children in distress, children on\nwhom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict,\nunspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on\nthe issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not\nrequired to save them. What is required is the will and\nthe commitment to act of those States which are in a\nposition to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to\nthem. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal\nnow so that when the special session of the General\nAssembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for\nChildren is held here in New York next September, we\nwill be able to adopt practical measures that will finally\nensure that children will be forever protected from the\nravages of war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me\nfirst of all to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on his\nelection as President of the Millennium session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The Polish delegation expresses its\nsatisfaction that the presidency of this session has been\nentrusted to an eminent statesman from Finland, a\ncountry with which we have ties of friendship and\ncooperation based on common values and aspirations.\nHe may count on my delegation's full cooperation in\nthe performance of his important tasks.\n29\n\nMy congratulations also to the Assembly's\noutgoing President, Minister Theo-Ben Guribab, for the\noutstanding commitment and skill he displayed during\nhis presidency.\nOn behalf of Poland, allow me also to welcome to\nthe United Nations the new Member, Tuvalu.\nI should also like to express my appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\noutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated his\nqualities of leadership and good judgement, and in\nparticular for his inspirational report, \u201cWe the peoples:\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury\u201d.\nAlthough the start of the new millennium is still a\nfew months away, a new era actually began a little\nearlier. It was marked by the demise of the world's\nideological polarization into East and West and\ndivision into three worlds, and by the emergence of the\nworld economy. Humankind enters this new era, the\nage of globalization, with the immense opportunity to\nexpand the spheres of freedom and prosperity brought\nby the triumph of democracy and advances in\ntechnology, especially the achievements of the\ninformation revolution.\nBehind us we have left the twentieth century, an\nage of extremes and profound contradictions. It was an\nage of man's triumphs and downfalls, alternating\nsetbacks and advances in the evolution of the\ninternational community. On the one hand, we have\nwitnessed of amazing scientific, technological and\nmaterial progress, the spread of human rights and\ndemocracy and the development of universal\ninternational institutions. On the other hand, it was also\nan age of the most horrendous dramas in contemporary\nhuman history, of the tragedies, atrocities and\ndevastation of two world wars, of the utmost contempt\nfor the human being, and of genocide and blind\nviolence perpetrated by utopias intent on thus building\n\u201cbrave new worlds\u201d. The Polish poet and Nobel\nlaureate in literature in 1980, Czeslaw Milosz, wrote in\nThe Witness of History that the twentieth century's\noriginal contribution to the history of the human race\nwas \u201cthe near disappearance of the concept of values\u201d\nand concluded: \u201cThe extermination camp became the\ncentral fact of the century.\u201d\nNonetheless, the end of this century seems to\nbring more optimism. This is not only the assessment\nof the Foreign Minister of reborn and democratic\nPoland. It is also the personal feeling of a man who,\nhaving been a prisoner of two totalitarian systems, the\nNazi and the Communist \u2014 incidentally, I am, I think,\nthe only Foreign Minister to hold this \u201cdistinction\u201d \u2014\nhas known the sufferings specific to this century, and it\nreflects the hope ingrained in human nature. But as\nwell as destruction and hatred, I have also been, since\nas long ago as the days of the Holocaust, a witness of\nand participant in a struggle for the dignity and the\nrights of the human being and the process of my\ncountry's recovery of independence and arduous\nconstruction of democracy.\nMy history of active participation in transforming\nthe conditions of human existence, in its individual and\ncollective dimension, began in the yard of the\nconcentration camp of Auschwitz. Later, enlistment in\nthe Polish resistance and, in particular, participation in\nassistance for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto.\nNext, the unimaginable inferno of the Warsaw uprising\nin 1944 and the death, as it seemed at the time, of\nWarsaw. Finally, the end of the war. I remember the joy\nand hope with which we greeted the United Nations\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. They gave me strength when I found myself\nhaving to survive the ordeal of years in Communist\njails. From them, too, I drew inspiration on the journey\nthat eventually led me and my political friends to\nGdansk, the city for which our allies were unwilling to\ndie in 1939 and in which the next great turning-point in\nthe history of the past century was launched in 1980.\nIndeed, two weeks ago we celebrated in Poland\nthe twentieth anniversary of the foundation of the\nSolidarity movement, the Polish revolution that was at\nfirst suppressed at gunpoint by the totalitarian regime\nbut that, becoming an emblem of hope, weathered\nrepression and an unfavourable set of international\ncircumstances. The rebirth of Solidarity in 1989 and\nthe Polish Round Table opened the way to historic\nchanges, including the fall of the Berlin Wall and the\ncollapse of the Communist bloc, and in consequence\nset in motion a sweeping transformation of the\ninternational system. Having been involved for over 60\nyears in these processes, as a writer, historian,\nuniversity lecturer and, currently, Foreign Minister, I\nfeel \u2014 if the Assembly will forgive the personal tone\nof this confession \u2014 as if I were a living, physical\nsymbol of humanity's stormy voyage through the\nhistory of the past century.\n30\n\nBut let me also say that the traumatic experiences\nof my nation have made the Poles exceptionally aware\nof the value of peace and any manifestations of good\nthat are lastingly present in international life. Making\nour contribution to the positive culmination of the\ntwentieth century and working towards the\nrevitalization of the message of the United Nations,\nand thereby opening up new prospects for the\nOrganization, we see ourselves as full and active\nmembers of the global family of nations. A further\nsource of the sense of security and confidence that\nfortifies us in this role within the United Nations is that\nwe have become a member of the North Atlantic\nAlliance and are forging ever-closer ties with the\nEuropean Union, which we expect to join in the near\nfuture.\nBolstered by our accomplishments in the past\ndecade, having reclaimed our place on the international\nstage, we are eager to participate together with other\nnations in this generally perceptible shift towards\nvalues. A yearning for a world imbued with moral\nvalues is visible in all civilizations and religions. This\nis especially evident in the waning of the unlawful use\nof force in international life. The recent outbreaks seen\nhere and there are an echo of divisions and conflicts\nthat are fading along with the twentieth century. This\npositive tendency can be observed in Europe, in the\nMiddle East, in North-East Asia and in other parts of\nthe world. Contributing to it is a growing respect for\nhuman rights and appreciation of the economic and\nsocial factors involved in their full achievement.\nAgainst this background, the Polish people hold\nin great esteem the peace mission of John Paul II, the\nPope from Poland \u2014 a Pope whose pontificate, like the\nwhole course of his life, personifies, beacon-like, an\nunwavering adherence to values and, through the\nsymbol of open arms, understanding and reconciliation.\nThe Pope's position not only fills us with pride but is\nalso a model for our international behaviour. The\nbearings guiding our actions, including here in the\nUnited Nations, are tolerance, openness and respect for\nthe dignity and rights of the individual, minorities and\nwhole nations. We are determined to oppose every kind\nof discrimination and prejudice, whether on ethnic,\nnational, religious or social grounds. In this cause,\nPoland is and will continue to be a staunch ally of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe are entering the twenty-first century with the\nimmense potential generated by the newest phase of the\nrevolution in science, technology, mass\ncommunications, the opening up of frontiers, the\ndevelopment of inter-societal ties and the\nuniversalization of democracy and human rights. Most\nof these phenomena are encompassed by the common\nterm \u201cglobalization\u201d. For a number of years,\nassessment of their consequences has, especially in the\nwake of regional financial crises, been growing\nincreasingly contentious. Sometimes they are treated as\na force of nature sweeping all before them, as morally\nneutral processes that can do good or harm and that\neventually will bring prosperity to all peoples or be a\nsource of crises, inequality and instability within\nnations and on an international scale.\nGlobalization has unquestionably beneficial\neffects in the sphere of trade, production, the spread of\nmodern technologies and capital flows. The\nliberalization of international trade, the growth of\nworld output and the prosperity of societies should\nbring a more equitable sharing of the benefits of\nglobalization. At the same time, there are looming\ndangers, harmful side-effects and new problems whose\nscale and nature we are not yet capable of identifying\ncorrectly. The challenge facing us is to work together\nto steer these processes in such a way that it is their\nblessings that are mainly felt by humanity, and that\nthey are prevented from creating new divides in the\nworld. We must do everything in our power, including\nhere at the United Nations, to ensure that these\nprocesses mean the globalization of good.\nFaced with the opportunities, but also the threats,\npresented by the evolution of human civilization at the\nthreshold of the third millennium, the international\ncommunity needs to organize around a question of\nbasic importance to the direction of its future\ndevelopment. That was the purpose of the Government\nof Poland when it decided, together with the\nGovernments of Chile, India, the Republic of Korea,\nMali, the United States and the Czech Republic, to\ninitiate broader international collaboration in the cause\nof consolidation and promotion of democracy in the\nworld.\nIn this gathering there is no need to argue the\nvirtues of democracy. No one disputes the positive\ninterrelationship between democracy and human rights,\ninternal and international peace, economic growth and\nprosperity and better realization of the principles of\njustice and solidarity. At the same time, we cannot\nignore the threats to democracy, which are primarily of\n31\n\nan internal nature. They affect countries in the process\nof democratic transition as well as so-called mature\ndemocracies. They cover a wide spectrum, ranging\nfrom poverty and economic underdevelopment, ethnic\nconflicts and organized crime to corruption and the\nexclusion of whole sectors of public life, notably\nfinance and the media, from democratic control, which\nsaps the foundations of democracy and demeans it in\nthe eyes of society. Democracy, its condition and\nprospects, can and should be no less a legitimate\nsubject of international debate and cooperation than the\nother great issues of our times: human rights,\ndisarmament, the environment and the like.\nImbued with this belief, we embarked, in\nconjunction with a number of other States, on\norganizing in June of this year an international\nconference, \u201cTowards a Community of Democracies\u201d.\nA total of 107 States accepted our invitation. Speaking\nat the Warsaw conference, Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan said,\n\u201cOne of the greatest challenges to\nhumankind in the new century will be the\nstruggle to make the practice of democracy\nequally universal. In that struggle, nations in\nwhich democracy is already well established will\nneed to be vigilant in preserving that\nachievement\u201d.\nThe participants in the conference adopted the Warsaw\nDeclaration, in which they reaffirmed their\ncommitment to its catalogue of democratic values and\nstandards. They also undertook to pursue informal\ncooperation to strengthen and promote democracy in\nvarious international organizations. For obvious\nreasons, the key question will be what can be done to\nadvance this cause in the framework of and through the\nUnited Nations.\nLet me take this opportunity to recall another\nPolish initiative that also falls within the current of\nresponses to the harmful side effects of globalization\nprocesses. In 1996, at the General Assembly, Poland\nsubmitted a proposal to frame a universal legal\ninstrument, the first of its kind, that could help us\ncombat one of the greatest dangers of our times:\ninternational organized crime. At this session the text\nof that Convention will be presented to the General\nAssembly for its approval.\nThe central issue of successive international\nagendas is security. Though preserving international\npeace and security is the main purpose of the United\nNations, States have also looked to other ways to\nensure their security: through creation of balance-of-\npower systems, arms races and even the use of force.\nToday we are trying to achieve such goals by different\nmeans. Anachronistic doctrines of geopolitics and\nspheres of influence are now fading into history. The\nRoman maxim, \u201cIf you want peace, prepare for war\u201d \u2014\nSi vis pacem para bellum \u2014 is becoming irrelevant.\nNevertheless, the problem of security remains a\npressing one, as the numerous conflicts and\nhumanitarian dramas in various parts of the world\nmake all too clear. In addition to crises and wars\ninherited from the old international order, we are\nplagued by conflicts which spring from poverty, ethnic\nand religious strife or the atrophying of States' ability\nto perform their basic functions: providing the people\nliving within their borders with internal security and\ndecent conditions of existence.\nThis new situation, in which security depends not\nso much on purely military factors as on social\nstability, on observance of human rights and the rights\nof national minorities or on access to drinking water,\nenhances the role of the United Nations, which can\ndraw on unique experience and a wide range of non-\nmilitary instruments for ensuring security. Fuller\ninvolvement by the United Nations in the security\nsphere as provided in the mandate deriving from its\nCharter requires determined continuation of reform of\nthe Organization in this field, starting with a practical\nredefinition of the role of the Security Council that\nwould extend its purview to non-traditional threats to\ninternational security.\nThe Security Council must do what, in\naccordance with the Charter, is expected of it by\nMembers and respond more decisively to signs of\nbudding conflicts or humanitarian disasters. The\nKosovo drama, like many others, could have been\navoided if Security Council members had displayed\nsufficient imagination and resolve at the right time.\nThat would also have enabled us to avoid last year's\narguments and controversies over the issue of\nhumanitarian intervention. The inability of the Security\nCouncil to respond robustly in such situations will\nopen the way to further precedents for sidestepping the\nCharter and United Nations mechanisms in the security\nsphere and could thereby lead to disintegration of this\nsystem.\n32\n\nThe success and effectiveness of the proposals\nand recommendations contained in the Secretary-\nGeneral's Millennium report will depend on the\ndetermination of the Security Council as the system's\nlynch-pin. Poland endorses the report's perspective on\ninternational problems and approach to tackling them.\nWe are in favour of stronger legal instruments for\nstabilizing the international order; this refers to\nsituations involving threats to security and use of force,\nto respect for human rights and to arms control and\nlimitation. In all these areas we must preserve the\nprimacy of the United Nations system over regional or\nunilateral measures, which are acceptable only in the\nexceptional circumstances in which the Security\nCouncil and United Nations mechanisms are found\nwanting.\nIn this context I should also like to pay tribute to\nthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations.\nAs a long-standing and very active participant in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, Poland is in\nfavour of streamlining the machinery for conducting\nthem \u2014 from decision-making to presence in the\nfield \u2014 and ensuring their greater effectiveness by\nwidening and making more adequate the array of\ninstruments with which such operations are equipped.\nThis means both the possibility of the use of force by\nthe units deployed in an operation and a wide spectrum\nof peace-building and post-conflict rehabilitation\ncapabilities. I refer also to action aimed at advancing\nhuman rights and laying the groundwork for democracy\nin the institutional and civil society sphere. In our\nview, in further work on the recommendations of the\nreport, greater emphasis should be put on the question\nof cooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations, an area in which lie many\nhitherto untapped opportunities, as well on as a more\ncreative approach to conflict prevention.\nWe no longer seek foundations for a future\ninternational order in military capacities, but to an ever\ngreater degree we are trying to build it on fair and\nrespected laws. The maxim Si vis pacem para iustitiam\nwhich adorns the facade of the Palace of Justice in The\nHague no longer has quite the idealistic ring that it had\nseveral decades ago. But we are also aware that though\nadministering justice through law is an indispensable\ncondition of peace, it is not yet a sufficient condition.\nOur times, in which conflicts and instability are often a\nresult of poverty and underdevelopment, require the\napplication of a new maxim, a contemporary\nparaphrase of the old ones: Si vis pacem para\nsolidaritatem.\nHere, we are entering the domain of the\ninternational economic order, in particular its financial\nand trade dimensions. This is a sphere in which the\nUnited Nations system must be much more active than\nhitherto or run the risk of being sidelined by the new\nand powerful non-State actors in international life. The\nrecently fashionable, if ill-defined, formula of global\ngovernance should at the practical level be developed\nin the United Nations framework or in concert with,\nnot parallel or counter to, the United Nations. First and\nforemost, it is essential to intensify international efforts\nto promote stability and predictability in international\neconomic relations, which includes strengthening the\nnew international financial architecture of a system and\ninstitutions based on transparent rules.\nWhat is also needed \u2014 and this is a point that\nclearly emerges from the reports of the main\ninternational organizations, the Secretary-General's\nreport included \u2014 is a new approach to development.\nOne has to agree with those who maintain that there is\nno greater challenge today than global sustainable\ndevelopment and that United Nations success or failure\nwill be crucial to the outcome of efforts by the\ninternational community.\nOne of the key challenges facing the international\ncommunity as it enters the twenty-first century is\npoverty reduction, especially in the least developed\ncountries. Success in this field requires wide\napplication of the principle of solidarity in\ninternational economic relations. If globalization is to\nbe harnessed to development and poverty reduction,\nmore is needed than just better coordination among the\norganizations active in the socio-economic sphere. It is\nalso necessary to stop perceiving development and\npoverty reduction solely as technical problems. To\nattack them effectively, there has to be a coherent\npolicy that comprises not only financial and technical\nassistance but also substantive measures in the sphere\nof education, culture, good governance, rule of law,\ndemocratic institutions, etc.\nInternational solidarity will not deliver results in\nthe shape of building up the production capacities of\nthe poorest countries and enabling them to reap\nbenefits from globalization processes without serious\nefforts on the part of these countries themselves, in\n33\n\nparticular rational economic policies and the ability to\nmake effective use of development aid.\nPoland is joining in international endeavours to\nfurther effective management of international\ninterdependence, with an appropriate role played by the\nUnited Nations system and a key role by international\nfinancial institutions in the organization of\ninternational economic and financial cooperation. In\nthe framework of a poverty reduction strategy, we are\nparticipating in the implementation of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Poland also\nsupports the European Union proposal that World\nTrade Organization (WTO) members, including in the\nfirst place the industrialized countries, should within a\nyear of the conclusion of a new trade round abolish\nimport tariffs and quotas on basically all exports from\nthe least developed countries.\nIt is precisely in order to stress what we believe\nto be the crucial significance of solidarity in\nmaintaining peace, security and solidarity throughout\nthe world that the Polish Government, mindful of the\nexperiences of our recent history, will \u2014 together with\na few other countries \u2014 propose that the United\nNations proclaim 31 August as \u201cInternational\nSolidarity Day\u201d; it is the date of the establishment of\nthe free and independent Solidarity trade union in\nPoland in 1980.\nThe qualitatively new feature of the situation at\nthe turn of the century is not only the extent but the\ngreater complexity of the tasks facing our\nOrganization. Greater still are the expectations\nassociated with it of individuals, diverse groups,\nnations and the whole international community. It is\nessential that we not only understand the nature of the\nnew problems but also deal more effectively with the\nmatters that have to be tackled by the United Nations,\nwhether or not they form an explicit part of the\nmandate deriving from the Charter. In roles ranging\nfrom preserving peace to human rights, and from\ndevelopment to protection of the natural environment,\nthe United Nations is irreplaceable. It is precisely\nbecause of the nature of threats such as environmental\ndegradation in the contemporary world that a speedy\nand comprehensive response by the United Nations is\nneeded. The sense of \u201cone earth, one human race\u201d\nrequires solidarity-driven and responsible action by all\nthe system's participants.\nThe tasks and expectations associated with the\nUnited Nations require that its role in international\nrelations be strengthened. The system must continue to\nbe the legal and institutional infrastructure of the\ninternational order. No other formula provides\nsufficient legitimization for the performance of this\nrole. The United Nations Charter and Organization are\nindispensable, in the first place, to small and medium-\nsized countries. Marginalization of the United Nations\nwould lead to anarchy, in which the only law would be\nthe will of the great Powers and increasingly powerful\nnon-State actors.\nThe extremely positive trends towards\ninvolvement of non-governmental organizations in\nUnited Nations activities \u2014 a trend steadfastly\nchampioned by Poland \u2014 must remain consonant with\nthe intergovernmental character of the Organization,\nwhose universal mandate stems from the legitimacy of\nthe States which are its Members. Within this system\nwe must, however, be mindful not only of the rights of\nStates but also of their obligations.\nAccountability does not apply only to individuals,\nthough here we are in favour of prompt entry into force\nof the treaty establishing the International Criminal\nCourt. We cannot allow the United Nations to tolerate a\nsituation of non-accountability of States for violations\nof international law.\nThe successes of any organization, its usefulness\nand effectiveness, are not only a matter of the\ndetermination and unanimity of its members. Much\nalso depends on the resources at its disposal, the\nefficiency of its procedures and the competence of the\npeople operating them. In the past, United Nations\nofficers have provided innumerable examples of their\ndedication in pursuing the Organization's activities, of\ntheir commitment to serving the ideals actuating the\nUnited Nations. Better use needs to be made of their\npotential through constant adaptation of the\nOrganization's structures and mechanisms to changing\ntasks. That will also make for much better disposition\nof the Organization's budget.\nIn our drive to rationalize the United Nations\nbudget, our focus should not be on ways of reducing it.\nThe real problem is that there is not enough money to\ndo all the things that everyone expects the Organization\nto be doing. The United Nations budget should be\ntailored to the tasks that we ask it to perform, but also\nmore effectively. We are also aware that the\n34\n\nOrganization's regular budget and its peacekeeping\nbudget should be based on the principle of the ability\nto pay and on realistic economic indicators. Poland is\nprepared to accept any reasonable and fair changes that\nmay be agreed on the future scale of contributions. We\nwill play a constructive part in negotiations on this\nproblem.\n\n"

        "file_text": "The twentieth century\nwas one of great trials and great achievements. The\nnew century will be what we make of it. Whatever has\nbeen won in the name of peace, the hunting season in\nhistory is not quite over. Tension between nations has\nnot disappeared. Ethnic strife, religious extremism,\neconomic inequity and social injustice continue to fuel\nconflict. Agents of terror and transnational criminals\nstrike everywhere.\nDespite the new wealth of nations, 1.2 billion\npeople live on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorest\nAfrican countries do not earn much more than the\nrichest man on earth. And, despite the grinding poverty\nof billions, the world spends $145 per capita on\nmilitary forces. We must do better \u2014 much better \u2014\nthan this.\nOur Organization received the needed impetus at\nlast week's Millennium Summit. That should not be\nsquandered. The fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly must reflect the new global covenant for\npeace and progress. As always, the United Nations\nmust be at the forefront of this great enterprise. We are\nhere to lead.\nThe Philippine delegation sees this Millennium\nAssembly as a bridge to link three divides: those of the\npast and the future; of experience and vision; and of\npromise and fulfilment.\nFifty-five years ago our Organization arose from\nthe ashes of war. Some founding Member States were\nvery young, just recently set free from centuries of\ncolonial rule. All were still preoccupied with tasks of\nrebuilding lives and neighbourhoods shattered by the\nGreat War. The ideological divide was to become\ndeeper and wider. The foundations for the walls and\ncurtains that defined an era were just being laid. For\nthe average person then a truly global community was\nno more than an ideal, remote and all but removed\nfrom the day-to-day lives of mostly rural, agricultural\npopulations.\nNow we are all part of the global village.\nInterdependence is a recognized and accepted fact.\n\u201cGlobalization\u201d is on the lips of everyone, sometimes\nwith scorn, at other times with affection, but always\nwith the discernment that it is the wave of the future.\nAbove all else, that future belongs to all the world's\npeople, to both the affluent and the destitute, to both\nthe strong and the weak. With everyone's direct\ninvolvement in charting and realizing our common\n10\n\ndestiny, we open the door to the fullest flowering of\nhumanity's potential. We also affirm human dignity.\n\u201cWiring\u201d the world's cities into the information\ngrid of the twenty-first century is indeed one wise\ninvestment we should be making today. But if anyone\nwere left out, if the \u201cdigital device\u201d were but to echo\nand perpetuate social injustice on a global scale, we\nwould not have moved far from where we started. The\npast would simply repeat itself.\nTo empower people is to build our bridge to the\nfuture. The world's leaders were therefore on the mark\nwhen they enshrined freedom, equality, solidarity,\ntolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility\nas the fundamental, people-empowering values of the\ntwenty-first century. Now, it is this Assembly's turn to\nemploy those values and take steps to achieve the\nspecific objectives set by the Summit for people\nempowerment.\nLet us buckle down to work and ensure that by\n2015 all children will be able to complete primary\nschooling and, beyond that date, that they have the\nopportunities to pursue higher levels of education. For\nlet us face it, education is the best tool for protecting\nhuman rights, promoting democracy and advancing\ngood governance.\nBut because a sound mind will work better in a\nsound body, let us win the battle against disease,\nincluding HIV/AIDS, which lays to waste millions in\nthe world's poorest regions. Let us take action to\ndrastically reduce maternal and under-five child\nmortality from their horrendous current rates and to\nachieve the lofty goals of the \u201cCities Without Slums\u201d\ninitiative.\nLet us invest in humanity. Let us launch in this\nAssembly nothing short of a Marshall Plan for the\nworld's people. Let us build this human bridge to our\nfuture, now.\nThe United Nations has both the experience and\nthe vision needed for success. Our Organization has\nboth the privilege and the duty to lead our world into\nthe future with confidence. We know how to do it.\nTo sustain the United Nations capacity to carry\nout its tasks, deep institutional reforms must now take\nplace. A more energetic and financially stable world\nOrganization, led by a proactive General Assembly and\nstrengthened by a truly representative and transparent\nSecurity Council, must now emerge.\nFor the new covenant on peace to prosper, the\nUnited Nations must remain, without equivocation or\ndoubt, the first and last peacemaker and peacekeeper of\nthe world. It should also be the vanguard that\nchampions the rule of law in international as well as in\ninternal affairs.\nPreventive diplomacy must be our principal tool\nin warding off conflict. We must reduce the use of\nforce. But where we need to use it, as in self-defence or\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, we\nshould be guided by international legal norms and\npractice.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should\nbe prosecuted with clear and well-defined mandates,\nadequate resources and strong international support\nwherever they take place. The report of the Brahimi\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations deserves our\nurgent and careful consideration.\nMore than ever, the United Nations must now\ngather together the political will of all nations to bring\nabout the final stage of disarmament and the much-\nawaited arrival of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nTowards this end, we must support the Secretary-\nGeneral's call to convene a conference on nuclear\ndangers, actively participate in the 2001 small arms\nconference, negotiate a comprehensive convention\nagainst terrorism and progressively improve weapons\nand arms budget transparency measures.\nThe central role of the United Nations does not\nand should not stop at matters of international peace\nand security. It should also be at the heart of our efforts\nto promote prosperity for all. It should lead the charge\nagainst poverty and the efforts to halve, by 2015, the\nproportion of people whose income is less than one\ndollar a day.\nAlong with the Bretton Woods institutions and\nother multilateral organizations and fora, the United\nNations is well placed to make important contributions\nto the reform of global economic and financial systems.\nFor our goal is not only to have a borderless world for\nunfettered trade and investment. We should found a\nglobal economic regime that builds productive\ncapacities, not income gaps; that promotes openness,\nnot corruption; that rewards enterprise, not greed.\nIn all these, partnerships with the private sector\nand with civil society are indispensable. Every man,\nwomen and child is our co-stakeholder and partner. For\n\n\nwhat we are trying to build is a new global order where\nhuman security goes beyond mere military security;\nwhere law upholds human dignity and both people and\nState uphold the law; and where political pluralism and\ncultural diversity are requisite to the attainment of\ncommon human objectives.\nIn other words, peace and prosperity must rest\nmore on human cooperation than on anything else. For\nin this global village, cooperation is the only tenable\nway to bridge experience and vision.\nThe United Nations Millennium Declaration\nembodies our collective hope: the promise of a true\ncommunity of nations working together for a more\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. We know that\nbetween this promise and its fulfilment lies a tortuous\nroad, yet we must tread its length. In this journey, the\nfirst and most important step we should take is to\nremove the greatest source of danger and discord, that\nis, underdevelopment. For if one is not free of want, he\ncannot be free of fear.\nIn the developing world, the toll from decades of\nturmoil and abject underdevelopment has been so\ndebilitating that only international relief can help some\nof us back to our feet. Many of us may cry for safety\nnets. But not even fish welcome life inside a net. What\nwe need is a new deal for the poor countries.\nDevelopment is particularly difficult for countries\nsaddled by mountains of crippling debt. Some 1.6\ntrillion dollars is now owed by developing countries,\nseveral of which have to use up to 95 per cent of their\nhard currency revenues to service debt. In the\nmeantime, development assistance is declining. This\nyear, grants to developing countries may total 40\nbillion US dollars \u2014 a mere half of what it was a\nquarter century ago.\nAs earnest for our collective future, we should\nhave meaningful debt relief for the world's heavily\nindebted poor countries immediately. Let us also see\nthe fulfilment of the promises of overseas development\nassistance (ODA) made three decades ago. Further\nsteps must be taken at the third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries next\nyear. We must ensure its success to help our brothers\nand sisters in Africa, in landlocked developing\ncountries, in nations particularly vulnerable to natural\ndisasters and in least developed countries in all regions\nof the world. At this Assembly, we should do our\nutmost to guarantee that all preparations necessary for\nthe success of this conference are made.\nWe must also redeem the pledge of our leaders to\nmake every effort to ensure the success of the high-\nlevel international and intergovernmental event on\nfinancing for development in 2001. By investing this\nevent with the active participation, goodwill and\nexpertise of all stakeholders, including the private\nsector, from the preparatory stages to the plan's\nimplementation, we may yet achieve what several\nUnited Nations Development Decades have not.\nThe world's people took heart from the boldness\nof spirit and resolve our leaders expressed in the\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration. They were\nreassured that we intend to take the world into the\nfuture as partners and not as adversaries. They wished\nfor clear direction from our leaders, and they received\nit. Now, they look to us in this Millennium Assembly\nfor concrete action. Let us rise to the challenge and\nbuild the bridges to peace and prosperity for all the\nunited nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like first of all, on my own behalf and that of\nthe Algerian delegation, to convey to Mr. Holkeri\nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession. I wish him every success in discharging his\nnoble duties. The choice of Mr. Holkeri as President is\na tribute to his personal qualities and to the experience\nof his country, Finland, with which we enjoy a firm\nfriendship.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\nconvey to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the\nForeign Minister of Namibia, our deep appreciation\nand gratitude for the great effort he made during his\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession.\nFinally, I should like to salute the spirit of\ninitiative and commitment shown by our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, the head of the Secretariat,\nand commend his sincere and tireless work to reform\nthe Organization and to give it a new dynamism so as\nto prepare it to meet the challenge of the enormous\nchanges in international relations.\nI should also like to welcome the State of Tuvalu\nas a new Member of our Organization.\nJust a few days ago, the United Nations hosted a\npolitical event that was without precedent since the\nOrganization was created: the Millennium Summit.\nBecause of a host of fast-paced developments that\noccurred in international relations, we, the peoples of\nthe United Nations, must take time at this juncture of\nhistory to organize a dialogue to discuss the shape of\nthe new emerging world order and the effects on us, the\npeoples, the States and the United Nations, the\nrepository of our collective hopes and aspirations.\nThe world has changed in a very short time from\na system with clearly defined parameters to a system\nwhere political and economic reference points are\nsorely lacking. It is a system defined by nebulous\nphenomena, which evolve according to rules set by\nforces that refuse, in the name of globalization, to\naccept any form of guidance or collective democratic\noversight. It is no surprise that globalization is\nincreasing the suspicions and fears of the developing\ncountries vis-\u00e0-vis the evolving new world order. The\ncurrent state of international relations, marked by\ninjustice and imbalance, will inevitably get worse\nbecause of the unbridled process of globalization.\nIt is because of this that the Millennium Summit\nforcefully proclaimed the need to reinvigorate the\nUnited Nations and to galvanize its role, since it is the\n18\n\nrefuge of the weak and the marginalized. The massive\npresence of the leaders of the whole world at the\nSummit was irrefutable proof of the commitment of the\npeoples and nations of the world to the United Nations\nand to the principles and purposes it embodies. The\nUnited Nations is the only forum built on the ideals and\nreference points shared by mankind as a whole, marked\nby universality and globality in its missions and\nprerogatives.\nCertainly the United Nations is facing today new\nchallenges caused by rapid, profound and sometimes\nsurprising changes in international affairs. No one\ndenies the fact that it needs to be radically reformed in\norder to prepare it and adapt it effectively to meet\ncurrent and future challenges and to manage and\nredress the contradictions of international relations.\nSecurity Council reform and expansion of its\nmembership are urgent matters, because this important\nbody clearly lacks the necessary representativity to\ngive legitimacy and efficiency to its decisions and\nactions.\nLikewise, consolidation of democracy and\ninternational relations, if it is to be truly meaningful,\nmust involve the enhancement of the General\nAssembly and the establishment of its role as the\nprincipal source of international law, as well as\noversight over the three principal organs, in keeping\nwith the United Nations Charter. Accordingly,\nmarginalization of the Assembly, when it comes to\nmajor questions such as the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, does not in any way\nallow the overwhelming majority of nations to\ncontribute to the decision-making process in\ninternational affairs.\nOpening the United Nations to the outside world\nis a necessity dictated by changes in the international\ncommunity and the demands of our times. By involving\ncivil society in its work, the United Nations will\nbenefit from the considerable contribution that non-\ngovernmental partners can provide in meeting the\nneeds of countries in matters of development,\nparticularly in the areas of education, health and\nhousing. But this partnership cannot be at the expense\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations,\nnor the independence of its decisions.\nIt is in the context of this vision that we state our\nposition on humanitarian intervention. For us it is a\nquestion not of whether or not it is acceptable to\nintervene in humanitarian disasters, but, rather, of legal\nand political parameters that should govern any\ndecision on this matter. We therefore demand that\nterms of reference be clearly and precisely established,\nthat they should be democratically adopted in a context\nof transparency and that they should effectively reflect\nthe will of the community of nations. They must be\nbased on principles of solidarity and justice, ruling out\nany forms of selectivity, special treatment or double\nstandards.\nExperience has shown that the international\ncommunity has found in the United Nations a\nframework that allows for considerable progress to be\nmade with regard to security and cooperation. In the\narea of disarmament, for example, thanks to the\navailable frameworks for negotiation and dialogue, the\nOrganization has been able to realize considerable\nachievements, such as the signing of many conventions\non weapons of mass destruction and the success of the\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\npresided over by Algeria.\nThe United Nations has also provided a\nframework to coordinate international efforts to deal\nwith new dangers that pose a threat to international\npeace and security, such as terrorism, organized crime,\nand drug and arms trafficking. On the subject of\nterrorism, the international community has embarked\non a process of implementing its strategy to combat\nthis scourge and to prevent it. The United Nations and\nregional groups have adopted legal instruments that\nsupplement international laws dealing with anti-\nterrorist actions. We hope that these achievements will\nbe enhanced by the adoption of a comprehensive\ninternational convention, to be considered a political,\nlegal and moral international covenant, to combat\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nAlgeria is keen that its relations within its\npolitical and geographical spheres be governed by a\nvision of the future that goes beyond short-term\ninteractions or ephemeral motives. In our policy\ntowards the peoples and countries with which we have\nrelations of neighbourliness, geography and common\nheritage, we want to consolidate the principle of\ndialogue and consultation and develop cooperation and\nsolidarity in keeping with the demands of good\nneighbourliness, common destiny, mutual interest,\nmutual trust and non-interference in the internal affairs\nof States.\n19\n\nRegarding the Arab Maghreb region, Algeria's\ncommitment to build a unified, stable and prosperous\nMaghreb is based on our conviction that Maghreb unity\nis a strategic option dictated by the aspirations of the\npeoples of the region and by the current international\nsituation, which encourages integration and the\nformation of blocs. Algeria is prepared today to work\nwith its Maghreb partners to reactivate the process on\nthe basis of an objective thorough analysis of common\nMaghreb action according to a rigorous and pragmatic\nmethodology that seeks to maximize the\ncomplementarities of the countries of the region and\nthat ensures gradual integration, taking into account the\nprinciples of equity and balance of interests.\nIt is on the basis of this vision that Algeria has\nspared no effort to help find a just and lasting solution\nto the problem of Western Sahara. Algeria's support for\nthe United Nations settlement plan is based on our\ncommitment to preserve the security and stability of\nthe region, without, however, rejecting the principle of\nthe right of peoples to self-determination. The\nsettlement plan, which was supported by both sides \u2014\nMorocco and the POLISARIO Front \u2014 and by the\ninternational community, remains the practical,\nrealistic option that will guarantee a just and lasting\nsolution to this issue. Today the settlement plan is at a\ndelicate stage, and the international community, which\nhas already made a considerable effort to implement it,\nmust give it even more attention and more support.\nThanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\nPersonal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, and the cooperation\nof both sides, the United Nations Mission for the\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has\nresolved the difficulties that for so long prevented\nimplementation of the plan. Today, there is no reason to\ndelay or to block the referendum process.\nMy country is convinced of the interdependence\nof the interests of the States and peoples on both shores\nof the Mediterranean Sea. We therefore reaffirm our\ncommitment to the Euro-Mediterranean process, which\nprovides a promising framework for the promotion of\ndialogue and consultation among the countries of the\nregion and opens up great prospects for understanding,\nintercultural exchange and improvement of partnership\nfor the benefit of all peoples.\nThe Middle East region has seen some\ndevelopments this year that have had an important\nimpact on the peace process. The question of Palestine,\nwhich is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict, is at a\ndelicate stage. That means that the international\ncommunity must mobilize even further in order to\nmove the peace talks forward. Algeria reiterates its\nsupport for the Palestinian people and salutes their\nstruggle for recovering their legitimate rights,\nincluding the right to establish their own independent\nState with Al-Quds as its capital.\nAlgeria would also like to reaffirm its support for\nthe fraternal Syrian people and its right to recover the\noccupied Golan.\nWe express our profound satisfaction and pride at\nLebanon's regaining its sovereignty over all its\nterritory.\nAlgeria once again reaffirms the need to lift the\nembargo that has hit the fraternal Iraqi people so hard.\nWe also call for a final lifting of the sanctions\nthat continue to penalize the fraternal peoples of Libya\nand the Sudan.\nAfrica is undergoing profound changes that are\nopening up new vistas for the peoples and countries of\nthat continent. Those changes have been brought about\nby the serious and determined will of Africans to free\nthemselves from the burdens of the past and by their\naspiration to join in the process of change that is\nsweeping our world today. Democracy is gaining\nground daily as the mode of governance for the vast\nmajority of societies in Africa. The State of law and\nrespect for human rights are becoming embedded in\nAfrican societies. That tendency is strikingly reflected\nin the historic decision by the 1999 Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment no longer to recognize any anti-\nconstitutional changes. That was a promising sign for\nthe establishment of a democratic culture in Africa.\nAt the economic level, African countries have\nwasted no time in joining the world trend towards a\nmarket economy and in creating the necessary\nconditions to promote free trade and investment.\nWith regard to the conflicts that have devastated\nthe continent and continue to cause humanitarian\ndisasters and to tarnish Africa's prestige, the\ncontinent's leaders are now using preventive diplomacy\nand their own skills in mediating and settling conflict.\nAlong the same lines, the OAU's Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution is\nbeing reinforced as the authority of reference to\nprovide a framework for dialogue and conflict\n20\n\nprevention. As a result of those efforts, we see signs of\neasing in various conflicts in some parts of Africa.\nThrough its chairmanship of the OAU last year, my\ncountry made great efforts to resolve some of those\nconflicts and to limit their scale.\nAlgeria's efforts were successful in the case of\nthe conflict between two neighbours, Ethiopia and\nEritrea, where the Algiers Agreement on Cessation of\nHostilities doused the fire of that destructive war\nbetween two fraternal peoples. The Agreement now\noffers real prospects for a just and lasting settlement of\nthe border dispute between the two countries.\nAlgeria has also stepped up its initiatives to end\nthe conflict in the sisterly nation of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. In coordination and\nconsultation with the countries of the region concerned\nand with the United Nations, President Abdelaziz\nBouteflika has intensified his efforts with the parties,\nurging them to find a peaceful and negotiated solution\nin order to spare the peoples of that country any further\nsuffering and preserve its unity and territorial integrity.\nToday, more than a year since the Lusaka Agreement,\nwe can only view with regret the reversals that have\ntaken place in the peace process in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. Those setbacks have led to a\ndeferment by the United Nations of the deployment of\nits peacekeeping mission.\nUNITA's continued defiance of the international\ncommunity in Angola and its failure to comply with the\ncommitments it made in the peace process continue to\ninflict the disastrous consequences of an endless war\non the people of Angola. While reaffirming UNITA's\nresponsibility for the ongoing war in that country, we\nnote with satisfaction the new effectiveness of\nsanctions on that rebel group. We reiterate the need for\ncomplete compliance by any means necessary to make\nthe rebel elements comply with international law and\nhonour their commitments under the Lusaka\nAgreement.\nThe solidarity expressed by the international\ncommunity for the efforts of the leaders of Sierra\nLeone to restore peace and security must be\naccompanied by a tough attitude towards the criminal\nelements guilty of murder and despicable acts against\ncivilians. Those acts have not spared even members of\nthe United Nations Mission.\nWhile we reaffirm the fundamental role of the\nUnited Nations and the Security Council in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we\ncontinue to stress the need for the Security Council to\ndemonstrate the same effectiveness and speed of action\nwith regard to conflicts in Africa as it does in\nconnection with conflicts in other regions of the world.\nIn that regard, I would like to express our desire that\nthe General Assembly give the necessary attention and\nin-depth consideration to the Brahimi report's\nrecommendations on peacekeeping operations, and that\nit implement those recommendations so as to make the\nUnited Nations more effective in this essential area of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nThe contrasts that exist in today's world can be\nseen very clearly in the economic and social situation\nof the world. Humanity has never before achieved such\na level of technological development. That\ndevelopment now makes it possible to meet basic\nhuman needs economically, socially and culturally.\nHowever, some segments of humanity continue to\nsuffer the most abject forms of poverty and destitution.\nThe Secretary-General's report to the Millennium\nSummit contains a clear formulation of those\ncontradictions, which do us no credit as a civilized\nsociety that aspires to preserve human dignity and to\nprotect the rights of those whose rights have been\nwrested from them.\nMr. Kofi Annan also recognized in his report that\nthe benefits of globalization remain limited to a small\ngroup of people. That fact reinforces our conviction of\nthe need to accelerate the restructuring of international\nrelations and our insistence on the need for a serious\nand comprehensive dialogue between the North and the\nSouth to find solutions for the imbalances that exist in\nthe international financial and trade systems.\nIt is time to tackle international economic\nrelations from the standpoint of humankind's needs and\ndignity rather than from the standpoint of market forces\nalone, because experience has proved that such forces\ndo not accord the necessary importance to social\nissues. If there is one area in which we must translate\ninto reality the values of solidarity upon which the\nUnited Nations was founded and the interdependence\nwhich marks international relations, it is that of\ncombating poverty, ignorance and epidemics.\nEffective and unified tackling of the problem of\nsustainable development in the third world necessarily\nentails settling the problem of debt, reviving\ncooperation for development, promoting investments\n21\n\nand opening up the markets of the North to the\nproducts and commodities of the South.\nWe are meeting today for the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly in our century, which has been\nmarked by many events, a century in which the horror\nof destructive wars was mingled with the joy of peace\nand d\u00e9tente, a century marked by a struggle between\nhope and resignation, where it became evident that\npeople are at once capable of the most abject acts and\nthe most useful kinds of actions.\nWe leave behind a century and usher in another,\nhopeful that humankind will learn from the past and\nwill demonstrate the necessary determination to avoid\nmaking the same mistakes, for which we have paid\nsuch a high price."

        "file_text": "My\ncountry is pleased at the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri\nto preside over the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are certain that, with his talent,\nability and experience, the efforts of this extremely\nimportant Assembly session will be highly productive.\nMy delegation would also like to extend its recognition\nto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his outstanding work as\nPresident of the Assembly at the session that has just\nconcluded.\nLast Friday, during the Millennium Summit, the\nleader of the Mexican nation, Ernesto Zedillo, stated\nhis personal commitment and that of the Mexican\npeople to the values and principles that sustain the\nactivities of our Organization. Today, through me, the\nMexican Government renews its willingness to\ncontinue working and participating constructively to\nstrengthen the United Nations, the reason for those\nhistoric meetings. We will do this guided by our\ntraditional policy in the multilateral arena: by\nencouraging dialogue, consensus, and unrestricted\nrespect for international law. We will do this\nconvinced, as well, that we must make good use of this\nopportunity to give renewed impetus to the United\nNations, so that it can progress in solving the\nchallenges that we confront, and can fulfil the goal of\nbuilding, in this new century, a safer, more just and\nequal world for all. As the President of Mexico stated,\nwe will do it confident that we Mexicans have the\nnecessary foundation to do our share in achieving the\ntargets contained in the report of the Secretary-General\nand the Millennium Declaration.\nMy country is convinced that the practice of\ndemocracy is indispensable for the development of\nnations and to guarantee respect for individual\nfreedoms. But we are also sure that democracy is\nsustained by the sovereign will of its citizens and is,\ntherefore, a domestic process that cannot be imposed\nfrom the outside, although, without a doubt, it can and\nmust be nourished by international dialogue between\ncountries and by the cooperation that can be provided\nby the United Nations.\nMexico is also convinced that, just as the\npredominance of democracy within the membership of\nour Organization is imperative, it is essential that\nrelations between nations follow democratic practices\nas well, and that these, in turn, be reflected in\norganizations such as the United Nations that we, the\npeoples of the world, have created to organize our\ncoexistence.\nToday we find ourselves with an extraordinary\nopportunity to advance in that direction: to cover\nfurther ground in the democratization of our\nOrganization; to achieve a level of democratization that\nallows the United Nations to successfully fulfil the\nmission with which we entrusted it in San Francisco,\nthe validity of which we seek to renew today, a level of\ndemocratization that reinforces the legitimacy of our\nOrganization and invigorates its initiatives, a level of\ndemocratization that supports the domestic processes\nthat many of our countries are undertaking and will\nconsequently be enriched by them.\nMexico has stated on various occasions that\nstrengthening the General Assembly, the international\ncommunity's most representative universal forum, is\nindispensable to guarantee the full democratization of\nthe United Nations. We have also asserted that it is\nnecessary to modify the structure and operation of the\nSecurity Council, so that it can fully shoulder its\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of peace and\ninternational security.\nIt is for this reason that my country has\nrepeatedly proposed that we undertake a profound\nreform of the Security Council; a reform that is not\nlimited to modifications of its composition; a reform\nthat also considers the Council's working methods and\ndecision-making process; a reform that allows that\nimportant organ of the United Nations to reflect the\nplurality and diversity of our Organization; a reform\nthat takes into account the transformations of the\npolitical landscape in recent times; a reform that does\nnot lead to the creation of new centres of power and\nprivilege; a reform that regulates and limits the scope\nof the veto, avoiding its abuse or selective application;\na reform that institutionalizes the relationship between\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly so that\ntheir links, contacts and exchanges of information are\nclearly regulated; in short, a reform that guarantees that\nthe Security Council's decisions have the legitimacy\nthat can come only from the universal assent of the\nGeneral Assembly.\n30\n\nBased precisely on this unwavering faith in the\nuniversality of international law, which Mexico fully\nshares, my country has engaged in its most important\nbattles in this world Organization. Mexico has always\nbeen ready to participate in codifying international law,\nbut we have continually insisted that progress along\nthis path should involve all of the countries that make\nup the community of nations. This is the only\nguarantee for preserving legality and for ensuring\ncordial, constructive and mutually beneficial relations\nbetween all of us.\nThe humanitarian crises in Kosovo, East Timor\nand Sierra Leone, to refer to only a few recent cases,\nhave made us reflect on the scope of and limits to\ncurrent international law. These crises have made us\nsee that it is imperative to find a balance between the\nurgent need to respond adequately to humanitarian\nemergencies and the need to respect the sovereign\nintegrity of all States. These crises, in short, have\nalerted us to the need to transform ourselves into a true\nassembly that analyses and proposes new paths, and\nthey have alerted us to what holds us back from\nbecoming an authentic forum where different positions\nare heard and where answers that realistically reflect\nthe possible consensuses are found.\nWe must therefore move forward and begin a\nprocess of further codifying our international law; a\nprocess based on the sovereign equality of States as a\nliving reality, not just a theoretical principle; a process\nin which the weak and the strong, the rich and the poor,\nand the small and the large can express themselves\nopenly. A process that clearly establishes the rules of\nthe game. A process that enshrines democracy as the\nonly way in which to reach truly legitimate agreements.\nBecause we believe in these democratic values,\nMexico has always opposed the legitimization, in\npractice, of any type of interference, especially when it\nis based on unilateral decisions or the decisions of a\nsmall group of countries. To the contrary, we have\nreiterated that the United Nations must be provided\nwith a modern political structure that permits it to\nconfront the new challenges to international peace and\nsecurity brought by the end of the cold war. For this\nreason, we have insisted on the need to begin, as soon\nas possible, a broad process of consultation; a process\nthat is absolutely democratic; a process that allows for\nthe discernment of the mood of our community of\nnations in order to respond correctly and in timely\nfashion to humanitarian crises without weakening the\nOrganization by doing so.\nI call upon the President of the General Assembly\nto formally begin, as soon as possible, this broad\nprocess of consultation that will allow us to reflect\ntogether on this issue of crucial importance for the\nUnited Nations.\nMexico stands ready to continue contributing to\nthe ongoing process of codifying international law to\nwhich I have referred. We will do so with the same\nconfidence with which, in recent years, we have\nadhered to a significant number of international\ninstruments proposed by this, our most important world\nOrganization. We will do so with the same will with\nwhich we Mexicans have committed ourselves to\nmodifying our national legislation in order to comply\nwith the obligations that derive from those instruments.\nSuch is our trust in international law and its\nadvancement.\nWith this trust, only a few days ago my country\nsigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court,\nas well as the Protocols to the Convention on the\nRights of the Child. With this trust we ratified, this\nyear, the Convention on the Status of Refugees and its\nProtocol, as well as the Convention relating to the\nStatus of Stateless Persons.\nWith this trust, last week Mexico deposited its\nratification instrument for the Kyoto Protocol. Some\nmonths ago, we did the same with regard to the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies.\nWith that same trust, Mexico continues its fight to\nachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons and\ntests, and reiterates the call made last April, by the\ngroup of countries, including Mexico, that are part of\nthe new agenda for disarmament initiative, for the\nnuclear Powers to commit themselves to the total\nelimination of their nuclear arsenals.\nFuture generations deserve a world free of\nnuclear weapons. They deserve a world that is also free\nfrom the uncontrolled manufacture and trafficking of\nconventional arms. They deserve, without a doubt, a\nworld where anti-personnel landmines cease to claim\nthousands of innocent lives.\nOur commitment to the protection and\npreservation of the human race extends also to\n31\n\ncombating the pandemics of our time. Today, a fatal\ndisease, AIDS, threatens to cut off the existence of\nmillions of beings on the planet. This is why only two\ndays ago, the women Secretaries and Ministers for\nForeign Affairs of 13 countries sent a letter to the\nSecretary-General in support of his call to stop and\nreverse the spread of AIDS by 2015 and to provide\nspecial assistance to children orphaned by this scourge.\nI want to renew the appeal of our 13 nations to all the\nMembers of the United Nations to support the Joint\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\nand to resolutely launch the common efforts that are\nnecessary to fight this global scourge.\nAs is well said in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral and in the Declaration of the Millennium\nSummit, the protection of our common environment,\nthe fight against transnational organized crime, the\npromotion of human rights, attention to vulnerable\nindividuals, including children, the fight for\ndisarmament, and international aid to respond to the\ndemands of the least developed countries  these are\nthe foundation for allowing the people of the world to\nlive not only free of fear and misery, but also with\nhope. These are also the challenges that our\nOrganization and its Members must respond to, by\nconsolidating an international architecture that is\nsustained by democracy and not by the concentration of\npower; an international architecture based on respect\nfor international law, and not on unilateral decisions;\nan international architecture that encourages the\nuniversal character of our community and not selfish\nindividualism; in short, an international architecture\nthat emphasizes solidarity and cooperation as the\nvalues that give sustenance and permanence to the\nOrganization."

        "file_text": "First of all, let\nme say how satisfied I am about this week's decision of\nour 14 European Union (EU) partners to lift the\nmeasures implemented on 31 January against Austria.\nThis is a victory for reason, and it is also a victory for\nEurope. In the last seven and a half months \u2014 a very\ndifficult time, I must say \u2014 the United Nations has\nstood by us. Austria treasures this support. The United\nNations has had confidence in our firm commitment to\nuniversal standards and values. The report of the \u201cthree\nwise men\u201d, Martti Ahtisaari, Marcelino Oreja and\nJochen Frowein, comes to the same conclusion. Austria\nwill continue its role as an active, reliable and\nconstructive Member State of the United Nations.\nAustria expects to resume fully its formal and\ninformal work within the European Union. This is\nabsolutely crucial in view of the important projects that\nlie ahead of us: first, the reform of the institutions of\nthe European Union and, secondly, the enlargement of\nthe Union, a matter of great importance and a historic\nresponsibility. An enlarged Union will bolster\nEuropean stability and prosperity. Its benefits will\nreach beyond Europe. Austria, as a country in the heart\nof Europe, will fully support and, in its own interest,\naccelerate the process of enlargement.\nSince this fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly coincides with the turn of the millennium,\nwe ought to undertake a broader examination of today's\nworld. We ought to design policies of a long-term\nnature. All too often we have to cope with\ncontradictions when engaging in day-to-day politics\nand when rapidly responding to crises on the one hand\nand addressing sustainable societal development on the\nother. A great number of our decisions taken today\nhave important implications for future policy options.\nGenerations to come will have to bear the cost, and\nthey will enjoy the benefits of our policies.\nIt is in this context that I wish to pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nclairvoyance and leadership. His millennium report\nembraces a balanced analysis of the challenges the\ninternational community faces today, and it offers\nconcrete, accomplishable and far-sighted\nrecommendations. Austria welcomes this road map for\nthe future course of United Nations activities and will\nfollow its guidelines.\nFurthermore, Austria supports the timely\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to mandate a\ncomprehensive review of peacekeeping operations in\nall their aspects. Since the environment for complex\npeace operations has become more challenging than\never before, Austria, as a major troop contributor,\nwelcomes the report and the recommendations drawn\n17\n\nup by a group of experts under the leadership of\nMr. Brahimi. We are ready to support their\nimplementation.\nAs Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I wish to\noutline a number of major achievements of the OSCE\nduring this year. The OSCE serves as the primary\nforum for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation in my\nregion. This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. This truly\nhistoric document initiated the Helsinki Process, from\nwhich we still draw valid lessons for our common\nefforts to achieve \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d, to use this vivid\nnotion from the report of the Secretary-General\n(A/54/2000, para. 65). Security and stability through\ncooperation and the effective protection of human\nrights within each country have a direct bearing on\ninternational peace and security. The fundamental\nsignificance of democracy, human rights and strong\ncivil societies has been affirmed in the Charter on\nEuropean Security adopted by the OSCE participating\nStates last year in Istanbul.\nThe OSCE has proved to be a flexible institution,\nadapting itself to the far-reaching changes in the\npolitical landscape of Europe after the fall of the Iron\nCurtain. Over the past decade, it has evolved into a\nvibrant organization with a network of as many as 20\nfield operations.\nNot only in South-Eastern Europe and Central\nAsia, on which I will elaborate later, but also in other\nparts of the OSCE area, we have been able to achieve\nconcrete results in our continuing efforts for peace and\nstability. As to conflict prevention, I would like to\nmention the successful observation mission of the\nOSCE at the border between Georgia and the Chechen\nRepublic of the Russian Federation. We can also\nregister some positive developments concerning the\npolitical resolution of \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in Georgia and\nin Moldova \u2014 conflicts which are often outside the\nspotlight of broader public attention but nevertheless\nhave a highly destabilizing impact on the region and\nbeyond. Through my frequent travels as Chairperson-\nin-Office, I wish to enhance the political awareness\nregarding these unresolved or potential conflicts and\nsecurity risks. The conflict situation in Chechnya\nremains unresolved and a matter of great concern.\nLet me mention an achievement in the\ninstitutional field. An important step in enhancing the\ncivilian crisis management capability of the OSCE was\nset with the establishment of the Rapid Expert\nAssistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT), a\nprogramme which should speed up the deployment of\nhighly trained civilian experts to the field.\nWhat are the specific challenges the OSCE is\ncurrently facing in the prevention, settlement and\nmanagement of conflicts? In South-Eastern Europe the\nwork of the Organization focuses in particular on the\nstrengthening of democracy, post-crisis rehabilitation,\nthe rule of law and civil society. The promotion of free\nand fair elections plays a key role in achieving these\ngoals. The OSCE is tasked with organizing local\nelections in Kosovo at the end of October this year and,\nonly two weeks thereafter, of general elections in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. In Kosovo, the OSCE has\nbeen involved in the complex task of civil and voter\nregistration, which resulted in more than 1 million\nregistrations. I note with regret that the Kosovo Serbs\ndid not participate in the registration process and that\nBelgrade would not allow the registration of Kosovo\nSerbs in Serbia. The OSCE, however, will continue its\nefforts to bring about active participation of the\nKosovo Serbs in democratic political life. We will not\nlose sight of our common goal of a pluri-ethnic\nKosovo.\nKosovo is an excellent example of the new\nquality of the cooperation between the United Nations\nand the OSCE as a distinct component within the\noverall framework of the United Nations Interim\nAdministration.\nA central goal of Austria's chairmanship of the\nOSCE is to give equal attention to current, and often\nlong-standing, conflicts as well as to potential security\nrisks. In the pursuit of this policy, we support the\nexplicit goal of the OSCE to create a common security\nspace. This implies a strong focus on the Caucasus\nregion and on Central Asia. The OSCE effectively\ncontributes to the alleviation of the suffering of the\ncivilian population in this region, the promotion of\npolitical dialogue between warring parties and the\nmonitoring of post-conflict arrangements through\nobserver missions.\nConflict prevention is key to the work of the\nOSCE in Central Asia. During my most recent visit to\nthe region, I obtained a first-hand impression of its\n18\n\nsecurity problems. In addition to the destabilizing\neffects of the precarious situation in Afghanistan, the\nCentral Asian region faces manifold transnational\nthreats, such as terrorism, organized crime, illegal arms\nand drug trafficking and the degradation of the\nenvironment, as well as violent extremism and\nreligious fundamentalism.\nThe OSCE is well placed to support the Central\nAsian States in their common efforts to deal effectively\nwith these multiple challenges to their security. It acts\nas a political catalyst supporting the efforts of other,\nspecialized international actors. The international\nconference, jointly prepared by the OSCE\nChairmanship and the United Nations Office for Drug\nControl and Crime Prevention, on the issues of drugs,\norganized crime and terrorism, to be held in Tashkent\non 19 and 20 October is only one example.\nI cannot but re-emphasize the importance of the\nhuman dimension in the work of the OSCE. In the\ncourse of this year we have focused our work on a\nnumber of abhorrent facets of civil unrest, such as\nchildren in armed conflict, the proliferation of small\narms and the trafficking in human beings, particularly\nwomen and girls. It is in this context that I would like\nto highlight the recent adoption of a comprehensive\nAction Plan for Gender Issues, which will guide the\nOSCE in its commitment to advance equality between\nwomen and men and to protect the human rights of\nwomen and girls in the region.\nIf we analyse the profound changes that have\noccurred in the recent past, we note that the individual\ncitizen has gained in prominence not only as an actor in\nour democratic societies, with growing responsibilities\nin relation to the social, environmental and economic\nsustainability of our development, but as a victim of\nnew threats to security.\nIt is noteworthy that the United Nations, the\nGroup of Eight and the OSCE have increasingly moved\naction against terrorism, drug abuse and crime to the\ntop of their agendas. I am pleased to point out that the\nnegotiations on a Convention against Transnational\nOrganized Crime, which were held at United Nations\nHeadquarters in Vienna over the past two years, led to\na successful outcome in the course of this summer. We\nare confident that the three additional protocols \u2014 on\ntrafficking in and smuggling of persons as well as on\ntrafficking in firearms \u2014 will be concluded this fall.\nAustria, in any case, will strive for a rapid entry into\nforce and implementation of these important legal\ninstruments. We are pleased that the United Nations\nCentre for International Crime Prevention will serve as\nthe secretariat for the Conference of the Parties. I stress\nthat my country is ready to join forces with our\npartners in the developing world to counter organized\ncrime in all its facets.\nThanks to the human development reports of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), our\nunderstanding of development has shifted from macro-\neconomic statistics to a more human-centred concept,\ndefining development as a process of broadening the\nspectrum of choice, both of the individual human being\nand of society at large. I am pleased that the Human\nDevelopment Report 2000 underlines the\ninterrelatedness between human development and\nhuman rights. In short, the Report concludes that\nhuman development is an essential precondition for the\nrealization of human rights. Human rights, in turn, are\nan essential prerequisite for comprehensive human\ndevelopment.\nIf, however, we accept that most challenges to\nhuman security have a human rights dimension, we\nmay wish to take a new and more operational look at\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. How can\nwe make our human rights regimes more effective in\nour societies? The Secretary-General has shown us the\npath to follow, saying:\n\u201cit is the poison of ignorance, all too frequently,\nthat lies at the heart of human rights violations,\nknowledge provides an antidote\u201d. (Press release\nSG/SM/6829, 10 December 1998)\nUltimately, it will be citizens themselves who, through\nbetter knowledge, become the owners of their human\nrights.\nIt is in this context that I would like to point out\nthe initiative taken by all women Ministers for Foreign\nAffairs present at the opening of the fifty-fifth session\nof the General Assembly. We jointly launched an\nappeal to our fellow leaders in order to energize our\ncommon fight against the global scourge of HIV/AIDS,\na scourge which increasingly affects women and girls.\nOur efforts to counter the HIV/AIDS pandemic must be\nmultifaceted. They must encompass access to adequate\nmedical care, drugs and social protection; they must\nencompass information and services available to girls\nand women to help them understand their sexual and\nreproductive rights in order to protect themselves from\n19\n\nunwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted\ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS. This should be\ncombined with the education of young men to respect\nwomen's self-determination and to share responsibility\nwith women in matters of health, sexuality and\nreproduction.\nThe United Nations Decade for Human Rights\nEducation, spanning the period 1995-2005, was\nunanimously adopted by this Assembly at its forty-\nninth session. We have reached its mid-term and might\ntherefore wish to give it new momentum. We clearly\ncame to understand that human rights education and\nlearning serve as strategies for development on the one\nhand and as preventive tools for human security on the\nother.\nFollowing an initiative taken by Austria in the\nframework of the \u201cHuman Security Network\u201d of\nForeign Ministers, an International Workshop on\nHuman Security and Human Rights Education was\nconvened in Graz, Austria, early this year. Experts\nfrom all continents called for human rights education\nand learning as a common endeavour of governmental,\nintergovernmental and non-governmental institutions.\nThey concluded that human rights education should go\nbeyond formal education so as to encompass all forms\nof learning and different modes of socialization.\nInnovative human rights education must be\nparticipatory and operational, creative and\nempowering. It must address all levels of society. All\ncitizens, in particular all persons in positions of\nleadership, must regard human rights standards as a\nyardstick when making decisions.\nIn this context, I applaud the initiatives taken in\nAfrica, South Asia, Latin America and Europe to have\nmunicipalities proclaim themselves \u201cHuman Rights\nCities\u201d. I am pleased to announce from this rostrum\nthat the city of Graz will be the first \u201cHuman Rights\nCity\u201d in Europe.\nWhile we affirm the universality of our human\nrights, human rights education and learning will have\nto be rooted in the rich cultural plurality of the world.\nIn the diversity of learning processes we will better\ncomprehend the common humanity we all share.\nWhy, it will be asked, do I raise the issue of\nhuman rights education and learning at the General\nAssembly of the United Nations? It is because I am\nconvinced that in this strategic triangle with human\nsecurity and human development, human rights are of\nprofoundly political significance for the direction we\ntake in our development.\nAs the acquisition of any political culture takes\ntime, our efforts must be long-term and comprehensive.\nAt the same time, there is a sense of urgency. This is\nwhy I appeal to the Assembly to give our efforts in this\narea a new momentum and new energy and direction.\nLately civil society has pleaded for more political\nleadership in this field. We should be ready to respond\nand to develop new structures of partnership with civil\nsociety and with the institutions already active in the\nfield at national, regional and international levels.\nThe global house of human rights must be built\nevery day. It must be built by everyone and it must be\nowned by everyone. Only then will it be a house of\nprosperity, a house of freedom and a house of peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After more than half a century of\nexistence, our Organization must take account of the\nwill of all Member States to participate in the\nmanagement of the world's affairs. The United Nations\nmust therefore undergo the transformations required in\norder to adapt to the requirements of the modern world.\nThis reform is in our opinion both necessary and\nurgent.\nWith regard to globalization, the question is no\nlonger whether one is in favour of or against this\nphenomenon. Globalization is a concrete reality that is\nhaving an impact on all areas of international relations.\nGlobalization is under way. However, if it is to produce\nall of its intended benefits, it is necessary to take into\naccount the interests of the developing countries. In\nthis regard, the question of development assistance,\ndebt and access to developed country markets must be\nenvisaged as conditions that will allow more fruitful\nand mutually beneficial cooperation between the North\nand South.\nWe are also very much concerned about the\nenvironment. Its preservation and protection have been\nat the centre of the concerns of the United Nations\nsince the world conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It\nis of the utmost importance for our shared environment\nto be preserved and managed in conformity with the\nprinciples of sustainable development. All of us \u2014\ndeveloped countries and developing countries,\nGovernments and private sector \u2014 all of us must agree\nto pay the price in a spirit of solidarity in order to\nremove any pretext for those who sometimes say they\nhave no other choice but to degrade the environment.\nWhat is at stake is the indispensable safeguarding of\nfauna, flora and, above all, the forests of the\ndeveloping countries.\nThe Congo, an equatorial country, feels a special\nresponsibility in this area. Our Government has made a\nsolemn commitment to the sustainable management\nand use of our forests. This subject will in fact be the\nfocal point of a ministerial meeting of the African\nTimber Organization, which will take place in\nBrazzaville from 9 to 13 October next.\nWith regard to peacekeeping and international\nsecurity, extensive efforts have been deployed by the\nUnited Nations to free humanity of the scourge of war.\nAnd although our successes may be remarkable, they\nare far from meeting the expectations of millions of\nmen, women and children around the world, who await\nwith anguish. That is why we strongly support the\n28\n\nproposals in the Brahimi Report and call for their rapid\nimplementation. In addition, we follow with interest\nand hope the negotiations between the State of Israel\nand the Palestinian Authority, and we greatly hope that\nthese efforts will be crowned with success.\nWe also welcome the most recent developments\nin the Korean Peninsula, all the more so because these\nexpress the will and deep aspiration of the Korean\npeople, separated by war, to live together in peace. We\nalso welcome the results achieved in Somalia, thanks to\nthe mediation of Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of\nthe Republic of Djibouti. We welcome this true\nrenaissance in Somalia and we express our best wishes\nfor the return of a lasting peace in that fraternal\ncountry.\nIn Central Africa, determined to strengthen their\noperational peacekeeping capacities in the face of\npersistent crises and conflicts that are causing\ndeterioration in the region, the members of the\nEconomic Community of Central African States have\ndecided to establish a council for peace and security\n(COPAX), whose operational organs will include the\nrapid reaction mechanism and the multinational\npeacekeeping force. Above and beyond its preventive\nmission, COPAX is also a response to the Secretary-\nGeneral's call for reserve forces. It is important for the\ninternational community to contribute to the proper\nfunctioning of this sub-regional mechanism for\npreventive purposes and for managing and settling\nconflicts in this region of the world, which is the victim\nof murderous, devastating wars. We would like to take\nthis solemn occasion to express our desire to be fully\nassociated in the search for solutions to the problems of\nconcern to us.\nOur daily experience \u2014 one shared with\nothers \u2014 of the consequences of conflicts with\nneighbours fully justifies this concern; we want to\neliminate the sources of conflicts with our neighbours.\nThat is why, whenever it is necessary, the Congo does\nits utmost to dispel any misunderstandings and to\nstrengthen the links of brotherhood and cooperative\nrelationships with its neighbours.\nHere, I must draw the attention of the\ninternational community to the humanitarian drama\nthat is under way in the north-eastern part of our\ncountry as the result of the massive influx of refugees\nand displaced persons fleeing the renewed fighting in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, a country with\nwhich we share approximately 2,000 kilometres of\nborder. Given the seriousness of this situation, the\nGovernment of the Republic of Congo would like to\nrenew its call for robust assistance for the populations\nin distress, who have virtually been forgotten by the\ninternational community.\nAs the Assembly knows, my country, the\nRepublic of Congo, has also been shaken by internal\nconflict. I should like to assure the Assembly that we\nhave re-established peace after the signature of the\nceasefire agreements and the agreements to cease\nhostilities last year, thanks to the mediation of El Hadj\nOmar Bongo, President of the Republic of Gabon.\nOnce again, we should like to express our sincere\ngratitude to him.\nSince then, the Congo has turned its face towards\nthe future. The future for us means the consolidation of\nthis peace, national reconciliation, the rebuilding of our\ncountry and relaunching the process of\ndemocratization. That is why, starting in September of\nthis year, as proscribed by the President of the\nRepublic, Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, the Government\nof the Congo has undertaken a mission to carry out the\nbroadest possible consultations on a draft constitution\nto be submitted to our transitional Parliament in March\n2001. Its adoption will open the way to a constitutional\nreferendum and general elections.\nSimilarly, in the framework of the reconstruction\nof our country, we have just adopted an interim post-\nconflict programme for the period 2000-2002. Its\nimplementation requires the mobilization of significant\nfinancial resources, and the support of the international\ncommunity is indispensable for this purpose.\nWe can never reiterate enough that our\nOrganization has demonstrated its utility. Its reform,\nwhich is today unavoidable if we are to make it more\ncredible in a world which is undergoing constant\nchange and which will be changed profoundly by\nglobalization, is absolutely necessary. We must have\nvery strong political will to fight against poverty,\nignorance, illness, injustice and violence, as well as the\ndegradation and destruction of our planet. This is the\nonly way to guarantee the credibility of the United\nNations to the peoples of the United Nations.\nMay the commitments made at the Millennium\nSummit guide our daily actions, so that the role of the\nUnited Nations will indeed be strengthened over the\ncoming century for the well-being of all of humanity.\n29\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to extend\nmy warmest congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his well-\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-fifth session. I am certain that his\nconsiderable experience and diplomatic skills will\nguide the work of this session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nexpress my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, for the exceptional manner in which he\npresided over the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly.\nEarlier this month, in this very Hall, an\nunprecedented gathering of heads of State took\nplace \u2014 an event that, through the final Declaration,\nhas given new impetus to enhanced international\ncooperation to tackle an array of international\nproblems. The Millennium Assembly has expressed the\nstrong will of the peoples of this planet for common\naction so that humanity can proceed with the\nconstruction of a better world.\nCyprus reaffirms its commitment to the United\nNations, which we have always considered and\ncontinue to consider to be the foundation on which the\ninternational community can pursue the lofty goals of\npeace, security, justice, respect for human rights, and\nsocial and economic development on a global level. We\nthus fully support the continuing efforts towards the\nreform of the Organization, including its principal\norgans, so that it will be able to successfully face the\nmany international challenges. For, just as all living\norganisms are constantly evolving in order to adapt and\nsurvive in an ever-changing environment, so does the\nUnited Nations need always to have the necessary\nstructures and means that will make it as effective as\npossible.\nCyprus welcomes the efforts of the United\nNations in the area of disarmament and we are\nparticularly pleased at the successful conclusion earlier\nthis year of the review process of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We would like\nto congratulate the Russian Federation for its recent\nratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty and the START II Treaty. We consider the\nexpansion of the regime of nuclear-free zones,\nincluding one in our region of the Mediterranean, to be\nan important component in our goal towards a nuclear-\nfree world.\nThe illicit trafficking of small arms is an issue of\ngrave concern. We are fully supportive of international\nefforts in this direction and consider more effective\naction to eliminate this phenomenon to be an\nimperative need of our increasingly interdependent\nworld.\nIn countless reports of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, the concern is evident regarding\nthe continuing degradation of the environment and the\nimperative need for global policies in the pursuit of\nsustainable development. The effects of overpopulation\nand unregulated development will undoubtedly create\nnew pressures on the environment in this new century.\nSmall island States facing their vulnerability to global\nwarming, rising water level and the increasing scarcity\nof water resources are particularly concerned in this\narea. We are particularly pleased with the organization\nin Cyprus next January of the workshop on energy for\nsustainable development, a capacity-development\ninitiative of the Alliance of Small Island States. We\nexpect this workshop to make a substantive input to the\nninth session of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe effects of globalization were extensively\ndiscussed by world leaders at the Millennium Summit.\nI will therefore limit myself in this statement to only\none aspect of the whole question of the impact of\nglobalization, which we consider a major problem that\nwe all have an obligation to address. The eradication of\npoverty is undeniably one of the major challenges that\nthe international community faces. It is imperative that\nnew and imaginative policies to attack the problem be\ndeveloped, with the Member States of the United\nNations and the major international financial\n24\n\ninstitutions working in close cooperation on this issue.\nDebt relief should be a central part of these efforts.\nThe progress achieved since the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which was adopted more\nthan half a century ago, has been considerable. The\ninternational regime of human rights instruments has\nbeen continually expanding and constitutes the\ncriterion against which the international community\nand national Governments are judged as to their\ndedication and actions in the protection of human\nrights. The United Nations has been at the forefront of\nthese new winds of hope for humankind. The subject of\nhuman rights today encompasses a variety of topics.\nWe are very pleased at the successful conclusion of the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on women and\nthe follow-up conference on social development, which\nwere held earlier this year in New York and Geneva\nrespectively. We look forward to continuing on this\npath at the upcoming world conference on racism,\nxenophobia and related intolerance and at the special\nsession of the General Assembly on children.\nOne of the areas of particular concern to Cyprus\nis the increasing number of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons throughout the world. Cyprus has\nitself experienced the tragic consequences of mass\ndisplacement and ethnic cleansing. The vast majority\nof displaced people \u2014 more than 22 million people,\naccording to the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees \u2014 are women and\nchildren, who are particularly vulnerable to gross\nviolations of their human rights. We strongly believe\nthat the international community has an obligation to\nmore forcefully secure the right of return of these\nrefugees to their places of residence.\nCyprus welcomes the withdrawal of Israeli forces\nfrom Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425\n(1978)of the Security Council. We would like to\nconsider this as a harbinger of the achievement of a\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.\nDespite the temporary setback in the Israeli-Palestinian\nfinal-status negotiations, we believe that the process\ncan and should move forward, so that peace, stability\nand prosperity will finally be established in this long-\ntormented region. Cyprus supports the implementation\nof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council in\nthis respect.\nCyprus fully supports Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999) and calls for the full respect of the human\nrights of all the inhabitants of Kosovo, irrespective of\ntheir origin, as well as for the full respect for the\nsovereignty, the territorial integrity and the democratic\nprocess of all States in the region. We also commend\nthe European Union for its considerable initiatives and\nsupport for the economic and political stabilization of\nSouth-Eastern Europe.\nWe have been encouraged by the positive climate\nthat has existed since the June meeting between the\nNorth and South Korean leaders. We express our\nsupport for further measures to achieve reconciliation,\nstability and cooperation in the Korean peninsula. We\nhave been heartened by the prospect of reunification\nand of the termination of the division in this sensitive\nregion.\nCyprus fully supports the process for the\nestablishment of an international criminal court and\nwas one of the original signatories of the Rome Statute.\nWe look forward to further progress in the work of the\nPreparatory Commission for the International Criminal\nCourt and welcome the results of its last session\nregarding the consensus reached on the rules of\nprocedure and evidence and the elements of crime. Our\nsupport stems from our firm belief that if we are to live\nin a world where justice and international law prevail,\nthen impunity for abhorrent crimes against humanity\nshould end immediately. Cyprus, itself a victim of such\ncrimes, knows very well the bitter truth of impunity.\nFor the last 26 years the General Assembly has\nincluded in its agenda the question of Cyprus.\nDecisions by this Assembly, in particular resolution\n3212 (XXIX), as well as successive Security Council\nresolutions, call for the restoration of the territorial\nintegrity, unity and independence of the Republic of\nCyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and\nsettlers from an independent country, Member of the\nUnited Nations, which was invaded in 1974 and whose\nterritory, 37 per cent of it, is controlled by the Turkish\noccupation army.\nAn attempt has been made from this rostrum to\ngive a different version from and interpretation of the\none upheld and understood by this General Assembly\nand by the Security Council. When one talks about the\nevents of 1963, one should not forget the armed\ninsurgency against the legal Government of the\nRepublic and the deliberate decision of the Turkish\nCypriot leadership to withdraw its representatives from\nParliament and the organs of the Government, in order\n25\n\nto pave the way for the present de facto division of the\nisland.\nFurthermore, it is well known and confirmed by\nthe three reports of the European Commission of\nHuman Rights, following appeals by the Republic of\nCyprus against Turkey, that ethnic cleansing occurred\nin Cyprus in 1974 with the violent uprooting of one-\nthird of the Cypriot population from their homes and\ntheir expulsion from the areas that are now under\nTurkish occupation. This is a classic example of a\ncreation of faits accomplis through the use of force.\nEnough has already been said about history, and\nmany recriminations were levelled by one side against\nthe other. We have said time and again to our Turkish\nCypriot compatriots, and we repeat to the Government\nof Turkey, that it is high time we looked to the future.\nA future bright and prosperous for all Cypriots,\npermeated by a spirit of reconciliation, in a peaceful,\ndemilitarized and reunited Cyprus, member of the\nEuropean Union, in which all Cypriots would live in\nconditions of peace, prosperity and the full protection\nof their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nWe want a future without occupation armies,\nwithout barbed wires of division and without human\nsuffering. Indeed, how can one seriously claim that the\nmassive Turkish military force which invaded and has\ncontinued to occupy 37 per cent of Cypriot territory for\nthe last 26 years is a force of pacification and\nliberation? Had these forces been pacification or\nliberation troops, as Turkey tries to portray them,\nwould the Security Council, which represents the\ncollective wisdom of the international community, call\nrepeatedly for their withdrawal? Moreover, how can\nanyone, speaking before this body, describe United\nNations resolutions and their call to uphold and adhere\nto international law as romantic descriptions and\nunrealistic assessments?\nOne further point that I would like to make is the\nreference to the so-called realities in Cyprus. We have\nbeen asked to accept, if we want to find a solution,\nthese so-called realities on the ground. These realities\nare, of course, the result of the Turkish invasion and its\ndire consequences on the people of Cyprus. One such\nstark reality reflecting the ultimate aims of Turkey in\nCyprus is the importation of 98,000 Turkish mainland\nsettlers into the occupied areas in an effort to change\nthe demographic structure of the island. Another reality\nis the mass emigration of our fellow Turkish Cypriots\nfrom the occupied areas and the constant threat posed\nby the 36,000 Turkish occupation troops stationed on\nthe island. This threat is real and manifests itself from\ntime to time through provocative actions on the ground.\nSuch is the case of the Turkish advance in Strovilia,\nfollowing the adoption last June of a resolution by the\nSecurity Council renewing the mandate of the United\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).\nThis illegal action has been described by the United\nNations Secretary-General as a clear violation of the\nstatus quo. The inability of the Organization to return\nthe situation to the status quo ante tarnishes its image\nand credibility. Could one imagine the consequences\nfor international relations, when nations are forced to\naccept solutions based on faits accomplis created and\nsustained through the use of military force and\nunilateral acts? Can we allow such a precedent to pave\nthe way for the disintegration of so many countries\naround the globe? What, indeed, would be the\nconsequences for small States in this kind of so-called\ninternational order, where international law is\nselectively applied and the will of the mighty reigns\nsupreme?\nThe one and only reality is the imperative need\nfor peace and reconciliation in Cyprus through a\nmutually acceptable solution within the parameters of\nUnited Nations resolutions. We are currently engaged\nin the fourth round of proximity talks. We have come\nto these talks with flexibility and with the political will\nto reach a solution as prescribed by this Organization.\nWe appeal to the Turkish side to seize the moment and\ncapitalize on the current favourable environment in\norder to reach a comprehensive settlement. Such a\nsettlement will be based on Security Council\nresolutions, which call for a bi-zonal, bi-communal\nFederal Republic of Cyprus, with a single sovereignty,\ncitizenship and international personality, comprising\ntwo politically equal communities, as described in\nSecurity Council resolution 750 (1992). The Turkish\nside must realize that a solution must be mutually\nacceptable and based on international law, and it must\nnot insist on imposing its will and on a solution based\non faits accomplis.\nOur common aim should be a solution that would\nbe honourable and something to be cherished by future\ngenerations of all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish alike, to\nwhom our utmost purpose is to bequeath a better place\nto live in harmony, tolerance and cooperation.\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir,\nlet me convey the congratulations and best wishes of\nthe Government and people of Solomon Islands on\nyour election as President of the fifty-fifth session of\nthe General Assembly. Your proven tremendous skills\nas a consensus-builder and mediator will no doubt\nguide the Assembly to adopt useful decisions on the\nmany important issues before us. My Government is\ncommitted to working closely with you and all Member\nStates during this Millennium Assembly.\nSolomon Islands warmly welcomes the admission\nof our sister nation Tuvalu as a new Member of the\nUnited Nations. This is further testimony that the\nUnited Nations is indispensable and that its body of\ninternational laws is vital to the protection and security\nof small island developing States. We look forward to\nworking very closely with the delegation of Tuvalu.\nThe Government of Solomon Islands concurs that\nconflict prevention should be the cornerstone of\ncollective security in the twenty-first century. We also\nacknowledge that peace and democratic stability are\ncritical pre-conditions for economic growth and\nsustainable development. Moreover, economic and\ndevelopment cooperation have an important role to\nplay in fostering these pre-conditions.\nAs highlighted in our Millennium Summit\nstatement, the ethnic crisis in our country has\nchallenged national peace, security and stability. It has\nresulted in the loss of human lives and property, the\nclosure of all key industries in our economy and the\ndisplacement of more than 30,000 people. While it may\nnot be comparable to major conflicts in other parts of\nthe world, the net result in human loss and suffering is\nrelative. Therefore, the international community,\nparticularly the United Nations, must give equal\nattention to every conflict situation. All Member\nStates, both large and small, must be treated fairly.\nChallenges to the security and stability of small\nisland developing States like Solomon Islands are,\nincreasingly, beyond their capacity to cope. In such\ncases, the support of the United Nations and the\ninternational community at large is imperative. In the\ncontext of our crisis, our smallness and remoteness,\nlimited resources, ethnic and cultural diversity and\nhistory are fundamental considerations.\nRestoring law and order is the number-one\npriority for my Government as we strive to resolve our\nconflict. There is no peace without security. While a\npeaceful and comprehensive solution has to come from\nSolomon Islanders themselves, international support to\nsustain the peace process is necessary. Since we\nlaunched our national peace plan, we have made some\nprogress in getting the conflicting parties to the table to\n2\n\nnegotiate and agree to a ceasefire. A ceasefire\nAgreement was signed by all parties concerned on 3\nAugust 2000 and a National Monitoring Council to\noversee its implementation was subsequently formed.\nDespite some violations of the Agreement, my\nGovernment remains steadfast in our commitment to\nachieving peace. Further peace talks have since taken\nplace in Honiara, the capital, and a draft framework\ntowards a peace agreement was adopted. A more\nconclusive peace agreement will be negotiated in\nCairns, Australia. Recognizing the importance of civil\nsociety participation in conflict resolution,\nreconciliation and reconstruction, my Government will\ncontinue to involve non-governmental organizations,\nincluding women's and church groups.\nMay I express my Government's appreciation to\nthe South Pacific Forum countries for their\nunderstanding and support during this challenging\ntime. I wish to mention in particular the recent visit by\na Pacific ACP ministerial mission led by the Foreign\nMinister of Papua New Guinea to assess the current\nsituation and make recommendations to the joint\nEuropean Union/African, Caribbean and Pacific (EU/\nACP) Commission. We further appreciate the efforts of\nthe Governments of Australia and New Zealand in\nfacilitating our peace process through their logistical\nsupport. To sustain long-term peace, Solomon Islands\nwill need the cooperation of its development partners\nto rebuild the economy and to foster a development\npath that creates employment, ensures fair distribution\nof national resources and wealth and accommodates\nour diverse cultural traditions.\nOnly the United Nations and other international\ninstitutions have the scope and legitimacy to generate\nthe principles, norms and rules that are necessary if\nglobalization is to benefit everyone. The least\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), including Solomon\nIslands, need international support to build the\ncapacities to enable us to become more effectively and\nbeneficially integrated into the global economy. The\nThird United Nations Conference on the LDCs next\nyear will give the international community a unique\nopportunity to review, assess and adopt policies and\nmeasures that could effectively address the\ndevelopment constraints of least developed countries.\nDeveloping and sustaining competitiveness and\nproductive capabilities, like all other aspects of\ndevelopment, is a long and often frustrating process.\nMy Government, however, is prepared to work with\nour development partners to address these problems in\na renewed spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility.\nThe past decade has witnessed the adoption of\nseveral international conventions and programmes of\naction, from the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment to social development and the\nadvancement of women. Their five-year reviews,\ndespite some progress, have indicated that insufficient\nresources remains a major obstacle to wider\nimplementation, especially in rural communities in\ndeveloping countries. New and additional resources are\nrequired if we are to make a difference. The United\nNations Intergovernmental Conference on Financing\nfor Development next year must produce a practical\noutcome on how to mobilize financing for development\nin the new millennium. The twenty-first century should\nbe a century for better implementation of international\nprogrammes, a century for action rather than rhetoric.\nThe economic vulnerability and ecological\nfragility of small island developing States must be an\nintegral basis for decisions on development\ncooperation with these States. Such cooperation in my\nview should continue to focus on better trading\nopportunities, including market access, capacity-\nbuilding \u2014 in particular, human resources\ndevelopment \u2014 and adaptation and mitigation\nprogrammes to address climate change and sea level\nrise.\nInvestment in renewable energy remains a\npriority for Solomon Islands. Access to a reliable and\ncost-effective energy source is imperative if our rural\npopulation is to capitalize on the opportunities of the\ninformation age.\nThe international community must mobilize\nresources to implement the Secretary General's\nrecommendations on bridging the digital divide\nbetween developed and developing countries.\nSolomon Islands is committed to reform,\nstrengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the United\nNations system, including the Security Council, which\nhas primary responsibility under the United Nations\nCharter for maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. Greater flexibility and understanding should\nbe demonstrated towards those that are striving to\nbecome new permanent members of the Council,\nincluding Japan and Germany. A similar attitude should\nbe shown towards the reconfiguration of the United\nNations regional groups to reflect present-day realities\n3\n\nand to accommodate those Member States, including\nAustralia and New Zealand, which wish to be placed in\ntheir most appropriate regional or geopolitical\ngrouping.\nOnly an inclusive and universal United Nations\ncan effectively perform its mandate in the twenty-first\ncentury. We must show greater understanding towards\nthose who request to participate in the work of our\nOrganization.\nMay I take this opportunity to reiterate the point\nmade by Solomon Islands during the Millennium\nSummit relating to the principle of an all-inclusive and\nuniversal United Nations. A case in point is that which\nrelates to the reunification of China, which would\nfoster greater stability in world affairs and effectively\nbolster the activities of the Organization. This new\napproach by the United Nations for the two Chinas will\nenhance greater understanding in pragmatic diplomacy\nand pave the way for efforts currently under way in the\nKorean peninsula. This is not impossible to achieve, as\nwe saw just before the turn of the century in the\nreunification of the two Germanys.\nThe challenges facing the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century are daunting. An effective United\nNations demands the steadfast commitment and\nsupport of all its Members. The rich and powerful must\npay their dues on time, in full and without conditions.\nAbove all, the United Nations needs global political\nwill and resources to maintain peace and security,\npromote sustainable development, address\nenvironmental degradation, combat poverty and disease\nand foster respect for human dignity.\nHuman problems will always remain with us, but\nthe way to resolve them should be through dialogue\nand discussion. This is the approach my Government is\ntaking towards resolving the current ethnic unrest in\nour country. Attaining peace could be a painful and\nslow process, it could be fragile and imperfect when\nachieved, but we believe we can do it. We must,\nhowever, go beyond achieving peace. We must provide\nour people with the values and skills that will sustain\npeace. As we enter the twenty-first century, let us\nreaffirm our commitment to work in partnership with\nothers in pursuit of global peace and human security.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first of\nall congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his unanimous election\nto the mantle of the leadership of the world's foremost\ninternational body. He is presiding in this, the last year\nof the present century, following the profound\ncommitments manifested at the Millennium Summit.\nWe look forward in eager anticipation to the\nimplementation of the Summit pledges, as small States\nare becoming more and more disillusioned with the\nactual manifestations and the selectivity of the United\nNations.\nI should like to offer congratulations to his\npredecessor, who, as we know, comes from a recently\nindependent country \u2014 a country which had to struggle\nin order to be entrusted with the management of its\nown affairs. In him, we saw a genuine attempt to move\ntowards some equilibrium in this body. As such, my\ncountry applauds his efforts, but we are still awaiting\nthe day when small countries will receive the respect\ndue to sovereign States.\nThis year we will be making a deliberately short\nstatement, in the hope that the Assembly will\nconcentrate on the myriad of problems with which we\nare plagued.\nSmall States do not equate with small problems.\nIn reality, the reverse is often the norm, particularly\nwhen the State in question is still on the periphery \u2014\nthe periphery of the dominant industrial entities. In the\ncase of my country, peripheral existence emerged in the\npost-Colombian era when, along with other Caribbean\ncountries, we became colonies of exploitation, as\nopposed to colonies of settlement. Mercantilism\ndemanded our production of agricultural commodities,\nwhether indigo, cotton or sugar cane; it was a\nmonoculture, designed solely and purposely for the\nbetterment of the mother country, at the expense of the\ncolonies.\n6\n\nBut no doubt the question is being asked as to\nwhy I am raising that issue here. It is precisely because\nthe lingering reality is that we are sometimes moved\nto ask ourselves if we are still victims of the \u201cRobinson\nCrusoe\u201d mentality. To be a colony of\nexploitation meant that the entity was an area of\nunderdevelopment \u2014 an underdevelopment which\nmeant that we were to remain in that state in perpetuity\nif we were to fulfil the precise conditions for\nexploitation.\nThroughout history, smaller entities have been, as\nit were, invisible. We do not have small problems. How\ncould that be the case when nuclear waste is still being\ntrans-shipped through our waters, despite numerous\nand repeated protests, pleas and entreaties? We have a\nproblem with the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nwhich rules in favour of the interests of multinational\nenterprises and the countries benefiting from the\noperations of those enterprises. The Windward Island\nproducers of bananas were at a total disadvantage, as\nthey could not afford to pay the cost of adequate\nrepresentation before the WTO. In 1896, the silver-\nthroated orator, William Jennings Bryan, stood up in\nCalifornia and asked whether mankind should be\ncrucified upon a cross of gold. Today, we must ask if\nWindward Island humanity is to be snuffed out on a\nbed of yellow fruit, thereby sending a ripple effect\nthroughout the Caribbean, culminating in deprivation,\ndegradation, depression and the severest forms of\ndehumanization.\nAt the Millennium Summit round table, much\ntime was spent talking about globalization, without the\nfundamental reality of that globalization \u2014 so-called\nfree trade \u2014 being dealt with. In modern history, there\nhas never been free trade. It has been advocated,\nencouraged and even preached about. John Bright and\nRichard Cobden have been acclaimed for their \u201cgospel\nof free trade\u201d, but it has never been a reality. In the\nnineteenth century, it was propelled by the industrial\nand maritime countries which stood to benefit from it.\nIn the twentieth century, it has emanated from the\ndominant States, and the statistics demonstrate that it\nhas wrought havoc on most of the developing world.\nThis has primarily been the result of selfishness\nand the unwillingness to listen to and accept the\nconcerns of those who suffer most from it. Yes, we\nbenefit from the expanded use of the Internet, the\ngreater access to education and the ability to travel\nabroad more frequently. But we have been hurt by\nextraordinary pressures to control our economic\nadvancement, whether by the influence of\nmultinational enterprises or by maritime activity, which\ndeplete our resources and pollute our environment.\nInstead of our nutritional level improving, the statistics\nagain show that poverty has spread, and the sick in\npoor countries cannot access the medicines needed to\nimprove the health of their societies. If we are to have\nglobalization, let us recognize its imperfections and\naddress them meaningfully. Let us not preach, \u201cdo as I\nsay but not as I do\u201d.\nGlobalization does not have a human face. We\ncontinue to hear about the opportunities for the\ndeveloping countries, but we are still waiting for the\nbenefits to be made manifest. While we wait, we would\nlike to remind this body that we remain disappointed\nthat the International Criminal Court will not be\ndealing with illegal trafficking in narcotics or with\nillegal trade in arms and terrorism. Let us be heard. Let\nus be seen. We do not have small problems.\nAt the Millennium Summit, my Prime Minister,\nLester Bryant Bird, clearly demonstrated how the\nworld's economic and political agenda is devised and\ndirected by a few of its most powerful Governments.\nHe stated that Antigua and Barbuda, as well as several\nother small countries,\n\u201chave experienced the most blatant disregard for\nthe rules of international law, rules that have been\nspelled out by the General Assembly and upheld\nby the International Court of Justice.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nThe principle now is \u201cmight is right\u201d. The Prime\nMinister pointed out that all of this is being done by the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD), which believes that its States\nwill lose capital to other States because of their more\ncompetitive tax regimes. They have gone further by\ndubbing tax incentives \u201charmful tax competition\u201d and\nlinking it most unfairly with money-laundering\nactivities, even when there is no evidence for the\ncharge. My country has voluntarily agreed to contribute\nmore for peacekeeping even with our strapped\nfinances, as we accept our role as a contributor to the\nwelfare of the globe. We would likewise hope that the\ndominant be fair to us.\nI can go on and on with our difficulties and our\nvictimization primarily due to our pusillanimous\nnature. For the first time in several years we have not\nelaborated on natural disasters. By now all members of\n7\n\nthe United Nations should know of our plight. We\nwould however wish to speak on a decolonization\nissue.\nAntigua and Barbuda has followed closely the\nquestion of Western Sahara, and even though we do not\nhave an international intelligence system, we are\ncalling for an implementation of the referendum, as the\nsignals for renewed violence, if the United Nations\ndoes not carry out its pledge, are quite clear. We do not\nwish to see, once again, the carnage witnessed in East\nTimor.\nThe conflict, as it has been underlined through\nresolutions of the United Nations, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, and the Movement of Non-Aligned\nStates, must be resolved through the exercise of the\nSaharawi people of their right to self-determination.\nThe international community has for decades adopted\nthis legal framework as a basis for a just and durable\nsolution to the conflict. We believe that the referendum\ncan be organized before next year, and we are calling\nfor such. We do not wish another situation with the\noutbreak of violence.\nLet me sum up with a few things that Antigua and\nBarbuda would like to see at the United Nations. We\nwould like to press for the end of \u201cselective\u201d\nmultilateralism and move towards the incorporation of\n\u201cgenuine\u201d multilateralism. We desire to have a reform\nprocess expanded beyond the Secretariat and practised\namong all countries of the Organization. Reform\nshould not connote expansion, it should mean\nrestructuring. The principle of rotation on the major\ndecision-making bodies, particularly the Economic and\nSocial Council (ECOSOC), should become a reality.\nAnd may I repeat: the principle of rotation should\nbecome a reality. The concept of globalization should\nbe viewed in its entirety, and a study should be done on\nits effects on developing countries. The gross national\nproduct should not be used as the sole criterion for\ngraduating a State from concessionary loans, and the\nvulnerability index, on which Antigua and Barbuda is\nranked very high, should be taken into consideration.\nThe principle of \u201cthe equality of sovereign States\u201d\nshould be used to guard against the marginalization of\nStates within the United Nations system. The countries\nthat have pledged to contribute 0.7 per cent of their\nofficial development assistance (ODA) should carry\nout their commitment in this regard. There should be\nsome form of equity in regard to geographic groupings\nwithin the United Nations. While we understand the\nreasons why the existing groups were created, the time\nhas come for a more equitable arrangement. The\nnations comprising the United Nations should become\ntruly united.\nAntigua and Barbuda will continue to fulfil its\nobligations to its citizens and to this body. We\nrecognize the benefits that we accrue from our\ninvolvement in this parliament of parliaments. We have\nbenefited and will continue to benefit from the\nprogrammes of the various bodies and agencies of this\nbody. We are, however, confident that we have\ncontributed towards global progress, and we remain\nready to continue our contribution to the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let\nme join in the congratulations addressed to Mr. Harri\nHolkeri and to his country, Finland, on his election to\nthe lofty and responsible post of President of the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every\nsuccess in guiding the work of the Millennium\nAssembly. I should like to take this opportunity also to\nexpress our genuine gratitude and to pay due tribute to\nMr. Gurirab for his outstanding diplomatic abilities and\nfor the evident skill with which he guided the work of\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nThe further the passage of time separates us from\nthe Millennium Summit, the more profoundly will we\nappreciate its historic outcome. Tajikistan welcomes\nthe recommitment by world leaders to the role of the\nUnited Nations as the key mechanism for the collective\nregulation of international relations.\nWe remain convinced that there is no alternative\nto the United Nations. No one actor is capable of\ndealing single-handedly with the new multifaceted\nchallenges, risks and threats to international security\nand stability. Only through concerted and collective\naction on the part of the entire international community\ncan we combat phenomena such as severe financial and\neconomic crises, regional conflicts, international\nterrorism, organized crime and the illicit drug trade.\nThe positive results achieved by my country in\nthe implementation of the peace process in our nation\nare further proof of the key role of the United Nations\nin coordinating the efforts of States in the process of\nresolving armed conflict.\nToday, after seven years of confrontation, peace\nprevails in Tajikistan. Following the first multiparty,\npluralistic elections in the country's history, held in\nFebruary 2000, Tajik society is living in a new kind of\nenvironment and is laying down a sound foundation for\nthe sustainable democratic development of the country.\nThe considerable support of the international\ncommunity, which, under the auspices of the United\nNations, effectively promoted the advancement of the\npeace process in Tajikistan, played a significant part in\nthe establishment of peace and stability in the country.\nThe Tajik people will always remember the United\nNations with gratitude and will always associate this\nOrganization with the return of peace, democracy and\nconditions for sustainable development to our ancient\nland.\nOn behalf of President Emomali Rakhmonov, I\ntake this opportunity to express our great appreciation\nto the Security Council, the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, his special envoys and\nrepresentatives, and the leaders of the United Nations\nteams and missions in Tajikistan for their enormous\ncontribution to the successful completion of the peace\nprocess in my country. Our special appreciation goes to\nall those States \u2014 about 30 \u2014 that sent their citizens to\nTajikistan as part of the United Nations Mission of\nObservers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). The Tajik people\nwill for ever keep in their memories the names of those\nwho gave their lives so that peace could return to our\ncountry.\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development\n21\n\nProgramme (UNDP), the World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the International Financial\nCorporation. They have rendered, and continue to\nrender, every possible support to the people and\nGovernment of Tajikistan in their efforts to overcome\nthe effects of the civil conflict and to rehabilitate the\ncountry's economy.\nAt all stages of the peace process the Russian\nFederation made a decisive contribution to its\nprogressive development. The Russian peacekeepers\nand frontier guards who lost their lives serving security\nand stability in Tajikistan and Russia will never be\nforgotten by our peoples.\nThe guarantor States for the implementation of\nthe peace agreement \u2014 the Russian Federation, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, the Republic of Uzbekistan,\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan,\nTurkmenistan, Pakistan and the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan \u2014 rendered considerable support to the\nUnited Nations in achieving the successful settlement\nof the conflict. The joint efforts of the United Nations,\nits specialized agencies, the Bretton Woods institutions,\nneighbouring States, the United States, the European\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC), and of all those others who\nsincerely desired to see a peaceful and stable\nTajikistan, contributed to the successful\nimplementation of the General Agreement on the\nEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in\nTajikistan, signed in Moscow on 27 June 1997.\nWe are fully aware that a huge job of post-\nconflict peace-building awaits us. We hope that the\nUnited Nations office in Dushanbe will continue to\noperate effectively, rendering rehabilitation assistance,\nfirst and foremost, in the social and economic spheres.\nMuch remains to be done, but what has already been\naccomplished at this stage is of great significance for\nthe steady, peaceful development of Tajik society and\nfor the entire Central and Southern Asia region.\nThis is undoubtedly of paramount importance for\nthe United Nations, since it constitutes one of the\npositive examples of successful activities by our\nOrganization in the maintenance of peace and conflict\nresolution. We hope that the support for and assistance\nto Tajikistan needed to reinforce the gains of the peace\nprocess will be intensified. We count on the General\nAssembly's adopting during its current session the\ntraditional resolution, normally adopted by consensus,\non humanitarian assistance to Tajikistan.\nLarge-scale humanitarian assistance is of\nparticular importance this year, because in the spring\nand summer the whole of Tajikistan was affected by a\ndrought on a scale without precedent in the twentieth\ncentury. The loss of grain crops on irrigated land\nproved to be from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.\nAccording to the World Food Programme (WFP), about\n3 million people \u2014 in other words, every second\ncitizen of Tajikistan \u2014 is inadequately fed. We greatly\nappreciate the Secretary-General's appeal for food\nassistance to the population of Tajikistan most affected\nby the drought, and we are deeply grateful to the WFP\nand all donor States that responded so promptly and\ngenerously to this appeal.\nClearly, in the new century United Nations\nactivities in the humanitarian sphere, in which it has\nalready demonstrated its capabilities, will continue to\nplay an important role. We believe that it is necessary\nto intensify the cooperation of Member States in this\narea in order to increase the international capacity to\nrespond to natural and technological disasters. In our\nview, this is one of the realistic directions for the\ndevelopment of the Organization, which will allow all\nto take advantage of the opportunities provided by\nglobalization. This is entirely achievable, once the\nefforts and capacities of the United Nations and other\ninternational economic and financial organizations are\nunited. It would provide a demonstration of the global\nsolidarity called for by the Secretary-General.\nAchieving sustainable development and ensuring\nthe equitable consideration of the interests of both\npresent and future generations on a global scale is one\nof the most serious challenges of the new century.\nToday we are not far from that boundary beyond which\nthe processes of destruction of the natural mechanisms\nregulating the environment and global changes become\nirreversible. Our common objective is to meet the ever\nincreasing needs of human development in the\neconomic and social spheres, while not simply\npreserving, but gradually restoring natural ecosystems\nto conditions that will guarantee environmental\nsustainability.\nMuch has been accomplished in this area over the\nlast decade. Agenda 21, adopted at the Rio de Janeiro\nConference, has become a fundamental document\ndefining the main area of activities of the international\n22\n\ncommunity on this topic. However, the dimensions of\nthe task faced by humanity require extra coordinated\nefforts. Alongside the long-term problems, such as\nclimate change, the preservation of biodiversity, and\ndesertification, new ones are emerging, demanding\ncareful consideration and concerted action. One is the\nproblem of fresh water, a resource which is being\ngradually depleted. Depletion of ground waters has\nbecome a serious problem. According to some\nforecasts, by 2050 the population of the planet will not\nhave an adequate water supply. The problem of\ndrinking water is multifaceted and is not confined to\npurely economic issues.\nIn \u201cWe the peoples: the role of the United Nations\nin the twenty-first century\u201d the Secretary-General drew\nattention to the fact that, in order to have a sustainable\nfuture, it is absolutely essential that the international\ncommunity tackle the current fresh water problems.\nMajor concern about this question has been expressed\nby many non-governmental organizations, as well as by\nthe private sector. It has already been discussed at\ninternational conferences, including, at the ministerial\nlevel, the Second World Water Forum held in The\nHague, the Netherlands last spring, and it will be\ndiscussed at the forthcoming International Conference\non water problems to be held in Bonn, Germany. All\nthese steps, aimed at giving profound consideration to\nthe matter and elaborating proper coordinated action by\nthe international community, are precisely the purposes\nserved by the initiative put forward by our President a\nyear ago to proclaim 2003 the international year of\nfreshwater. We hope that the relevant resolution will be\nadopted by consensus at this session. We would be well\nadvised to recall our relationship with the two atoms of\nhydrogen and one of oxygen that, bound together in\nnature, support our lives on earth.\nWhile the twenty-first century may present new\ntrials for humanity, that which recently ended\nchallenged the international community with the urgent\nnecessity jointly to combat international terrorism, the\ndrug trade and organized crime. The situation in many\nregions of the planet demands that the United Nations\nmobilize even greater international efforts to counteract\nthese horrible phenomena more actively.\nThe situation in Afghanistan in particular\nendangers regional and international security. The\ninter-Afghan crisis has transformed that country into a\nstronghold of international terrorism and made it the\nworld leader in drug production. The situation in\nAfghanistan was recently the subject of a thorough\ndiscussion at a meeting of the Group of 6+2, held at the\nlevel of Foreign Ministers. Tajikistan is firmly\nconvinced that there can be no military solution to the\nAfghan crisis; any victory by any party to the conflict\nwill be temporary and will not lead to the\nestablishment of peace and stability in that country.\nOnly the United Nations, in cooperation with the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, is capable of\nuntying the tight knot of the Afghan crisis. Tajikistan\nfully approves of the activities of the United Nations\nSpecial Mission to Afghanistan and its Head, Mr.\nVendrell. We express our hope that additional resolute\nmeasures to be undertaken by the Security Council and\nthe entire international community will eventually\nallow the fire of war that has raged in that country for\n20 years to be extinguished. Otherwise, as we have\nalready seen, the terrorist and narcotic threats to\nregional and global security emanating from\nAfghanistan will continue to grow.\nOur duty is to help the Afghan people to return to\na dignified and peaceful life and to erect a reliable\nbarrier to the heroin-fuelled aggression and the\ncultivation of international terrorism encouraged by the\nTaliban, which threaten not only the countries\nbordering Afghanistan, but also those located far\nbeyond the region. We are convinced that it will\nbecome possible to find a formula for peace and a way\nout of the Afghan deadlock only through our joint\nefforts and the leadership of the United Nations.\nIn order to continue playing a key role in world\naffairs, the United Nations must continuously renew\nitself. Much has already been done to that end thanks\nto the important initiatives and effective actions of the\nSecretary-General. However, a number of issues that\ncould have a real impact on the efficiency of the United\nNations in the twenty-first century \u2014 inter alia,\nexpanding the Security Council's membership \u2014 have\nyet to be addressed. Tajikistan is in favour of\nincreasing the efficiency, balance and representation of\nthe Security Council by incorporating highly\nindustrialized countries, such as Japan and Germany,\nand influential developing States into its membership.\nWe hope that this issue will be resolved with the\nbroadest possible support.\nEach session of the General Assembly provides\nus with a unique opportunity to develop a unified\napproach and to coordinate our actions at the global\n23\n\nlevel for the sake of a truly democratic, secure and\nsustainable development of humanity. The Summit of\nworld leaders, unprecedented in the history of\nmankind, has given our Organization a powerful\npolitical impetus with which to enter the twenty-first\ncentury. The Millennium Assembly should preserve\nthis momentum and use it rationally for the sake of\nstrengthening the community of nations and our\ncommon future.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Our stubborn quest for a world of peace,\nprogress, solidarity and of concord recently prompted\nthe Heads of State and of Government from the world\nover to commit themselves at the Millennium Summit\nto joint reflection about the ways of making a reality of\nthis aspiration in the twenty-first century.\nThe conclusions they arrived at, conclusions that\ncan be summarized as the need for us to usher in a new\nera in international relations, without a doubt mark the\nframework for the future work of our Organization.\nIt is thus a positive circumstance that our work is\nunfolding against this backdrop so that during our\ndeliberations we might strive to act in accordance with\nthe guidelines set for us by our Heads of State.\nBut before my delegation attempts its own\nassessment of the state of the world as we look at the\nfresh challenges facing us in the twenty-first century, I\nshould like, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ange-\nF\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, President of our Republic and Head of\nState, who wishes us every success in our work, to\naddress to you, Mr. President, as well as to the other\nmembers of the Bureau, our heartfelt congratulations\non your election to the presidency of this session.\nYour superb mastery of international affairs in the\ncontext of which your country, Finland, holds a very\nspecial place, bodes well indeed for the success of this\nsession and, in this connection, you can count on the\ncooperation of the delegation of the Central African\nRepublic.\nThe competence with which your predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, guided the work at\nthe fifty-fourth session, has earned the full appreciation\nof my delegation.\nI should like as well to express again to the\nSecretary-General the full support of the Government\nof the Central African Republic for all he is constantly\ndoing at the helm of our Organization to provide solid\nunderpinnings for peace and development in a world\nwhich has become complex indeed. The relevance of\nthe proposals that he put forward in his introductory\nreport at the Millennium Summit reflect his deep\ncommitment to fully serving the cause of the\nOrganization, and we are deeply grateful.\nFurthermore, the Central African Republic, which\nhas always encouraged our Organization to stride\nforward towards universality, welcomes the admission\n7\n\nof Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. I am delighted to\ncongratulate this young republic on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Central African Republic.\nA world of peace, of progress, of solidarity and of\nconcord, such was the philosophy of the founding\nfathers of the United Nations.\nHow can one explain then that 55 years later we\nshould be so far from attaining that goal?\nPeace, when it is not assured, gives way to war.\nFactors such as penury, destitution, poverty, AIDS,\nmalaria and tuberculosis \u2014 compounded by\nintolerance, injustice, indifference and social\ninequalities \u2014 these make up the threats to the balance\nof peace.\nProgress is a reality for only a quarter of\nhumankind, while three quarters still are not enjoying\ndecent living conditions.\nSolidarity still is something selectively applied in\na world that is nonetheless interdependent.\nAll this cannot foster fellowship within this\nconstantly changing world.\nThat is the state of the world as we enter the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe Secretary-General's report entitled \u201cWe the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century\u201d has the merit of having pointed out all\nthese distortions that do not help to ensure the smooth\nunfolding of international relations.\nBut even though the United Nations, 55 years\nafter having come into being, has not fulfilled the\nhopes to which its inception gave rise, the fact\nnonetheless remains that it does exist. And the fact that\nit still does exist is something which first and foremost\nis due to the determination of States, which do in fact\nfeel the need for this Organization. We must therefore\nstimulate renewed interest in the United Nations; that\nis what is at stake at this session.\nThe United Nations must regain its authority in\norder to contribute to regulating the course of events in\nthe world in the twenty-first century. On the basis of\nreal solidarity among States, we must conceive of a\nnew kind of cooperation that would make it possible\nfor us collectively to organize a defence of peace, the\npromotion of development and of progress, as well as\nthe fostering of human rights and of democracy\neverywhere around the world.\nThe fact is that as you look around the world\nthese days, you find that peace is jeopardized in many\ndifferent countries, and especially on the African\ncontinent.\nWhat is more, all this is happening as though the\nconventional conflict-settlement machinery were no\nlonger suited to coping with crisis situations. Still, the\nresources afforded by the United Nations, as well as by\nregional organizations, have made it possible for a new\nattitude in the face of conflict to emerge, one which\nfirst and foremost involves regional solidarity.\nIt is in this context that my country today still\nplays host to a United Nations office, the United\nNations Peace-Building Support Office in the Central\nAfrican Republic (BONUCA), responsible for striving\nto consolidate peace. Indeed the tragic events for which\nthe Central African Republic became the staging\nground in 1996 and 1997 prompted African countries\nfirst to intervene in the context of the Inter-African\nMission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui\nAgreements (MISAB), before bringing the United\nNations into the picture. The United Nations Mission in\nthe Central African Republic (MINURCA) made a\ngenuine contribution by its very presence and by what\nit did in restoring peace and in promoting national\nreconciliation, thanks to the support provided in\norganizing both legislative and presidential elections.\nI would like here again to express the\nappreciation of the Government of the Central African\nRepublic to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, to the members of the Security Council and\nespecially to the countries that so generously\ncontributed to supporting that mission of peace by\nproviding the wherewithal for MINURCA.\nThe experience gained in the Central African\nRepublic can be made available as an asset to the\nUnited Nations, reflecting a success in keeping the\npeace and consolidating it. My delegation, which\nsupports the Brahimi report, hopes that the\nrecommendations it embodies will be fully\nimplemented so that we really see take root a new\ndoctrine for United Nations operations of\npeacekeeping.\nIn the same vein, my delegation hopes that the\nUnited Nations provides the same resources to\n8\n\npromoting a lasting settlement in the situations in\nSierra Leone, in Angola, in Burundi, between Ethiopia\nand Eritrea, as well as in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo.\nAs to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nwhich shares a rather long border with my own\ncountry, my delegation calls for cooperation from the\ninternational community in the context of the United\nNations, so that a solution may be found to this\nconflict, the consequences of which have already taken\na heavy toll, both for the Congolese people, with which\nwe are bound by fraternal ties, as well as for the\nneighbouring States such as the Central African\nRepublic, which is currently hosting tens of thousands\nof refugees that have fled the effects of the war. My\ndelegation takes advantage of this opportunity to call\nupon the competent international authorities, the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nin particular, to devote special attention to the Central\nAfrican Republic in this instance.\nMoreover, my delegation firmly supports the\nongoing process seeking to bring about a settlement to\nthe question of the Middle East. We do not doubt that\nthe determination of the parties involved will make it\npossible to lift the last remaining obstacles so that a\nfair, negotiated and lasting solution in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973) may be found.\nThe United Nations subsequently should regain\nits authority in order to enable it to contribute by\nletting multilateralism work to promote development\nthroughout the world. The fact is that without denying\nwhat has been done internationally to fight poverty and\nwhile acknowledging that developing countries should\nshoulder primary responsibility for ensuring the\nnecessary preconditions for their development, my\ndelegation hopes that the community of States will\ncome to grips with the question of poverty and will\napply a fresh way of thinking to it in this twenty-first\ncentury.\nAll the indicators of poverty are there for us to\nsee, and you can find them everywhere in Africa: weak\nprimary educational systems, a lack of sanitary\ninfrastructure, a lack of drinking water, of the proper\nconditions for hygiene, to name but a few. The African\ncontinent is part of that 1 billion inhabitants of our\nplanet living on less than one dollar a day, while two-\nthirds of the population of the planet hold three-\nquarters of the world's income.\nPoverty is extreme in Africa; we must do our\nutmost to come up with new ways to reduce it in the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe Central African Republic, which at the\nbeginning of this year took part in the Libreville\nsummit on growth and poverty reduction in Africa,\nabides by the new strategic framework to combat\npoverty proposed by the Bretton Woods institutions.\nMy country therefore calls for an increase in the\nresources allocated to such agencies as the United\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\nPopulation Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization to support the\nCentral African Republic's strategy to combat poverty.\nOf course, eradicating poverty will be necessary\nin order to make it possible for developing countries to\ntake part in the work of development. That is\nparticularly true with regard to the countries of Africa.\nBut it will also be necessary to put developing\ncountries in a position where they can really rise to the\ndevelopment challenge. In this connection, the issue of\nthe debt burden comes to mind, for it continues to\nsubstantially handicap all development efforts.\nHow, then, can we ensure that globalization\nstimulates development in Africa instead of leading to\nmarginalization? Inasmuch as the new technologies\nthat are being introduced contribute to the overall\nprogress of mankind, Africa must expect to benefit,\nand we once again call for the rules governing the work\nof the World Trade Organization to take Africa's\ninterests into account.\nIn his introductory report to the Millennium\nSummit, the Secretary-General reminded us that all\nactivity is people-oriented. Nothing is more true. My\ndelegation hopes that the United Nations will regain its\nauthority so that it can contribute to ensuring the\nnecessary conditions for the promotion of rights and\ndemocracy throughout the world. Guaranteeing and\nprotecting human rights contributes to national\nconsensus and strengthening democracy in a country.\nWe have understood that so well in the Central\nAfrican Republic that we have created a government\nbody called the High Commission for Human Rights,\nwhose mission is not only to monitor respect for human\n9\n\nrights, but also to implement the various international\nlegal instruments signed by the Central African\nRepublic aimed at promoting human rights. That\nimplementation requires resources in order to bring\nabout the most widespread dissemination possible of\nhuman rights at the national level. As human rights are\nindivisible, it is important to establish cooperation\nbetween States to promote human rights throughout the\nworld. My delegation hopes that in the course of the\ntwenty-first century the United Nations will become\nincreasingly involved in international efforts to\nestablish a worldwide culture of human rights. It must\nbe reformed and renewed in order to be able to take on\nthat role.\nRenewal means adaptation to the realities of the\nworld today. The Organization's procedures, methods\nand approaches to every issue within its competence\nwill have to be streamlined. However, let us not forget\nthat protecting international peace and security is the\nprimary task entrusted to the United Nations. That role\nis primarily the responsibility of the Security Council.\nMy delegation would like to see the Security\nCouncil reformed in order to better discharge that\nresponsibility. The world has changed profoundly, and\nthe composition of the Security Council should reflect\nthat. Even though the veto power is not as abused today\nas it was during the cold war, we should restructure the\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories to take into account the new international\nreality. That is the opinion of the delegation of the\nCentral African Republic.\nIn that way we can contribute to setting relations\nbetween nations on a different course. That requires a\nreal and willing commitment by States. This year's\nadoption of the Constitutive Act of the African Union\nas an expression of Africa's willingness to join the\nUnited Nations in meeting all the challenges is a\nmanifestation of that commitment. My country will do\neverything in its power to encourage this new\nmovement towards integration.\nThe century that witnessed the birth of the United\nNations has ended. A new century is beginning, one in\nwhich there is still a United Nations \u2014 something that\nis cause for satisfaction to mankind. But what shall we\nmake of the United Nations in the twenty-first century?\nThat is indeed the fundamental question raised by the\nSecretary-General in his report to the Millennium\nSummit.\nShould we continue to keep the United Nations\nlocked in the vice of contradictions that exists between\nMember States? Should we continue to look on\nhelplessly as its authority is flouted in peacekeeping\noperations? Should we continue to accept the\nOrganization's being left behind as the world moves\nforward? The answer, in the opinion of the delegation\nof the Central African Republic, is a resounding \u201cNo\u201d.\nLet us therefore return to the dream of the\nfounding fathers and make sure that in the new century\nthe United Nations has the necessary means to bring\nabout peace, solidarity and harmony throughout the\nworld. Such a world is possible if we want it. That is\nthe world our Heads of State spoke of in their message\nto us at the Millennium Summit.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The\nhistoric Millennium Summit and the forward-looking\nDeclaration it adopted have set a very positive tone for\nthe Millennium Assembly, which is now continuing\nwith this general debate.\nWe extend our heartiest congratulations to\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election as the\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session. His deep\ncommitment to the values and principles of the United\nNations gives us the confidence that the affairs of this\nAssembly are in very good hands.\nI should also like to congratulate Foreign\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab, my dear colleague, for his\nsuperb leadership of the fifty-fourth General Assembly.\nWe are grateful to him for his invaluable guidance in\nthe preparations for the Millennium Summit and its\noutcome.\nMay I also express Bangladesh's sincere thanks\nand gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\nvision in convening the Millennium Summit and for his\nuntiring efforts towards its success. His millennium\nreport contains a number of good proposals and ideas,\nwhich we wholeheartedly support. I reiterate\nBangladesh's full support and cooperation to the\nSecretary-General in his determination to enhance the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nLet me at the very outset extend our heartiest\ncongratulations to the people and Government of\nTuvalu as the newest Member of this Organization.\nTwenty-six years ago this month, when\nBangladesh had just become a Member of this\nOrganization, the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, addressed this Assembly. He\nunderscored our commitment to the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. For our people, it was a great moment.\nWe have travelled a long way since that time and our\ncommitment to the United Nations has only grown in\nstrength.\nAs Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mentioned in\nher speech at the Millennium Summit:\n\u201cIn this Organization, the powerful and the\nweak, the large and the small, the wealthy and the\nstruggling come together as equals to address\ntheir problems, to forge cooperation and to\nfurther understanding. It certainly is in our\ninterest to strive for a United Nations which can\nfulfil our common goal \u2014 a better world for\nevery human being\u201d.\nTo the people of Bangladesh, human rights is a\nsacred trust, because we were victims of its abuse. And\nyet the very person who had championed the cause of\nfundamental rights was denied the most basic of all\nhuman rights, the right to life. I speak of the ghastly\nmurder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,\nalong with almost his entire family and close relations,\nby a group of assassins on 15 August 1975. The\nmurderers had committed a crime and human rights\nabuse of the worst kind. And, in what could best be\ndescribed as an arrogant affront to human rights and\ndemocratic principles, the killers were granted\nimmunity from law by the so-called Indemnity\nOrdinance issued by the undemocratic regime of that\ntime.\n15\n\nThe present democratic Government in\nBangladesh has repealed the Indemnity Ordinance\nsince its assumption of office. The accused have been\ntried and found guilty of murder, and the verdict of the\ncourt of law has been announced. Some of them,\nhowever, have managed to escape justice by finding\nasylum in foreign lands. If human rights is to dominate\nthe agenda of the new century, we would urgently ask\nthe international community for its cooperation in\nbringing these self-confessed killers to Bangladesh to\nface justice. Here I would like to express my\nappreciation and gratitude to those countries which\nhave been cooperating with us in this matter.\nTo Bangladesh, a very important manifestation of\nhuman rights is the right to development, which needs\nfurther assertion by the international community. In\nensuring that right, it is essential that our collective\nefforts focus on addressing poverty. Unless we take\npositive actions in this regard, globalization will be\nmore of a challenge and less an opportunity \u2014 freedom\nfrom want will remain elusive. The challenges are\nparticularly daunting for the least developed countries\nand merit priority attention.\nJust as globalization touches us all,\nmarginalization of these vulnerable countries would\naffect us all in the global family. We would urge the\ninternational community to make every effort for the\nsuccess of the third United Nations Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries in 2001 in Brussels.\nIn the past decade, the international community\nhas made tremendous progress in recognizing the\nchallenges and adopting elaborate programmes of\nactions in the areas of social development, human\nrights, environment, population, human settlement and\nfood security, as well as on women and children. Now\nthe challenge before us is to fulfil the commitments we\nhave made together. Let us resolve that the next decade\nwill be the decade of implementation.\nAt home, in facing the challenges of the coming\ndecades, poverty eradication has been set as the over-\narching goal of the present Government of Bangladesh,\nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\nWe are making increasingly great investments in our\npeople and in our social and human development.\nIn ensuring the effectiveness of this engagement,\nBangladesh has focused on the rights of women and\nchildren. Bangladesh has become party to most of the\ninternational instruments relating to the rights of those\ntwo groups. During the Millennium Summit, Prime\nMinister Sheikh Hasina ratified the Optional Protocol\nto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women and the two Optional\nProtocols on the sale of children, child prostitution and\nchild pornography and on the involvement of children\nin armed conflict. Adoption of the \u201cWoman and Child\nRepression Prevention Act, 2000\u201d by our national\nParliament is also a major step forward in eliminating\nviolence against women and children.\nUnfortunately, our efforts towards sustainable\nhuman development have been set back through\ncalamities beyond our control. Sometimes it is natural\ndisasters like floods, cyclones or tidal surges.\nSometimes it is silent killers like dengue fever or\narsenic contamination of groundwater. Today, two\nthirds of the Bangladesh population is at risk as the\nresult of arsenic contamination of drinking water. The\nGovernment has responded to this crisis with urgency\nand determination; in collaboration with international\nagencies such as the World Bank, the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), as well as non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs). Adequate emphasis has also\nbeen given to ensuring alternative sources of safe\ndrinking water for the community.\nIn her statement at the Security Council summit\ntwo weeks ago, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\nemphasized that international peace and security must\nalso be understood in terms of human security. She also\nemphasized that we should prevent war crimes, crimes\nagainst humanity and genocide against the civilian\npopulation. We believe that the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court can effectively deal with\nthese crimes. We signed the Rome Statute last year and\nhave already initiated the process for early ratification.\nAs an elected member of the United Nations\nSecurity Council, Bangladesh remains committed to its\nobligations to maintain and preserve international\npeace and security. Bangladesh strongly supports\nenhanced effectiveness of the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations, as well as its peace-building\nmeasures. Bangladesh is proud to be one of the largest\ntroop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, in fulfilment of our commitment to global\npeace and security. In this context, we welcome the\nrecommendations of the Brahimi Panel and look\nforward to their consideration by the relevant\nintergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat. Here we\n16\n\nwould emphasize that the resources needed for their\nimplementation should not in any way undermine\nother, already existing programmes.\nAn area of our common concern has been United\nNations sanctions, their effectiveness and their impact.\nIt is a matter of satisfaction that the Security Council,\nafter years of debate, has set up a Working Group\nunder Bangladesh chairmanship to study various\ngeneral issues related to sanctions. We are confident\nthat the work of the Group will help the Council to\nagree on measures to streamline the sanctions regimes.\nTo ensure peace and development, we must move\nahead with an agenda for real disarmament. The\nnuclearization of our own region in South Asia has\ncaused us concern. As one of the least developed\nregions in the world, South Asia cannot afford to get\ninto a race for nuclear weapons. In accordance with its\nconstitutional commitment to total and general\ndisarmament, Bangladesh took the lead in South Asia\nto sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) in 1996, ratifying it earlier this year. We also\nwere among the first in South Asia to sign the Ottawa\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines, which was\nalso ratified by us during the Millennium Summit,\nalong with the Convention on certain conventional\nweapons (CCWC) and all its Protocols.\nBangladesh considers peace and development to\nbe fundamental rights. One cannot endure without the\nother. The United Nations and its Member States must\ncontinue to espouse and promote a culture of peace.\nBangladesh took the initiative for the international\nobservance of this millennium year and the first decade\nof the twenty-first century as the International Year for\nthe Culture of Peace and the International Decade for a\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of\nthe World, respectively.\nAs we have said on earlier occasions, Bangladesh\nbelieves that the United Nations should be prepared to\nrespond effectively to the challenges of the new\ncentury. Since United Nations reforms were initiated\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a lot has been done,\nbut much more could be added to this. We aspire to\ngreater democratization and transparency in the\norganizations of the United Nations. We also believe\nthat involvement by non-governmental organizations\nand other actors of civil society can significantly\nenhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.\nA changed world needs a changed United\nNations \u2014 an Organization for today's world. We need\nto demonstrate courage and determination in order to\npreserve the United Nations as the world's most\nuniversal forum. Its founding fathers spoke about the\nscourge of war. Today the United Nations will only live\nup to the global reality if it cannot only free the world's\npeople from the scourge of war but also save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of poverty.\nMay Bangladesh live forever.\nMay the United Nations live forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to offer you my\ncongratulations on your election and my best wishes\nfor the coming year, and also to convey my great\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, for his fine work and guidance over the past\nyear.\nI would like to start by thanking our Secretary-\nGeneral for his report to the Millennium Summit. It is\ncomprehensive, ethical and most impressive. We have\nnever had anything like it before. One effect it has had\nis to give deep meaning to the expression the\ninternational community. I think that in the past, we\nhave often used this term far too lightly. Now we know\nwhat it stands for. It is spelled out in the final\nDeclaration made by our heads of Government, which\nis now a textbook for the coming year. Its great ideas\nstill echo in this Hall, and its noble aims light up the\nfuture.\nIn our view, it has given precise targets that can\ntruly help developing nations. For the first time, we can\ndistinguish clearly between immediate issues and long-\nterm ones. This is very important, because many of the\nthings on which we spend so much time and so many\nresources are not, in fact, today's issues. They are sad\nlegacies passed on by the twentieth century.\nObviously, they are important. Each one is tragic\nin the consequences it has for ordinary peoples' lives.\nBut they are all primarily the responsibility of\nGovernments and regional organizations. The more\nthey dominate the affairs of the United Nations, the\nmore they stop us from concentrating on the deep-\nseated problems of developing nations. Those problems\nare the ones that can truly be called today's issues. As\nthe Secretary-General highlighted in his Summit report,\nthey are becoming very serious indeed. We have even\nhad to give them a new name: transnational issues.\nThey each have academic titles: technological\nproblems; demographic problems; socio-economic\nproblems; and environmental problems. But take away\nthe grand language, and they all add up to a simple\nfact: they are far too big for individual Governments to\ndeal with, or even regional organizations.\nIt is all too clear that they will not be solved in\nthe marketplace, either. The solutions will not trickle\ndown. In fact, the global market economy has\nlengthened their list and created its own set of special\nproblems.\nIt would all be very depressing indeed but for one\nthing. The Summit Declaration has clearly invited us\nall, as Members of the United Nations, to accept a joint\ninternational responsibility to find solutions. Naturally,\n\n\nwe may differ on how to go about it, but what is most\nimportant is that we have to recognize and accept the\nneed for new priorities. Consequently, we highly value\nthe assessment made by the Secretary-General of\nwhere these lie.\nFor example, we appreciate his timely advice that\nglobalization requires policies and measures that are\nsensitive to the needs of developing nations. We are\npleased that he has upheld the peoples' right to\ndevelopment as fundamental. We join him in\nrecognizing the special concern of our friends and\ncolleagues on the African continent. We support all that\nhe is trying to do to improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the United Nations, because this\nshould enable it to concentrate on what it does best and\nis best equipped to do.\nBy this I mean the practical, urgent work done by\nits organs and agencies and its professionals and\nvolunteers, in the field, close to the people. Much of\nthis represents development in areas such as education\nand training, which are absolutely critical if the people\nof developing nations are to move beyond a day-to-day\nstruggle for basic food, shelter and medicine and take\npart successfully in the new global economy.\nIt means that the work of agencies such as the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) is vital. It needs to proceed\nurgently and not be held back because essential funds\nare diverted to solving ancient problems.\nThe vital tasks of the United Nations today\nshould not be held hostage by the twentieth century. It\nhas urgent new work to undertake for developing\nnations. This work can be simply summed up. It is to\nensure that the phrase developing nations actually\ndoes mean nations that are developing  rather than\nwhat they too often tend to be, just a polite expression\nfor the very opposite.\nThe Summit Declaration offers us all the chance\nto do just this, in friendship and cooperation, and I\nhope that we will do everything we can to implement\nits provisions. It would be the best form of appreciation\nwe could offer to the Secretary-General and his staff at\nthe end of a remarkable year's work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\nI join other\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession. I am confident that with your vast experience\nand diplomatic skills you will be able to guide the\nproceedings of this Assembly to a successful\nconclusion.\nI would also like to express my delegation's\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nfor the effective manner in which he guided the work\nof the last session of the General Assembly.\nLet me also take this opportunity to commend the\nSecretary-General for his great dedication to the\nOrganization and the many contributions he has made\nin the service of the international community.\nThere are great expectations on the part of the\ninternational community that in the new century the\nUnited Nations will be a more effective Organization.\nIndeed, its continued relevance, especially to the\ndeveloping countries, which comprise the majority of\nthe membership of the United Nations, will, to a large\ndegree, depend on their perception that it is attuned to\ntheir concerns and responsive to their needs. The\nOrganization must continue to serve the interests of all\nits Members, big or small, strong or weak. It must be\nmore transparent and democratic in its decision-making\nprocesses and work methods.\nIn this context, the reform and restructuring of the\nOrganization continues to be a matter of great\nimportance. Much has been done through the process\nof reform effected by the Secretary-General, but reform\nis a continuous and ongoing process and should\ncontinue to be vigorously pursued to ensure the United\nNations increased effectiveness and efficiency,\nespecially in facing up to the challenges of the new\ncentury. As modernization of the Organization entails\nadditional resources, the critical issue of financing the\nUnited Nations must also be seriously addressed and\nresolved as soon as possible.\nMore intensified efforts should be made to bring\nto conclusion the deliberations on one of the most\nimportant aspects of the reform process: the\nrestructuring of the Security Council. Clearly, the\nnecessary compromises must be made if the ongoing\ndeliberations on the reform of the Council are to make\nany progress at all. We look forward to your leadership,\nMr. President, in unblocking the current impasse so\nthat this important organ of the United Nations can be\nfully revamped, modernized and made more effective.\nMalaysia continues to support expansion of the Council\nin both categories of its membership. Any expansion in\nthe permanent category should include both the\nindustrialized and the developing countries. If there is\n7\n\nno agreement on expansion of the permanent\nmembership, the Council should be enlarged for the\ntime being in the non-permanent category.\nA central objective of reform of the Security\nCouncil should be to ensure its effectiveness in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nEqually important is the need to enhance the Council's\nunity of purpose among its members, especially the\npermanent members, so as to avoid the situation that\nnecessitated the taking of international action outside\nthe Council by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), as in the case of Kosovo, when the Council\nwas unable to act. Notwithstanding the special\ncircumstances of Kosovo, future international\ninterventions should be made only with the express\napproval of the Security Council, in the interest of\npreserving the role and authority of the Council as\nenshrined in the Charter, as well as of ensuring the\nlegality and legitimacy of all such actions.\nAnother aspect of the work of the Security\nCouncil that should be thoroughly reviewed relates to\nthe imposition of sanctions on Member States, which\nhave often brought untold suffering on the general\npopulace, particularly women and children. Sanction\nregimes of the future should be established only when\nabsolutely necessary and should be specifically\ntargeted, time-bound, subject to regular review and\nlifted when no longer necessary. The interests of all\nparties to the conflict should be addressed in order to\nachieve a just and lasting peace. We have seen too\nmany conflicts that seem to be resolved on paper but\ncontinue to remain outstanding on the ground.\nWe should strive in the new century to make our\nworld a safer place. We should strive to get rid of\nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 particularly nuclear\nweapons, but also chemical and biological weapons.\nWe must intensify global efforts to reduce existing\nstocks of these horrendous weapons, culminating in\ntheir total elimination. The major Powers and others\nthat possess and manufacture these weapons bear a\nspecial responsibility. We should all play our part in\nensuring that there is no let-up in the global efforts\ntowards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\nWe should also limit the production and\ndeployment of ultra-sophisticated, high technology\nconventional weapons, many of which are being used\nin the wars of developing countries, resulting in the\nironic situation of third world countries fighting their\nwars with first world weapons, thanks to the aggressive\nmarketing efforts of arms vendors of the developed\ncountries. The developing countries can ill afford the\narms race that this will trigger, nor the huge defence\nexpenditures to sustain the use of these weapons.\nWe must ensure that genocide, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nand other crimes against humanity that were\nperpetrated, for instance, in Rwanda, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Kosovo, are never allowed to be\ncommitted again anywhere else in the world. More\nstrenuous efforts should be made to apprehend indicted\nwar criminals so as to send a stern warning to others.\nThey should not be allowed to get away with their\nheinous crimes with impunity.\nUndoubtedly, the maintenance of international\npeace and security can be better served through more\neffective use of preventive diplomacy. This has been\nhighlighted by the Secretary-General in his Millennium\nReport (A/54/2000) and should be seriously\nconsidered.\nThe Organization will have to develop a more\neffective early-warning capability and deal with\nemerging conflict situations through more effective use\nof the mechanism of preventive diplomacy. A more\nproactive approach in preventive diplomacy would\nrequire even closer coordination and collaboration\nbetween the Security Council and the Secretary-\nGeneral, who would have to put his good offices role to\neven greater use.\nHowever, that should not become an excuse to\nimpose anything on Member States or to interfere in\ntheir internal affairs. There are growing tendencies for\nthe developed countries, in the name of civil society,\ndemocracy and human rights, to set standards in\naccordance with their own moulds for the developing\ncountries to follow. We even ignore the fact that many\nof the problems confronting the developing countries\nare the vestiges of the colonial past. We want to leave\nyesterday behind and move to today and the future, but\nthe pace appropriate to the particular country\nconcerned should be followed.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should\nbe empowered with clear and well-defined mandates,\nadequate resources and strong international support,\nirrespective of where they take place. There should be\nno perception of selectivity in their launching. In this\nregard, it is especially important that peacekeeping\noperations in Africa \u2014 notably in Sierra Leone, the\n8\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia and\nEritrea \u2014 be strongly supported by the international\ncommunity. At the same time, for peace to be viable it\nis essential that peacekeeping missions incorporate the\nnecessary elements of disarmament, demobilization\nand reintegration of ex-combatants, with the necessary\nsupport of the international community.\nMy delegation commends the frank and forthright\nreport (A/55/305) of the Brahimi Panel on United\nNations Peace Operations. The Panel's bold\nrecommendations deserve the detailed and careful\nconsideration of the membership of the Organization.\nThereafter, we must demonstrate the urgency,\nseriousness and political will to follow up on those\nlaudable recommendations, lest the Panel's report meet\nthe fate of many United Nations reports in the past for\nlack of the necessary political will.\nOn another conflict situation, it is a matter of\ngreat concern to Malaysia that one of the longest-\nrunning conflicts of this century, the Arab-Israeli\nconflict, remains unresolved. Successive opportunities\nwere not grasped due to the lack of seriousness on the\npart of the Israeli Government to pursue the path of\npeace. We are disappointed that the Israeli Government\nfails to live up to the expectations of the international\ncommunity and lacks the boldness of vision, as well as\nthe will and courage, to grasp the once-in-a-lifetime\nwindow of opportunity to seal a lasting peace between\nIsrael and Palestine and Syria in the interest of regional\npeace and security.\nThe aspirations of the Palestinian people for an\nindependent and sovereign homeland can no longer be\ndenied. We look forward to welcoming in the very near\nfuture an independent State of Palestine among the\ncommunity of nations here at the United Nations, as\nwell as in other international organizations. Equally, we\nlook forward to the return of Syrian Golan without\nfurther delay. Israel must bury the suspicion and\ndistrust of the past and look to the future in an\nenvironment that will create opportunities and\nchallenges in a peaceful and stable Middle East.\nSince the East Asian financial crisis there has\nbeen increasing recognition of the nature of the\nproblem of, and the need for reform of, the existing\nglobal financial and economic systems, which\nMalaysia has strongly advocated. It is my hope that\nefforts in that direction will continue to be pursued by\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, even if the worst for the\naffected Asian economies may now be over and those\ncountries are now recovering. It is dismaying that some\nquarters are suggesting that, with the end of the crisis,\nthere is now no urgency or even necessity for reform.\nGiven the universality of its membership, the United\nNations is well placed to make an important\ncontribution to promoting the reform process,\nparticularly in the context of its own increasing\ndialogue and interaction with those institutions. It\nwould be the height of folly and irresponsibility to wait\nfor another round of speculative currency attacks to jolt\nus into action.\nEast Asia's traumatic experience is also a strong\nreminder of the negative effects of globalization on\ndeveloping countries. While globalization is inevitable\nand is becoming a permanent feature of the new\ninternational order and system, it is far from being a\npanacea. Indeed, the United Nations Human\nDevelopment Report indicates that globalization has\nled to the marginalization of many developing\ncountries, resulting in an increasing disparity in\neconomic attainment between nations. This conclusion\nis not surprising, given the existing inequitable\ninternational economic order and the differing access to\ntechnology.\nWith all its potential benefits, globalization in its\nunfettered form is likely to do more harm than good to\nthe small, vulnerable economies, at least in the short\nand medium terms, unless measures are put in place to\nprotect them. It will bring about not free trade, but an\nunfair and inequitable exchange: the inflow of capital,\ngoods and services from the developed North in return\nfor the outflow of hard-earned foreign exchange from\nthe poor countries of the South. The notion of a level\nplaying field, which is the central creed of\nglobalization, would perpetuate the present inequities\nin favour of the strong, developed economies at the\nexpense of the vulnerable economies of the developing\nworld. It would only ensure the continued domination\nof the weak by the strong.\nFor globalization to be universally embraced\nwithout reservation there must be in place certain\nground rules to regulate the conduct of free trade in\ngoods and services to ensure an equitable exchange\nbetween unequal partners predicated on a win-win\nproposition. At the same time, the principle of\ntransparency should be applied across the board to\ninclude currency traders and market manipulators, who\nare now somehow exempted from such a requirement,\n9\n\nas well as from payment of taxes. Until and unless\nthese measures are instituted, globalization will be seen\nby the developing world as a largely predatory\nideology of the rich nations for the exploitation and\nsubjugation of poor ones.\nThat impression is further reinforced by the\nintolerance of dissenting of some of its promoters\nviews in their zeal to prescribe the one-size-fits-all\napproach towards globalization. The developing\ncountries should be allowed to pursue globalization at\ntheir own pace so as to enable them to develop social\nand institutional structures to fully benefit from the\nprocess while minimizing its negative impact. For\nmany countries, the price to be paid for globalization as\npresently interpreted, particularly the loss of\nindependence, would be simply too great for them to\nbear. This is not the time for us to re-examine the\nconcept of the nation State and the sovereignty of\nnations in order to accommodate the needs of the giant\nmultinational companies that operate across borders.\nIn the meantime, in order to brace themselves for\nthe full impact of globalization, developing countries\nmust forge enhanced cooperation among themselves in\na true spirit of South-South cooperation and on the\nbasis of mutually beneficial \u201csmart partnerships\u201d with\nthe involvement of the private sector. This would\nfacilitate a useful exchange of ideas and experience\namong them on the globalization process. Malaysia is\npleased to share those ideas and experiences with its\npartners from the developing countries, and has done\nso in the past several years in the context of the\nLangkawi international dialogue. We are pleased to see\nthat those dialogues have been emulated by Africa\nthrough the South African international dialogue.\nIndeed, in an increasingly complex future world it is\nonly appropriate for the developing countries to\ndevelop such synergies through strategic linkages\namong themselves as well as with the developed\ncountries.\nTo assist in the process of globalization, it is\nincumbent upon the international community to ensure\nthat the developing countries, particularly the least\ndeveloped among them, continue to receive\ndevelopment assistance to enable them to make the\nleap out of chronic poverty. Indeed, given the intrinsic\nlink between peace, security and development, the\nOrganization must continue to be in the vanguard of\nglobal developmental efforts, upon which so much of\nthe world depends. It is imperative for the United\nNations to carry out its developmental mission with\neven greater vigour at a time of increasingly scarce\nresources and exploding populations. This is where the\ncontinued role of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) can be especially critical, with\nadditional resources and more effective programmes,\nparticularly for vulnerable small island and landlocked\nStates and States in Africa, where in a number of cases\neconomic performance has fallen back rather than\nprogressed since independence.\nNotable gains have been made in several African\ncountries. However, Africa's ability to rise out of\nchronic poverty can be attained only with continued\ninternational assistance, including forgiveness of its\ncountries' external debt, without which many of them\nwill remain trapped in the vicious circle of poverty,\nviolence and natural or man-made disasters. In this\nregard, Malaysia reiterates its strong support for, and\nlooks forward to, the convening of an international\nconference on financing for development in the year\n2001 involving all major stakeholders, including the\nprivate sector. The convening of such a forum is\nimperative, as there can be no development without the\nnecessary financing to support it.\nAlong with the Millennium Summit, this session\nof the General Assembly will be remembered for,\namong other things, paving the way for the kind of\nUnited Nations that will eventually emerge to serve the\ninternational community, at least in the early decades\nof the twenty-first century. While the shifting patterns\nof relationships among nations have yet to find a final\nform and the future is far from clear, there is no\ndenying that in the increasingly complex and\ninterconnected world of tomorrow, the United Nations\nis likely to play an increasingly critical role. To that\nend the Organization must continuously place itself at\nthe forefront in the search for solutions to global\nproblems."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin my\nremarks by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\nthe General Assembly. I wish you much success in\nguiding the Assembly to a fruitful outcome and I\npledge to you the full support of the Liechtenstein\ndelegation. I would also like to congratulate the newest\nMember, Tuvalu, on its admission to the United\nNations and in particular, to welcome Tuvalu into the\ngroup of small countries.\n24\n\nI have had the honour of participating in the\ngeneral debate before, but this year is very special. It\nmarks the tenth anniversary of Liechtenstein's\nmembership in the United Nations. I would therefore\nlike to include in my remarks some of the issues to\nwhich Liechtenstein attaches particular importance in\nits United Nations engagement. For Liechtenstein, as\nfor many other countries, the United Nations stands for\nthe protection of human rights and human dignity and\nfor the promotion of common values.\nThe United Nations has been particularly\nchallenged during the last 12 months in playing its\nrightful role in the pursuit of peace and security.\nAlthough remarkable efforts have been made, some\nconflict situations still do not allow for effective\npeacekeeping to take place. When the Secretary-\nGeneral called last year for a culture of prevention, my\ndelegation fully supported his ideas and we still believe\nthat the prevention of conflicts must be the key concept\nin the maintenance of peace. We all know that\npreventing conflicts can save hundreds of thousands of\nlives. Political energy and enormous financial\nresources can be used for other purposes. The term\n`culture of prevention' entails a comprehensive\napproach to different kinds of problems. However,\npreventive approaches can be perceived as a threat to\nthe sovereignty of a State. The classic notion of the\nterm obviously no longer enables us to cope with the\nchanged realities of the world. The sovereignty of\nStates remains a cornerstone of the United Nations.\nCreating a culture of prevention is therefore a process\nthat requires a concerted effort by the United Nations\nmembership as a whole. Addressing the root causes of\nso many of today's internal conflicts will constitute a\nfurther step in meeting this humanitarian, political and\neconomic necessity. Liechtenstein has for several years\npromoted ideas and suggestions on a preventive\napproach with regard to problems arising from the\napplication of the right of self-determination. It is time\nto free ourselves of biased and obsolete thinking and to\nrecognize that the effective application and exercise of\nthe right of self-determination is the basis for\npreventing internal conflicts and the violent\ndisintegration of States.\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998 was an\nhistoric step. The conclusion of the work on the\nelements of crimes and the rules of procedure by the\nPreparatory Commission this summer was a further\nstep forward, and the ratification process is promising.\nWe hope to be able to contribute to the entry into force\nof the Statute soon. It is of crucial importance that the\nintegrity of the Rome Statute be maintained throughout\nthe remaining work to be done by the Preparatory\nCommission. The qualities of the ICC have often been\npraised. The ICC's potential for prevention is certainly\none of its outstanding characteristics. An effective\ncriminal court will make an important contribution to\nterminating the practice of impunity which has\nprevailed for so long without being seriously\nchallenged.\nLiechtenstein has always supported enhanced\nUnited Nations cooperation with regional\norganizations, inter alia,  the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as the\nCouncil of Europe, in particular in the areas of human\nrights, conflict prevention and post-conflict\nrehabilitation.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights\ncan also contribute to the prevention of conflicts. This\nis more than a legitimate concern for all of us  it is\nour duty. Ever since Liechtenstein became a Member of\nthe United Nations 10 years ago, this issue has been a\ntop priority. In recent years, human rights have become\nmore important in foreign policy and in the world\neconomy. There is increased awareness that human\nrights issues cannot be considered in an isolated\nmanner, since there is a clear connection between\nhuman rights and economic prosperity, social welfare,\nand peace and security.\nThe full enjoyment of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms by women must be the basis for\nfull equality in a stable society and we must continue\nto take further action in order to achieve the full\nadvancement and empowerment of women. Together\nwith 12 women Foreign Ministers, I last night signed a\nletter addressed to the Secretary-General in which we\nnoted the special needs of women in HIV/AIDS\nprevention, care and treatment, and called upon the\nUnited Nations membership to take into account the\nneed for an enhanced availability of education, testing,\ncounselling, care and treatment designed to address the\nspecific needs of women and girls.\nLiechtenstein fully supports the fight against\ntransnational organized crime, in particular trafficking\nin persons, and offences against children as well as the\nfight against money laundering. Financial crime is\n25\n\nincreasingly a key concern in today's open and global\nfinancial world, which is characterized by the high\nmobility of funds and the rapid development of new\npayment tools. In our view, international cooperation in\nthe global fight against money laundering can only be\nenhanced if all international financial services centres\nwork towards full implementation of internationally\nagreed standards, and my Government therefore fully\nsupports the objectives of the United Nations Global\nProgramme against Money Laundering (GPML)\nForum. The approach must, however, be transparent,\ninclusive and non-discriminatory, and the positive\naction already taken or being taken by individual\ncountries must be properly recognized. Any punitive\napproach, including the establishment of lists and the\nimposition of sanctions on individual jurisdictions, as\nwell as the failure to distinguish between the fight\nagainst money laundering and tax issues, runs counter\nto the spirit of international cooperation. We therefore\nregret, in particular, recent proceedings by some\ninternational and regional bodies directed against\ncertain financial centres, including Liechtenstein. The\nlack of transparency and the manner in which this was\ndone are not in conformity with the established\nprinciples and procedures of international cooperation.\nThese established principles and procedures must\nguide the cooperation between States and the resolution\nof difficulties they may have. International cooperation\nmust be handled in the same way when large States are\ndealing with small States and when small States are\ndealing with large States. No organization should be\nallowed to depart from established practice in\ninternational relations. Cooperation by small States\nmust never be interpreted as capitulation; cooperation\nimplies consideration of the rights and interests of all."

        "file_text": "I\nagain extend our congratulations to the President on his\nelection.\nThe Millennium Summit has charted for us a plan\nof action for the immediate future. We must\nconsistently bear that plan of action in mind as our\nmain priority, and direct all our work towards its\n11\n\neffective implementation. We cannot view the final\ndocument adopted by the most important gathering of\nworld leaders ever held as a mere expression of good\nintentions and act as though it were a matter of routine\nand as if nothing had happened.\nFirst, we must take action to ensure that the vast\nmajority of the human race living in developing\ncountries make significant progress towards the\nattainment of sustainable development. We must make\nspecial efforts with respect to the millions of men,\nwomen and children who live in poverty. They must be\ngiven means of subsistence, education and medical\ncare.\nOur most important shared instrument, the United\nNations, is currently ill-equipped for that enormous\ntask. We must therefore focus on giving it the power\nand means to play an effective role in that important\neffort. We believe that the United Nations must play a\ncentral role in the struggle for development. To that\nend, we must consider without delay ways to\nstrengthen the General Assembly, our most democratic\nand open institution. It is equally necessary to\nstrengthen the Organization's primary instrument in\nthis field, the Economic and Social Council, which\nshould become a real council for human development,\nwith authority and ability to act comparable to the\nSecurity Council's.\nThe message of the Millennium Summit is very\nclear: peace and development are equally important,\nand each depends on the other. The most urgent tasks\nin the struggle against poverty are also clear: to\nalleviate the debt burden of highly indebted poor\ncountries; to tackle the scourges of AIDS and malaria;\nand to provide education for all. In all of those tasks\nthe United Nations must play a leadership role.\nIn order to meet the established goals of reducing\nworld poverty by half by 2015, we must ensure that\nnational Government's measures adopted in accordance\nwith the social platform of United Nations conferences,\nto benefit their populations in the areas of health, food\nand education, are accompanied by international\ncooperation based on solidarity, in order that those\ntasks are carried out efficiently and promptly.\nIt is therefore particularly important, in order to\nsupport the objectives of, and strategies for, poverty\neradication, that developed countries meet their\ncommitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct to official development assistance.\nIt is equally urgent to ensure that the rules\nregulating international trade and finance are just and\nequitable, not only in theory but also in practice, so\nthat they lead to development for all, and not merely to\nthe further enrichment of a privileged minority.\nIn that regard, the high-level intergovernmental\nmeeting on financing for development, to be held next\nyear, should result in effective coordination and\nharmonization of all the efforts Governments and\ninternational organizations, so that those efforts may\nbear tangible fruits meeting the needs of all countries.\nThe United Nations must be the coordinating centre for\nthe World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions.\nWith regard to foreign debt, it is vital that the\ninternational community promote, on the basis of\nNorth-South dialogue, the adoption of concerted\nmeasures for the effective resolution of this problem,\nwhich is seriously weakening the sustained economic\ngrowth of developing countries affected by the\nexcessive burden of debt servicing. We believe that it\nwill be necessary to consider the timely rescheduling\non favourable terms of the international financial\ncommitments of developing countries, including highly\nindebted poor countries and medium-income countries.\nThe freeing of resources currently allocated to\ndebt payment will make it possible for those countries\nmore efficiently to meet the real needs of their\npopulations in the areas of food, health and education.\nIt will also promote their peoples' participation and full\nintegration within their respective societies. It is also\nnecessary to recognize the economic and social costs\nincurred by developing countries in meeting foreign\ndebt payments.\nShared responsibility in dealing with economic\nand social issues, as well as with regard to questions of\npeace, requires more intensive and effective\nparticipation by developing countries in the world\neconomy, particularly in decision-making and the\nformulation of international and economic norms.\nThe efforts of the developing countries towards\npoverty eradication, economic and social progress,\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment are dependent on a favourable\ninternational economic environment and on\ninternational cooperation for renewed and strengthened\ndevelopment. The magnitude and urgency of the\nchallenges facing us in the economic and social sphere\n12\n\nrequire the support of all Member States in order to\nrealize the aspirations of those who cry out for a more\nequitable and just world, in which poverty eradication\nand the promotion of development are a genuine\nexpression of international peace and stability.\nAs for our other main priority, the maintenance of\npeace, we must learn from our experience \u2014 both from\nour mistakes and from our achievements.\nThe United Nations must be provided with the\nmeans to anticipate and prevent conflicts, not just put\nan end to them once they have erupted.\nIn this respect, disarmament, including nuclear\ndisarmament, is vital, as is the elimination of the illicit\narms trade. Also key is the struggle against\ntransnational criminal activities such as terrorism and\nthe illicit drug trade.\nIn this context, we welcome the proposal of the\nSecretary-General to convene an international\nconference on the reduction of the nuclear threat. We\nbelieve that this could help strengthen the commitment\nto eliminate nuclear weapons, as recently agreed at the\nsixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nVenezuela supports the convening of the United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next\nyear. That Conference will be a perfect opportunity for\nus to combine our efforts to adopt measures of\ncooperation to eliminate this illicit activity, which has\nlinks to organized transnational crime and is\nencouraged by unscrupulous groups or individuals who\nact unlawfully.\nThe role of the United Nations as the only forum\nempowered to authorize the use of force must be\nreaffirmed, without distinctions or exceptions, apart\nfrom self-defence, which in turn must be in strict\ncompliance with the provisions of the Charter.\nIt is urgent to this end to make effective progress\ntowards reform of the Security Council. This does not\nmean mere cosmetic change, but rather real reform,\nwith a view to ensuring its credibility as a democratic,\ntransparent and impartial organ in which no country\nhas the right to block, through the use of the veto,\naction agreed by the majority.\nIf we wish the Millennium Summit to have real\nsignificance, if we want it to be remembered not only\nbecause of the milestone represented by the\nparticipation of an unprecedented number of world\nleaders, we must take concrete action at this session of\nthe General Assembly. Towards that end, Venezuela\nfully supports the proposal made recently by the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay to create a\nworking group to ensure implementation of the\nMillennium Summit Declaration. We believe that this\ngroup should be open to participation by all Member\nStates. We believe also that the representatives of the\ncountries that co-chaired the Summit and those that\npresided over the four round tables, as well as the\nChairmen of the regional groups, should participate\nactively in this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I express my sincere\ncongratulations to the President on his election. I am\ncertain his qualities and skills will bring a successful\nconclusion to the fifty-fifth session. May I also extend\ncongratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, his\npredecessor, on what he achieved. Finally, I endorse\nthe European Union's priorities paper, which was\ndeveloped by Hubert Vedrine, the President of the\nCouncil of the European Union.\nSome believe that violence might be an intrinsic\npart of humanity. But so are humanity's relentless\nefforts to rule out violence, regulate antagonism,\npeacefully resolve confrontational situations and\nprevent hatred and prejudice. Whether we come\ntogether to understand each other or to debate each\nother, our goal has always been to better our lives and\nbuild a more secure future.\nSince ancient times, we have attempted to\nestablish norms of peaceful coexistence. In this effort,\nwe have built traditions and religions, as well as\npolitical structures. Through these norms we have tried\nto battle a fate seemingly dictated by force, poverty,\noppression, prejudice, chronic and communicable\ndiseases, inequality and a withering environment.\nThroughout history, our efforts have taken\nvarious forms. But they have all commenced with a\nunique first step: the overriding principle that, in order\nto solve our problems, we need to work together.\nThis month is being marked by two events that\nwill bring the peoples of our world much closer: the\nMillennium Assembly and the Olympic Games. At the\ndawn of the twenty-first century, nations will meet,\ncompete, clash, differ and disagree. Yet our world has\nnever looked more united or more determined to tackle\nits problems as one, indivisible community.\nIn the current environment, our efforts to build a\nbetter world for our children can and ought to be pan-\ncosmic. We can all contribute to a future that inspires\nour children and inspires the will to grow and to create.\nAs the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has very\nwisely said,\n\u201cWe face global challenges which oblige us\nto work together. If that is true in the economic\nand social sphere, it applies even more to the\nchallenge of massacre and war\u201d.\nThese words command even more authority coming\nfrom a man whose political skill, moral authority and\ndevotion have contributed, in numerous cases, to the\nresolution of conflicting issues.\nWhen a child misses its childhood and its\neducation because it is in a dark prison cell, when a\nchild is maimed from the explosion of a mine or when\na child dies of hunger, of AIDS or in war, we do not\nwitness just a tragic event. We do not witness only the\nsad state of some distant community. In today's world,\nwhen we see a child die, we lose another ray of hope\nthat our global community will come together as one,\nthat we shall live in peace and that we will finally\ntackle the challenges we all face together.\nIn Greece, we have become deeply conscious of\nthis reality. What goes on in our neighbourhood\ndirectly affects the way in which our children will grow\nand develop. So we have made a commitment to our\nworld and, more specifically, to our region, and it is\nthis commitment that I have come to share with the\nAssembly today.\nThe two global events of this September \u2014 this\nAssembly and the Olympic Games \u2014 symbolize the\nbeginning of an era for my country. After this\nministerial week of the General Assembly, Greece will\nraise the Olympic flag in Sydney. For the second time\nin almost a century, the international community will\nbestow upon Athens the responsibility of the\nOlympiad.\nOver the next four years, Athens has committed\nitself to run both an athletic and a cultural Olympiad.\nToday, I commit our county to an Olympiad for peace:\nfour years of the most relentless efforts and a\ncommitment to the international community to fight\nagainst the evils that have kept our community of\nnations at war, under totalitarianism and under\noppression.\nI pledge today that when the Olympic flame of\nour ancestors rises over the Athenian sky, it will light\nup more than a shiny stadium. It will light up a whole\narea of fighting for peace, democracy and justice. The\nnext four years \u2014 the years that coincide with this\nGreek Olympiad \u2014 will set of the stage upon which\n33\n\nthe future event will unfold. The globalization of the\neconomy, the increased power of the media and rapid\ndevelopments in information technology,\ncommunications and biotechnology are just some of\nthese new challenges.\nGlobalization, while creating incredible wealth\nfor many, fosters conditions for conflict and poverty.\nThe new economy cannot be dominated by interests,\nand must be monitored to promote both democracy and\nhuman security. For the next four years, Greece will\ntake an active role in international forums to do its part\nin dealing with this problem of globalization. That is\nwhy Greece has also enthusiastically accepted an\ninvitation to join the Human Security Network.\nHuman rights laws alone cannot provide for\nhuman rights; they must be strengthened by civic\nresponsibility and democratic institutions. We need to\ncreate structures that will reach beyond the democratic\ndeficits of the global community. We need to create\nregional cooperation, build civic structures and\ncommunity services and work with non-governmental\norganizations. We need to educate our citizens and our\nsocieties in making this process their own and allow\ntheir voice to be heard.\nThis, in our view, is the role of the United\nNations. This honourable Organization can and must\nbridge the gap between the global challenges we face\nand the democratic deficits that exist in our global\nculture. We believe that now is the time to turn the\nUnited Nations from an Organization working to\nglobalize democracy into an Organization that is also\nable to democratize the process of globalization. The\nMillennium Summit agenda is proof that the\ninternational community shares these views.\nInitiatives taken within the United Nations can\nmake our world a better place. Let me use a single but\npowerful example. On 7 September, nations were\ninvited to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the\ninvolvement of children in armed conflicts.\nWhatever the causes of modern-day brutality\ntowards children, the time has come to call for a halt \u2014\nto call for a truce. The most fundamental principle is\nthat children should have no part in war. This is only\none of the initiatives that Greece will actively support\nin the international arena in the coming years.\nAt the same time, our view of the purpose of\ninternational organizations comes from the rich\nexperience we have amassed in our region. Starting\nwith the war in Kosovo, my country has been deeply\ninvolved in the events unfolding in the area. We\nbelieve that the lessons of this involvement can greatly\ncontribute to the work of these organizations. We are\neager to share our experience with the international\ncommunity.\nWe believe that stability in our region is a\nprerequisite for Greek security, and we define stability\nto mean the practice of democracy, the strengthening of\ninstitutions that provide transparency and\naccountability, the reduction of economic inequalities\nand the rule of law in our societies and between our\ncountries. Our security lies in being a member of the\nEuropean Union and of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization, and we work so that countries in the\nregion may benefit from the stabilizing influence of\ntheir future membership in these institutions.\nDuring the Kosovo war, my colleagues in\nneighbouring countries and I decided to cooperate\nclosely to alleviate human suffering and avoid further\ninstability in our region. We grew to understand that\nour fates were intrinsically linked. As a result, we were\ncompelled to discover ways to increase our cooperation\nand effectiveness in dealing with our problems. We\nwould otherwise have been condemned to constant\nstrife, conflict and isolation in the world. In the next\nfour years, Greece will build upon this base. We are\ndetermined to transform the plight of a war and its\nbrutal memories into an opportunity for generations to\ncome.\nThrough this process, I hope that Greece has\nmanaged to inspire in the international community the\nimportance of a consistent, universal and unifying\npolicy towards South-Eastern Europe. From Bosnia to\nCyprus, we have the same objectives: we want the\ncountries in the region to be integral, peaceful and\ndemocratic; we want them to remain multicultural; and\nwe want them to join the European Union. Yugoslavia,\ntoo, is an essential part of this political framework. We\nstrongly desire to see the return of Yugoslavia to\nEurope. I would like to endorse my Romanian\ncolleague's call to rethink our policy on sanctions,\nwhich often do more to serve purposes contrary to\nthose for which we are striving.\n34\n\nThat is our message. Even though it is simple\nsounding, our message is a radical break from the past,\nwhen favouritism, cold-war intricacies and double\nstandards consistently broke the spirit of the people in\nthe region. Now is the time to put an end to that. We\nmust stop redrawing borders around ethnically\nhomogeneous communities while compelling them to\nseek the favours of greater Powers. In the next four\nyears, we will commit Greece to an effort to transform\nthe multitude of races, religions and ethnicities in the\nregion into an instrument of solidarity and stability \u2014\na beautiful kaleidoscope of creative, multicultural\ncooperation.\nGreece's vision for the Balkans is one of a region\nin which democracy finally becomes the norm; where\ncitizens' aspirations can finally be realized through\npeaceful and democratic practices; where the rights of\nminorities are respected; and where Governments are\naccountable, economies are transparent and politics\nallow for the fullest participation of all elements of\nsociety.\nThe world has a responsibility in supporting this\nvision for our region. We need to empower the region,\nwhich has historically been handicapped, dependent\nand divided by a world community of competing\ninterests and a babble of conflicting signals. This\nbalkanization of the region must be replaced by\ncoordination of international efforts.\nThis is why we have actively supported and\npromoted this new vision within the international\ncommunity. Last year our efforts helped more than 40\ncountries develop a unique contract between the\ninternational community and south-eastern Europe. The\ncontract was coined the Stability Pact. We have a clear\nsense of how the Stability Pact can achieve its goals\nand it is an optimistic sign that the European Union,\nthe United States and Russia cooperate closely within\nits framework. Regional integration can also be\nachieved as the Stability Pact promotes investment in\ninfrastructure projects. Education is a primary goal and\na strategy for democratic leadership and institution-\nbuilding, which will stimulate economic growth and\nwill bring us together. The pact actively promotes\nrespect for the rule law among States and peoples in\nthe region.\nOur stand in international organizations and our\nagenda for the next four years is coloured also by our\nrecent experience with Turkey. The earthquakes that\nshook Greece and Turkey a year ago created a new\nclimate for the first time in our recent history. Tragedy\ngenerated a genuine feeling of human warmth.\nSpontaneous and dramatic acts of fraternity and\nsolidarity were expressed. Our mandate was clear. Our\npeoples desire to live in peace together.\nSince the earthquakes, Greeks and Turks are\nusing every opportunity to explore their newly found\nneighbours, and to come together, meet, exchange\nexperiences and make up for lost time. On a bilateral\nlevel we have signed 10 agreements that will radically\nchange the environment in which we interact; in one\nyear, 10 agreements. We do not view these\ndevelopments as a momentary result of what was lately\ncoined as seismic diplomacy. We view them as the\nbeginning of a long process that will radically affect\nour lives in the coming years.\nWe have opened a dialogue; one that is honest.\nAnd although we may differ and do differ on many\nissues, such as how we see Cyprus or how we approach\nour bilateral relations, this open approach can only lead\nto a progressive resolution of our problems. When I\nspeak today I know that those of the Turkish side will\nnot or may not agree on many issues. But they know\nwe are honest. We are honest in what we say and in our\ndesire for a new and peaceful relation.\nI believe that Greece and Turkey have no choice\nbut to explore new avenues for cooperation. I believe\nour mutual interests can outweigh our political\ndifferences. We can and must resolve these differences\nthrough peaceful means; peaceful means of that of the\nInternational Court of Justice.\nThe European Union's decision to upgrade\nTurkey's status to that of a candidate country in\nHelsinki in December marked an historic turning point\nin Greek-Turkish relations. Helsinki does not signal the\nend of Greece's efforts; it represents the beginning of a\nnew and equally courageous Greek initiative. In this\ncontext, we are ready also to further discuss\nconfidence-building measures between Greece and\nTurkey.\nI do not want to give the false impression that all\nour problems have suddenly been resolved. It is also\nmost distressing that a variety of statements and acts\nstill undermine this genuine and difficult effort, and\nthere are those who certainly may wish that our efforts\nwill fail. It is our historical duty to overcome these\n35\n\ndifficulties and maintain the momentum in response to\nour peoples' mandate for peace.\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General and\nall those who labour with him towards a just solution in\nCyprus: a solution based on United Nations resolutions\nfor a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation in one\ninternational personality, one citizenship and one\nsovereignty.\nAt this time, I would appeal to him to move\nforward with the peace talks on this basis. The\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions is not\nonly important for Cyprus. It is important for the moral\nstanding of this all-important Organization. Double\nstandards and inaction only serve to undermine the\ncredibility of this Organization in the eyes of so many\ncountries and peoples.\nOne cannot accept developments such as those\nthat recently took place in Strovilia. This responsibility\nrests with the United Nations, with the guarantor\npowers and all those who have a say in international\ndevelopments. It has become obvious that the current\nsituation in Cyprus and its occupation by foreign forces\nchallenges the integrity and credibility of this\nhonourable Organization. I know this term may be\npainful, but Cyprus is an occupied island, and this must\nend. We need to go beyond the situation and it will take\ncourage; courage from all involved.\nA solution to the Cyprus problem can and should\nbe seen as a win-win situation. It is vital for peace,\nstability and security in our region. I truly believe that\nthe Greek-Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriot\ncommunities can find solutions, and we must allow\nthem to live together peacefully. We can aid them in\nthis process. Greece and Turkey can aid them. Cyprus\nwill either unite us or divide us, Greece and Turkey.\nWe have a responsibility to cooperate on Cyprus and to\nfacilitate the solution to this process. Greece and\nTurkey, through their rapprochement, share a rare\nopportunity to help the citizens of Cyprus rebuild their\nisland, their homes and their dreams. The outcome of\nthese efforts should be that every Cypriot enjoys safety,\nequality under the law, protection of their human\nrights, appropriate representation and security under a\nEuropean roof.\nCyprus, Turkey and Greece: for anyone willing to\nenvision the future, our futures are as interwoven as\nour histories. A reunified federal Cyprus, member of\nthe European Union, will not only serve the European\naspiration for stability in the region, but the aspirations\nof every citizen in every one of the countries involved.\nI extend my appeal to the Turkish Cypriots. We\nwant them near us, in our wider European family. In\nthis family we do not only guarantee them the\nsolidarity of the Greek people, but also the\ncommitment of the Greek Government. Our citizens\nwill only master the great possibilities that lie ahead if\nthis last wall in Cyprus comes tumbling down.\nOur experience in our region, our rapprochement\nwith Turkey and our consistent efforts for a just\nsolution in Cyprus have given Greece a new voice in\nthe international community. We treasure our new\ncapacity and intend to grow it further. During our\nOlympiad for Peace we plan to keep a close eye on\ndevelopments in the Middle East, always seeking\nmethods to facilitate the hopeful process. We shall\nfollow closely developments in the South and\nparticularly in Africa, a continent for which the Greek\npeople share a special place in their hearts. Our\nemphasis will be on children: their rights, their right to\navoid a violent life.\nOur concentration in our Olympiad for Peace will\nbe on international initiatives in which our country can\nplay a role. Drawing on our ancient traditions, we are\nworking to re-establish the practice of Olympic Truce.\nWe aspire to the day when the tradition of suspending\nall hostilities during the Olympic Games becomes the\nseed for a more lasting peace. Huge amounts of\nresources are wasted on military procurements and war,\nand they must be channelled into health, education,\nculture and sport. To this end and in close cooperation\nwith the International Olympic Committee and\nPresident Samaranch, we have established the\nInternational Centre for Olympic Truce in Greece.\nIn both ancient and modern Greek, the word for\ntruce is ekecheiria. It has a dual meaning. It means\nsetting one's weapons aside, but it also means reaching\nout one's hand in friendship. We do not simply aspire\nto a momentary truce, but to a continuous truce, an\nactive truce.\nThe concept of Olympic Truce can complement\nthe work of national and international organizations\nspecializing in conflict prevention and resolution and\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\nsharing similar objectives. The Centre in Olympia will\noffer a sanctuary to support peace-building. This year\nwe hosted children from war-torn areas in the Balkans.\n36\n\nTruce in Bosnia in 1992 allowed for children to be\ninoculated. Truce in Sidney this year will allow for\nNorth and South Korean teams to march under the\nsame flags: an historic moment.\nI started my address by saying that people coming\ntogether has always been the prerequisite for building a\nbetter world and a more secure future. I conclude by\nappeal to members. Take this ancient tradition, which\nby now is no longer exclusively Greek. It has become\nuniversal. Use this tool to complement efforts and\ninspire the younger generation for peace and\ncooperation, going beyond ethnic, racial, religious or\nother divisions.\nThis is the objective of the Olympic Truce. And\nthis is the foundation upon which Greece shall build its\nfour-year Olympiad for Peace."

Remarkable ideas and proposals\nwere voiced and a Summit Declaration was adopted.\nThe time that we have to fulfil the commitments made\nby our leaders at the Millennium Summit has already\nbegun to elapse.\nThe twentieth century is coming to an end.\nHumankind will recall this century as an epoch of\noutstanding contrasts: scientific-technological and\nspiritual-intellectual progress, the bloodshed of two\nworld wars, the collapse of empires, the emergence of\nnew sovereign States, the cold war and collective\nefforts for the sake of peace and stability. What will the\nworld be like in the approaching century?\nThe end of the confrontation of two systems and\nthe prevalence of ideas about democracy and the free\nmarket should contribute to the formation of a world in\nwhich the interests of all States are taken into account\nand a genuine and equal partnership is established.\nHowever, an analysis of the development of the\ninternational environment leads us to the bitter\nconclusion that stereotypes of rivalry are still alive. We\nare living through a very difficult period, when a single\nwrong step could destabilize  the situation and,\ntragically, lead to a return to the past. We have a long\nway to go to build a just and secure world order. It can\nbe achieved only by the joint efforts of all States, large\nand small, rich and poor, developed and developing.\nThe year 2001 has been declared the United\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. We are\nconvinced that we should not let this opportunity slip\nby, and should use this dialogue to consider together\nthe prospects for resolving the complex problems\nfacing humankind.\nThe year 2001 will also stand out because of\nanother remarkable event: the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly to review the outcome of the World\nSummit for Children, which will be held next\nSeptember. I believe that I do not need to underline its\nsignificance. As a member of the Executive Board of\nthe United Nations Children's Fund, my country is\nactively participating in the preparations for this\nimportant event.\nThe fact that both of these events are being held\nat the juncture of two millenniums is highly symbolic\nand should contribute to the achievement of a\nqualitatively new level of interaction among States\naimed at global progress.\nGlobalization is the main feature of the current\nstage of the development of the world economy. It is a\ncomplex and objective process. Countries are\nconcerned about the prospects of this phenomenon.\nWhile opening up new possibilities for developing\neconomies, ensuring sustainable development and\nimproving the welfare of peoples, globalization could\nalso have tangible negative consequences for States\nwith economies in transition and for developing\ncountries.\nIn this regard, I would like to underline that the\nUnited Nations must make fuller use of its capacities,\nas well as those of its specialized agencies, to assist\nStates in anticipating and ensuring the early prevention\nof the possible negative consequences of globalization\nand the increasing interdependency of States. The\nUnited Nations is called upon to continue to play a key\nand effective role in strengthening international\neconomic cooperation and advising States on all major\nissues of global development.\nAzerbaijan is making its own contribution to the\ndevelopment of the process of globalization. Located at\nthe point where Europe and Asia meet, with a\ndiversified economy and rich in natural resources,\nincluding hydrocarbons, my country serves as an\neffective link in the development of East-West and\nNorth-South cooperation. Azerbaijan is actively\nparticipating in projects for the development and\ntransportation to international markets of the\nhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea, as well as in\nthe project to restore the Great Silk Road, all of which\nare of global importance.\n5\n\nAzerbaijan, together with a number of the Great\nSilk Road countries, is currently working on a new\nlandmark project, SILKSAT, to provide the countries of\nthe Great Silk Road with a global satellite\ntelecommunications system, in addition to existing\ncommunication lines. These projects are crucial to\nenhancing trade and industrial ties among the\nparticipating countries, developing their economies and\nmaking them interactive and strengthening their\nintegration into the global world economy.\nHowever, external threats, internal problems,\noutside pressures and involvement in the struggle for\nspheres of influence are depriving these young and\nfragile democracies of the opportunity freely to carry\nout policies that would respond to the interests and\nexpectations of their people, to strengthen and improve\ntheir statehood and to engage in peaceful development.\nSince their very inception, they have been forced to\nfight a difficult battle for independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity.\nAs the victims of aggression, seizure of their\nterritory, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, aggressive separatism and\nterrorism, these States rightly expect the United\nNations to take the most effective action to create a just\nand secure world and to protect the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Unfortunately, the southern\nCaucasus has become a region where all of these\nproblems, threats and risks have their explicit\nmanifestation.\nThe main destabilizing factor of the situation in\nthe southern Caucasus has been the aggression of\nArmenia against Azerbaijan, which has brought\nincalculable tragedy to millions of people. As a result\nof the aggression, Armenian armed forces have\noccupied 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan,\ncarried out \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and ousted 1 million\nAzerbaijanis from their homes. In this connection, the\nUnited Nations Security Council adopted four\nresolutions which unequivocally reconfirmed the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the\nborders of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and called for\nthe immediate and unconditional withdrawal of\nArmenian armed forces from all of the occupied\nterritories of Azerbaijan. However, from 1993 to date,\nthose Security Council resolutions have remained a\ndead letter.\nSince 1992, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been engaged in\nbrokering a settlement of the conflict between Armenia\nand Azerbaijan, but its activities have not been\nsuccessful. Bilateral discussions between the Presidents\nof Azerbaijan and Armenia are continuing, but they,\ntoo, have failed to produce results. The two countries\nhave observed a ceasefire for the last six years, but it is\nnot a solution to the problem.\nWe call on the United Nations to take all\nnecessary measures to implement the Security Council\nresolutions. Peace and security in the region cannot be\nachieved without a settlement of the conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, as well as other regional\nconflicts, and the removal of external pressure,\nincluding foreign military presence. Bringing political\nintegrity and neutrality to the southern Caucasus would\nmake possible the establishment of a normal\nrelationship among the States of the region and ensure\ntheir harmonious integration into the world economic\nsystem.\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the\norganizations of the United Nations system and to\ndonor countries for their assistance to Azerbaijani\nrefugees and displaced persons, who have been living\nin great distress for over eight years. Of critical\nimportance to us is the continuation of and increase in\nthe humanitarian assistance being provided to them\nuntil they can return to their homes.\nThe United Nations is the key forum for\ncoordinating inter-State relations. The need to make\nsignificant efforts to enhance the Organization's\neffectiveness is not in doubt. In recent years, under the\nleadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, a\nserious evaluation of the resources and capacities of the\nUnited Nations, as well as of the Organization's\nactivities in the post-cold-war decade, has been made.\nWe had never before heard such self-criticism as that\nexpressed in the reports on tragedies in Srebrenica,\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. In this general\ncontext, we commend and support the Secretary-\nGeneral's efforts to reform the United Nations.\nThe United Nations bears great responsibility for\nthe fate of the world, and we place our hopes in it.\nSerious and rational reforms should increase the\neffectiveness of the Organization and, first and\nforemost, of the Security Council. Given the Council's\nspecial significance, the question of adopting reform\ndecisions by two thirds of the Member States has been\n6\n\naffirmed by a consensus resolution of the General\nAssembly. Azerbaijan fully supports such an approach.\nWe also believe that the representation of the\nStates of Asia, Africa and Latin America in the\nSecurity Council should be in keeping with modern\npolitical realities. We have already expressed, and\ntoday we reconfirm, our support for the election of\nGermany and Japan as permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. At the same time, I would like to\npoint out that one additional non-permanent seat should\nbe allocated to the Group of Eastern European States\nbecause of the unprecedented doubling in the\nmembership of the Group. Otherwise, each country of\nthe Eastern European Group could only be elected a\nnon-permanent member of the Council once every 38\nyears.\nWe have studied with great interest the Brahimi\nreport on strengthening United Nations peacekeeping\ncapacities. We would not like the ideas and\nrecommendations contained in that remarkable report\nto remain a dead letter.\nWe also hope that the International Criminal\nCourt will become an effective organ to bring to\njustice, on behalf of the international community, those\nwho have committed war crimes, genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity and the crime of aggression. Should\nthe Court become hostage to the interests of various\ngroups of States and to the practice of double standards\nrather than being guided by international legal norms\nequal for all, perpetrators will go unpunished.\nAzerbaijan is interested in taking an active part in\ncombating international terrorism, organized crime and\nillegal drug trafficking. The fight against those\nproblems, which are growing in scale, can be effective\nonly with the concerted efforts of all countries at both\nthe regional and the global levels.\nIn this connection, I would like to draw attention\nto a proposal made by the group of States that includes\nGeorgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova\n(GUUAM) on the establishment of an international\nanti-terrorism centre.\nSpeaking of GUUAM in a wider context, I would\nlike to stress that the meeting of the GUUAM heads of\nState during the Millennium Summit could be\ncharacterized as a landmark in the history of the group.\nThe New York memorandum adopted at the meeting\nconfirms the orientation of the GUUAM States towards\nfurther developing mutually beneficial and\nmultifaceted cooperation in various spheres.\nThere is yet another urgent issue whose resolution\ncannot be postponed. I am speaking of the difficult\nfinancial situation of our Organization that has arisen\nas a result of delays by Member States in making their\ncontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets.\nMember States should fulfil their financial obligations\nto the Organization in full, on time and without any\nconditions.\nAt the same time, our delegation believes that the\ntime has come to reconsider the current scale of\nassessments for both the regular and the peacekeeping\nbudgets. We are ready to cooperate constructively with\nother delegations on this matter. We believe that the\nprinciple of a State's capacity to pay should be the\nbasis for the future reform of the scale of assessments.\nOur Organization is designed to play a leading\nrole in overcoming obstacles to global peace and\nprogress. I would like to underscore our collective\nresponsibility for peace and security on our planet, and\nto express my confidence that the results of the\nMillennium Summit and the entire fifty-fifth session of\nthe General Assembly will become a reliable basis for\nachieving a more stable and peaceful twenty-first\ncentury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, at the\noutset to congratulate you heartily on your election to\nthe Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a\nclose friend and partner within the Nordic community.\nWe wish you success with this challenging task and\npledge to you the full support of the Icelandic\ndelegation.\nThe Millennium Declaration provides the\ncommitments of the world community in the new\ncentury. To prevent conflicts, maintain international\npeace and security and make peace an achievable goal\nat the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue\nstrengthening the United Nations and the international\nlegal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported\nverifiable arms control and arms reduction measures\nand will continue to support realistic disarmament\nproposals aiming at maximum security with a\nminimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the\nenormous sums being spent on weapons, while the\nmoney could be used to significantly improve the lives\nof millions.\nToday, when there is an obvious need to assess\nthe United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping\noperations, it has proved extremely important to have a\nSecretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of\nthe matter through his own experience. I would like to\ncommend the Secretary-General for taking the\ninitiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the\nfield to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi\nreport. Its recommendations should be implemented as\nsoon as possible.\nEven though my country does not have a military,\nit has been able to participate in peacekeeping\noperations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing\nmedical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of\nlaw, the media and women's rights. We have noted with\ninterest the recommendations made in the Brahimi\nreport concerning the non-military aspects of peace\noperations. We will be studying them carefully now\nthat we are in the process of looking into how we can\nstrengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the\nfuture.\nThe report states that expressions of general\nsupport in the form of statements and resolutions must\nbe followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking\nthese words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making.\nIn the preparations for the Millennium Assembly,\nthe Secretary-General encouraged Member States to\nengage more effectively in the international legal\nframework by acceding to a number of legal\ninstruments. One to which Iceland has decided to\naccede is the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel.\nThe Security Council has the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded\nin reflecting the tremendous changes in the\ninternational arena which have taken place since its\nestablishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years\nto come, the reform process has to be accelerated.\nThe rules of international law governing the\nrelations between States are now well established; this\nalso applies in the fields of human rights and\nhumanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and\nobligations of States and individuals. But ground rules\ndo not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them.\nThere are mechanisms to ensure respect and\ncompliance with these rules, such as the General\nAssembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping\nmissions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an\neffective international court system should be available\nto bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the\nsame time serving to deter potential perpetrators.\nWith this in mind, I believe that the greatest\nachievements towards strengthening the international\nlegal system in recent years have been the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunals\nfor the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda\nand the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the\nRome Statute and encourages all other States to do so.\nI welcome the proposal to include cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\nin the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I\nhad the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of\nthe Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well\naware of the important contribution made by the\nCouncil to peace and stability in Europe, especially in\nthe field of human rights. The United Nations, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations\n14\n\nresponded to the serious situation in the Balkans by\njoining forces and working together to make\nreconstruction achievable.\nIn Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter-\nethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements\ncannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by\nthe international community. One ethnic group must\nnot be allowed to win at the expense of another. The\nKosovars have been provided with a unique\nopportunity to build a just community in the region \u2014\na community where the fundamental freedoms and\nrights of every individual and minority group are\nrespected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are\nKosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation\nfor lasting peace and stability for future generations.\nThe same can be said about similar situations\nelsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nThe international community has taken on an\nenormous task in building a whole new civic structure\nwithin Kosovo. The development of a legal system and\nfree media have been two challenging tasks. The\nelections to take place in October are also going to be\nchallenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an\norderly and peaceful manner.\nIt is very important to include women in the\npolitical process. In this respect, I would like to\ncommend the United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in\nKosovo, not only in the political field but also in\nfighting violence against women and in promoting\nwomen's participation in economic activities.\nThe importance of human rights in securing long-\nterm stability and security, both within and between\ncountries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore\nessential that no compromises be accepted in this field,\nand our aims should remain high.\nThe Security Council should be commended for\ndiscussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security\nthreat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in\nsub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of\nchildren and armed conflict. The discussion in the\nCouncil has served to concentrate the attention of the\ninternational community on these issues and led the\nway for others to take the measures required. Both\nissues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect\nthem to feature prominently on the agenda of next\nyear's special session to follow up the World Summit\nfor Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\nenormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international\nefforts to combat it.\nThe rights of women were significantly enhanced\nwith the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the\nProtocol and is preparing its ratification.\nI cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of\nthose women around the world who are still enduring\nmajor human rights abuses, including female genital\nmutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions\non their freedom of movement and the right to work.\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Prime\nMinister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland\nwelcomes their adoption and hopes that they will\nfurther secure the human rights of children.\nWe have to put extra effort into working towards\nthe elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying\nto note the trend towards increasing racism and\nxenophobia in certain parts of the world, including\nEurope. This needs to be fought at all levels. The\nWorld Conference to be held in South Africa next year\nwill without doubt play an important role. Iceland\nwelcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of\nhistory, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it.\nAs reflected in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral, \u201cWe the peoples\u201d, fighting poverty remains\none of the main challenges to the United Nations.\nPeople living in poverty do not have the opportunity to\nexercise many of their fundamental rights and\nfreedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of\nglobalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as\ndecided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to\nbe done. Globalization and new technologies offer\nmany opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate\nthan in the past.\nWe have been strengthening our development\ncooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the\nbilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of\nAfrican countries with a focus on strengthening their\nfishing industry and education and health areas, with\nthe potential to positively alter the lives of people in\nneed. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing\nto the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\n15\n\nthrough the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund.\nMost of our decisions are based on compromises,\nin which each and every one of us has to give a little in\norder to reach an agreement. It is very important to\nkeep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance,\nbut also when the time comes for us to pay our dues,\nboth to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping\nbudget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this\nOrganization that all Members pay their contributions\nfully, on time and without any conditions.\nIn recent years, the oceans of the world have\nreceived increased attention in the General Assembly.\nWe welcome this development. Iceland's economy is\nbased on the sustainable harvest of living marine\nresources. The health and responsible stewardship of\nthe oceans are therefore of critical importance to us.\nLast year, we resolved to improve United Nations\ncoordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that\nend, we established an Informal Consultative Process\nto discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceans\nand the law of the sea. I was pleased with the\nimplementation of this decision of the first Meeting of\nthis Process last spring.\nHowever, we must act carefully when seeking to\nimprove our coordination and cooperation in this area.\nOcean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level\nand be consistent with the rights and obligations laid\ndown in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We\nmust fully respect the sovereign right of States over\ntheir natural resources and the competence of existing\ninternational organizations. Above all, the integrity of\nthe Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful\nthat the Convention provides the legal framework\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must\nbe carried out.\nThe United Nations specialized agencies have an\nimportant role to play in promoting the conservation\nand sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this\nrespect is marine scientific research. We need more\naccurate and policy-oriented information on the state of\nthe oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a\nworthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process\non Ocean Affairs.\nAt the onset of a new millennium, it is more\npressing than ever before to ensure the access of people\nin the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to\nreadily available and sustainable energy. Today, about\none third of the world's population does not have such\naccess, and this situation is obviously a serious\nobstacle to the development of these communities. In\nmy country, we have been able to bring sustainable\nenergy to all households in the country. We are sharing\nour experience and knowledge with the developing\ncountries through the United Nations University\nGeothermal Training Programme, which is located in\nIceland and funded by my Government.\nThe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a\nmomentum for building a secure future for humankind\nand life on Earth under the banner of sustainable\ndevelopment. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a\nglobal conference to take stock of the progress made in\nmeeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and\nthe other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have\nnot been able to live up to all the expectations raised in\nRio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the\nprogress that we have made.\nThe concept of sustainable development has truly\nbecome accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in\nenvironmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own\ncountry, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe\nthat we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use\nregime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy\necosystem and a robust economy. Regional and\ninternational efforts to prevent the pollution of the\noceans have continued to gather strength and we can\nexpect further efforts, in particular to control pollution\nfrom land-based sources.\nIt is my belief that, in charting a course for the\nfuture, we should be looking at success stories and\nlearning from them, rather than concentrating on the\nobstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but\nnot the doom-sayers."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to sincerely congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of this, the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session, which serves as a\nbridge between two millennia. I would like to assure\nyou that you will have the full cooperation of my\ndelegation. I would also like to pay homage to your\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the valuable\ncontribution he made to the work of this Assembly, as\nwell as for his contribution to the preparations for the\nMillennium Summit.\n14\n\nDuring that Summit, less than one week ago, the\nheads of State and Government of the Member States\nof the United Nations adopted a Declaration. The\nspecific commitments and objectives contained in that\nDeclaration pose a complex challenge. Their\nimplementation will require sustained efforts on the\npart of each of the members of the international\ncommunity. In making those efforts, all of us  small\nand large, rich and poor  should keep in mind the\ncommon responsibility we bear for the future of our\ncivilization.\nThe Secretary-General's millennium report and\nthe Declaration it inspired reflect with the greatest\neloquence the tasks and the requirements, as well as the\nworries and fears, facing our planet. And those ideas\nhave been expressed at an opportune moment: the\nthreshold of the new millennium. By taking up the\nwork of implementing this major programme of action,\nwe will be undertaking the indispensable process of\naddressing the increasingly pressing global problems\nwe are facing.\nOne of the great lessons of the decade that has\njust passed, and also of the Millennium Summit, is that\nwith the vanishing of the bipolar world order, East-\nWest confrontation has been replaced by North-South\nproblems. We believe that everything possible must be\ndone so that this divide does not become rigid and so\nthat the problems and difficulties it poses do not persist\nfor too long. The Secretary-General's millennium\nreport, the document adopted during the Summit of\nheads of State and Government, the many speeches we\nheard during the Summit  they all show that the\ninternational community recognizes and has assessed\nthe scale of the challenges that globalization is forcing\nit to take up, and they show that the international\ncommunity is searching for solutions to pressing\nissues, with the goal of reducing the appalling\ndisparities in the world. There are many such issues\nand problems. They include poverty, the increasing\neconomic and social gaps between the developed and\ndeveloping countries, environmental issues, organized\ncrime, international terrorism, AIDS and other\ndiseases, drugs, human migration, the use of the\nInternet to sow intolerance and extremist ideas, and so\nforth. It is no exaggeration to say that, in order to\nensure a stable, just and prosperous future for all\nhumanity, we must, as soon as possible, get down to\nwork on following up on the decisions that have been\ntaken and on creating international legal standards to\nthe extent necessary. These standards should also be\ndeveloped in the fields of trade, finance and human\nrights  most specifically to protect the rights of\nethnic, linguistic or religious minorities. As part of this\nundertaking, it is important to reinforce good\ngovernance and solidarity.\nLet us recall that the great transformation of the\nworld's political, security, socio-economic and\nscientific landscape has been accompanied by a\nremarkable evolution  the return of man to the\ncentral place that is properly his on the international\nchessboard, and by a rediscovery of the purpose of\ngovernmental action at the national and international\nlevels. It is not a question of safeguarding States and\nGovernments but of protecting people and\ncommunities, human beings, men and women who\ncompose our societies. We must thus realize that\npolitical and legislative practices and our future\nactivities in the codification of international law must\nadequately reflect that fundamental fact that we now\nsee re-emerging.\nIn this context, the millions of victims of the\nconflicts afflicting the world and the daily tragedies we\ncontinually see mean that we cannot stand with our\narms crossed, that we must try to find as quickly as\npossible a response to the practical and theoretical\ndilemmas that have been haunting us for some time.\nThere are conflicts within States accompanied by\nserious violations of the human rights and genuine\nhumanitarian crises. The national authorities, wherever\nthey may be, must not be allowed to systematically\npersecute their own populations on a massive scale\nwith complete impunity while taking shelter behind\ncertain principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe international community must deal with these\nsituations with a new vision and philosophy that reflect\nthe realities and the spirit of our contemporary world.\nAs a result of our proximity to the ex-Yugoslavia,\nmy country, Hungary, has felt the whole weight of\nthese problems over the last decade. We have been\nwitness to the serious delays on the part of the\ncommunity of nations that has prevented it from acting\nin time in Bosnia and Rwanda, and elsewhere, with the\nappropriate means on the basis of a mandate\ncorresponding to the real nature of the situation and\nwith the necessary political will. That is why we\nwelcome Mr. Brahimi's report on peacekeeping\noperations. We are ready to begin without delay the\n15\n\nnecessary work to examine and implement these\nrecommendations.\nWith regard to the Balkan region, the Stability\nPact for South-Eastern Europe that came into being one\nyear ago is an initiative for prevention and\nreconstruction which offers the countries and the\npeoples of that part of the continent the possibility to\nleave their conflicts behind, to settle their differences\nand to open up new prospects for cooperation. Hungary\nattaches great importance to this and will make its own\ncontribution to this vital enterprise, particularly in the\nfield of strengthening democratic forces in the region\nand in human rights, including the rights of minorities.\nWithin this context, a democratic evolution in the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia will undoubtedly have\na stabilizing effect on the region as a whole and will\nmake it possible to bring to an end the isolation of\nSerbia from the major European and international\ncurrents. The elections scheduled for the end of\nSeptember offer us an occasion to set this process\nunder way. Such an evolution will enable us to\nnormalize relations between Serbia and Montenegro.\nOne of the global problems facing us is\nundoubtedly the question of conventional weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction. We appeal for new\nprogress in the field of light weapons and anti-\npersonnel mines, the victims of which are basically\ninnocent civilians.\nThe 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of nuclear weapons\nmarked an important step forward in the search for a\nsafer future for humanity. The document adopted there\nreaffirms the central role of the treaty in the field of\nnon-proliferation and the need for international\nagreement to this end. We hope that between now and\nthe next review conference, to be held in 2005, we will\nbe able to undertake the process of implementing the\nprogramme of action which was adopted to promote\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. From this\npoint of view we attach particular importance to the\ninitiation of work towards a treaty on the prohibition of\nfissile materials for military purposes.\nWe have also been following very closely the\nnegotiations designed to draw up a verification\nprotocol on the Biological Weapons Convention, which\nwill enter a decisive phase on the eve of the review\nconference set for 2001. Hungary will chair the ad hoc\ngroup charged with formulating a mechanism in that\nconnection and will do everything in its power to\nachieve the objective over the course of next year.\nHungary considers the adoption of the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court one of the most\nimportant international achievements in the field of\ninternational law. This Statute is aimed at imposing\nrules of international humanitarian law and at ending\nan era of impunity. Nineteen States have already\nratified the Statute, and the number of signatures is\nnow 112. Hungary views this with pleasure and will\npursue its own preparations for ratification of the\nStatute. We will continue to participate actively in\nnegotiations to bring about universal acceptance of the\nCourt while preserving the integrity of its Statute.\nThe reform of our world Organization has been\non the agenda for some time. Recent events throughout\nthe world  particularly unprecedented changes in the\npolitical and military order, economic evolution,\nprogress in the fields of science and informatics, and\nthe end of the century that symbolizes very tangibly the\ndawn of a new era full of both promises and\nuncertainty  have transformed the desire to see the\nUnited Nations adapt to the realities of our time into an\nimperative that will no longer tolerate any deviations or\nhesitation. Consequently, our first task is to face in a\ndetermined way the tremendous challenges awaiting us\nin the twenty-first century. The political will of\nMember States cannot be lacking if we really wish to\nmake every effort to support the laudable efforts of the\nSecretary-General to achieve this adaptation process.\nThis will involve, among other things, reforming the\nSecurity Council and the budgetary system, which is\nnecessary to strengthen the credibility and efficacy of\nour world Organization.\nThe more quickly we can reform the Organization\naccording to the requirements of this critical period, the\nmore reassured people throughout the world will be as\nto the future of the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I wish also to congratulate most sincerely\nthe Secretary-General on his comprehensive and\ndetailed report outlining the most important challenges\nfacing the international community in the twenty-first\ncentury.\n9\n\nThe heads of State or Government of the States\nMembers of the United Nations drew inspiration from\nthis important document for the Millennium Summit,\nwhich has just concluded, at which they expressed their\ncollective commitment and determination to adopt\npolicies in favour of a globalization process benefiting\nthe entire world population.\nInternational cooperation among Governments\nwill pave the way for an increasingly integrated system\nin which all States are inevitably involved, thus\nbringing all the peoples of the world closer together.\nSan Marino believes that a wider globalization process\nof a juridical, ethical and cultural nature, in which\nsolidarity is a major concern, is a sine qua non for the\nachievement of genuine economic globalization.\nThe Republic I represent is fully convinced that it\nis the responsibility of all countries of the world to\nensure economic and social development and to\naddress threats to international peace and security, and\nthat the United Nations must play a central role in\nshaping our common future.\nAgainst this backdrop, the question of the least\ndeveloped countries burdened with a huge foreign debt\nmust be re-examined, in the conviction that debt relief\nmust form an integral part of the contribution offered\nby the international community to worldwide\ndevelopment.\nSince the economic and social development of\nmany countries is being irreparably hindered by debt\nproblems, international solidarity is an imperative for\neverybody, just as human rights and dignity must not\nbe violated in the name of market laws.\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, it is\nunacceptable that half of the world's population still\nlives in extreme poverty, with an income of barely two\ndollars a day. The indifference to this problem is a\ndisgrace to humanity as a whole, since we are all well\naware that poverty often triggers domestic and\ninternational conflicts and leads to exploitation and\nunderdevelopment.\nAgainst this gloomy background characterized by\nblatant contrasts, the international community must\nconcentrate its efforts on the protection of the most\nvulnerable, who bear the heaviest burden, and must pay\nspecial attention to women and children, who are the\nmain victims of poverty, violence and exploitation.\nPrompted by the conviction that legal cooperation, at\nan international level, is crucial to the protection of the\nrights of the child, San Marino was the first country to\nsign, this year, the Optional Protocol on child\npornography, and the second country to sign the\nOptional Protocol on the involvement of children in\narmed conflicts. The Republic is actively preparing to\nparticipate in the Special Session on Children to be\nheld in September 2001, where progress made over the\nlast decade in the protection of children will be\nreviewed. On that occasion, the international\ncommunity will lay the foundations for ensuring that\nchildren enjoy their full juridical status.\nWell aware that legal equality between men and\nwomen has become a major concern, both nationally\nand internationally, San Marino welcomes the results\nof the 1995 Beijing Conference, as well as those of its\nfollow-up special review session held in New York last\nJune.\nThe technology revolution, among the most\nimportant ones of the last decades, has caused radical\nchanges in international relations. We all hope that\ninformation technology and the Internet will be\nincreasingly used by the poorest countries as\ninstruments of economic and cultural development. In\nthis context, I wish to reiterate my country's\ncommitment and willingness to take part in the latest\nUnited Nations projects aimed at reducing illiteracy\nthrough computer science and promoting the\nknowledge and use of new technologies in developing\ncountries. In this way, new technologies, far from\nwidening the gap between rich and poor countries, will\nbenefit everybody.\nIn this spirit, the international community as a\nwhole has the duty to contribute to the consolidation of\ndemocracy in Africa and to help its populations, under\nthe auspices of the United Nations, in their struggle for\nlasting peace, poverty eradication and the achievement\nof just and sustainable social development.\nThe entire international community has the moral\nand civil obligation to put an end to the conflicts\nafflicting many African countries and to counter the\ngrowing instability caused by ethnic and territorial\ndivisions in some of these States or regions. In fact, if\ninternational peace is to be attained, the right of each\nindividual to live in peace and security must be\nguaranteed.\nThe numerous and cruel acts of genocide\nwitnessed by the twentieth century recently led the\n10\n\ninternational community to set up an International\nCriminal Court in order to prevent the authors of\ncrimes against humanity from going unpunished. San\nMarino, the first European country to ratify the Statute\nof the Court, hopes that other Parliaments will add to\nthe 19 having already deposited their instruments of\nratification, so as to attain the minimum number,\nenabling the Court to be operative and become a\njuridical and moral authority.\nOn behalf of my country, I wish to thank the\nSecretary-General for having made the Organization\nmore efficient and modern, through a series of reforms.\nYet, with regard to the reform of the Security Council,\nMember States could not make any decision in the\nabsence of a general agreement. In this regard, let me\nexpress my sincere hope for a comprehensive,\ndemocratic and fair reform of the Security Council\nsoon.\nAt the beginning of a new millennium, the\nconsolidation of a more efficient and representative\ngovernance, at an international level, bridging the gap\nbetween the haves and have-nots, is our common\nexpectation. Globalization being an irreversible\nprocess, we rely on the power and ability of this\ninstitution, which we believe in and which we are\nstriving to strengthen.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Once again I shall rely on\nthe kindness of those who interpret our speeches, since\nI am yet again putting them to the test of working\nwithout a written text.\nI shall switch between repetition and familiar\nissues, between deception and truth.\nFirst, repetition. As last year, the President of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Mr. Laurent-D\u00c8sir\u00c8\nKabila, has sent me to this very same rostrum to speak\nabout the same issues. Once again our invaders and\naggressors  from Rwanda and Uganda in\nparticular  are in our country, and I shall speak about\nthis again. This falls under the heading of repetition.\nI shall talk about this issue in the spirit and the letter of\nthe principles of the United Nations. The letter is\nimportant insofar as it helps us make sense of this\nsituation. I would suggest to delegations a small\nexercise regarding the reputedly historic work we do\nhere. By playing with historic a little, by transposing\na letter or two, another meaning can be found.\nI am awaiting the letter of the solution that the\nUnited Nations will adopt one day regarding the\nproblem of the aggression against, and occupation of\nour country by, people who are here in this very Hall\nand who have spoken falsely yesterday and today.\nUganda has said that it has come to my country in\norder to solve problems among the Congolese. Have\nthe Ugandans come as tourists? Have they come as\nscientific researchers?\nWe need to return to the letter of the definition of\naggression. These people, who ordinarily are our\nneighbours, leave their country, cross our borders,\ncome into our country and are occupying it even as I\nspeak. And, as if they had not already gone too far,\nthey have taken it upon themselves to say what we\nshould do to settle the problems among the Congolese\npeople. They do not talk about inter-Ugandan dialogue;\nthey do not talk about inter-Rwandan dialogue. They\ntalk about the inter-Congolese dialogue. Perhaps that is\nwhy they are slitting people's throats, massacring\npeople, cutting off penises, burying women alive. They\nare planting fields of arms in the way that Van Gogh\nplanted fields of sunflowers, burying women alive and\nleaving their arms sticking out of their graves  with\nthe idea of later harvesting arms. They have multiplied\nthe number of Dachaus by thousands. They shut up our\npopulations in their humble huts and then set the huts\non fire. Perhaps this is their understanding of\nparticipating in a solution to the Congolese problem.\nUnjustifiably!\nIt is a deception for the head of State of one of\nthese countries to play around in New York and say\nWe will not leave the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Notwithstanding the clear resolutions of the\nSecurity Council  resolutions 1234 (1999) and 1304\n(2000)  which state plainly that the Rwandans, the\nUgandans and Burundians must leave the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, representatives of those\ncountries come here and say We will not leave.\nThese impostors come to this very building and dare to\nengage in such arm wrestling for the benefit of the\n26\n\nleaders and other representatives of the countries\ngathered here.\nI do not want someone to tell me  even if it is\ntrue \n\nYou have made a wonderful speech.\n\nI want to be told We shall report back to our\nGovernments and heads of State what you said,\nbecause it is the truth: truth in response to deception.\nAs the philosopher Spinoza said, Verum index sui et\nfalsi; that is, truth is a touchstone both of the truth\nitself and of falsehood. One of our singers  his name,\nKoffi Olomide, is worth remembering  sings, in one\nof the languages that are well known to Africans who\nlisten to Congolese music and from which I am\ntranslating: A lie takes the elevator, but the truth uses\nthe stairs. The phrase is even prettier in Lingala.\nAnd so it is  the lies of the aggressors have\nquickly arisen to fool people. They are trying to pass\nfor little lambs, these people who are in a country that\nis not their own, where no one wants them to be and\nwhere they have not been invited. They are there. And\nthey have the nerve to say We will not leave,\nnotwithstanding the clear Security Council resolutions\nthat enjoin them to leave our country without delay or\nconditions.\nI am repeating today what I said last year;\nhowever, I must repeat this because these people are\nstill in my country and show no sign of leaving. They\nhave outrageous plans, such as creating a Great Lakes\nRepublic by cutting up our country and joining entire\nprovinces of it to their countries.\nAll of this will seem quite clear if you look at a\nmap of my country. You will see that our 2.347 million\nsquare kilometres are located amid small asteroids that\ngravitate around it in some sort of Brownian motion.\nThey enter our country, massacre people and, as I said\nearlier, shamelessly state that they are not going to\nleave. They believe that this lie will prevail because it\nhas taken the lift, while our truth has to take the stairs.\nBut I believe that our truth is making headway in your\nminds. Right is on our side.\nNone of our own soldiers are in Kigali or in\nKampala, but there is an unwanted multitude of foreign\nsoldiers in my country, growing in number as well as in\nweaponry. No doubt they are there for tourism. Since\nwe are embarking upon a historic millennium  and\nwe should consider the meaning of that adjective  we\nmust remind those people that they have to leave now,\ntoday. They should go home. They must not remain in\nmy country because what they are doing is abominable.\nI have given the Assembly a Dantesque\ndescription of what these people are doing in my\ncountry, supposedly for peaceful reasons. They are\nmassacring people, as I have stated. They are burying\nwomen alive and cutting off the penises of prisoners.\nThis needs to be analysed. Why would anyone do that\nto prisoners? The lies in the lift will not tell you about\nthat, but the stairway will. I hope you will inform your\nrespective Governments of the realities of the situation\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. People say it\nis complex, but in fact it is not complex at all. Those\npeople are not in their country. They have crossed our\nborders, supposedly to secure their own borders and\nsupposedly because the g\u00e9nocidaires are in my country,\noccasionally returning to their own countries to sow\ndisorder.\nOnce again, look at a map of our country. You\nwill see that the asteroids that I mentioned, Rwanda in\nparticular, have borders on Lake Kivu. It is a very\nsmall area that is the real border between us. If you\nlook at the map, you will see that these asteroids, in\norder to secure their borders, have gone 2,000\nkilometres beyond this real border, to the Atlantic, to\nstart a war. We do not know how they manage to move\ntheir soldiers around because they do not have\naeroplanes; however, know that they manage. They\nmove heavy weaponry 2,000 kilometres in order to\nstart a war, the purpose of which is to defend their\nborders 2,000 kilometres away. Who can possibly\nbelieve this? Who can claim that this is the truth?\nWhen you wish to defend and secure your border, you\nput your troops at your border so that others do not\ncross.\nThere is yet another lie: they say that they are\npursuing the perpetrators of the genocide that everyone\nremembers from 1994. They claim that they are\npursuing them because they have hidden in our\ncountry. Well, these people occupy two provinces in\nthe border area of our country and one other province\nthat is even farther away, farther from the equator.\nThey have never caught any g\u00e9nocidaires, living\nor dead. It would be a shock if they did. The Rwandans\n27\n\nare saying that there are g\u00e9nocidaires in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to justify\ntheir presence. However, they have never caught any.\nWhy have they never caught a g\u00e9nocidaire? I\nthink they are incapable of doing two things at once.\nEach Rwandan or Ugandan has only two hands, and\nthose two hands are busy. Do you know what they are\ndoing? They are taking our diamonds, copper, gold,\nprecious wood and rare animals, which they do not\nhave on their asteroids. And they are becoming\ndiamond exporters. If you look at the stock exchange,\nyou will see that Rwanda this month exported so many\ndiamonds, but those diamonds are covered in the blood\nof the Congolese people. The gemocracy that\nemploys them is doing the same thing in Sierra Leone,\nLiberia and Angola. One could say that the common\ndenominator between those countries and ours is that\nwe are under the thumb of gemocrats who prevent us\nfrom creating democracy. We have gemocrats against\ndemocrats. That is the deepest meaning to be found in\nthese poor countries that wish to become rich through\npillaging and plundering, which they do in the full light\nof day where everyone can see them. What is more\nsurprising still is that nobody tells them to stop their\nplundering and go home. This is an absolute fraud, and\nit threatens our African brothers as well. A country that\nis one eightieth the size of ours, that not long ago,\nbefore Lumumba, held the reins of our country, dares\nto allow its justice system  because in our country\nthere are patriots and nationalists \nI come from a province near the Atlantic, 2,000\nkilometres away from the Rwandan border. I see\nappear in my province people who are easily\nrecognized by their phenotype, accompanied by some\nCongolese passing through the province on their way to\nKinshasa. They even go to the airport to defend their\nborders, which are 2,000 kilometres away. Our patriots\nand nationalists stand up and do not welcome them. We\ntell them what we must tell them, as a true patriot\nwould do in the face of the invader.\nThat country, one eightieth the size of our own,\nallows its justice system to prosecute me, to issue an\narrest warrant against me and to inform all other\ncountries that if I go to their country, I should be\narrested for crimes against humanity, just because I\nspoke as a patriot against those who have come into my\ncountry.\nOne country, more powerful than the others, has\nasked, because of the thrashing it has received, to be\nallowed a corridor to the Atlantic. We do not know how\nthese people got to the province of Kivu, which they\nhave virtually annexed. They have changed the local\nadministrators, appointed new governors and changed\nthe telephone system. In order to call this province, you\nhave to dial the code for Rwanda. This is well known.\nThey even direct automobile traffic. In other words,\nthey have completely taken over our province.\nNonetheless, in their speeches they say they are in\nfavour of the territorial integrity and political\nindependence of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. At the same time, though, they are appointing\ngovernors in our country, changing the names of our\nstreets and making decisions as if it were their country.\nThese countries have spilled blood in our jungle\nand dare to assume the right to tell us who our Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs should be. In threatening my\nfreedom of movement, perhaps they imagined that I\nwould not manage to reach New York, but we have\nmore than one trick up our sleeve. Here I am. I will\nleave New York and go wherever my President tells me\nto go. We hope that other countries that wish to\nmaintain good relations with us will refuse to heed\nthese uneducated judges.\nI say uneducated because I have urged our\npeople to rise and crush the invaders and to make them\neat their words, but these judges thought I had called\nfor the invaders to be strangled. These judges are so\nuneducated they did not realize that I was quoting\nVoltaire. And now that I've admitted to quoting\nVoltaire, they will probably issue international arrest\nwarrants for him, because they have no idea who he\nwas. Who are these countries to appoint themselves\nuniversal judges and to prosecute people who are not\ntheir citizens for acts that were not committed in their\nterritories? These judges do not rely on law  since\ntheir position is indefensible  but on the law of the\njungle, because they are hunters. They made their\npronouncements two years ago. They are like hunters\nwho make no sound as they stalk their prey, but I too\nam silent. I have not been warned or notified, but\nINTERPOL knows it must arrest me if it gets its hands\non me. They have been just like big game hunters.\nEveryone knows what happened to our Prime\nMinister, Mr. Lumumba. In the tragedy in which a\nSecretary-General of the United Nations lost his life,\nthe people  one person in particular  who carried\n28\n\nout that dirty work dissolved Lumumba's body in\nsulphuric acid. Perhaps they are after me now because\nthey are suffering a shortage of sulphuric acid. This\ngentlemen kept one of Lumumba's teeth as a talisman\nand displayed it on television, admitting that they had\ndismembered Lumumba's body, dissolved it in\nsulphuric acid and kept his tooth as a charm. These\nuniversal judges have not been moved to prosecute the\nperson who boasts of having dissolved Lumumba's\nbody and kept one of his teeth. I think these people\nintend to open a museum some time soon and to grow\nrich charging admission to see Lumumba's tooth.\nMy African brothers may also be prosecuted\nwhen people arrogating the right to appoint members of\nGovernment issue warrants for them. That is why my\nbrothers should not remain silent. They are foreign\nministers and the same thing could happen to them.\nThey should react. They should not think of me as\nsomeone who is uneducated. These countries must be\nprevented from acting beyond their rights. No one\nassigned them the task of running the world's affairs\nthrough their own brand of justice.\nI do not wish to linger on this ridiculous topic,\nbut I would go even further in discussing truth and\nmendacity. Everyone is convinced that we are erecting\nobstacles to the diplomatic work of the United Nations,\nbut Lumumba's tooth should be a sign that we have\nhistorical reasons for our actions. What goes around\ncomes around. I recognize that we have been very\nparticular about how the United Nations forces may be\ndeployed, but we have acceded to the Organization's\nwishes. We agreed to the Mission and to the Lusaka\nCeasefire Agreement, although the fire has yet to\ncease. People persist in believing in the validity of the\nAgreement, but it was signed on 10 July 1999 and the\nfires are still burning today and the war continues.\nStill, people keep talking about the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement.\nWell, the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement designates\nthe invaders, the aggressors, as parties. These parties\nsigned the Agreement, but Security Council resolution\n1304 (2000) implies that they are the aggressors and\nenjoins them to leave my country. Thus, they are no\nlonger parties, but aggressors who should leave as soon\nas possible.\nMoreover, their Congolese puppets are playing\nthe role of Trojan horse. These invaders have exploited\ncertain Congolese supporters of Mobutu to justify their\ninvasion of our country and their aggression. Now, one\nof these asteroids is giving shelter to Mobutu's former\nsoldiers. They are training in Kampala and their aim of\nreturning to Kinshasa has been openly declared. One\nlarge country is helping others to build military bases\non our borders and is training their soldiers in order to\nincrease tourism in our country.\nWe must be vigilant. We must act to ensure the\nimplementation of the United Nations resolutions. We\nwould tell the United Nations that, in order to be more\neffective and to have a greater chance of success, it\nmust implement its own resolutions. I would express\nthe hope that I shall not have to return here next year to\nrepeat yet again that the Rwandans are still in my\ncountry, sowing death and pillaging our land. The\nUnited Nations must finally implement its own\nresolutions.\nHow can it do so? It can compel the Ugandans\nand Rwandans to return to their homes. We do not want\nthem in our country. They are our eternal neighbours,\nasteroids that orbit our planet. Let them go home. Let\nthem talk to us. We want this war to end as all others\ndo: with negotiations. The Second World War ended in\nnegotiations; the war in Algeria ended in negotiations\nbetween France and the National Liberation Front; the\nwar in Viet Nam ended in negotiations between the\nhost country here and the Vietnamese; the war between\nProtestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, which\nhas broken all endurance records, is showing signs of\nending soon. How? Through negotiations between the\nCatholics and the Protestants.\nJust the other day, in reference to another topic, I\nmentioned that Security Council resolution 242 (1967)\nwas adopted over 40 years ago, but that it is only now\nbeginning to be implemented. Now, we are not going to\nwait 40 years for our Clinton and our Camp David. The\nUnited Nations must implement its resolutions\nimmediately. It must support us to ensure that the\naggressors, whatever they may say, go home. They are\nnot at home. We do not want them in our country. They\nmust go home.\nThe Second World War erupted after a long\nincubation. We now see hope for perpetual peace\nfollowing that war, but I agree with Paul \u2026luard that we\nmust be vigilant because the womb that bore the vile\nbeast is still fertile. We want all men, even our\nenemies, to be our brothers. We want to rebuild our\ncountry, which was dismantled by the excesses of\n29\n\nMobutu. Like luard, we want to turn water into light\nand, as I said, to make every man our brother.\nThat is my message to the Assembly. I repeat: do\nnot tell me\n(spoke in English)\nYou have made a wonderful speech.\n(spoke in French)\nSay We have understood your message and we shall\ntell our Governments to implement the relevant United\nNations resolutions immediately so that the aggressors\ngo home. Please help us to talk with them, in order to\nput an end to this war, which should end as all wars\nend. Some of us lost all our hair waiting for the blessed\nday, 17 May 1997, after 32 years of activity. Look at\nPresident Kabila's head and mine; we can be\nrecognized by our advanced baldness, which came\nabout while we were waiting for the moment when we\ncould re-enter Kinshasa.\nSo, my African brothers and my brothers from\nother countries, including many from Latin America, I\nconclude with a Spanish saying. I do not wish to\ntranslate it, so those who do not understand will have\nto stop a Spanish-speaking colleague and ask What\ndid he say?:\n(spoke in Spanish)\nWhen your neighbour's house is on fire, watch out for\nyour own house."

        "file_text": "I wish to\ncongratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on his\nelection to the presidency of this historic session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I also take this opportunity to\ncongratulate his predecessor, my dear brother and\ncolleague, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign Minister\nof Namibia, on a job well done.\nZimbabwe joins other Members of the Assembly\nin welcoming the admission of Tuvalu as the one\nhundred and eighty-ninth Member State of the United\nNations.\nSince a Millennium Assembly can only come\nonce in a lifetime, it is my singular honour and\npleasure to address this Assembly. The twentieth\ncentury was probably the most eventful in the history\nand the experience of Zimbabwe. As we enter the\ntwenty-first century and the new millennium, the\npeople of Zimbabwe, in a very symbolic and yet\nhistoric way, find themselves concluding painful\nchapters of their experience, whose closure is critical to\nthe laying of a foundation for a better future.\nStructural inequalities are a fundamental reality\nof Africa's colonial past, which many countries like my\nown are grappling with to this day. In my country 70\nper cent of Zimbabwe's best arable land is still\ncontrolled by less than 1 per cent of the population \u2014\nroughly 4,500 settlers or their descendants. This is in a\ncountry of nearly 13 million people. It is a historical\nfact that the colonial regime forcefully robbed us of\nthis land without paying us any compensation. As I\nspeak, the Government of Zimbabwe is in the process\nof taking back 5 million of the 12 million hectares of\nour prime land to settle landless peasants.\nZimbabwe's land reform programme is meant not\nonly to correct the wrongs wrought on our society by\ncolonialism, but also to restore our people's heritage\nand basic means of subsistence and economic\nparticipation. In this endeavour, we have received\nneither the cooperation of those sectors of our society\nto which colonialism bequeathed special privileges, nor\nthe acknowledgement or support of former colonizers\nwho willed those privileges. In pursuit of their policies,\nthose powerful interests have employed their financial\nmight, as well as their control of the media to not only\nchoke our economy but also to demonize us before the\nworld.\nWe cannot, in one breath, pay lip service to\nhuman rights, equality and poverty eradication and, in\nthe next, defend inequality, which condemns the\nmajority to a life in squalor. We invite all our partners\nto see through the veil of the negative and racist media\n19\n\nblitz, acquaint themselves with our people's real need\nfor justice, restoration and agrarian reform and help us\nremove the barriers that constrain poor people's ability\nto benefit from their economy and to contribute to its\ngrowth.\nOur determination to undertake land reform in\nZimbabwe is one of the \u201ccrimes\u201d cited in the so-called\nZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000, which was passed by\nthe United States Senate in June this year and is before\nCongress as I speak. It proposes to prescribe the\noutcome of our land reform exercise and seeks to\nvirtually usurp the authority of the Parliament of\nZimbabwe. Most ironically, the so-called Democracy\nAct proposes to authorize the investment of United\nStates funds of around Z$ 300 million in the breeding\nof opposition parties in Zimbabwe. That amount, which\nis exclusively for opposition parties, is more than four\ntimes the Z$70 million distributed by the Zimbabwean\nfiscus among all political parties that have a stipulated\nthreshold representation in Parliament. Are we\nexpected to just stand idly by and watch helplessly as\nour destiny is determined from outside our country?\nWhere, I ask, is our self-determination and our\nsovereignty, for which so much blood and so many\nlives were sacrificed by our people?\nThe measure seeks to hurt Zimbabwe's fortunes\neven further by issuing United States directors at the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank with\nstanding directives to vote against Zimbabwe at every\nopportunity. This means that even if Zimbabwe met all\nmacroeconomic requirements and exercised the\nrequisite fiscal discipline it would still be disqualified\nin its quest for assistance from the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, on the basis of political considerations that\nare totally extraneous to the stipulated technical\ncriteria.\nJust what are the rules of the game, and to whom\nare these international financial institutions\naccountable? Do we need any further justification for\nthe resounding call for a new international financial\narchitecture? For while the current international\nfinancial architecture is subservient to the interests of\nthe rich and the strong, even to the satisfaction of their\nlast extraterritorial exploit, it remains for ever\ninsensitive to the survival needs of the small, the weak\nand the poor.\nZimbabwe's involvement in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo to help prevent mayhem,\nbloodshed and the overthrow of a legitimate\nGovernment there is another \u201ccrime\u201d cited in the\nZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000. At the invitation of\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Zimbabwe, together with other allies of the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC),\nsent troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nhelp fend off an invasion by two of that country's\nneighbours. The responsive intervention of the SADC\nallies effectively contained the situation and\nestablished the relative calm and stability prevailing in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo today. It also\npaved the way for the peace process that culminated in\nthe signing last year of the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement, which, all involved agree, offers the best\nhope for establishing and maintaining peace in the\nregion.\nWhat does Zimbabwe get in return for its\nsacrifices in upholding the principles of the United\nNations Charter? Sanctions and threats of more\nsanctions are the response. For helping to create the\nvery conditions that enabled the United Nations to set\nfoot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nZimbabwe is today questioned, tried and sentenced to\npariah status. Some of the proponents of the Zimbabwe\nDemocracy Act 2000 have demanded that Zimbabwe\nwithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo before they can even consider withdrawing\nthat measure.\nAre we being punished for creating conditions\nthat enabled the United Nations and other humanitarian\nagencies to deliver assistance to Congolese\ncommunities? Are we being vilified for enabling\nthousands of Congolese children to get polio\nvaccinations and other types of life-saving\nimmunization? After offering our partnership in the\nquest for peace and human well-being, we expect the\ninternational community to respond accordingly and\ncooperate with us.\nInstead of punishing those who invaded the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, instead of\ncensuring those who are violating the national\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, in blatant desecration of\ncardinal principles of the Charter, instead of\nquestioning those who are already in contempt of\nSecurity Council orders to withdraw immediately from\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, some members\nof the international community have chosen, rather, to\n20\n\nvictimize Zimbabwe, whose troops are in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo at the invitation of\nthe Government of that country. Exactly what outcome\ndoes the international community wish to see in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo?\nI reiterate, and categorically so, that Zimbabwe is\ncommitted to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted on this question.\nIn this regard, Zimbabwe is ready to immediately\nwithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, as\nsoon as the United Nations deploys peacekeepers in\nthat country. We therefore urge the Secretary-General\nto deploy the observer mission already authorized by\nthe Security Council as part of phase two deployment,\nso that we can move to phase three and the deployment\nof actual peacekeepers in order to enable us to leave\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nLike their neighbours in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, the peace-loving people of Angola are\nvictims of an imposed war that has been fomented by\ngreed rather than grievance. While the crisis is far from\nresolved, we are mollified by the position taken by the\nSecurity Council, through the Angola sanctions\nCommittee, to ensure the effective application of the\nembargo against UNITA. We support the SecretaryGeneral's stance of naming and shaming the violators\nof sanctions as a way of preventing the opportunism\nand greed that fan conflicts. This was the position\nadopted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at\nits last summit, in Lom\u00e9, Togo.\nIn both the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand Angola, we challenge the United Nations, and the\nSecurity Council in particular, to come to the aid and\ndefence of the innocent victims of war, to protect their\nnatural heritage and resources from pillage, and to\nsafeguard their territorial integrity and national\nsovereignty.\nWith regard to the Lockerbie affair, we still await\nthe Security Council's comprehensive and final\nresponse to Libya's full compliance with the Council's\nresolutions. It was the Council's own commitment that\nsuch a conclusive step would be taken 90 days after\nLibya's full compliance. We call for transparency and\nfairness in the trial itself, at The Hague, to avoid any\nmiscarriage of justice.\nThe international community must never lose\ntrack of the long, drawn-out dialogue on the peace\nprocess in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine.\nWe call for good faith and consistency in the\nnegotiations until the brotherly Palestinian people\nattain statehood with national sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity.\nIn Western Sahara, the international community\nowes it to the Sahrawi people to ensure the early\nholding of a free and fair referendum to allow them the\npriceless opportunity to determine their destiny.\nOn the global economic front, the last decade of\nthe twentieth century witnessed tremendous progress in\nsome parts of the world, but it also saw stagnation and\nsetbacks, even in some countries that had previously\nexperienced fast economic growth. Periods of\neconomic and financial crisis lead to retrenchment,\nwherein concern for people gives way to concern for\nbalancing budgets and payments. Those crises have\nunderscored the importance of understanding and\nstrengthening the social underpinnings of development\nto ensure that peoples, their cultures and their societies\nare taken into account in the process of development.\nPoverty amid plenty is an affront to our common\nhumanity. At a time when the world has the\nwherewithal to attack poverty vigorously, spectacular\naffluence and abject poverty are found side by side. In\ncontrast to its potential as the ultimate provider of new\nopportunities for growth and development worldwide,\nglobalization has been accompanied by widening\nincome disparities among, as well as within, countries\nand regions. Its ill effects have disproportionately\nvictimized the most vulnerable and marginalized\nnations and sections of society. Globalization is\nredefining the nature and role of States and the\ngovernance of international bodies, thereby\nsubordinating democratic political processes to\nunaccountable economic and financial actors and\ninstitutions. Globalization is thus undermining the\nability of Governments to serve as guarantors of the\nsocial, economic, political and cultural health of our\ncommunities.\nAt the expense of our common goals and\nobjectives for international economic cooperation, we\nhave surrendered to blind market forces in the faint\nhope that somehow things will, as if by magic, turn out\nright. The consequences of that impoverishing process\nare clearly visible in a number of alarming trends, such\nas the takeover of national assets by transnational\ncorporations in the name of public enterprise\n21\n\nprivatization and commercialization. As a result, Africa\nenters the new century hanging on the vagaries of\nglobal markets, accounting for only 1 per cent of global\ngross domestic product and about 2 per cent of world\ntrade.\nGeographically, Africa is probably the world's\nmost fragmented region. The continent is demarcated\nby about 165 borders dividing it into 53 countries, 22\nof them with less than 5 million people and 11 with\nless than 1 million. That fragmentation imposes real\nconstraints on development, and, without economic\nintegration, Africa will fall farther behind. We\ntherefore call upon the international community to\nsupport our efforts at regional integration as we\npromote regional public assets and initiatives,\nincluding regional infrastructure such as roads,\nrailways, ports and power-pooling systems, infectious\ndisease control, centres of excellence for training,\nregional markets and trade, and agricultural research\nand early warning systems for drought.\nDespite talk of the global village, it is apparent\nthat Africa's lonely days are not yet over. For we still\nhave cause and occasion to feel marginalized in so\nmany respects. We know what it is like to give passage\nto emergency aircraft and sea vessels that criss-cross\nour airspace and waterways to attend to emerging\ncrises in distant places while our own crises simmer on\nand explode in our faces. Our ceasefire agreements and\ntruces are tested beyond limit, while the United\nNations stands aloof and unimpressed; yet urgent\ninterventions are deployed to flashpoints in other\nregions, even without ceasefire guarantees.\nHesitant and half-spirited interventions by the\nSecurity Council in several African conflicts have\nneither done the job nor enhanced the credibility of the\nUnited Nations. As the United Nations organ uniquely\nmandated to maintain international peace and security,\nthe Security Council should make itself equally\nattentive to the needs of the world's family of nations,\nincluding through cooperation with regional\narrangements everywhere, as provided for in Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. Or is it true that so\nlong as the Security Council remains unreformed, it\nwill always fail to respond adequately to the interests\nof all the Members of the United Nations?\nAs we review the progress of nations and design\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury, we need to remind ourselves that \u201cwe the\npeoples\u201d of the world constitute the real wealth of the\nbrotherhood of nations. The thrust of the United\nNations agenda \u2014 and, indeed, of development \u2014 is\ntherefore to create an enabling environment for people\nto enjoy long, healthy, peaceful and creative lives.\nI wish to put it to this Millennium Assembly that\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury is to champion the agenda of the world's weak,\nthose marginalized and impoverished by globalization,\nthose currently circumscribed to the margins of policy\nand decision-making in the international economic and\nsocio-political system. In brief, it is to protect the weak\nand manage the strong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election. I\nam confident that his vision and energy will guide this\nsession to a successful conclusion.\nI also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with\ndistinction and efficiency.\nI commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed\nSecretary-General of this Organization, for the\nthoughtful recommendations which he has put forward\nin his report to the Millennium Summit entitled \u201cWe\nthe peoples: the role of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century\u201d. His vision and stewardship have\nproved to be vital factors in advancing the work and\nmission of the United Nations at this critical time in the\nhistory of the Organization and the world.\nI join the previous speakers in welcoming the\nnation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of\nthe United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also\nthe smallest Member country of the Organization, with\na population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square\nmiles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the\nleader of that nation proudly take his place among the\nother leaders of the world in what was the largest\ngathering of heads of State or Government ever\nassembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There\nis a special affinity between the countries of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We\nare among the smallest constituents of the\nOrganization. We share similar historical and\nconstitutional experiences. We face the same\nenvironmental threats. We look forward, with\nconfidence, to a future involving the creative\n29\n\nutilization of the phenomenal developments in the area\nof information technology.\nMy country's Prime Minister, The Right\nHonourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders\nfrom the Caribbean Community, of which he is the\ncurrent Chairman, in denouncing the growing\ninsensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of\nsmall developing countries on the part of the powerful\nin today's world. In his address to the Millennium\nSummit the Prime Minister noted that while our\nreligious heritage has taught us how to reach across the\nboundaries of nations through the very inspirational\nguideline, \u201clove your neighbour as yourself\u201d, small and\nvulnerable island States such as our own are being\nvictimized by the application of international rules\ncrafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes,\noblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the\nwell-being, of others. We are all affected by the\nmodalities of the global village which we inhabit,\nthrough revolutionary developments in communication\ntechnology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours,\nand yet the competition among the world's peoples has\nbecome fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead\nand widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is\nnow related not only to material wealth, but also,\nfrighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries\nto compete in the accepted medium of communication,\nbecause of the existence of an ever-widening digital\ndivide.\nThe Millennium Summit concluded with the\nadoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming\nthe importance of the United Nations and the need to\nstrengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as\nmaking commitments to targeted reductions in poverty,\nthe levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by\nimpoverished nations around the world, the incidence\nand spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic\neducation for all children. On the other hand, we are\naware that the current world order is rapidly falling out\nof step with today's realities and that there is a pressing\nneed for the international community to come together\nand address the numerous challenges before us.\nWe must acknowledge that efforts to address old\nissues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well\nas new ones arising from globalization, the rapid\ngrowth of information technology and the resulting\ndigital divide, the consequences of the environmental\ndegradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender\nissues, among others, have largely been inadequate.\nOur common and daunting task is therefore to ensure\nthat this globalized world will be beneficial for all and\nnot just for some. More than ever before, there is an\nurgent need to foster a consciousness of universal\nmoral values in order to deal with present-day\nproblems, all of which are assuming an increasingly\nglobal dimension. The promotion of peace and human\nrights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and\namong States, the protection of immigrants, the\nsafeguarding of the environment, the battle against\nterrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms\ntrafficking, money laundering and economic and\npolitical corruption are issues which no nation,\nregardless of how wealthy or powerful, can\nsuccessfully address alone. They concern the entire\nhuman community and must be addressed and resolved\nthrough common universal efforts.\nMy country, a small State in the Caribbean, has\nalways been aware of its interdependence with other\ncountries for its prosperity and security. We have\nmoved to advance our interests through multilateral\ncooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\nStates (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean\nStates (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions\nof the United Nations system. For a small developing\ncountry like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nmultilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of\nour policies and programmes to enhance our standard\nof living and create a better life for all of our people. I\ntherefore reiterate my country's commitment to and\nsupport for the work of the United Nations and its\nagencies in this regard.\nThe Millennium Summit provided an appropriate\nopportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate\nthemselves to the attempt to have an impact on and\nchange for the better the quality of life of the world's\npoorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of\ndeprivation and suffering. The Summit will have\nproved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new\nmillennium, but as an event that made the transition\nfrom words to deeds. The times demand nothing less.\nThe security, welfare and development of people\nmust, in the context of any new world order, dominate\nthe attention of the world's multilateral financial\ninstitutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must\nundertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our\npeople from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.\n30\n\nWhile micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation\nprogrammes have been successful, much needs to be\ndone to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions\nstill suffer from hunger.\nWe had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera\nand tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and\ndrug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS\nare spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the\nCaribbean Community have placed combating this\npandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This\nscourge has already claimed the lives of over 10\nmillion people. It is projected to claim the lives of over\n200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\nThe developed world is not spared, either.\nWorldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are\nliving with the disease, over 18 million have died since\nthe beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million\nchildren have become orphaned. In the Caribbean\nregion, the disease now threatens the human resource\ndevelopment efforts of CARICOM and could reverse\nthe social and economic gains of the countries in that\nsubregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean\nis estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the\nhighest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second,\nin terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A\nUnited Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over\n360,000 adults and children in our region were living\nwith the disease. There is no immunity. International\ncooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields\nmust be intensified if the disease is to be contained.\nWe cannot preach about human rights and the\nuniversality of the United Nations while at the same\ntime ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of\nthe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that\nthe time has come when serious consideration should\nbe given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In\nthis regard, my Government is urging that the subject\nbe placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We urge every Member State of this\nnoble Organization to give its full support to this\nworthy initiative for a country whose democratic\ncredentials cannot be challenged.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process thus\nfar, and expresses the hope that through dialogue,\ncompromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace\nmay become a reality.\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nare to survive globalization, the international\ncommunity must give careful and urgent consideration\nto the following measures: the revitalization of growth\nin developed countries; the lowering of interest rates;\naccess to the world's markets for the products of\ndeveloping countries; the reduction of debt and the\ndebt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating\nsituation in the marketing arrangements for primary\nproducts produced in the developing countries;\neconomic diversification; increasing the levels of\nofficial development assistance and humanitarian aid;\nreductions in net capital flows from bilateral and\nmultilateral sources; and combating the negative\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries like\nours, by international financial institutions, from\nconcessionary funding arrangements.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\nconcerns of other developing countries with regard to\nthe general decline in official development assistance\nand the flow of foreign direct investment to developing\ncountries. We look forward to the consultation on\nfinancing for development planned for 2001.\nThe changing world environment dictates the\nneed for the revitalization and restructuring of the\nvarious organs of the United Nations organizations, but\nmy Government attaches very high priority to the\nrevitalization and strengthening of the role of the\nUnited Nations in promoting international cooperation\nfor sound development, including economic\ndevelopment. We share the view that the United\nNations should be encouraged to develop its full\npotential in the area of international economic\ncooperation and should be endowed with the requisite\nresources to contribute to solving the serious economic\nand social problems facing developing countries in\ntheir efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\ndevelopment.\nWe commend those donor countries that have\nmade financial contributions to the South Pacific\nApplied Geoscience Commission to assist the\ndevelopment of an environmental vulnerability index,\nand call for the early adoption by the international\ncommunity of a vulnerability index that would serve as\na guide for multilateral financial institutions and the\n31\n\nUnited Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of\ndeveloping countries.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other\nsmall island developing States in the strategically\nlocated Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the\nendemic problems of the production, trafficking and\nconsumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances. This modern day scourge continues to pose\nserious problems which threaten to destroy the social\nand moral fabric of our communities. My Government\nis fully committed to the ongoing process of\ncooperation with other countries to counter these\nillegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in\nthis forum our complete support for the Multilateral\nEvaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the\nmember countries of the Organization of American\nStates (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the\ninternational fight against the drug trade. I also take\nthis opportunity to urge that more resources be\nallocated through collaborative efforts by the\ninternational community to encourage farmers to keep\naway from the production of illicit crops.\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\nChairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\nspoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good\ngovernance and respect for human rights and\ndemocracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are\naspects of our society of which we are eternally proud.\nRecently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our\nconstitutional democracy was put to the test through\nopen expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal\nthrough dialogue and compromise. My Government is\npleased to put on record its appreciation to the\nVincentian people for upholding democratic values and\nrespecting the supremacy of the constitution and the\nrule of law as fundamental principles by which our\nbeloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to\nexpress gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to\nthe National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry\nand Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to\nmany individuals and other institutions for their\ninvaluable contributions in bringing about a swift\nresolution of the matter. My Government has long\nrecognized the urgent need for constitutional reform\nand will continue to work with other interested parties\nto bring about meaningful change that would seek,\namong other things, to strengthen the foundations of\nour democracy. As full members of this body, we have\nseen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional\nreform in the promotion of democracy, stability and\neconomic development.\nWe also recognize that constitutional reform is\ncrucial to strengthening our own integration processes\nwithin the Caribbean Community, including the\nestablishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be,\ninter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on\nmatters pertaining to the interpretation and\nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty of\nChaguaramas, which established CARICOM.\nMany matters of profound importance to Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean\nCommunity as a whole are included in the agenda of\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These\ninclude: sustainable development, the future of United\nNations reform, the International Criminal Court and\nhuman rights, the death penalty and financing for\ndevelopment.\nI wish, once again, to focus the attention of this\nnoble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana\ntrade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well\ndocumented. Banana exports to the European Union\nfrom my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint\nLucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\ncountries are crucial to the economies of these\ncountries and represent over half of all export earnings\nin some cases. The industry provides substantial\nemployment for many families in Dominica, Saint\nLucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own\ncountry.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative\nof the efforts of the European Commission and other\nparties which seek to bring about an amicable and\nequitable solution to the dispute. However we are\ndeeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime\nbe eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with\nthe 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this\nwould have immeasurable harmful consequences for\nour economy. It will lead to the destruction of the\nCaribbean banana industry and negatively affect other\nACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to\nthe economy.\nThe two alternative solutions being proposed by\nthe European Commission, that is a first come, first\nserved system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that\nproves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only\nsystem, would prove to be disadvantageous and\n32\n\ndisastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system\nensures access.\nWe therefore urge the interested parties to the\ndispute to use their substantial influence to bring about\nthe much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a\nresolution that is acceptable to all parties. An\nefficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will\nsupport our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable\nisland State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining\npeace and economic security, which are vital for the\nachievement of economic diversification within a\nreasonable period of transition.\nWhile we recognize that there are structural and\ninherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to\ncompete with highly integrated operations on the\nmarket, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in\norder to allow our people to engage meaningfully in\ntrade and development, rather than be forever subjected\nto the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed\ndesire to hold on to our banana industry, which served\nus well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the\nrealities of the present day trade and economic\nenvironment.\nMy delegation also wishes to express its concern\nover the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within\nthe WTO that would prevent consideration of the\nwaiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU\nPartnership Agreement if it includes bananas without\nadvice on how the regime will be formed. My country\nand other members of the Caribbean Community have\nbeen actively engaged in diversifying our economies\nthroughout the last quarter of the last century. This has\ninvolved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing,\ntourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have\nimproved air access to our country and my Government\ncontinues to prioritize the education of our people to\nprepare them for the opportunities that will accrue.\nMy Government will continue to honour its\ncommitments to all international agreements to which\nit is signatory. In furtherance to our international\nobligation we have signed the following: the United\nNations Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United\nNations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea,\nthe International Convention Against the Taking of\nHostages and the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these\ninstruments were deposited with the Secretary General\nduring the Millennium Summit.\nDuring his speech at the Millennium Summit,\nPrime Minister Mitchell stated that:\n\u201cSmall island States such as our own, with\nan enviable record of good governance and\nhuman rights, have seen the mighty in the banana\ntrade using the international rules \u2014 crafted by\nthem \u2014 impede our economic growth.\u201d\nSimilarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) on our financial services,\nwithout any deference to our rights to be heard,\ndemonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small\nvulnerable States attempting to diversify their\neconomies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment,\n\u201cWhere is the fairness in free trade?\u201d\nOffshore financial services is one of our chosen\navenues of economic diversification. We believe that\nwe are capable of offering a useful, professional and\nmutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly,\nin 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative\nexercise to ensure that we would put in place a\nregulatory and supervisory framework to adequately\nadminister the conduct of international financial\nbusinesses operating in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our\nregulatory regime against money laundering activities,\nwe enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being\na responsible member of the international community,\nincluding by playing its part in the war against money\nlaundering. We believe that those who toil to build a\nbetter life for themselves, their children, their\ngrandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be\nafforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such\npeople should have access to facilities that will\npreserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be\ncreated for them to optimize and maximize their\nwealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we\nbelieve in the preservation of privacy, we are also\nresolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable\ncharacter and conduct are not allowed to take\nadvantage of the opportunities that are available in our\ninternational finance sector.\n33\n\nMy country and others in the Caribbean\nCommunity are deeply concerned that the so-called\nharmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to\nfrustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the\nsovereignty of small island States desperately seeking\ncreative avenues for survival. Such action on the part\nof the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax\ncartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes\nfrom those who wish to legitimately escape them\nthrough the exercise of free choice. It would also close\noff an area of diversification and economic activity in\nwhich poor developing countries can be competitive\nand which they have actively promoted for a long time.\nThe unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial\nStability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force\nalso impact negatively on the burden of taxation in\nwealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of\nCaribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global\nfinancial service and stifle economic growth in the 47\nblacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils.\nThe small island States of the Caribbean are\namong those countries most at risk from the adverse\neffects of climate change. Already, many of our islands\nare experiencing those effects in areas that impact\ndirectly on the important tourism sector of our\neconomies. We are also prone to extremely damaging\nnatural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm\nsurges, which visit us annually with increasing\nfrequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also\nexperiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions\nand earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if\nless regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.\nThe continued committed support of the international\ncommunity is crucial in complementing the work of\nthose States in addressing these serious problems.\nOur survival as a region is intimately interwoven\nwith our environment. Our physical and economic\nlimitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways.\nSuch actions are a flagrant violation of our human\nrights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We\ntherefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a\nnuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIn closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in\nthis forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of\nthe Charter of the United Nations, through service to\nour country, to the Caribbean and to the international\ncommunity. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of\nthe Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable\nSir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an\nelected member of our legislature. He has seen our\ncountry through the stages of constitutional\ndevelopment from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime\nMinister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to\ncontemplate public life without him. His address at the\nMillennium Summit was his last to this body, for he\nhas decided to demit office as Prime Minister before\nthe twenty-first anniversary of our political\nindependence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell\nhas made us all proud by his long, dedicated and\nvisionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the\narea of land reform, which empowered people through\nland ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate\nthat, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend\nsincere gratitude to him from this rostrum.\nThe challenge is ours: to turn our words into\naction and to agree on a common vision of our future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She has asked me to\nmake this statement in her place.\nThe Millennium Summit has given us the\ntestimony of the heads of State and Government. This\nexceptional meeting was the opportunity for a renewed\ncommitment of States throughout the world to our\nOrganization, encouraging common efforts to give\nevery citizen the freedom to enjoy a decent life and\nopening the way for self-fulfilment for individuals and\ntheir communities.\nWe congratulate and commend you, Sir, as the\nnew President of the General Assembly. We also\nexpress our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, for the vigour of his presidency.\nOur Secretary-General has tirelessly emphasized\nthe urgent need to act by innovating and ensuring a\nsustained pace for the work of the Organization. We\nalso commend him and especially encourage him to\ncontinue his work.\nMy speech today will emphasize the themes of\nLuxembourg's message to the Millennium Summit. The\nspeech by Mr. Hubert V\u00c8drine, the French Minister for\nForeign Affairs, on behalf of the European Union fully\nreflects the point of view of my country.\nIn 1999 we restated the main themes of the\nLuxembourg Government's involvement in Europe and\nwithin the United Nations and its commitment to\nstrengthened international solidarity, demonstrated by\nthe fact that in 2000 my country has reached the\nobjective set by the United Nations of official\ndevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product. This year is a time to speak further of\nthe principle of shared responsibility, because the\nworld has to face the old challenges of violence and\ndevelopment, as well as the more recent one of\nglobalization.\nGlobalization is both a source of achievement and\ncause for concern. It is ambivalent and requires\nadequate instruments in order to manage it and gear it\ntowards equitable development. Without a common\ndefinition of the rules to be applied, it could give rise\nto bitterness and revolt. But the use of violence might\ncompromise the path towards development. It is a\nmatter of concern that worldwide arms sales have been\non the rise since 1996. The horror of constant violence\ncommitted by human beings against each other could\nsimply make us grieve. However, such a passive\nattitude would not do justice to the realities of this\nworld. The number of armed conflicts has in fact gone\ndown, from 55 in 1992 to 36 in 1998, but this bare\nstatistic does not explain how this decrease took place.\n2\n\nHowever, another statistic should grab our attention:\nbetween 1974 and 1999, 113 countries went from an\nauthoritarian regime to a multi-party system. More\nmeaningful than statistics is the encouraging fact that\nthe number of negotiation processes has increased, the\nkey to their success often being innovative formulas to\nachieve peaceful coexistence where previously there\nwas deadlock and resentment.\nEast Timor, the conference between Somalis in\nDjibouti and the new inter-Korean dialogue are recent\nexamples. In spite of the obvious difficulties, these\nconstructive developments show by their number and\ndiversity that preventing conflicts is a strategy in\nmotion. We have to consolidate this strategy of\nprevention in order to show that it produces lasting\nresults. Of course, there are many failures, and we must\nnot close our eyes to the difficulties.\nIn Kosovo, in particular, intolerant behaviour led\nto a sort of blindness, even in people who had\nthemselves suffered oppression. Psychology teaches us\nthat former victims do not always avoid eventually\nbecoming executioners. We must put an end to this\nvicious circle and stop unbridled criminality. The\ncommitment of the Special Representative, Bernard\nKouchner, and of all those who are working to brighten\na grey sky brings us a message of hope which will bear\nfruit.\nAt the end of the cold war our hopes were\nperhaps inspired by impatience. Today we see that\nthere are solid foundations: above and beyond\nacademic investigations and the awakening of\nconscience, concrete action is being taken. We thank\nthe community of organizations and individuals present\nin the field; those who pay with their lives expect\nothers to support them and to provide the necessary\nmeans.\nBut the major responsibility is not to disappoint\nthose in direct need of assistance: victims, displaced\npersons and refugees, those denied the protection of the\nrule of law, even the means of subsistence. And when\nmanagement deficiencies lead to short-sighted over-\nexploitation and stifling pollution of an environment\nthat can take no more, this phenomenon should be\nreversed and responsibility established and assumed.\nHow can we believe that catastrophes will go\nunnoticed or that international solidarity will not bother\nto analyse the cause of events?\nCrime must not pay. This concept will go from\ntheory to practice in the globalization era. Information\nis spreading ineluctably and innovations are being\nmade. International law may be lagging behind certain\ntechnologies, but it is in the process of being\ndeveloped. For example, universal participation in the\noverall structure of multilateral treaties, which was\nstrongly stimulated by the Millennium Summit.\nAnother example is the courts to try war crimes,\ngenocide or crimes against humanity. After the creation\nof tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\nsome countries are considering establishing courts in\ncooperation with the United Nations. National courts\nhave instituted proceedings, and as a result the era of\nimpunity is ending. Luxembourg was the eighteenth\nState to ratify the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court, which will go into effect after 41 more\nratifications.\nIn democracy the rule of law prevails, but\npolitical action is crucial to its development. Through\nthe major conferences of the 1990s and their follow-\nups, the United Nations has shown clearly that such\nconferences are also an important source of law. The\nguidelines that emerge stimulate the creation of\ndomestic laws, and their juxtaposition produces a vast,\ninternationally recognized network. Future actions,\nincluding the campaign against small arms, financing\nfor development and the World Conference against\nRacism, will help promote the rule of law. Stable, but\nnot rigidly fixed, transparent and subject to democratic\ncontrols, the rule of law is certainly one of the most\nreliable pillars for development.\nBut the international community and the United\nNations will have to build other pillars as well as part\nof the structure for a world in which poverty and\nviolence no longer threaten us. Without going into\ndetail, I refer to the need to remember, respect for\nequality, the will for prevention and openness to\ncooperation.\nThe century which is drawing to a close was the\nmost terrible in the history of mankind in terms of\nabsolute numbers of victims, and also in conceptual\nterms, because it led to the development and use of\nweapons of mass destruction. Above all, it saw several\ncases of genocide on an unheard-of scale, openly\nmotivated by the most despicable racism. It is essential\nto study the mechanisms which lead to these\naberrations into inhumanity, because repetitions of such\n3\n\ndestructive phenomena should be rejected and made\nimpossible.\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that we should\nremember, which means escaping from ignorance and\nalways bearing in mind the lessons of the past. If the\ncountries of the European Union are very sensitive\nwhenever they encounter xenophobia, racism and the\nrejection of those who are different, it is because we\nare resolved at all costs to act to avoid once again\nsuccumbing to the sickness of hatred. A Europe with a\ngrowing population, a European Union spreading to the\neast and the south, must act with determination to\ncontinue the course of openness.\nLuxembourg is a laboratory with a mixture of\npeoples, as a result of our being at the crossroads of\nFrench and German culture and because of the impact\nof immigration of long ago. The moral outlook of its\ncitizens leads them to respect others and their\nindividuality. With the coming of sovereignty,\nindependence and development became a reality for\nour country, and with them a strong adherence to the\nprinciple of equality, whether of individuals or States.\nIt is the responsibility of all States to expose the\ndangers of any tendency to feel contempt for others.\nUnfortunately, division and lack of respect for the\nworth of the individual can be seen on every continent.\nOnly five years ago the world deplored the most\nviolent racist crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda. Such\ncrimes must be rejected, for they create openings that\nthe prejudiced quickly take advantage of. We must\ncollectively assume responsibility in the fight against\nthis vicious circle.\nRespect for equality requires that we do not make\nindependence a sanctuary. Rather, it demands that we\naccept each other as partners and recognize the\nlegitimacy of our respective interests. Thanks to the\nprogress of the European Union, classic sovereignty\nhas been replaced for its member States by an\ninterdependence whose positive effects are impressive.\nThe solution, in the year 2000, is no longer abstract\nindependence, but concrete cooperation.\nThroughout the year 2000, the Security Council\nhas devoted a great deal of time to Africa in\nrecognition of the seriousness of the phenomenon of\ntaking large portions of countries hostage. Some of\nthese crises are being fuelled by the exploitation of\nnatural resources. The significant international reaction\nto these events is encouraging, but it must also lead to\nthe elimination of these situations. Among them, I will\nmention the problems in Angola, Sierra Leone and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nThese catastrophes, along with other\ndevelopments  in particular in East Timor, in\nsouthern Lebanon and along the border between\nEthiopia and Eritrea  have contributed to a\nconsiderable increase in United Nations peacekeeping\nactivities. However, these activities are suffering from\na lack of resources, to such an extent that both their\noperations and their credibility are compromised.\nInstead of being a deterrent, they risk becoming simply\nan alibi.\nI hope that this session will be able to adopt\nenergetic measures to implement the recommendations\nof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations,\nchaired by Mr. Brahimi. The lack of financial resources\nshould not be an insurmountable obstacle. Further, it is\nappropriate to take up this issue as part of this session's\nagenda item on the scale of assessments for\npeacekeeping operations. But in fact, these activities\nare above all operations aimed at maintaining\nceasefires. Achieving peace requires other efforts \nfirst and foremost the will to prevent conflicts and the\ndetermination to avoid their resurgence.\nAfter the research, the passionate discussions and\nthe debates  most recently those that took place in\nthe Security Council and in the General Assembly\ncommittee on the prevention of conflicts in Africa \nhave we found sufficient will to now take action? Such\na critical mass is necessary if a determined will to\nprevent conflicts is going to be manifested.\nHuman solidarity will be essential in those\ninstances in which the parties show they are incapable\nof avoiding conflict and when attacks on the integrity\nof individuals and major material consequences can be\nclearly foreseen. Indifference and lack of assistance in\nthe face of danger no longer accord with the universal\nawareness of the reality of our interconnectedness,\nwhich grows in parallel with the spread of knowledge.\nThis is an ethical issue, but it is also an issue of\nknowledge and technical resources. Luxembourg\nintends to create a civilian action corps to go on\nhumanitarian and human development missions.\nLuxembourg will contribute to the United Nations\nfunds for peace-building, and it is involved in\npeacekeeping operations and in reconstruction\nmissions.\n4\n\nThe will to prevent conflicts entails the ability to\nchoose from among a great range of mechanisms that\nare capable of dissuading those who, as a result of\nignorance or provocation, are turning to aggression.\nThis will to prevent conflicts can be that much more\neffective in managing disputes if it is invoked well\nbefore violence breaks out. Over eight years, the\ndiscreet action of the High Commissioner on National\nMinorities of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, Mr. Max van der Stoel, has\namply justified the confidence placed in him by 55\nEuropean States and former Soviet Republics and has\nproduced significant results.\nWhen people are struggling in isolation, external\ncooperation and solidarity can remove the most\ndifficult obstacles. The noteworthy Human\nDevelopment Report 2000 of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme stresses the importance of\npreventing conflicts, of inclusive democracy and of\nrespect for human rights as means of preventing\ncountries that have been bled white from being\nexcluded from the benefits of the global economy and\nof global technology.\nFor their part, Mr. Annan and Mr. Brahimi remind\nus that every action to reduce poverty and ensure a\nsolid foundation for growth is a step towards\npreventing conflicts. This is one of the keys of\ndevelopment. It is a very reliable method for building\nconfidence and reducing poverty. It is a responsibility\nthat we must take up.\nThe effort cannot be undertaken unless external\ncooperation is not in itself an obstacle. In many cases it\ngives rise to questions and resistance. But cooperation\nthat is not welcome is pointless. Unfortunately, at times\nmistrust and a certain pride prevail and lead to a\nfortress mentality. This in turn can lead to\noveremphasizing identity issues and to the\ndevelopment of a mental block.\nWhen a terrifying earthquake rocked Turkey in\n1999, the Greeks offered their assistance. This gesture\nand the Turks' acceptance of it have profoundly\ntransformed bilateral relations that have been\nparticularly difficult. This positive, spontaneous\ndevelopment was the result of the awareness of Foreign\nMinisters Papandreou and Cem that the ongoing harm\nbeing caused by the earlier mistrust was not acceptable.\nThis positive development is continuing, and it is\ngreatly hoped that it will soon be reflected in the\nconversations, under the aegis of the United Nations,\nbetween the Greek and Turkish Cypriot\ncommunities  conversations that are at present\nindirect.\nWhen confidence comes up against the invisible\nwall of ignorance, even the tendered hand will not be\ntaken. Thus, those who are separated by a\npsychological chasm should construct a bridgehead and\nexpress in a decent manner their willingness to achieve\nmutual recognition.\nThe Israelis and Palestinians were reconciled in\nsignificant ways as a result of the Camp David\nconversations. President Clinton, for his perseverance,\nPrime Minister Barak and President Arafat, for their\nawareness of history and their common acceptance of\ntheir shared responsibility to the future, deserve\nencouragement and the firmest support in their effort to\nconclude this historic process. I am convinced that the\nresources of this dialogue have not been exhausted.\nThere is an opportunity to achieve, within the next few\nweeks, a framework agreement. It must remain clear\nthat the willingness to cooperate has been firmly\nestablished. This willingness will be seconded by the\nwillingness of the international community, and of\nEurope in particular, to offer its support to the\nestablishment of peace and to the reconstruction\nefforts.\nThe sculpting of the role of the United Nations,\nthe shape of its future work, will be a complex and\ndemanding task if we expect the Organization to escape\nits current fragility and affirm its responsibility. But\nperhaps we can rely increasingly on the vast experience\nthat has been gained during past actions. The\ndevelopment of this collection of experiences requires\nincreasing internal cohesion. The responsibility for the\ndevelopment of this cohesion falls on the\nOrganization's Members. This is the objective we must\nset for ourselves. The willingness to cooperate must\nlead to the elaboration of healthy administrative and\nfinancial structures, as well as to balanced relations\nbetween the principal organs, none of which should be\nexempt from periodic reform.\nToday the United Nations cannot be said to be in\na position to meet these criteria. Therefore, is it not\nindispensable that its Members pay their assessments\nwithout delay or conditions, and in full?\nThe fact that the Security Council is not being\nreformed and the distance between the Council and the\nvast majority of General Assembly members does not\n5\n\ncontribute to the effectiveness of the Organization. The\nbridges that the United Nations will try to construct\nshould include, in order to seek greater unity of action,\na reinvigorated relationship between the General\nAssembly and a duly enlarged Security Council.\nThe United Nations will be put to the test. As a\nresult of the pursuit of globalization the Organization\nwill be in demand. Will it be capable of meeting the\nchallenge and of responding in a way that will put the\nOrganization at the centre of the major international\ndiscussions? Even after the Millennium Summit it\nwould be rash to claim that this question is closed.\nLuxembourg hopes that it will be possible to respond\npositively, and Luxembourg reaffirms its willingness to\ncooperate so that we can proceed together in this\ndirection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to welcome you to your post and to\nwish you every success in your important and difficult\nactivities in guiding the activities of this Assembly. I\nshould like to say how grateful we are to Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab for his wise guidance of the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe twentieth century was in every aspect a\ncentury of sharp contradictions in relations among\npeoples and nationalities, as well as a century of\neconomic disaster. The most stark examples were two\nworld wars, scores of civil wars and the catastrophe at\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as other\ntragedies.\nThe flames of war also raged in the African\nStates, which had gained independence in the 1960s. In\nCentral Asia, the Afghan wound is still bleeding, but\nthe most important event of the twentieth century was\nthe collapse of the enormous empire called the\nUSSR \u2014 an empire which wore the outer shell of\ninternational friendship but within which everything\nwas worm-eaten. New, independent sovereign states\narose from its ruins. Out of that rubble, our\nindependent neutral State arose \u2014 Turkmenistan,\nwhich from the very first days of its coming into being\nchose the path of goodness and justice, peace and\ncooperation.\nThe twentieth century did not resolve many of the\nproblems that needed resolution. Quite the contrary \u2014\nthe knots of these problems have become even more\ntangled and their lines even more taut. They have\naccompanied us into the twenty-first century and now\nwe must unravel this tangled web and relax these taut\nlines. This should be the task and concern of all\npeoples and nationalities.\nOur planet is the house we share and therefore it\nis the duty of everyone living on this planet to keep it\nclean and peaceful and to achieve economic stability.\nIn his report submitted to the Millennium Assembly,\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations drew our\nattention to problems which require immediate\nsolution, relating to all aspects of our lives.\nGlobalization is the priority problem. It is an\ninevitable objective process, part of the general course\nof world development, which includes many aspects,\nboth positive and negative. This is a decisive trend in\nworld development, which affects the whole complex\nand multifaceted field of international political and\neconomic relations. In this respect, questions of\ninternational law and the moral and juridical aspects of\nrelations between countries and regions cause concern\nand require constant monitoring.\nWe must not allow some to hold sway over others\nor allow mankind to be programmed according to one\nyardstick alone, and no sovereign state should be\ndictated to by insistence on one development model.\nThis is a very serious question, because this approach\ncalls into question the entire system of international\nrelations, the legitimacy of international legal norms\nand the principles and purposes \u2014 indeed, the viability\nof \u2014 the United Nations itself as the expression of\nvoluntary cooperation among equal nations.\nThe model of political globalization based on the\nsupremacy of a neo-liberal philosophy is gradually\nstrengthening the logic of confrontational thought in\ninternational affairs, leading to the arm-twisting of\nthose who don't recognize the new international power\nstructure based on humanitarian intervention and\nprotecting human rights, but not on the rights of\npeoples.\nTurkmenistan, like the overwhelming majority of\nStates, is against this approach. We are convinced that\nthe common progress of mankind lies not in dictating\none model or in a single set of laws and principles, but\na combination of ideas and philosophies. In this\n8\n\ncontext, I should like to stress the importance and\ntimeliness of the idea put forward by the President of\nIran, President Khatami, of a dialogue between\ncivilizations. We started this century and this\nmillennium under such a profound symbol, and this\nobliges us to have respect and tolerance for a whole\nrange of centuries-old cultures and State systems. That\nis how we see the possibility for a friendly dialogue\namong States, peoples and individuals.\nWe must move away from looking for differences\namong us and start looking for what brings us together,\nwithout forgetting our specific features. That is our\napproach in our relations to the world and with all our\npartners, and this has made it possible for my country\nin the short period of time since our independence to\nbuild friendly relations with all our neighbours in the\nregion and to find many friends far beyond the confines\nof our neighbourhood.\n\nThe main achievement of independent\nTurkmenistan was to ensure stability within our State,\nand this stability has been guaranteed because of the\nuniversal support of the programmes and tasks facing\nthe State, in which our people take a direct part. It is\nthanks to this stability that we are today successfully\nimplementing economic and social programmes that\nseek to provide well-being for our citizens.\nThe development of a socially oriented policy has\nbeen reflected in a strategy for socio-economic reforms\nin Turkmenistan for the period up to 2010. That\nprogramme envisages a continuation of the policy that\ngives priority to social programmes, bearing in mind\nthe economic realities that have emerged in the years of\nour independence. Today, Turkmenistan is a country\nthat is self-sufficient in grain and basic food products\nand that has implemented the main parts of its overall\nprogramme for economic security.\nIn our economic programme, we stress in\nparticular developing the real sector of the economy,\ninstitutional transformations and attracting\ninvestment \u2014 including foreign investment.\nAgriculture is our priority, as well as the fuel and\nenergy sectors, the chemicals industry and consumer\ncomplexes, transport and communications\ninfrastructure and a network of transnational pipelines\nthat export Turkmenistan's fuel to world markets.\nOne of the main tasks in this coming period will\nbe to develop our productive potential. Here, a leading\nrole will be played by the fuel industry. We intend to\nconcentrate our efforts on labour-intensive sectors;\nthese are promising from the point of view of their\npotential and competitiveness. The economic growth of\nour State should guarantee the well-being of our\ncitizens.\nFrom the standpoint of ensuring sustainable\nsocial development and the progress and well-being of\nour people, regional cooperation is becoming\nparticularly important. In our region, we have a stable\nsystem for active economic interaction, provided by the\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), which\nconsists of 10 States with major resource and economic\npotential. Over the past few years within ECO we have\nstarted to implement some important interregional\ntransportation and communications projects which will\nbring the European and Asian countries' economies\ncloser together, bridge the technological gap between\nthem and establish an equitable system of trade and\neconomic relations between the North and the South.\nThat same goal is currently being served by\nTurkmenistan's efforts to export energy raw materials\nto world markets. Building pipelines is not just a\nquestion of profitable commercial projects; these are\nalso projects for the social development of our country\non an enormous scale, going well beyond our national\nconfines. Because of this, Turkmenistan is taking an\ninitiative to draft an international legal instrument to\nguarantee the safe, unimpeded transit of energy raw\nmaterials through major inter-State pipelines. This\ninstrument is necessary to make sure that the interests\nof the producers are taken into account, as well as\nthose of the transit countries and consumers, and that\nwe totally rule out the possibility of the use of these\npipelines as an instrument for political and economic\npressure.\nAnother problem that could severely damage\nregional stability is the question of the legal status of\nthe Caspian Sea. The lack of clarity on this question\nand the one-sided scenarios being offered impede the\nuse of the enormous potential of this sea. For\nTurkmenistan, the main point is to take into account\nthe interests of all riparian states in order to ensure that\ncooperation on the Caspian is based on mutual respect,\nequality and mutual benefit. Turkmenistan believes that\nseeking a new legal status for the Caspian Sea requires\nall riparian States to make some sensible compromises\n9\n\nand show a willingness squarely to face the new\nrealities. This process should be monitored by the\nUnited Nations.\nTouching on regional security, allow me to dwell\non the grave Afghanistan problem, which we take\nparticularly seriously. The history of the long-suffering\nAfghan people has shown that any outside interference\nin this domestic conflict, particularly the use of force,\nis futile and will only make matters worse. We are\nfacing a fair accompli, and in this situation we must\nrecognize that dialogue and cooperation with the\nTaliban will give more results from the point of view of\ntheir natural modernization than any attempts to isolate\nthem or to impose any kind of sanctions on them.\nSanctions basically work against the Afghan people.\nThey are therefore counterproductive.\nTurkmenistan favours a peaceful solution of its\nconflicts, and as a neutral, friendly neighbouring State\nis prepared actively to promote the Afghan settlement\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. In particular,\nrecently, upon the initiative of the President of\nTurkmenistan, another initiative was taken to work out\nsome mutually acceptable solution to resolve this\nAfghanistan conflict. That was the point of the\nTurkmenistan mission which went to Iran, Afghanistan\nand Pakistan and held talks and consultations with top\nleaders of these countries and with the leaders of the\nTaliban movement and the Northern Alliance, after\nwhich proposals to settle the conflict were made at the\nrecent meeting between the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations and the Afghanistan six plus two group.\nTogether with the United Nations, Turkmenistan is\nmaking every effort to convince the belligerents to\ncease fire and to sit down at the negotiating table.\nIn conclusion, I again assure the Assembly that in\nTurkmenistan the United Nations has an active\nMember prepared to make every effort to discharge the\nlofty tasks decided at the United Nations Millennium\nSummit. As we enter the new millennium we begin to\nwonder what it will be like. What awaits us in the\nfuture? Every person, every people, living in this world\nis striving for a better, more radiant future, which has\nto be built consistently, insistently, on the basis of\npeace, respect and progress. I hope that all the peoples\nof the world will devote themselves to that goal."

        "file_text": "On my way to the\nAssembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State\nCouncil of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a\nself-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani\nmilitary personnel \u2014 army, plain-clothes personnel and\narmed Taliban \u2014 are reported to have been positioned\nin the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border\ntown of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound\nfor an attack on Badakhshan province.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I take this\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the major task of presiding over the\nimportant millennium session of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to congratulate the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\nhis excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of\nthe General Assembly, which set the stage for the\nMillennium Summit.\nThree years ago, I stood before the Assembly and\nstated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in\nAfghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and\nanswer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the\ndark and ominous movement known as the Taliban,\nwhich, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded\nAfghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the\nGeneral Assembly indeed has to answer major\nquestions. One among many is the silence the world\nhas chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their\nPakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism,\nwhich has led to the abject misery of the Afghan\nnation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region\nand beyond, is it not high time that the international\ncommunity put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban\nprocessing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and\ninadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this\nview that I should like to focus my statement entirely\non the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating\nregional and international implications, within the\ngiven time limit.\n4\nA question arises: what has been the result of the\nTalibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In\nan age of information and globalization, it has been a\nreign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in\nthe name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms\nand civil liberties, massive violations of human rights,\ndegrading and tormenting treatment of men and\nwomen, trafficking of women and girls, the forced\nseparation of women from their menfolk, the random\nand deliberate round-up of individuals based on their\nethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of\nfarmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the\ncontamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch\nof children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of\nall but rudimentary religious education \u2014 for male\nstudents only \u2014 with the closure of all schools for\nfemales, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian\naid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the\nsituation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of\nthe historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in\norder to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry\nand historical identity.\nThe objective of the Pakistani military\nintelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services\nIntelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to\ncreate instability in Central and South Asia by means\nof terrorism. This \u201cIslamic Emirate\u201d has instituted\nMullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed\nAmir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning \u201cCommander of the\nfaithful\u201d not only in Afghanistan, but in theory\nthroughout the Muslim world.\nThe process the Pakistani military intelligence\nhas chosen for the realization of its objective is to\ntransform the Afghan nation into an exhausted,\ndevastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation\nstruggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to\nturn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit\nactivities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other\ncrimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing\ncentres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act\nas the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan\ncontinues to carry out these activities under the name\nof Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment\nthat such activities have led to the defamation of both\nthe noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims\nthroughout the world.\nIn short, the Afghan nation has become the direct\nvictim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani\nmilitary's hegemonic interests in the region. These\ndiabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military\nintelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution,\nwhile the implied risk and perilous consequences for\nthe very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are\noverlooked.\nAs the world is gradually awakening to the\ncreeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that\nsome \u201ccivilized\u201d nations, on certain occasions, have\npreferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban,\nan entity which has failed to meet the minimum\nstandard of being considered civilized, while having\nchampioned terrorism, human rights violations and\ncrimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only\nPakistan's military junta has continuously given its full\nblessing to the movement.\nAt least until early May of this year, the official\nposition of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and\nofficials strangely claimed, was that it maintained\ncontacts with both parties to the conflict. However,\nPakistan's News Network International (NNI) news\nagency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez\nMusharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy\nwas \u201cin accordance with Pakistan's national interest.\u201d\nAdvocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of\nPakistan, the General was quoted as saying, \u201cWe have a\nnational security interest, both demographic and\ngeographic.\u201d He further stated that in the realization of\nthis security interest, \u201cPashtoons should be on our side\nand they\u201d, meaning Pashtoons, \u201care represented by\nTaliban.\u201d\nThe world must know that in a flagrant violation\nof recognized international norms and principles and in\nclear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler\nof the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous\npretext of national security interest, has claimed the\nright to impose a certain ethnic group through the\ninvocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the\ncost of the sovereignty and political independence of\nAfghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and,\nprior to that, of the League of Nations, long before\nPakistan was even born.\nIt is important to remember that terrorist training\ncamps operating from the Taliban-held territories of\nAfghanistan, including those established by the\ninfamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has\n5\nbeen repeatedly called for by the United Nations and\nthe entire international community, have been\nestablished by Pakistan's military intelligence through\nthe Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks.\nThey continue to utilize these territories as a ground for\ntraining, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements\nseeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the\nregion and beyond. This is done under the guise of\nIslam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani\nhegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan\nand the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and\nactivities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and\nUzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of\nthe Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is\nhigh time that the Security Council, in accordance with\nrelevant resolutions, undertook appropriate\nenforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the\nprime source of sponsorship of these activities.\nThe Security Council, in its unanimously adopted\nresolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly\ndemanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from\nsheltering, supporting and training terrorists and\nplanning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other\ncountries and that it extradite to the requesting States\nthose indicted for committing international acts of\nterrorism.\nThe recent upsurge of terrorist activities in\nCentral Asian countries and beyond, emanating from\nthe Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires\ndrastic measures by the Security Council against the\nmilitia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration\nof the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the\nexpansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999),\nwhich must include the end of terrorist activities in all\nforms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of\nAfghanistan, could adequately, among other things,\nserve the cause of peace and security in the region.\nHere I would like to welcome the proposal by the\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for convening an international\nconference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the\nevil phenomenon of terrorism.\nIn spite of the current devastating drought in\nAfghanistan \u2014 the most severe in 30 years \u2014\nAfghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics.\nThe production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by\nthe Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan,\naccount for considerable revenue, which is used to\nfinance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to\nconsiderable transnational organized crime, while\nadding to the number of addicts, both at home and\nabroad.\nAmong the many deliberate violations and\ninstances of absolute disregard for international\nhumanitarian law and the numerous crimes against\nhumanity committed by the Taliban and their outside\nsupporters in the year 2000, one could mention the\nfollowing cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of\n198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as\nhostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August\nof the United Nations mine-clearance employees\naffiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and\nAfghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access\nto humanitarian aid that, according to the European\nUnion, in the light of the devastating drought\nconstituted a breach of international humanitarian law;\nthe forced blood-drawing and organ removal of\ninnocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in\nAugust; the forced deportation of the civilian\npopulations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the\nclosing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from\nworking, of all bakeries run by the United Nations\nWorld Food Programme in which widows were paid to\nmake bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to\nother widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul\nalone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of\ncivilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and\nthe forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of\npeople throughout the north due to renewed Taliban\nmilitary onslaughts.\nWe believe that the commission of those heinous\ncrimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to\nthe lack of adequate response by the Security Council\nand the international community to bring to justice the\nperpetrators and others involved in incidents at\nBamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in\n1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings\nof Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military\nadviser to the United Nations Special Mission to\nAfghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998.\nIt is significant to note that the Taliban continue\nto deprive women of their fundamental rights,\nincluding the right to education, which affects over\n100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are\nstill barred from employment by the Taliban. While the\npredictable results will speak for themselves, present\n6\nand future female generations of Afghanistan will be\nilliterate. The cultural and social impact of that\ncriminal act on the country's future generations will be\nenormous.\nPakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a\nfact well known to the international community. The\nhundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting\nalongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the\nGovernment; the mortal remains of hundreds of\nPakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and\nidentification cards obtained from their pockets; the\nintercepted radio transmissions; and the massive\nlogistical support and the overt supply of large\nquantities of military hardware and ammunition, all\nprove the direct involvement of Pakistani army\npersonnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General\nRustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently\nstationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province,\ncommands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations\nin the north. He has been assisted by two of bin\nLaden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them\nwere involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and\nin the atrocities committed against the civilian\npopulation. It is important to mention that the\nNovember/December issue of Foreign Affairs\nmagazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis\nhaving fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in\nexcess of 80,000.\nA breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in\nAfghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed\ncontingents, including units from the North-West\nFrontier Corps and different commando units, have\nactively participated in battles on various occasions;\nInter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the\nplanning and command and control of both intelligence\noperations and logistical support; ex-commissioned\nofficers in charge of tactical operations, artillery\nsupport and logistics; frontier militia units;\nparamilitary members of extremist terrorist groups\naffiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the\nSepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and\nthe so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or\nreligious schools.\nOther categories of foreign fighters in\nAfghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda\ngroup and its affiliated units from around the Persian\nGulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups\nfrom Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In\naddition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were\neducated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are\ndispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally,\nthere are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons\nfrom around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon\nfodder.\nIn this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\nappeals to the Security Council to mandate the United\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an\ninvestigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report\nto the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani\narmed men and Arab fighters who are working\nshoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries.\nThis would break the silence that has thus far\nencouraged further Pakistani intervention in\nAfghanistan.\nI should like to remind the Assembly that only\nthose Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will\nbe immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity\nand genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment.\nOne must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah\nindirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace\ninitiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that\npeace has no place in the Taliban agenda.\nWhile striving for the realization of noble human\nvalues and principles \u2014 the institution of a democratic\nsystem, the observance of human rights, including\nthose of women and girls, civil liberties and\nelections \u2014 the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates\nits firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement\nof the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for\nthe formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully\nrepresentative Government through a workable\nmechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or\nloya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the\nauspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as\nPakistan continues to directly and massively intervene\nin the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State\nof Afghanistan considers the task of defending the\nterritorial integrity, national unity and political\nindependence of Afghanistan its immediate priority.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has high\nexpectations that the United Nations and the\ninternational community will exert pressure on\nPakistan to immediately cease its intervention in\nAfghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel\nand armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the\nSecurity Council will address the question of foreign\n7\nintervention, the existence of terrorist networks in\nAfghanistan and the effective implementation of\nrelevant Security Council resolutions; that the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its\nview of the Taliban's words and deeds \u2014 spoken and\ncarried out in the name of Islam \u2014 which we believe\ndistort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its\ntenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug\nControl Programme will assist the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan in the fight against the production and\ntrafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and\nthe international community will step up their efforts\nfor an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan\nconflict; and that the international community will\nprovide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and\ndrought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I\nshould like to mention that the current drought, the\nmost severe in 30 years, will have tremendous\nhumanitarian repercussions.\nWe remain thankful for the statements made by\nthe heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and\nin the General Assembly expressing their legitimate\nconcerns over the dangers emanating from the\nPakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan.\nWe deeply appreciate and support the\nindefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the\nSecretary-General's Special Representative for\nAfghanistan and head of the United Nations Special\nMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no\nstone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries\nconcerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful\nsolution to the Afghan conflict.\nI should like to conclude by stating that the\nUnited Nations cannot embark on the new millennium\nwithout appropriately addressing the issues enshrined\nin its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body\nadvocate globalization in its true sense when\nTalibanization is threatening regional stability in our\npart of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta\nwill remain the prime actor in this dreadful and\nimmense tragedy in Asia.\nLike many others afflicted with the Taliban\nplague, we wonder how far the evil threat of\nTalibanism will spread, how many more souls it will\nbury and how many new borders it must cross before\nthe conscience of the international community is\nawakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate\nand drastic preventive measures.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me\nat the outset, Mr. President, to convey to you our\ncordial congratulations and regards on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. I am convinced that your competence and\nactive cooperation with United Nations Member States\nwill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\nI would also like to express sincere thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, for the effective manner in\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session.\nAt the same time, I wish to commend Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, for his firm leadership\nsince taking office and for his visionary and action-\noriented report \u201cWe the peoples:\u201d. This report, together\nwith the forward-looking Millennium Declaration,\nadopted two weeks ago at the historic Millennium\nSummit, sets an ambitious agenda for the United\nNations for the twenty-first century.\nI would also like to convey our warmest welcome\nto Tuvalu, the newest Member of the United Nations.\nAs we enter the new millennium, the prospects\nfor the international community's evolution are marked\nby justified hopes, generated by the significant changes\nthat occurred in the international arena during the last\ndecade, yet also by hesitation and sometimes by\nscepticism regarding our capacity to efficiently face\ntoday's worldwide challenges. The Millennium Summit\noffered a unique opportunity to reflect on the global\nproblems that confront the world today and to identify\nand act on the challenges ahead. It reaffirmed the\ncentrality of the world Organization in addressing the\nglobal, social, security and economic needs for the\nbenefit of people. We have ahead of us a real challenge\nto reshape the United Nations so that it can realize its\nuniversal goals of peace, human security, cooperation,\npoverty eradication and sustainable development. From\nthis perspective, the Republic of Moldova attaches the\nutmost importance to the implementation of the\ncommitments inscribed in the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration.\nThough the international community, and in\nparticular international organizations, makes systematic\nefforts aimed at resolving conflicts, we should\nrecognize that these efforts sometimes fall short of\nreaching their proposed goals. Currently, on the\nEuropean continent alone, we are witnessing a number\nof unresolved conflicts and potentially crisis-\ngenerating situations.\nDemocratic transformations and economic\ndevelopment in some South-Eastern European\ncountries, including the Republic of Moldova, are also\njeopardized by unresolved internal conflicts. In the past\n2\n\neight years we have made sustained efforts to settle the\nconflict in the eastern region of the country, in full\ncompliance with the principles of international law and\ninternational practice. The mechanism of settlement,\ninvolving the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the mediating\nStates, Russia and Ukraine, has been established.\nMoldova is oriented towards a complete settlement of\nthe conflict, respecting the principle of the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of my country, and at the same\ntime granting to the region autonomous status. Despite\nthe reasonable compromises proposed by the\nconstitutional authorities, separatist tendencies still\npersist. It is an apparent peace, which distracts the\nattention of the international community from the\nimperatives of finding ways to settle the conflict and\nsimultaneously impedes economic and democratic\nreforms.\nThe situation becomes more difficult if the fact\nthat the region is over-militarized is taken into account.\nTens of thousands of tons of munitions, armaments and\nequipment, sometimes accounted for and sometimes\nnot, that are limited under the Treaty on Conventional\nArmed Forces in Europe (CFE), are deployed in the\nregion. An early, complete and unconditional\nwithdrawal of foreign troops, munitions and\narmaments, as stipulated in the OSCE Istanbul Summit\ndocuments, and as required by the CFE Treaty, would\nundoubtedly facilitate the peaceful and complete\nsettlement of this conflict. I express our hope that,\ntogether with our partners, and assisted by the relevant\ninternational organizations, we will be able to ensure\nthe implementation of the schedule for the withdrawal\nof foreign troops from the territory of Moldova. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to express our\ngratitude for the political and financial support granted\nby a number of States in order to facilitate the process\nof withdrawal and the destruction of the armaments.\nAlthough some of the so-called frozen conflicts,\nat least in our region, do not appear to be getting\nworse, there is a growing sense of frustration that the\nsolution is not yet within our reach. It is therefore\nimperative to enhance political awareness regarding\nunresolved or potential conflicts, with a view to\nactively involving the United Nations and relevant\nregional organizations in their settlement.\nIt is well known that the settlement of an ongoing\nconflict requires incomparably greater political,\nfinancial and moral efforts than are needed at the stage\nof preventing conflict. It has become obvious that\nUnited Nations mechanisms and strategies for dealing\nwith threats to stability are inadequate. They need to be\nstrengthened, not only to resolve conflicts and conflict\nsituations, but, more important, to prevent them. From\nthis perspective, the Republic of Moldova fully\nsupports the Secretary-General's efforts to direct the\nUnited Nations strategy towards conflict prevention.\nWe welcome the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\noperations. In our view the implementation of its\nrecommendations will significantly consolidate the\ncapacity of the United Nations in conflict prevention,\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\nMember States should provide the Organization\nwith the necessary support to enhance the rapid\ndeployment capabilities of the United Nations through\nthe involvement of the United Nations standby\narrangements system. Given this context, I would like\nto inform the Assembly that Moldova has already\nestablished the legal and institutional framework for its\nfuture participation in peacekeeping operations and the\nUnited Nations standby arrangements system.\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are essential\nelements of the security architecture. The Republic of\nMoldova, like many other countries, considers that we\nshould continue our efforts to achieve disarmament and\nnon-proliferation, with universal ratification of the\nmajor multilateral disarmament instruments and\nnegotiations on biological weapons, ballistic missiles\nand small arms. In particular, we should reaffirm the\nrole of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty as the\ncornerstone of international peace, security and\nstrategic stability. The Republic of Moldova attaches\nthe utmost importance also to the issue of small and\nlight weapons, primarily to the effort to create effective\ninternational mechanisms for the prevention of their\nillegal transfer, especially in areas of conflict. In this\nrespect, we are prepared to bring our contribution to\nthe preparation of the international conference on illicit\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons in all its\naspects, to be held next summer.\nMy country highly appreciates the proposals of\nthe Secretary-General on the issues of development and\npoverty eradication as reflected in the millennium\nreport and in the report on the work of the Organization\nsubmitted to the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly.\n3\n\nIn conditions of globalization, which has\ngenerated profound transformations in the global\neconomy, this issue becomes even more important,\nparticularly for less developed States and for States\nwith economies in transition. A United Nations system\nbetter adapted to the necessities of economic\ndevelopment should pay more attention to the\nharmonization of commercial policies, cooperation in\nthe technological field, and the monetary policies of\nmember States and international institutions.\nIn these efforts, the United Nations should enlist\nthe support of governmental economic and financial\ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental\norganizations, thus promoting a partnership with a view\nto development. A redefinition of the cooperation\nframework and international help is needed, which\nshould involve new strategies and investment policies.\nMy country favours the elaboration of strategies of and\nmeasures for globalization management, and also\nfavours the holding of a special session of the General\nAssembly regarding globalization and a United Nations\nconference on the less developed countries next year.\nIn order to reach sustainable development\nfocused on the human being, there is a need to improve\nthe partnership among developing and developed\ncountries, international institutions and civil society.\nWe consider that the United Nations, as a framework\nfor international cooperation, should play a key role in\nsupporting and coordinating national efforts. Within\nthe framework of the United Nations development\nprogrammes and funds, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) plays a special role\nin human sustainable development. United Nations\nassistance provided through UNDP has contributed to\nstrengthening the legal and institutional framework\nnecessary for the continuation of countries' reforms.\nCurrently, the framework for cooperation between\nthe Republic of Moldova and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme embraces approximately 40\nprojects in the fields of governing and democracy,\nenvironmental protection and regeneration, the\nprotection of fundamental human rights and freedoms,\nthe promotion of women, poverty reduction and\neradication, economic and social strategies, and human\nsustainable development. I would also like to mention\nthe important role of the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe. By promoting the\ndissemination and implementation of the instruments\nof the Commission, we would ensure the adjustment of\neconomies in transition to international and European\nstandards. Thus, the projects implemented by the\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe\nwould contribute directly to the integration of these\neconomies into the world economy.\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the activity of\nthese institutions. We consider, however, that their\nfinancial resources should be increased and the\nmanagement of resources should be more efficient. We\nwelcome the actions undertaken by the UNDP\nAdministrator, reflected in the Administrator's business\nplans, and those of the Executive Secretary of the\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe,\nmeant to enhance the efficiency of the activities and\nresource management of these important institutions.\nWe consider that the establishment of strong positions\nregarding development policies, through an\nunderstanding of the characteristic conditions and\nspecific needs of countries, would contribute\nsignificantly to the Organization's reaching its goals in\nthis domain.\nThe reform of the Security Council lies at the\nheart of the general reform of the United Nations. It\nshould be guided by the principles of equitable\ngeographic representation, democracy, effectiveness,\nefficiency and transparency. It is on this foundation\nthat we can modernize the composition of the Security\nCouncil and bring it into line with the substantial\nincrease in the general membership of the United\nNations since 1963, the year of the only previous\nreform of the Council. The Republic of Moldova\npronounces itself in favour of a moderate enlargement\nof the Council's composition and of a reasonable\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-\npermanent members which would correspond to the\nprinciple of fair geographical distribution and ensure\nan adequate balance between the industrialized and\ndeveloping countries.\nOur country also welcomes the process of\nrevitalization and improvement of the General\nAssembly's efficiency and, at the same time, supports\nthe idea of restoring the central role of the Assembly as\nthe debating and main representative body of the\nUnited Nations. We consider that it is necessary to\ncontinue the efforts to consolidate the coordinating\nfunctions of the Economic and Social Council\nregarding United Nations funds and programmes.\nUnder existing conditions it is clear that United\nNations reform will continue successfully only if the\n4\n\nfinancial problems affecting the Organization's\nactivities are solved. We support the proposals aimed at\nthe reform of the United Nations scales of assessments,\nincluding the peacekeeping scale, taking into\nconsideration the payment capacity of each State.\nDespite the difficulties it faces, my country makes\nevery effort to reduce its United Nations budget\narrears.\nThe evolution of the situation in the international\narena in the past 55 years calls for imposes a new\nvision and a redefinition of the concrete mechanisms\nfor realizing the fundamental objectives of the\nOrganization, which spring essentially from the\nfounding philosophy of the Charter of the United\nNations. In this respect, the Organization should draw\nconclusions from its own past and, relying on\npermanent support from States, should accomplish new\ntasks from the perspective of adapting to the\nimperatives of time. We express our hope that the\nUnited Nations, which remains indispensable for the\ninternational community in the twenty-first century,\nwill be able to impose a positive direction on this\nevolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I\nwould like first of all to join previous speakers in\nextending my congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth\nMillennium session of the General Assembly.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the outstanding and fruitful\nway in which he guided the work of the fifty-fourth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation wishes to express its deep\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\n21\n\ncontinuing and tireless efforts in steering the United\nNations through the uncharted waters of world affairs\nwhile adapting it to the new global forces of change.\nWe welcome Tuvalu into the family of nations,\nand the Republic of Suriname looks forward to\nworking together with it in implementing the principles\nand goals of the Organization.\nThis Millennium Assembly is a unique\nopportunity to take stock of, and to reflect on, recent\nexperiences with the phenomenon of globalization,\nwhich continues to dominate developments in the\neconomic, political and cultural field at both the\nnational and international levels, affecting the daily\nlives of millions of people, their institutions and\nrelations between States.\nWe recognize that while globalization can be a\npowerful and dynamic force in the promotion of\neconomic growth and development, it also poses risks\nand new challenges to individuals and nations alike.\nThe fact of the matter is that globalization has\ngenerated new economic disparities, as its benefits\nremain highly concentrated in only a few countries.\nThis has brought about increased vulnerability and\neconomic instability, in particular to the least\ndeveloped countries and to the structurally weak and\nvulnerable small States.\nMany of these countries have difficulty in coping\nwith the increased competition arising from trade\nliberalization and lack the capacity to take advantage of\nthe new opportunities brought about by globalization,\nwhich in turn puts them at risk of marginalization and\neven complete exclusion  the so-called big losers of\nglobalization.\nIt is for this reason that, during the recently held\nMillennium Summit, consensus was reached at the\nhighest political level that globalization must be\nconsidered in the wider context of development and of\nour shared responsibility to ensure that, through a more\ninclusive, transparent and participatory decision-\nmaking process in international economic issues, the\nbenefits of globalization are accessible to all on an\nequal footing.\nWe also concur with the view that the United\nNations, as the most universal forum, has a crucial and\ncentral role to play in forging understanding and\nconsensus among its Members, so as to create more\nopportunities for all, and indeed not to leave billions of\npeople in a state of poverty and exclusion. We look\nforward to concrete actions to be taken in this regard.\nAll nations have a collective responsibility to\naddress current global concerns, such as\nunderdevelopment and acute poverty, the growing\ninequality within and among nations, violent conflicts\nand civil wars which cause untold human suffering in\nthe South and are fuelled by the global arms bazaar,\nenvironmental degradation, refugees and migration,\nHIV/AIDS and other threats to public health, bridging\nthe digital divide and the emergence of global\ncriminal conglomerates.\nIn the context of the aforementioned, we welcome\nthe initiative taken by the Secretary-General to create a\ndigital task force with the aim of bridging the digital\ndivide. In order not to lag behind in our present era\ndominated by the advances in information and\ncommunications technology, the President of the\nRepublic of Suriname launched a national information\nand communications technology initiative in his\ninaugural statement on 12 August of this year in order\nto catch the Internet Express without delay and to\npromote national access to information and\ncommunication services at all levels of education and\nall areas of the public domain. We welcome the\ncontribution of the Kingdom of Norway to assist the\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) in this regard.\nLast April, the developing countries met in\nHavana and, in a renewed spirit of cooperation,\nsolidarity and shared responsibilities, they agreed to\nclose ranks and implement an action-oriented\nprogramme to assist the developing countries in\nbridging the gap with their more affluent partners from\nthe North. Although essential in contributing to\ndevelopment, South-South cooperation is not a\nreplacement for North-South cooperation; nevertheless\nbetter relations between the members of the South will\ncontribute to better relations between the South and the\nNorth.\nUnfortunately, globalization and trade\nliberalization have not created the necessary conditions\nto accelerate growth and development for small and\nvulnerable States. On the contrary, these countries have\nbeen further marginalized in world economic affairs\nand are threatened by the provisions of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), demanding an end to the special\nand preferential arrangements, enacted solely to level\nthe playing field. We, therefore, reiterate our request\n22\n\nfor the international community's early adoption of a\nvulnerability index so as to consider assistance to these\ncountries, based on their specific vulnerabilities and\nnot solely on their gross domestic product. We are\npleased that an appeal was made in the Millennium\nDeclaration to enact such a vulnerability index.\nRecently, the 12 Presidents of South America\nassembled in Brasilia to discuss daunting issues that\nare common to the region and to pledge their political\nwill and support as a firm foundation for enhanced\ncooperation among their respective countries. We thank\nthe Government of Brazil for so gracefully hosting this\nSummit. The Declaration coming out of that meeting,\nin letter and spirit, underlined the necessity of closer\ncooperation between our countries in order to be able\nto adapt successfully to the demands of globalization.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the\nGovernment of Suriname considers it of crucial\nimportance that Member States achieve tangible results\nin the areas of disarmament, arms control and non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons in maintaining peace\nand reinforcing international security for all States.\nThe reform of the Security Council remains\ncrucial for our efforts to make the United Nations more\neffective in dealing with global peace and security\nissues. So far, however, reaching consensus on how to\nrestructure and reform this important body has eluded\nus as a consequence of differences among the Member\nStates with respect to the scope and nature of the\nneeded changes. My Government reiterates its view\nthat the membership of this Council should be\nincreased with members from both the developed and\ndeveloping world and considers in this context the\nproposals presented by the Non-Aligned Movement\n(NAM) as instrumental.\nWe also believe that agreement must be reached\non defining the relationship between the Council and\nother principal organs of the United Nations, such as\nthe Economic and Social Council and the General\nAssembly. We are of the opinion that the Security\nCouncil should focus its actions on creating a peaceful\nsecurity environment, while the temporarily established\nUnited Nations involvements related to socio-economic\nand political development in affected countries should\nbe coordinated by the Economic and Social Council\nand/or the General Assembly. Such an arrangement,\nbased on the Charter provisions, will undoubtedly\ncontribute to greater effectiveness and efficiency of the\nUnited Nations, while limiting the influence of national\npolicy considerations on its activities. Let us use the\nmomentum created by the Millennium Summit to\nstrengthen our resolve in reaching a consensus on this\nmatter as soon as possible.\nThe Government of Suriname wishes to\nunderscore the importance of the United Nations as the\nuniversal forum to enable Member States to reach\nconsensus on issues related to peace, security,\ndevelopment and international economic cooperation.\nWe wish to express our gratitude to the Kingdom of the\nNetherlands for resuming bilateral cooperation between\nour countries and to thank them for their support in this\narea.\nThe United Nations Charter embodies lofty and\nnoble principles that remain valid today, as was\nreiterated by all the Heads of State and Government at\nthe recently held Millennium Summit.\nIn order to make the United Nations a more\neffective instrument in the hands of the world's people,\nwe must continue to be guided by these principles in\nconducting national and international affairs. In this\nregard, it is essential to honour the commitment to\nproviding the necessary financial means in a timely and\npredictable manner in order to enable the United\nNations to fulfil its mandates.\nFinally, as we enter the new millennium in an\nemerging global village, we must bear in mind that we\nare one human family in all our diversity, living in one\ncommon homeland, the planet Earth, and that we must\ntherefore cooperate in creating a more just, more\nsustainable and more peaceful world in which everyone\nwill live in a clean environment with a fair distribution\nof the Earth's resources  indeed, as the Secretary-\nGeneral has called for in his millennium report, a world\nfree from want, free from fear, that does not\ncompromise the ability of our planet to provide for the\nneeds of our children and for future generations. My\ncountry stands ready to play its part and to contribute\nto this, our common endeavour."

Panama shares\nthese and other concerns of the Secretary-General.\nIndeed, as the other members of the Ibero-American\ncommunity are aware, upon an initiative of President\nMireya Moscoso announced at Havana in November\nlast year, the next Summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of Ibero-America, which will take place\nshortly in Panama, will be dedicated to discussing the\nproblems facing children and young people in our\nregion. In the preparations for this meeting, which\nPanama has undertaken with the greatest enthusiasm,\nthe national Government has received the support of\norganizations devoted to the well-being of the world's\nchildren and young people. These include the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \u2014 a United\nNations agency which has selected Panama as its new\nregional headquarters and to whose noteworthy\nactivities, in fulfilment of its mandate, I am glad to pay\ntribute on this occasion \u2014 together with agencies\nresponsible for promoting culture, particularly the\nculture of peace, including the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), another United Nations agency which has\ndone extremely valuable work in promoting universal\nunderstanding through education, technology and\ncommunication.\nWith respect to gender equality, we are glad to be\nable to state that in recent years our country has made\nsignificant progress, particularly with respect to the\npolitical participation of women. Indeed, since\n1 September last year a woman has guided the destiny\nof our nation. From January this year our Supreme\nCourt of Justice has been presided over by a woman.\nDuring the review conference on women held in the\ncontext of the special session of the General Assembly\nin June 2000, the delegation of Panama signed the\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which\nmakes it possible to have recourse to an international\nbody in case of the denial of such rights. Furthermore,\nPanama has made significant improvements in access\nfor women to education and health. However, much\nstill remains to be done, particularly with respect to\nequal access to economic resources. In this area, which\nis closely bound up with sustainable human\ndevelopment, my country hopes to make significant\nadvances, particularly through international\ncooperation.\nOn this point, international cooperation, I should\nlike to share some brief thoughts and place them before\nthis distinguished body for consideration. More than 40\nyears ago one of my predecessors in the post of\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Miguel J. Moreno,\naddressed this General Assembly on the topic of\ninternational cooperation for development. On that\noccasion Minister Moreno stated:\n\u201cEconomic development, and international\ncooperation for the attainment of such\ndevelopment, are not only necessary if world\npeace is to be achieved, but also represent\nimportant means of cementing it and making it\ndurable.\u201d (A/PV.749, para. 176)\nDr. Moreno added:\n\u201cSocial tranquillity and national political stability\ndepend on economic development and on the\nbenefits which the peoples derive therefrom, as\ndo also a better understanding among the nations\nand international harmony; all these are\nindispensable for world peace.\u201d (A/PV.749,\npara. 178)\nThese wise words are as true today as they were\nwhen they were uttered at the thirteenth session of the\nGeneral Assembly in 1958. It is this wisdom that has\nguided the renewed emphasis that the United Nations,\nin the last decade and through its United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), has placed on the\npromotion of sustainable human development. This\nconcept is the axis and basis of our President's\ngovernmental plan. Our Government recognizes that\nwithout measures to promote human development,\neconomic growth can make no sense and have no\nmeaning.\nAlthough it may be boosted by economic growth,\nhuman development is much more than economic\ngrowth, for human development means enhancing the\ncapacities of human beings as individuals and as\nmembers of the community by measures that provide\naccess to emancipating education and to better health\nand transport services, measures to permit participation\nin an economy and a culture that respects human\ndignity, that encourage the prudent use of natural\nresources, and foster and enlarge the exercise of the\n8\n\nfundamental duties and rights of the human individual.\nGiven this multidimensional nature and the\nPanamanian Government's concern to work towards\nsustainable human development and to promote human\nrights, the Panamanian delegation expresses its\nsatisfaction at the contents of the latest UNDP human\ndevelopment report, which considers the link between\nhuman rights and human development. The report\nexplains that human freedom is the common purpose\nand the common motivation of human rights and\nhuman development.\n\nIn the years that have elapsed since our return to\nconstitutional government our country has made\nsignificant advances. Under our Government we have\nbegun a process of repealing legislation that restricts\nfreedom of expression and we have invited the Inter-\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights, a significant\nregional agency, to assist us in promoting the\nenjoyment of human rights in Panama. Also recently,\nthrough a process of cooperation involving the major\npolitical movements in the country, we have adopted\nby consensus the basic elements of a Panamanian\nsecurity policy based on the doctrine of human\nsecurity, an extremely important component of\nsustainable human development. That doctrine upholds\nindividual and grass-roots communities as constant,\nclear-cut points of reference for the responsibilities and\npurposes of the State's security strategy, and is based\non taking preventive measures designed to reduce\nvulnerabilities and minimize the risks threatening the\nopportunities and rights of individuals and of\ncommunities. I am particularly gratified to be able to\nstate that Panama is one of the few countries to have\nadopted the human security doctrine as a State policy.\nWe hope that this will be a matter for more in-depth\ndiscussion and analysis at the next Summit of the\nAmericas to be held in June 2001 in Quebec, Canada.\nIn the context of this and other aspects of\nsustainable human development and the exercise of\nhuman rights, Panama firmly believes in international\ncooperation and has recourse to it in order to promote\nthe lofty objectives that are the inspiration for States\nMembers of the United Nations. At the recent\nMillennium Summit, whose purpose was to set a clear\ncourse for the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury, Panama, among other things, called for States\nMembers to return to the pursuit of the original spirit\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Pursuant to this\nrequest, it is our hope that the members of the Security\nCouncil will assume the obligation of representing the\ngeneral interests of the international community instead\nof acting according to their individual strategic military\nor political interests. The general interest of the\nMembers of the Organization indicates that the time\nhas come to engage in debate and reach some\nconclusion as to the way in which we can expand the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of\nthe Security Council while restricting and regulating\nthe use of the veto. We have expressed our agreement\nwith the need to reform the Charter of the United\nNations in order to achieve this objective and others,\nprovided such reform is based on the principles of\ndemocracy and equitable geographic participation.\nPanama wishes here and now to reaffirm its\ncommitment to the principle of self-determination of\npeoples, articulated in the Charter of the United\nNations, and to the use of mechanisms for the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts. The dangerous disputes which\nriddle and split our world from the China Sea to the\nMagreb, and which may degenerate into domestic or\ntransboundary outbreaks of violence, must be\naddressed with a sense of urgency by the United\nNations. This would be possible within a structured,\nconflict-prevention programme that provided for\nspecialized support to nations to guide them and assist\nthem in a fair and orderly, peaceful negotiation of their\ninterests. Accordingly, we recommend recourse to the\nmoral and technical presence of the United Nations\nwithin such processes, engaged in by small States beset\nby hostile Powers, or by racial or religious\nintolerances. Likewise, we recommend recourse to the\nUnited Nations in support of negotiations on\nreunification or self-determination that other people\nmay wish to embark upon, with the aim of preserving a\nprosperous, democratic way of life or of securing for\nthemselves the benefits of development.\nThe Republic of Panama nowadays is a fully\nsovereign State glad to have recovered the exercise of\nsovereignty throughout its national territory, and to\nhave proved its resolve and ability to fulfil the\ncommitments stemming from its participation in this\ngreat international community. Panama has the will and\nthe capacity not only to administer efficiently and\ntransparently its greatest asset, the Panama Canal, but\nalso to cope successfully with the growing demands for\n9\n\ninternational maritime traffic and to ensure the security\nof our inter-oceanic waterway.\nThe Canal and the reverted lands will be the\ndriving force behind the development of the\nPanamanian economy in coming years. Among other\nlarge-scale projects, we are now executing the\nextension of the Culebra Cut, a $1 billion investment\nthat, once completed in the year 2001, will permit\nsimultaneous passage of Panamax vessels through this\nsection of the Canal. Once this work is completed,\nprojects will be begun to expand the Canal's water\nbasin. Moreover, consultations and studies are under\nway with a view to building the third set of locks,\nwhich will make it possible for the inter-oceanic\nwaterway to be used by post-Panamax vessels and will\nincrease the efficiency of the Canal by 25 per cent. All\nthis will benefit world trade. Lastly, in the coming year\nbidding will be opened for the construction of a second\nbridge over the Canal in order to help unite our land,\nwhich is currently divided by the Canal.\nIn the lands recovered and now devoted to\nnational development, former military installations of\nall kinds have been expertly retooled for commercial\ncivilian use. Among other things, the former Albrook\nair base has become a centre for domestic air and land\ntransport; the former School of the Americas has been\nconverted into a hotel of the Meli\u00e1 international chain,\nwith its own convention centre; the Coco Solo military\nbase, which enjoys a unique location at the Atlantic\nmouth of the Canal, today houses the international\nmaritime cargo ports of Manzanillo and Coco Solo,\nwhich complement the international port of Balboa on\nthe Pacific, all interconnected by a trans-isthmus rail\nsystem for container transport; and in the forts of\nDavis, Corozal and Cocol', processing centres are now\nbeing developed for exports, with the backing of\ninternational capital.\nWith input from the International Financial\nCorporation, studies are being undertaken to convert\nthe Howard air base into a multifunctional air and sea\ncargo centre for the Pacific side of the Canal. The\ndevelopment of the Sherman base, which is a genuine\necological gem, seeks to link the protection of the\ncountry's historical patrimony and environment with\neconomic development. Fort Clayton is now the base\nof an educational and industrial complex known as the\nCity of Knowledge, where the regional office of the\nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the\nhemisphere will be located. The City of Knowledge is\nalso home to regional campuses of Texas A & M and\nMcGill Universities and a continental-level regional\ncentre for human rights. All of this will contribute to\nthe Government's plan to make Panama a centre of\ninternational agencies.\nIn order to take full advantage of international\ncooperation, Panama has adopted a policy of\nstrengthening its links with the various major\ninternational organizations, including those that are\npart of the United Nations system. In this way we are\nstriving to move forward and contribute to worldwide\npeacemaking by converting former military bases into\ncivilian and commercial areas that will enhance world\npeace.\nThis is an appropriate occasion to place on record\nthat Panama categorically rejects the actions of the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD), which has unilaterally devised\ntaxation standards that its members are trying to\nimpose outside their jurisdiction, in open violation of\nresolutions of the General Assembly. On this point,\nPanama is grateful for the support of the majority\nleader of the United States House of Representatives,\nwho on 7 September wrote to the United States\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Lawrence Summers,\nstrongly condemning this action. There is a need for a\ncareful examination of the flight of billions of dollars\nin capital from developing countries to the financial\ninstitutions of the first world which are trying to\ntighten the so-called qualifications that are used to\nexert pressure, with obvious objectives.\nPanama is committed to the fight against the\nlaundering of money stemming from drug trafficking\nand other unlawful activities. We believe that all\ncountries should work together to eliminate this\nscourge. This effort should be carried out through\nlegitimate mechanisms of international institutions that\nare representative not only of the industrialized North\nbut also of the emerging countries of the South, such as\nthe United Nations and the various regional\norganizations.\nIn the spirit of international cooperation, to which\nI previously referred, and in consideration of the most\nbasic concepts of justice, we are today calling for the\ncooperation of the General Assembly in resolving a\ndispute between Panama and the United States of\nAmerica, as a result of the bases operated by the armed\nforces of that country on our territory throughout the\n10\n\nlast century. In this forum, in September last year, our\nPresident stressed her confidence that the outstanding\ndifferences surrounding this issue that still persisted\nbetween Panama and the United States would be\nresolved satisfactorily in a reasonable period of time.\nUnfortunately, despite the efforts and goodwill\ndisplayed by the Panamanian Government these\ndifferences have still not been settled.\nIn his powerful report entitled \u201cWe the peoples:\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury\u201d, and with respect to certain matters relating to\ntrade, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, proposes\nthat States Members follow a line of conduct consonant\nwith environmental and human rights standards. He\nalso urges States to fulfil their obligations vis-\u00e0-vis\nuniversal values and the common standards that have\nemerged from countless conferences and extensive\nnegotiations and that have taken the form of historic\nresolutions and conventions under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations. By extension, we believe that this\nappeal to States applies not only to trading matters but\nalso to all the other aspects of relationships among\nnations. His profound words express the vast ethical\nfoundation of the United Nations.\nIn another part of his report the Secretary-General\nwarns of the risk that environmental degradation,\namong other factors, may heighten social and political\ntensions in an unforeseeable and potentially dangerous\nfashion. We are particularly gratified by this clear\nvision on an issue whose various facets are already\nhaving a serious impact not only on many developing\nnations but also on the most developed.\nIn view of these very wise appeals and warnings,\nas well as of the predominant role that the United\nNations plays in the maintenance of international peace\nand defence of the principle of sovereignty, in a formal\nnote, to the Secretary-General I have requested him to\nbring to the attention of the United Nations the failure\nof the United States of America to fulfil its obligations\nso that the Organization can assist in bringing about an\nearly resolution of the dispute arising from the refusal\nof the United States to fulfil the commitments derived\nfrom the unauthorized military use by its army of\nsignificant portions of Panama's national territory. I\nhave informed the Secretary-General of the facts and\nformally requested that my note be circulated as a\ndocument of the General Assembly and that it be\nbrought to the attention of the Security Council.\nI take this opportunity to wish the General\nAssembly a fruitful year of deliberations under the\nguidance of its President. I should like to express my\nsincere hope that this year will be one of significant,\nmeaningful and tangible achievements for the\nOrganization in the treatment of the most important\nitems on its agenda, to the benefit of all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow\nme to begin by thanking the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his\nwork as President of the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, during which he continued and\nconcluded the preparation process of the recent\nMillennium Summit, initiated during the preceding\nsession.\nLikewise, I extend to the President of the\nAssembly at the fifty-fifth session, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\nformer Prime Minister of Finland, our congratulations\nand best wishes for the success of his tenure.\nWe also extend a fraternal welcome to Tuvalu as\na new Member of the United Nations.\n30\n\nA little over a week ago the United Nations held\nits Millennium Summit. To be more precise, we held\nour Millennium Summit. The work of the Secretary-\nGeneral and of the Member States deserves our praise,\nfor the result of their efforts was wholly positive. We\nshould all congratulate ourselves on that very\nsuccessful work, but the task assigned to us by the\nSummit is now in our hands. It should begin with an\nassessment and careful evaluation of agreements,\ndisagreements and priorities.\nAbove all, we should pay special attention to the\nstatements made by our heads of State and\nGovernment, as well as to the oral summary reports by\neach of the Presidents of the four round tables. Taken\nas a whole, this constitutes rich background material on\nwhich we could, and should, work. One could say that\nthe General Assembly, as a universal and independent\nbody, has been entrusted with a mandate by the highest\npolitical leaders of the Member States. Interpreting and\ncarrying out that mandate is now the main objective of\nour work in the General Assembly.\nOf course, the Secretary-General's report\n(A/54/2000), known by the opening words of its title,\n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d, is an essential contribution, widely\nappreciated at this time of putting the Organization in\nperspective. For that reason, the Secretary-General\ndeserves our sincere acknowledgement.\nWe can therefore say that never before have we\nhad more authoritative or exact guidelines. As the\nSecretary-General said in his opening statement, the\nresponsibility for putting those directives into practice\nis in our hands; in other words, in the non-exclusive\nframework of the General Assembly.\nFrom the very start of our renewed task we must\ntry to identify some central ideas that reflect a general\nconsensus on our point of departure, while\nacknowledging that neither the Summit nor any similar\nUnited Nations meetings will be able to make any\narbitrary changes to the items on the world's agenda or\nalone bring about the alterations that practically all of\nus view as necessary and inevitable.\nIt is therefore a matter of using the Millennium\nSummit as a launching platform for the achievement of\nthe common objectives of the international community,\nwhose main quality should be to reflect the basic rights\nand interests of all its members. We should, then, be as\ncareful in identifying those goals as we are in selecting\nthe procedures and determining the time required to\nachieve them. In any case, there are some realities that\nwe cannot, and should not, evade.\nThe first is the acknowledgement that the so-\ncalled globalization or universalization phenomenon\nconstitutes the inescapable environment to which the\nhuman family should adapt, not from a stance of\nconfrontation or resigned acceptance, but in order to be\nan active part of it. By living within the framework of\nglobalization we will be in a position to direct and\nchannel it, accepting its intrinsic values in its scientific\nand technological dimension, while conferring upon it\nthe necessary inspiration and political will to control its\nnegative effects on societies that lack the necessary\nresources to be part of globalization and to benefit\nfrom it.\nIt has been said here at the Assembly that we\nshould attempt to make it possible for all States to\nclimb aboard the globalization train. That goal should\nmotivate our individual actions and our cooperation\nefforts in the immediate future.\nAs was repeatedly emphasized during the\nSummit, United Nations action of the kind I have\ndescribed would have an encouraging and positive\neffect, especially since no other international institution\nhas undertaken that task. Given the universal and all-\ninclusive nature of globalization, it is appropriate to\nconsider what action the United Nations could take\nfrom the perspective of evolution and change of the\ninternational system in its three principal areas: first,\nthe institutional political system \u2014 the Organization\nitself and its powers; secondly, the global financial\nsystem established by the Bretton Woods Agreements;\nand, finally, the organization of international trade\nwithin the framework of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO).\nWith regard to the first, it must be admitted that\nin the process of reform of the Security Council, to\nwhich we have devoted so much effort, no significant\nprogress has been registered recently. It would appear\nthat the international community has not yet\nsufficiently assimilated its will to change at the\ninstitutional level. That admission does not take away\nfrom the fact that the reform of the Council is a\npending matter and one which, as the round table\nreports indicated, received particular attention from the\nheads of State and Government at the Millennium\nSummit.\n31\n\nIt seems to us that on this matter we have reached\na paradoxical situation. On the one hand, there is\npractically a consensus on the need to reform the\nCouncil so that it can \u2014 on the basis of certain\nprinciples held very dear by the international\ncommunity \u2014 more adequately reflect current reality,\nbeing made more democratic in its spirit, more\nrepresentative in its structure and more transparent in\nits functioning. On the other hand, however, some\nbelieve that the formula proposed to achieve the goal\nof expanding the Council \u2014 an increase in both\npermanent and non-permanent members \u2014 disregards\nthe very principles that we seek to implement. We have\nthus responded to the need felt by all for reform of the\nCouncil, in order to make it more representative and\ndemocratic, with formulas that do not yet appear to\nreflect the requisite universal spirit of reform.\nThat is why we believe that, while we continue\nour efforts to reorganize the Security Council, we must\nalso explore alternative solutions avoiding the\napproaches \u2014 perhaps too simplistic \u2014 adopted so far,\nwhich have not made progress possible, even after\neight years of intensive negotiations. New approaches\nand ideas are needed in the reform of the Council more\nthan in any other problem.\nPeacekeeping and international security continues\nto be a core issue giving the United Nations its specific\ncharacter and, to a certain degree, its reason for being.\nThe Organization's peacekeeping and international\nsecurity mechanisms, the limits within which they can\noperate and their modalities have been on our agenda\nsince the founding of the United Nations. They\ncontinue to require our attention, because problems of\npeace and international security manifest themselves in\nvarying and sometimes unexpected ways as the world\npolitical situation evolves.\nThe United Nations is now confronted with the\nworrisome problem of how to achieve its peacekeeping\ngoals with limited resources and inadequate\nmechanisms. The report on peace operations prepared\nby a group of experts, known as the Brahimi report and\ndrafted at the request of the Secretary-General, will\nundoubtedly help us find a way to overcome the\ndifficulties now facing the Organization in this area.\nUruguay, since 1952 a traditional contributor to\npeacekeeping operations, is carefully considering the\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report,\nmany of which we deem worthy of our support.\nIn any event, we warmly welcome the initiatives\naimed at a more in-depth consideration of what has\nbeen termed \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d. We hope that\na detailed and objective examination of this concept by\nthe Organization will enable us to grasp its true scope\nand implications and to find ways of integrating it\nharmoniously into the international legal order, without\nany kind of distortion.\nThe financing of peacekeeping operations\nrequires the prudent management of existing resources\nand, as with the regular budget, that all Member States\nfulfil their financial obligations to the Organization,\nwithout conditions. Likewise, the institutionalization of\nthe current scale of assessments is vital, perhaps with a\nfew small changes that would not create problems for\ndeveloping or least developed countries and that would\nensure that States shoulder their responsibility\naccording to their real capacity to pay.\nThis is also our position on the regular budget.\nWe cannot accept that, in determining the scale of\nassessments, simplistic formulas should be used that\nare based only on isolated economic indicators such as\nper capita income, which do not reflect the real\neconomic situation of the country and of its population.\nWe cannot overemphasize the link between the\nquestion of disarmament and that of development\nfinancing. The fact that the majority of violent conflicts\noccur in the developing sector of the world, in which\nthere are often too many weapons and too few schools,\nremains a shameful paradox. We must continue to work\ntowards disarmament. That is why my country,\nUruguay, supports the convening of the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, set to take place next\nyear.\nUruguay also supports the efforts of the \u201cNew\nAgenda\u201d countries towards the elimination of nuclear\nweapons and encourages the ratification of the\nComprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty.\nAs concerns the international financial system \u2014\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank \u2014 and its handling of the recent, recurrent crisis\nsituations in the world, shortcomings were noted in its\nmethods of operation. In particular, its failure to\nanticipate those crises has made clear the need to\nupdate and reform the system directly responsible for\nensuring global economic governance. In this effort to\nreorganize the financial institutions and to coordinate\n32\n\ntheir activities with those of the United Nations and its\nagencies, we should also consider the common\naspiration of the majority of the members of the\ninternational community to democratize the decision-\nmaking processes in those organizations. The close\nconnection between the decisions by the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund, and the social\nand economic realities of countries, more than justifies\nthis aspiration.\nInequality, poverty and debt in the developing\nworld are problems that have been, and continue to be,\nemphasized in the debates of the Millennium\nAssembly. These problems require not only ongoing\nprogrammes and actions but, above all, a basic sense of\nsolidarity, which does not always characterize our\ncooperation efforts.\nIn the same vein, two noteworthy ideas were put\nforward during the Summit that we believe should be\nconsidered, because they could offer some guidance in\nefficiently addressing economic issues. The first is the\nidea of creating a development council that is neither\ndependent nor subordinate and that has the authority to\ntake the decisions necessary to adjust and direct\ncomplex international financial flows, since the trends\nand developments in that respect affect the economies\nof all States.\nThe second is related to international trade. In\nthis regard, the international community is firmly\nconvinced that international trade must be made\nincreasingly open and free. The President of Uruguay,\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, in his address to the Summit\nand in the relevant round table, emphasized the\nindivisible nature of freedom, as a whole that cannot be\nseparated from free trade.\nAs trade is a natural and traditional method of\ncommunication among peoples, Member States must\nnot impose protectionist barriers to its free flow, which\nwould delay development and therefore affect the well-\nbeing of peoples. This could also lead to serious social\nproblems, which in many cases could spiral out of\ncontrol. In this way, obstacles to trade, discriminatory\ntrade policies and protectionism could become factors\nof political instability at the domestic and international\nlevels. This is the position of Uruguay within the\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR), in the\nrelationship between MERCOSUR and the Andean\nCommunity, in the Free Trade Area of the Americas\nand in the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThe strong argument to that effect put forward at\nthe Summit must not be disregarded by those Member\nStates that singly or together selectively raise\nprotectionist barriers in order selfishly to defend their\nown production and participation in the market,\ndenying others what President Batlle has called\n\u201cour right to create and produce and our right to\noffer and sell what is produced\u201d.\nIn this regard, I cannot but welcome the initiative\nof the Government of Italy, announced by its Prime\nMinister during the Summit, to insist, within\ninternational organisms \u2014 including within the Group\nof 8 \u2014 on the need for the developed countries to open\ntheir markets to the least developed countries by\nabolishing quotas and tariffs.\nNor can the WTO cannot turn a deaf ear to this\ncall. Although it does not play a major role in global\nfinancial governance, its regulations affect trade in its\nbroadest sense, and it still counts among its\nresponsibilities, set out at the Uruguay Round and in\nthe Marrakesh agreements, the regulation of trade in\nagricultural products, which affects many of our\ncountries, particularly those of Latin America and\nAfrica.\nToday no one could doubt the role of the United\nNations in the gradual process of achieving equality in\nthe world. But the United Nations does not bear sole\nresponsibility in this respect; the Member States and\nGovernments do as well.\nA solid and hopeful future for the international\ncommunity will depend on our good judgement and\nintegrity. Also at stake is the trust of our peoples and of\npublic opinion. Fortunately, for those of us who\npractise the democratic creed, that trust is always time-\nbound and subject to public opinion.\nOur ability to work within the Organization will\ndetermine whether the Millennium Summit that just\ntook place will breathe new life into the United\nNations. The world needs to see itself reflected in the\ninstitutions it established, with hope and participation,\nwith responsibility and a will to build a fairer, more\npredictable, more peaceful and more humane society.\nI therefore believe \u2014 and this is merely a\nsuggestion \u2014 that it is essential for all of us to ensure\nthat the Assembly is accorded the important role\nassigned to it in the Charter, even though reality\nsometimes does not allow for this. We must ensure that\n33\n\nthe Assembly and the Secretariat establish as soon as\npossible a working group or a similar mechanism that\nwould follow up on the Millennium Summit and would\nexamine the wealth of ideas put forward by our heads\nof State to ensure that they can be implemented and put\ninto practice. Only in that way will the Millennium\nSummit be remembered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your\nskill and extensive experience in international affairs\nconvince us that this session will be crowned with\nsuccess.\nI am honoured to take this opportunity to extend\nour profound appreciation to your predecessor, Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, for his outstanding management of our affairs\nduring the previous session, for his leadership role in\nthe General Assembly and for his spirit of effective\ncooperation.\nWe also thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\nhis tireless efforts in the service of our Organization.\nHis wise approach to the important issues and the\nreforms he is implementing in the United Nations\ndeserve our support and cooperation at all levels.\nOn behalf of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros, I also congratulate Tuvalu on its admission\nto membership of the United Nations.\n(spoke in French)\nConsidering the enormous responsibilities of the\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping, the defence of human\nrights and the promotion of social well-being, it is easy\nto see why, 55 years after its creation, the Organization\nstill has a great deal to do. Given its varied activities, it\nneeds more solid and up-to-date structures that are\nadapted to contemporary conditions; sufficient and\nreliable funding; sound, transparent and energetic\nmanagement; and the ability to carry out its tasks in\nconformity with current priorities and specific regional\nconcerns. The Millennium Summit further reaffirmed\nour Organization's essential role in this respect.\nThat is why the United Nations new\norganizational plan must allow it to respond to the\nneeds of today's world in the face of major upheavals\nthat inspire intense introspection and consideration. Its\nreform is also necessary to guarantee sound and\nreliable structures, with equitably distributed duties,\nthat will confirm its universal nature and ensure better\nresults. Thus, it is particularly necessary to open the\nSecurity Council, the organ primarily responsible for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, to\nother countries, as permanent and non-permanent\nmembers, in order to make it more representative and\nto ensure that its membership and working methods\nreflect present-day realities.\nAt a time when the world is evolving and\nundergoing globalization, the island States and small,\npoor countries with limited resources are preoccupied\nby the threat of marginalization looming over them. In\naddition to the various crises besetting our countries,\nthis state of affairs calls on us to address the urgent\nneed for support, assistance and, especially, awareness\nof the dangers we are facing.\nFirst are the dangers arising from the immediate\nand long-term repercussions of the conflicts engulfing\nthe planet, claiming millions of victims, most of them\nchildren, women and the elderly.\nSecondly, there are the dangers posed to the\nworld by the ever-growing number of acts of terrorism.\nIn this respect, it is important not only to be aware of\nthe potential danger and to find effective means of\ncountering it, but also to draw clear distinctions\nbetween and not to confuse the behaviour of people\nwho act in contempt of law and human dignity with\nthat of those who act primarily out of religious\nconsiderations.\nThirdly, there are the dangers resulting from\nflagrant violations of human rights. To combat this\nproblem, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros\n9\n\ngives its full support to the implementation of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which should put an end\nto these abuses. The Republic is preparing to ratify the\nStatute soon, and it hopes that the implementation of\nthe Court's jurisdiction will be effective.\nFourthly, there are the dangers resulting from\nnatural catastrophes and from the overall degradation\nof the environment \u2014 the increasing vulnerability of\nwhich is a source of serious concern for the world. The\nsmall land-locked States \u2014 developing countries of\nlimited size \u2014 are particularly exposed to these\ndangers. Given the increasing severity of this problem,\nthere is an increasingly urgent need to give priority to\nprotecting ecological systems.\nFifthly, there are the dangers posed by serious\ndiseases from which our populations are suffering \u2014\ndiseases such as AIDS, malaria and many others,\nextreme poverty included.\nSixthly, there are the dangers posed by the\nmarginalization of the poor countries in the midst of a\nworld undergoing rapid change, a world in which it is\nhard for these countries to find their way.\nSeventhly and finally, there are the dangers to\nwhich these same countries are exposed as a result of\nthe external debt burden which absorbs a great deal of\ntheir attention and wreaks havoc on their national\nbudgets.\nThis is to say that in this first stage of our entry\ninto the third millennium, there are many outstanding\nquestions regarding the future of humanity, and these\nquestions require careful consideration. The overall\nimage presented by the world today is a sombre one.\nAlso, as regards economic issues, it goes without\nsaying that the world is facing a situation that calls for\nserious examination and for joint action by the\ndevelopment partners to support national, subregional\nand regional efforts.\nIn the case of Africa, its overall economic\nproblems are a source of concern because they have\nbecome aggravated as a result of the increasingly\nglobalizing world and the great strain that external debt\nis placing on our economies. Further, it makes sense to\nbe concerned about the future of a continent that has\nbeen marginalized, in particular as regards global trade\nand the information revolution, and afflicted by all\nkinds of plagues. It is essential that \u2014 in addition to\nthe efforts of the individual countries and in the\nframework of regional integration \u2014 the continent\nbenefit from the good offices of the international\nfinancial institutions in examining and addressing\ndifferent problem areas. In this regard, I am pleased to\nhere reiterate our appreciation for the efforts of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme to fight,\nalongside our Governments, all forms of\nunderdevelopment.\nAs a small landlocked developing country and as\nan African country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros is grappling with these kinds of problems. It\ncannot be denied that, despite our current situation, our\nGovernment is manifesting a firm will in searching for\nways and means of lifting the country out of the hole in\nwhich it finds itself and of creating favourable\nconditions for improving the life of our society. The\neffort under way to clean up the public finances and to\nrevive and restructure the national economy attest to\nthe Comorian Government's determination to improve\nthe socio-economic situation that has prevailed for\nmany years in the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros.\nOur bilateral and multilateral partners have\nconsistently supported these efforts; however, I need to\nreiterate the necessity of enhancing this assistance in\norder to help us meet the challenge of\nunderdevelopment and, above all, to help us avoid\nfalling victim to the perverse effects of globalization.\nWe should also focus on the political situation of\nthe world, which is today divided by various sorts of\nwars and crises, which are seriously upsetting the\npeace and security of peoples. Greater attention should\nbe given to these two crucial objectives \u2014 objectives\nthat form the very basis of our Organization \u2014 and\ngreater thought should be given to how to vouchsafe\nthem.\nThis is why, on the subject of wars, I would like\nto appeal to the goodwill of the parties involved in the\nproblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nin the entire Great Lakes region and to ask them to\nfocus their efforts on d\u00e9marches that can produce\nnegotiated solutions to the disputes of these parties.\nAs regards Somalia, my country is greatly\npleased by the current happy outcome of the situation\nthere and by the establishment of a transition\nGovernment. The Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros hopes that the solid foundations have now\n10\n\nbeen established so that a lasting peace can be secured\nfor this fraternal country.\nIn the same vein, the Comorian Government\nappreciates the efforts made in the holding of the Camp\nDavid negotiations and salutes the work of the\nGovernment of the United States of America in this\nregard. The Comorian Government, which has\nsupported and continues to support the Palestinian\ncause, hopes that these efforts will lead to a speedy\nresolution of the Middle East crisis \u2014 a resolution that\nwill be in the interest of the peoples of that region who\nhave so long suffered from incessant instability. The\nComorian Government also believes that any solution\nto this crisis must include the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif\nas its capital.\nFurther, we proclaim the necessity of completely\nlifting the embargo against Libya, and also ask that the\nembargo against Iraq be lifted. We appeal to the Iraqi\nGovernment to cooperate more fully with the efforts to\nfree the Kuwaiti prisoners.\nConflict zones remain in all the continents. The\nCharter of the United Nations having been written for\nthe peoples, the United Nations must enhance its\nefforts to prevent and resolve conflicts by peaceful\nmeans. In essence this means insisting on the urgent\nnecessity of supporting the cause of world peace,\nbecause its absence handicaps all efforts to achieve real\nsustainable human development.\nIn this regard, allow me to review the current\nsituation in my country, the Islamic Federal Republic\nof the Comoros, and to explain how disturbed the\npeople are about the threat to peace posed by the\nseparatist crisis that has been taking place on the\nsisterly island of Anjouan for close to three years. With\nthe support of the international community \u2014 in\nparticular, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nthe League of Arab States, the European Union, and\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference \u2014 the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros has explored every\nmeans of putting an end to this crisis. The\nintransigence of the Anjouanese party after the\ndeclarations that were made during the inter-island\nconferences that were held at Addis Ababa and at\nAntananarivo have led the OAU to take repressive\nmeasures against this party \u2014 measures that were to be\napplied in a step-by-step fashion.\nThe object of imposing the economic embargo\nagainst the sisterly island of Anjouan was to lead the\nAnjouanese to be reasonable. However, the situation\nhas hardly changed, and during this time the lowest\nlevels of Anjouanese society \u2014 along with all those\nwho were supporting national unity \u2014 suffered terribly\nfrom the effects of these measures. Recognizing on the\none hand that, given the hardening of the movement's\nposition, this situation was victimizing the population\nof Anjouan, and particularly the poorest levels, and\nconvinced on the other hand that we Comorians\ntogether might be able to come up with a non-military\nsolution, the current leadership of the country, under\nthe enlightened direction of Colonel Azali Assoumani,\nPresident of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros, has insisted on undertaking direct\ndiscussions with the Anjouanese party, in the hopes of\narriving at national reconciliation.\nThe attempts at initiating such a dialogue opened\nthe way to the signing of an initial text on 1 July 1999\nat Fomboni on the island of Mwali. This text is\nconsidered to represent a significant step on the part of\nthe current regime \u2014 a step towards harmonizing the\nopposing points of view.\nThe negotiations were continued recently, leading\nto the signing of a joint declaration, again in Fomboni\non 26 August. This provides another appropriate\nframework for preserving the unity and territorial\nintegrity of the Comoros, to which the Secretary of\nState for Foreign Affairs of The Gambia referred on 20\nSeptember. Because it allows dialogue to be initiated\nwith our Anjouan brothers on the future Comorian\nentity, the declaration is of particular significance to\nComorians.\nThe Fomboni declaration makes it clear that the\nnew Commorian entity is the sole subject of\ninternational law within the Comorian frontiers\nrecognized by the international community. In order to\npush ahead with this process, a timetable was\nestablished spelling out the various stages leading to\nthe submission to a referendum of the act which is to\ngovern the future Comorian entity.\nI should like to make it clear that the Fomboni\njoint declaration takes account of, and respects, the\nspirit of the Antananarivo Agreement, which was\nrejected by the Anjouan party.\nToday, more than ever, there is hope that it will\nbe possible to resolve this unfortunate problem by\n\n\npeaceful means and to lay the groundwork for a\ndemocratic State \u2014 a Comorian-style democracy, a\ndemocracy stemming from the living forces of the\nnation of the Comoros, without any outside\ninterference or influence. Would it have been just to\nreject this breakthrough, thus penalizing innocent\nwomen and children who have been so sorely tried by\nthe embargo, and then to envisage a military solution?\nIf there had been resort to war in order to have peace,\nwhy not avoid it, if possible, and so prevent casualties?\nThe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has\ncommitted itself to dialogue to settle conflicts,\nrespecting the principles of our Organization.\nThis wise principle was the basis of the Comorian\nauthorities' approach to their brothers in Anjouan. I\ntherefore appeal for understanding by all our partners\nwho have always supported our efforts to find a\nnegotiated lasting solution to this crisis. This is why,\nwhile respecting the position of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and that of all our other partners,\nI reiterate, on behalf of the Government of the\nComoros, our determination to continue this struggle,\ntogether with them, in order to preserve the unity and\nterritorial integrity of our country.\nThe Government of the Comoros pays tribute to\nthe Secretary-General of the OAU, Mr. Salim Ahmed\nSalim, for his personal efforts and his efforts through\nthe OAU to resolve this crisis. We also express our\nwholehearted gratitude to the League of Arab States, as\nwell as the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, the\ncountries of the region and other friendly countries,\nincluding France, for their support.\nWe earnestly hope that reason has finally\nprevailed with our brothers in Anjouan and that they\nhave really understood that breaking up the covenant of\nunity and fraternity which links us and will always link\nus \u2014 Comorians of the four islands of our archipelago\nState \u2014 will not benefit anyone.\nWe hope that we have all learned the lessons from\nevents which have so seriously affected the country in\nhuman, material, psychological and other terms, and\nthat we understand that war will always be a bad\nmaster and the worst choice. The process of\nreconciliation is a demanding task requiring a great\ndeal of resources. In this connection, we make a\npressing appeal to the international community to\nsupport the programme of reconstruction and national\nreconciliation which the Comorian Government has\ndrawn up in conjunction with the World Bank.\nFaithful to the fundamental principles of the\nCharter, the Government of the Comoros continues to\nopt for the policy of dialogue and discussion to resolve\nall of the problems which confront us. With profound\nrespect for these principles, we appeal to France, with\nwhich the Comoros has for long had close ties of\nfriendship and cooperation, to contemplate a direct and\nconstructive dialogue which will make it possible\nquickly to reach a negotiated solution with regard to\nreintegrating the Comorian island of Mayotte into its\nnatural community.\nAs stability, understanding, unity, harmony\namong our peoples, partnership and progress go hand\nin hand, creating conditions to guarantee these values\nwould be the best gift which the international\ncommunity can offer present and future generations on\nthe eve of the next millennium.\n(spoke in Arabic)\n\u201cIf people one day want life\nFate has no choice but to respond;\nNight has no choice but to yield to dawn\nAnd shackles cannot but be shattered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed an honour and a\nprivilege for me to address this body on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Palau.\nPresident Kuniwo Nakamura sends his warm greetings\nand wishes everyone a successful deliberation during\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. He\nalso wishes to congratulate and welcome the newest\nMember of the United Nations, our good Pacific\nneighbour and friend, Tuvalu.\nDuring the recently concluded Millennium\nSummit, we addressed many global issues that pose\nproblems and threats to mankind at the national,\nregional and international levels. These problems must\nbe seriously looked into by this body and other\ninternational and regional organizations so that their\nsolutions may be found or remedies provided to\nalleviate the suffering they impose on our world and its\npeoples. These problems \u2013 ranging from hunger,\npoverty, tuberculosis, malaria and the spread of\nHIV/AIDS to global warming and environmental\ndegradation and vulnerability \u2013 are not just the\nresponsibilities of the countries or regions that are most\naffected; every member of the global community must\nplay its part in order for this planet and its inhabitants\nto survive these destructive forces.\nToday, we live in an era in which the production\nof food is at an all-time high. Advanced technology in\nthe area of food production, improved farming and\nagricultural methods are readily available and can be\nsuccessfully applied to widespread areas that are\ntraditionally not suitable to agriculture and farming.\nIn a similar context, medical research and\ninformation can and should be shared universally. An\nintegrated approach to intervention in the field of\nHIV/AIDS is critically called for in many developing\ncountries. Collaborative health-research projects\nfocusing on the biology of this disease and the\ndevelopment of tools for its prevention and control \u2014\nincluding  diagnostics, drugs and vaccines \u2014 must also\nbe made available and affordable to the many third\nworld countries seriously plagued by this disease. As a\nglobal community charged with the responsibility for\nthe security of mankind, we must confront the real\ndanger of HIV/AIDS and work collectively towards the\neradication of that horrible disease.\nUncontrolled and unregulated human activities\nhave affected and will continue to affect our\necosystem, thereby endangering and threatening our\nvery existence. Global warming is a difficult and\nscientifically complicated phenomenon. Even today,\nscientists are still divided on this issue, particularly on\nits causes and effects. While some agree that the\nemission of greenhouse gases and human and industrial\nactivities are responsible for climate change and global\nwarming, others maintain that the changes occur\nnaturally and that, because the earth is so resilient to\nsuch changes, none of these occurrences will have\npermanent effects.\nHowever, as a small island country in the Pacific,\nPalau has seen and experienced the actual impact of sea\nlevel rise, unpredicted weather patterns and an extreme\nrise in sea water temperature, all of which are signs and\nindications of global warming and climate change.\nMany island countries all over the world have also\nexperienced these catastrophic changes. Let us, as\nworld leaders, work individually and collectively\ntowards the real resolution of global warming. The\nblueprint and foundation of this important task are set\n23\n\nforth in the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Let us fulfil\nour roles.\nDuring the Millennium Summit, we also\npresented institutional issues that should be seriously\nconsidered by the entire membership of this\nOrganization. Two further issues were raised by Palau\nduring the Summit: open membership and\nrepresentational participation in all bodies of the\nUnited Nations. The lack of action on these issues on\nour part, as a body, is quite contrary and detrimental to\nthe objectives of the United Nations.\nWith regard to open membership, Palau believes\nthat any State that meets the traditional and standard\ndefinition of independent State should be allowed\nmembership in the United Nations. To that end, it is the\nposition of the Republic of Palau that the contributions\nof Taiwan to the global community, particularly the\ndeveloping countries, more than qualify the Republic\nof China on Taiwan to fully participate in the United\nNations as a full-fledged Member. We strongly support\nfull membership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in\nthe United Nations and appeal to all States members of\nthis body for their support.\nCountless achievements concerning the welfare\nand security of this planet and its inhabitants have been\naccomplished by this body since its inception 55 years\nago. Many important organs and bodies within the\nUnited Nations have been created, and some have even\nbeen reorganized since then to further promote and\nenhance the institution's objectives and goals.\nHowever, one very important organ within the\nUnited Nations system, the Security Council, has\nremained virtually unchanged since its inception. Palau\ntruly believes that this important organ should be\nreorganized and restructured to increase both\npermanent and non-permanent members in order to\nstrengthen the Council's work and effectiveness. We,\ntherefore, maintain our support of the Millennium\nDeclaration, expressing the determination to intensify\nour efforts to achieve a more comprehensive reform of\nthe Security Council.\nReform can only materialize if we all agree to a\ncommon formula by which the number of permanent\nand non-permanent members should be increased. The\nRepublic of Palau further maintains that any increase in\nthe permanent membership of the Security Council\nshould reflect a Member State's contribution to\ninternational peace and security and its capability to\neffectively carry out the objectives of the Council. A\nfew countries have surely reached that plateau to serve\nas permanent members of the Security Council.\nFinally, the Republic of Palau reaffirms its\ncommitment to global partnerships in this world of\ninterdependent economies as an essential step towards\nthe achievement of sustainable development. At the\nfifty-fourth United Nations General Assembly, the Vice\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, His Excellency\nThomas Remengesau, Jr., addressed the Assembly and\nspoke of a tri-partite scientific project involving the\nUnited States of America, Japan and Palau that was\nstill in its developmental phase. I am deeply honoured\ntoday to inform this Assembly that last month the\nGovernment of Japan completed the constructional\nphase of the project and officially handed over the\nfacility to the Government of the Republic of Palau.\nThe next phase is to furnish the facility with the right\nequipment and tools necessary for scientific research.\nWhen fully completed, the Centre will provide\nscientists and researchers with a state-of-the-art facility\nfor research in the area of coral reefs and marine\norganisms. Medical research can and will also be\nconducted in this facility. In addition, the Centre will\nserve as a tourist attraction, as different exhibits on\nmarine life and a large aquarium will be on display.\nAt this juncture, I would like to convey our\ngratitude and thanks to the Governments of Japan and\nthe United States of America for their support in this\nnoble endeavour and welcome any input and\ncontributions from the scientists and researchers of the\nrest of the Member States to utilize the facility, since\nwe all work towards the common goal of safeguarding\nand utilizing our environment for the betterment of\nhumanity.\nThe Palau International Coral Reef Centre project\nis a clear example of cooperation between developed\nand developing nations in promoting sustainable\ndevelopment. Financial resources and mechanisms,\nenvironmental utility and transfer of sound technology,\ncooperation and capacity-building have been made\navailable to support this important initiative.\nThe Republic of Palau continues to be challenged\nand challenges every Member State to build on the\nachievements of the last eight years that have passed\nsince the Rio Summit, to look critically at the problems\n24\n\nthat are still facing us and to make firm commitments\non further progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Our deliberations come in the\nwake of the historic Declaration just adopted at the\nMillennium Summit. Today, we look into the future\nwith greater confidence. Our commitment to the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter is undiminished.\nOur enthusiasm to turn our Organization's goals into\nsolid realities remains high. In our quest for a better\nworld, we are to derive our inspiration from our\ndemocratic values; our energy from the dynamism of\nour societies; and our strength from global solidarity\nand shared responsibility.\nToday, there is no greater challenge for us than\nthe prevention of conflicts and the achievement of\npeace. The horrors we witnessed in Europe, the Far\nEast and Africa in the course of the past decade compel\nus with a sense of urgency to devise effective conflict\nprevention mechanisms and strategies. In his\nMillennium Report, the Secretary-General articulates\nthe means for conflict prevention. These\nrecommendations, when adopted and implemented,\nwill provide the required capacity and credibility.\nAs an increasingly active member of the\ninternational community, providing civilian and\nmilitary contingents to peace efforts in different spots,\nas far apart as South-Eastern Europe and East Timor,\nTurkey will give substance to United Nations efforts to\nprevent conflicts. As peace operations become a core\nfunction of the United Nations, we feel the urge to have\na sounder financial basis. Turkey therefore supported\nthe review of assessments for the apportionment of\nexpenses for peacekeeping operations. We hope that\nthese discussions will lead to a fairer redrawing of the\nscale.\nThe rapidly globalizing world provides an\nappropriate environment for Turkey, at the heart of\nEurasia, to serve as a bridge between many nations and\ncivilizations.\nA priority task is securing peace and stability in\nthe Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern\nEurope, in which Turkey plays an active part, provides\na good framework for cooperation and development in\nthe region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the\nfull implementation of the Dayton/Paris accords is still\nour objective. We should preserve Bosnia and\nHerzegovina as a multi-ethnic, multicultural,\nindependent and sovereign State. Turkey will continue\nto contribute bilaterally and through multilateral\nendeavours to Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-building\nand reconstruction efforts.\nIn Kosovo, the United Nations has been able to\nput in place arrangements enabling the population to\nsustain their daily lives, but the current state of ethnic\nviolence does not inspire hopes for a promising future.\nThe United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo\nhas set new rules for the administration of Kosovo. We\nlook forward in particular to the full recognition of the\nvested rights of the Turkish community of Kosovo. We\nhope the shortcomings in this respect will soon be\ncorrected, allowing the multi-ethnic and multicultural\nstructure of Kosovo to be duly reflected in its public\ninstitutions and organs.\nTo turn to a positive development, I should\nunderline that the constructive trend in our relations\nwith Greece I mentioned in my address last year to the\nGeneral Assembly continues. During the year, we have\nsigned nine agreements for cooperation in a variety of\nareas, ranging from economy to culture. In this context,\n\n\nthe rapprochement between Turkey and Greece that we\ninitiated has already brought about positive results.\nThe mutual rediscovery by the peoples of Turkey\nand Greece of one another and their reconciliation\nprovided the main dynamics of the rapprochement.\nAlmost on a daily basis, politicians, mayors,\nbusinessmen, trade-unionists, artists, writers,\nsportsmen and student groups visit each other across\nthe Aegean or Thrace. Trade between the two countries\nis flourishing. An unprecedented flurry of activity is\nbeing observed along the Aegean coasts and in Thrace.\nBilateral tourism is on the rise; joint investments are\nbeing carried out. A memorandum of understanding for\na joint Turkey-Greece-European Union pipeline project\nto transport Central Asian and Caucasian energy to\nWestern Europe has been signed.\nAll these positive developments have revealed\nonce again that the Turkish and the Greek people are in\nfavour not of confrontation, but of cooperation and\nfriendship. The peoples of our two countries have not\nonly superseded their politicians, but have raised a\nmost significant barrier to any inclination to move\nbackwards. The rapprochement between our two\npeoples constitutes the best guarantee against the\ninclinations of some politicians who, once in a while,\nyearn for the confrontational past.\nTurkey's attention is also focused on\ndevelopments in the southern Caucasus and Central\nAsia. Our historical, cultural and linguistic affinities\nwith the countries of those regions serve as a major\nasset in our joint efforts to see the peoples of the region\nmove towards higher levels of security and prosperity.\nRecent terrorist activities, however, pose a new threat\nto the peace and security of the Central Asian States\nand are of major concern. We are now seeking ways as\nto how we can best assist those countries in their\nstruggle against terrorism.\nRecent events demonstrate once again that we\nhave to fight international terrorism collectively. We\ncommend the efforts of the United Nations to\nstrengthen the legal framework in the fight against\nterrorism and urge the General Assembly to keep the\nmatter high on its agendas.\nThe developments in Afghanistan are cause for\ngrave concern, as they have a direct impact on the\nstability of a huge region, including Central Asia. In\nthe southern Caucasus, peace has yet to be achieved\nbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia. The international\ncommunity has the obligation to contribute to ending\nthe Armenian occupation of parts of Azerbaijan.\nStability in Georgia, on the other hand, remains a goal.\nWe have put forward the idea of a stability pact for the\nCaucasus and are following up our initiative. The\nregional countries must develop a growing awareness\nof the wide-ranging benefits of regional cooperation.\nHere, I should also underline that attempts to\ndefame other nations or to extract enmity from history\nwill serve no useful purpose. No nation in the world\nhas the right to use or distort history in order to achieve\nsome kind of identity. Historical research should be left\nto scholars. In this day and age, we expect all nations\nto concentrate their efforts on cooperating with each\nother for the good of their peoples.\nThe Middle East peace process has reached a\ncrucial phase. Turkey has always underlined the\nimportance of a comprehensive, just and lasting\nsettlement on the basis of international legitimacy and\nwithin the framework of Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and of the principle of land\nfor peace.\nThe Palestinian issue lies at the core of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. On the other hand, it has again been\nproven during the course of negotiations that Al-Quds\nis the decisive element for peace between Palestinians\nand Israelis. Progress was made at the Camp David\nsummit, as it was the first occasion at which there was\nfrank discussion of all issues, including the most\nsensitive. We are heartened to witness the willingness\nof both sides to continue negotiations and to explore all\npossibilities. We encourage the parties to remain\nengaged in order not to waste this historic opportunity.\nTurkey is endowed with centuries of experience\nregarding the area, the wider region and its problems.\nWe also have deep historical, moral and cultural ties\nwith the peoples of the region. Turkey has good\nrelations with the Israeli and the Palestinian parties\nalike and enjoys their trust. This prompted the parties\nto solicit our contributions in recent weeks to\nfacilitating a better understanding and greater\nconfidence between them. Turkey will continue these\nefforts as long as we all think them useful.\nI would also like to underline that Israel's\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon, within the\nframework of Security Council resolution 425 (1978),\nwas a step in the right direction. We also hope that\nnegotiations on the Israeli-Syrian and the Israeli-\n12\n\nLebanese tracks will resume soon and reach a mutually\nacceptable solution.\nAs we are recommitting ourselves to uphold the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter with increased\ndetermination and vigour, we should likewise avoid\nbeing captive of approaches not based on reality. In the\nsame vein, efforts to impose solutions that do not take\ninto account the realities on the ground are doomed to\nfailure.\nIn line with this very basic logic, the settlement\nof the Cyprus issue must be compatible with the\nexisting realities on the island. To refresh memories on\nthis particular subject which is sometimes distorted in\npublic opinions by some powerful centres, I would like\nto summarize the historical background. Cyprus\nbecame an international problem as of December 1963\nwhen the joint Turkish-Greek Republic was forcibly\ndestroyed by the Greek Cypriots and an\nunconstitutional rule was set up at the expense of the\nTurkish Cypriots. The present situation in Cyprus came\ninto being after the coup in 1974 engineered by Nikos\nSampson, the coup leader, who was acting in\ncoordination with the colonels' junta in Greece. This\ncoup murdered many Greek Cypriots as well. The coup\ntoppled Archbishop Makarios and forced him to flee\nthe country. They staged widespread terror and moved\nto make the Turkish Cypriots subjects of a Greek\nCyprus which was designed to be an integral part of\nmainland Greece.\nTurkey, as one of the guarantor powers by virtue\nof the London and Zurich Agreements, intervened to\nterminate the ongoing massacres and to prevent the\nperpetration of similar atrocities in the future.\nAccordingly, Turkey averted an ethnic cleansing on the\nisland and spared the Turkish Cypriots from sharing the\ntragic fate of the Muslim Kosovars and Muslim\nBosnians of the future. Therefore, it would be a gross\ndistortion of history to consider Turkish intervention as\nan occupation. On the contrary, it symbolizes liberation\nfor nearly 200,000 Turkish Cypriots. Due to Turkish\nintervention, not only did the coup in Cyprus fail, but\nalso the junta collapsed, and democracy returned to\nGreece.\nSince 1974, peace and security has prevailed on\nthe island. Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots live on\nthe island as two independent states, two functioning\ndemocracies, representing two distinct peoples. In spite\nof a ruthless economic embargo imposed upon them by\nthe Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots have made\nconsiderable economic progress.\nIt is stipulated by the United Nations that both\nparties through separate referenda should approve a\ncomprehensive settlement mutually acceptable to the\ntwo parties. In case the settlement is rejected by one of\nthe parties in its referendum, the proposed solution\nbecomes null and void. It is out of the question,\ntherefore, for an international organization or any other\ngrouping to impose its own solution on the parties. In\nthis framework, the membership of Cyprus in the\nEuropean Union, of which Turkey is not a full member,\nwould be an indirect enosis and contrary to the\nLondon and Zurich Agreements.\nIf a mutually acceptable settlement is sincerely\nsought, then the model is quite clear, based on the\nrealities of Cyprus: a confederation consisting of two\nstates. As to this model, the two independent entities,\nby virtue of reaching an agreement between\nthemselves, will transfer some of their functions to the\nconfederal bodies. Thus, both the integrity and\ndiversity that emanate from the realities of the island\nwould be preserved. A mutually acceptable settlement\nin Cyprus cannot be reached through romantic\ndescriptions but through realistic assessments.\nTherefore, to define the division of Cyprus as the last\nwall of Europe might sound fashionable but the\nconnotations it brings and the parallelism it draws are\ntotally erroneous. First of all, the line defined as a\nwall was not drawn by Turkey. This line was drawn\nby the United Nations peacekeeping forces in 1963 in\norder to protect the Turkish Cypriots from the assault\nof the Greek Cypriots. This is the year when the Greek\nCypriots illegally got hold of the state apparatus and\nconducted violent assaults against Turkish Cypriots.\nTo refer to some recent arrangements by the\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on its sovereign\nsoil as an act strengthening the existing barriers is\nirrelevant. For the walls to tumble down in Cyprus,\nthe Greek Cypriot side must first free itself of its\npresent frame of mind. Turkey favours a viable\nsettlement of the Cyprus issue. It supports President\nDenkta\u015f' confederal proposal and the proximity talks\ninitiated by the Secretary-General.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nthe appreciation of my Government for the efforts of\nthe Secretary-General as well as his Special Adviser on\nCyprus, Mr. de Soto.\n13\n\nAs a new century is being initiated, it is\nregrettable that the richly endowed continent of Africa\nis yet to receive its share from globalization. Especially\nthe prosperous nations have to make a sustained effort\nto counter poverty and disease in Africa and give the\npeoples of Africa the hope and the means for a more\npromising future.\nWe have to vigorously pursue our efforts to make\nthe world a safer place for all. Turkey has always\nencouraged efforts aimed at achieving meaningful and\nverifiable arms control and disarmament arrangements.\nIn this context, we are also supportive of nuclear\ndisarmament. It is with this understanding that we are\nsignatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT) and to the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT). We urge all countries that have not yet done\nso to do likewise.\nOne of the tools at the disposal of the United\nNations to respond to countries that violate\ninternational peace and stability is sanctions. In recent\nyears sanctions have become a prominent tool in\nUnited Nations collective efforts. There is now an on-\ngoing debate on the subject and an assessment is being\nmade on the utility of sanctions.\nThe effectiveness of sanctions, as we see it, has\ntwo important aspects. The first has to do with whether\nthe sanctions applied to a given country or area serve\ntheir intended purpose. This, in turn, raises the question\nof whether the sanctions are properly targeted and\nwhether there is universal compliance. The second\naspect concerns the proper implementation of\nsanctions. They are invoked on the premise that the\ndecisions taken by the United Nations will be respected\nand that all will share the ensuing burden. Therefore,\nthe collateral effects of the sanctions on third States,\nand especially the uneven burden they place on\ncountries neighbouring the targeted State, are issues\nthat must be addressed. Moreover, we also should see\nto it that the adverse effects of sanctions on innocent\npeople, especially on children, women and the elderly,\nare minimized.\nAfter the widespread economic setbacks of the\npast few years, the healing process of the global\neconomy gathered momentum. Global integration has\nbeen further fuelled by bold leaps in science and\ntechnology. However, there is no room for\ncomplacency. To ensure that the benefits of revitalized\ngrowth are felt evenly on a global scale, continued and\nintensified efforts are needed at national and\ninternational levels.\nIt is not only the countries that have been exposed\nto the negative effects of globalization that stand to\nlose as a result. Global inequality threatens to become a\nsource of political and social instability. The\nelimination of poverty should therefore remain our\nparamount goal. To reach this goal, we must achieve\ngood governance, transparency and participation. We\nmust also build strong social safety nets. But these will\nnot yield the results being sought if we do not make\nadequate provision for the education our people. As\nphysical borders begin to fade, the minds trapped\nwithin national domains must also change and be\ntransformed.\nWe applaud the growing role of the United\nNations in the economic and social sphere. With its\nrole in breeding a culture of international cooperation\nand solidarity  a genuine culture of international\ncooperation and solidarity  the United Nations has\nindeed been a source of inspiration for us all.\nIn one respect we feel we possess most of the\nelements for a promising future, ranging from\nincreased universal awareness of human dignity to\nstrides in science and technology. Yet, at the same time,\nwe are distressed to find ourselves plagued by war,\nweapons of mass destruction, terrorism, racism,\nxenophobia, poverty and many other evils, both old and\nnew. As the new millennium is ushered in, we must\nembrace rationalism, empathy and human solidarity in\ntackling our common problems. Only then can we\nrelax, having fulfilled our responsibilities to the next\ngeneration.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the President on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the\nmembers of the Pacific Island Forum group of\ncountries at the United Nations, comprising Australia,\nFiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand,\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon\nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country,\nMicronesia.\nIt is with pride that I congratulate and extend a\nwarm welcome to our Pacific Island neighbour Tuvalu\ninto the United Nations family. The members of our\ngroup may vary greatly in land and ocean areas,\npopulation, resource endowment, economic\ndevelopment, social structures, languages and cultures,\nbut we share a common goal for the Pacific, based on\nsecurity and stability, as well as prosperity and\neconomic opportunities for its peoples, and the\nsustainability of resources. Within the same context the\nPacific Islands Forum countries represented in New\nYork reaffirm their commitment to play a supportive\nrole in the United Nations decolonization programmes\nin respect of the remaining non-self-governing\nterritories in the Pacific.\nThe Pacific Ocean occupies a central place in the\nlives of the people of the Pacific Islands. Preservation\nof this resource \u2014 which contains the world's highest\nmarine diversity \u2014 is critical to our future economic\ndevelopment. The vast oceanic area under the control\nof our members is rich in fishing potential but requires\ncareful management and monitoring to address illegal,\nunregulated and unreported fishing and other\nenvironmental threats. A major achievement for us and\nour distant-water fishing partners is the convention\nrecently adopted by the Multilateral High-Level\nConference on the Conservation and Management of\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\nCentral Pacific, which will protect the world's last\ngreat tuna fishery.\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Open-\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\nLaw of the Sea, under the co-chairmanship of the\nAmbassador of Samoa, promises to serve as a vital part\nof the preparatory process for the General Assembly's\nconsideration of ocean issues. The ocean priorities\nidentified by the Pacific Island Forum include\nratification of the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea and the United Nations agreement on\nfish stocks; marine scientific research and technical\nassistance; and the delimitation of maritime zones,\nincluding continental shelves.\nThe world's security environment has become\nmore fluid and uncertain with new and emerging\nthreats. Events this year show that a reputation for\nstability and peace are by no means guaranteed in the\nPacific. In light of the political crisis in Fiji and the\nsocial unrest in the Solomon Islands, Foreign Ministers\nof the Forum met in Samoa in August. They recognized\nthe need for regional action to be taken on the basis of\nall members being part of the Pacific Islands extended\nfamily. In doing so the Forum must demonstrate that it\nis prepared constructively to address difficult and\nsensitive issues, including the underlying causes of\ntensions and conflicts, such as ethnicity, socio-\neconomic disparities, lack of good governance, land\ndisputes and erosion of cultural values. Accordingly,\nthey decided to recommend to the Pacific Island Forum\nmeeting in Tarawa, Kiribati, that leaders commit\nthemselves and their countries to a number of\nfundamental principles and courses of actions,\nincluding the following: belief in liberty of the\nindividual under the law, equal rights for all citizens\nregardless of gender, race, colour, creed, political belief\nand in the individual's inalienable right to participate\nby means of a free and democratic political process in\nframing the society in which he or she lives; upholding\ndemocratic processes and institutions which reflect\nnational and local circumstances, including the\npeaceful transfer of power, the rule of law and the\nindependence of the judiciary, just and honest\ngovernment and recognizing the importance and\nurgency of equitable economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations\nof the people of the Forum.\nThe ministers established a working group to\ndevelop these principles, and options for action in\ncases where the principles have been violated, for\nconsideration by Forum leaders when they meet in\nKiribati.\nIn addition to increasing incidents of civil unrest,\nthe region is facing new threats from international,\nfinancial and cyber crime and people-smuggling, as\n27\n\nwell as the challenge of preventing and controlling\ncommunicable diseases and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nThe threat associated with uncontrolled access to even\na small number of weapons was brought into stark\nrelief in the region recently, adding weight to the\nForum leaders' decision in 1997 to put in place\nregional cooperation and a legal framework to control\nthe spread of weapons in the region. This approach is\nin step with international efforts to combat the illicit\ntrade in small arms, particularly in the lead-up to the\n2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.\nWork on a legal framework has progressed to a point\nwhere we expect draft legislation to be circulated\namong Forum island countries before the end of this\nyear.\nWe in the Pacific retain a close relationship, in\nboth economic and cultural terms, with our natural\nenvironment. We therefore maintain a keen interest in\nthe development of the Environmental Vulnerability\nIndex. We thank the several Governments that have\nkindly committed substantial funds for the completion\nof the third phase of the studies being conducted by the\nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission\n(SOPAC), and encourage its adoption by the United\nNations so that the environmental and natural risks that\nour members face are recognized when consideration is\ngiven to eligibility for concessional aid, trade treatment\nand least-developed-country status.\nAgenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States remain the basic guideline for\nprotecting the environment and achieving sustainable\ndevelopment. Steady progress is required in the\npreparations for the 10-year review of the United\nNations Conference on the Environment and\nDevelopment, to take place in 2002. We give high\npriority to international efforts to have the Kyoto\nProtocol come into force at the earliest possible date.\nWe are thus committed to achieving a successful\noutcome to the sixth session of the Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, to be held in November. We\nwelcome the formulation of specific tools, such as the\nClean Development Mechanism, which promise to be\nuseful in enabling island countries to do our part to\ncombat climate change and to adapt to its consequences\nwithin the parameters of our own national\ncircumstances.\nStrengthened efforts are being made in the region\nto build capacity to understand and respond to climate\nchange, including through observational networks. The\nsmall island nations of the Pacific face unique\nconstraints on development. Most have small\nsubsistence-based economies with a narrow export\nbase. Forum economic ministers meeting in July\nreconfirmed their commitment to the process of\neconomic reform, based on the principle of good\ngovernance, with the aim of providing a sound\neconomic basis upon which social development can\ntake place.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) remains\nthe world's most significant international opportunity\nfor the negotiation of trade and commercial issues. The\nPacific Island Forum has agreed to establish a Forum\ndelegation in Geneva and a working group of Forum\ntrade officials to improve cooperation in the WTO and\nto actively engage in the policy debate about the best\nway to enhance the role of the WTO in contributing to\ndevelopment. We recognize the importance of finding\nways to ensure that trade reform delivers outcomes\nwhich will contribute not only to economic growth, but\nalso to the advancement of development and social\nequity objectives and improved environmental\noutcomes.\nThe global information economy promises great\nopportunities, particularly for those in isolated areas\nsuch as the Pacific, but it also demands new skills and\ntechnology. Efficient and effective communications\nservices, including a dedicated modern network system\nlike the Small Island Developing States Network\n(SIDSNET), are of critical importance in achieving\neconomic and social development and overcoming the\nconstraints resulting from the relatively high cost\nstructures of telecommunication networks for Forum\nisland countries. A Forum vision for the Pacific\ninformation economy seeks to develop an appropriate\nmechanism for the cooperation of regional regulators\nand relevant organizations. Education and training are\nof fundamental importance to enhancing the\nadaptability of Pacific islanders to economic reform in\na rapidly changing world and region. By supporting\neducation, the United Nations can help overcome one\nof the major obstacles to economic growth and poverty\nreduction.\nThe United Nations system continues to play a\nvital role in protecting the interests of small island\nStates, such as most of the members of the Pacific\n28\n\nIsland Forum. It is essential that the United Nations\nremain strong by adapting to meet new challenges such\nas globalization. At the same time, the central role of\nthe General Assembly, with its universal membership,\nshould be strengthened. The Security Council should\nbe made more representative, transparent and\ndemocratic so as to be able to respond to the\nrequirements of a fundamentally different international\nsetting. It needs to be reformed comprehensively to\nmeet contemporary demands and the conditions of the\nworld today.\nWe welcome the Brahimi report (A/55/305) and\nlook forward to the strengthening of the ability of the\nUnited Nations to carry out its key peacekeeping role.\nTo fulfil its collective security responsibilities, the\nUnited Nations must be afforded strong and sustained\npolitical support, together with financial and\ninstitutional resources. An integral element is a more\nequitable scale for determining peacekeeping funding.\nThe Pacific Island Forum group remains\ncommitted to ensuring an effective United Nations.\nProgramme of work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Representing and speaking on behalf of\nthe Government of the Dominican Republic, which\nsince 16 August 2000 has been presided over by\nMr. Hip\u00f3lito Mejia on the basis of the votes cast by our\npeople for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, we\nshould like to reaffirm our profound commitment to the\nprinciples that gave life to this Organization and to the\nprospect for its further work as we head into a new\nmillennium.\nWe should like to voice our congratulations to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his having\nconvened the historic Millennium Summit on the basis\nof the report about the role to be played by the United\nNations in the twenty-first century, a document which\ncontained an intelligent and pinpointed analysis of the\nmost acute problems of the present and of what is\nahead for the international community.\nThe Dominican Republic is convinced that\nfreedom and equality for all States and for all human\nbeings, without any distinctions whatsoever, constitute\nthe underpinnings for real peace and for harmonious\nand democratic development of the international\ncommunity.\nThe assessment of the world situation drawn up at\nthe Millennium Summit highlighted that\nnotwithstanding the extraordinary scientific and\ntechnological strides made, the development in\ncommunications media and the rapid expansion of the\nwealth of some countries, two thirds of mankind live in\nconditions which prevent freedom and equality from\nbeing a common denominator for all the peoples of the\nearth.\nIt is all too well known that globalization is not\nemerging as some magic formula or a panacea to heal\nwounds, nor as any wondrous invention of the genius\nof certain sectors of the rich countries.\nGlobalization is the continuation of a process\ngoing back centuries in the history of humankind and\nsomething which, unfortunately, on the one hand does\ncontribute to the progress and enrichment of some, but\non the other hand still leaves us with a developed and\nan underdeveloped world. It is precisely because of its\nunequal effects upon the peoples of the world that at\nthe South Summit of the Group of 77 held in Havana,\nand at the Millennium Summit which took place in this\nvery Hall, we heard with renewed strength a just call\nfor freedom and equality.\nThe breadth and the dizzying speed of the\nchanges which globalization has triggered in recent\nyears have stirred the good conscience of humanity,\n15\n\nand, although it appears a paradox, a peaceful\nrebellion, albeit a distrustful one, is beginning to\nprotest what is seen in all this as just one more form of\nthe traditional domination of the powerful over the\nweakest.\nWe peoples that had been colonized, and, having\ngained independence, had to live in permanent defence\nof our sovereignty and our cultural identity, have\ndeveloped the kind of sensitivity that allows us to sort\nout the real consequences of certain historic processes.\nThat explains how, faced with the effects of\ninescapable globalization, we have reacted critically,\ndetermined not to continue to live on the sidelines and\nnot to accept that we should withdraw, unable to\nachieve the security of a future filled with hope\nthrough the exercise of our free will.\nGlobalization must be guided by the conviction\nthat the aspiration of a world free from upheaval can be\nachieved only by an equitable interdependence which\ncan understand that the current imbalances caused by\nthe requirements and conditions imposed by certain\nbodies can be met by the underdeveloped countries\nonly by the gradual application of free trade\nagreements and the elimination of the kind of\nprotectionism that stands in the way of the free access\nof goods and services to the markets of the developed\ncountries.\nOne single example shall suffice to illustrate the\nconsequences of the indiscriminate opening of the\nmarket of an underdeveloped country. In the\nDominican Republic thousands and thousands of\nmedium and small-sized companies have gone\nbankrupt because they could not compete with the\navalanche of products from the highly industrialized\ncountries.\nPeoples whose asymmetry in relation to the\ndeveloped countries has been affirmed over centuries\ncannot and will not be able to adapt to being\nparticipants benefiting from globalization if they do not\nreceive the kind of support that allows them to attain\neconomic and social objectives that can contribute to\novercoming their current underdevelopment. To talk\nabout globalization and to leave the poor countries to\ntheir own devices to make all the efforts necessary to\ncome up to the speed of the wealthy countries is a cruel\njoke. Globalization must be imbued with an effective\nspirit of solidarity and social justice. Otherwise,\nunderdeveloped humankind may find itself faced with\na new version of the economic voracity that is\nillustrated in the fable of the shark and the sardine.\nWe believe that these concerns are all too\nlegitimate and, first and foremost, foresighted. We\nmust not in the future be forced to find a new word for\nglobalization to brand it as we branded the imperial\npolicies of the past.\nGlobalization is already doing more than give rise\nto concerns and exacerbate the problems of the poor\ncountries; it also steadily worsens the external debt\nsituation. How many times must we pay that debt?\nWhen will we finish paying it? We are convinced that\ncertain aspects of globalization and the consequences\nof external debt are two sides of the same coin. The\nindifference to the harm that this ruinous debt burden\ndoes to the economies of poor countries makes one\ndoubt the existence of a true spirit of solidarity or a\nsincere readiness to cooperate. Only forgiving that debt\nunder logical and favourable conditions and through\nmechanisms guaranteeing effectiveness can give\nunderdeveloped countries the encouragement they need\nto embark on the path into the new era.\nMoreover, current price of oil is a further source\nof distress for those who depend on it for energy\nproduction. This year's oil bill for the Dominican\nRepublic will be more than $500 million, which\naccounts for some 15 per cent of our national budget.\nThis situation \u2014 one shared by many other peoples \u2014\ndemands consideration founded on international\nsolidarity and cooperation.\nWhen we in the Dominican Republic speak of\nsolidarity and cooperation, we cannot but speak of\nHaiti. Because we are adjacent to that fraternal people,\nwe know how much it needs the generous, sustained\nsupport of the international community. As the\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, Mr. Hip\u00f3lito\nMejia, said at the Millennium Summit, the Dominican\nRepublic cannot alone bear the present social burden of\nhundreds of thousands of Haitian citizens. The\nDominican Republic therefore wants a solution in\nwhich the international community would be an active\nparticipant, one that must be based on human rights\nand that must be implemented in accordance with the\nnorms and principles that must govern a sound\nmigration policy.\nBut let no one think that we have come here to\ngrumble and to use the General Assembly as a wailing\nwall. That is by no means true. The Government of the\n16\n\nDominican Republic is absolutely convinced that it is\nDominican society itself that must make the greatest\neffort to achieve development. Mindful of its\nresponsibilities, therefore, the Government of the\nDominican Republic accepts the challenge of\nglobalization, because it knows that the first thing is to\naddress the priorities of development, and because it\nknows also that its greatest efforts must go towards\nestablishing social justice to resolve problems of\neducation, health, the environment, the equality of men\nand women, children, eliminating poverty, ending drug\ntrafficking, nutrition and steady improvement in human\nrights and civil liberties.\nFortunately for many of the world's peoples,\ndeveloped countries and international bodies largely\nunderstand that the point of globalization must not be\nto unleash market forces and to bring about\nprotectionism, production subsidies and technical\nregulation, because such obstacles can only contribute\nto widening the gulf between rich and poor. Those\ncountries and organizations are working together\nsincerely to ensure that the benefits of this process will\nbe shared through cooperation involving the\ncomprehensive development of peoples. It was in that\nspirit and with those concerns in mind that the United\nNations proposed the 2001 High-level\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\nDevelopment.\nThe Dominican Republic has strengthened its ties\nwith the Caribbean, with Central America and with\nother areas of integration, and we are making our\ncontribution to enhance the possibilities for\nnegotiations, access to foreign markets, technology\nexchanges and cultural enrichment. Moreover, we\nbelieve that South-South cooperation is an\nindispensable complement to growth-oriented\nprogrammes undertaken with developing countries.\nI turn now to the need to reform the Charter of\nthe Organization. Much has happened since 1945. With\nundeniable skill, the United Nations bodies of that time\ndealt with the tasks they faced in the wake of the\nSecond World War. But that was then; now, those\nbodies do not reflect the realities of a new international\ncommunity that is larger and more demanding of\ndemocratic development.\nReform of the Security Council is imperative; the\nDominican Republic considers that it must take place\nin keeping with the sovereign equality of States,\nequitable geographical distribution and the varying\nlevels of development of peoples. We are convinced\nthat an increase in the number of both permanent and\nnon-permanent members, carried out on the basis of\nthose principles, would enable the General Assembly to\nplay its role as the organ that is truly representative of\ninternational democracy.\nI turn now the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court, which was a major event. We hope that\nthe Court will be able to mete out justice not only to\nheads of State, heads of Government and officials who\ncommit war crimes, crimes against humanity or crimes\nagainst citizens, but also to those who engage in\nadministrative corruption and theft of State property,\nsomething that certainly constitutes a crime in many\ncountries because of the economic and moral harm it\ncauses to their peoples.\nBecause of the desire of the Dominican Republic\nto be consistent with the historic tradition of its\ninternational relations, it wishes to reaffirm its support\nfor the Republic of China in its logical and just\naspiration to rejoin the Organization, of which it was a\nprominent Member for many years. Here, our position\nreflects a duty born of conscience, not a position that\nwould diminish the rights that the United Nations has\nrecognized others to have.\nAlso linked to our historic tradition is the\nprinciple of national sovereignty. Since it won\nindependence on 27 February 1844, the Dominican\nRepublic has held the right of self-determination as an\nunshakeable article of faith. Thus, when there is talk of\nalso enshrining humanitarian intervention as a right, we\nfind ourselves faced with a situation that demands\nclear-cut and precise definitions. We request this body\nto devote to this issue the attention it deserves so that\nall its Members will participate in clearing up such a\nworrisome matter.\n\nFinally, the Dominican Republic wishes to\nexpress its conviction that the dialogue initiated by the\nMillennium Summit and the positions expressed in the\nGeneral Assembly will contribute positively to\nstrengthening efforts for peace and brotherhood, which\nare the essence of the spirit of the United Nations\nCharter.\n17\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, from the\noutset, to extend warm congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your election to preside over the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would\nlike also to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the able\nmanner with which he discharged his responsibilities as\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express our\nsincere appreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for all the efforts he has been making to make\nthe United Nations equally relevant to all of us. I wish,\nin particular, to congratulate him on the success of the\nMillennium Summit, which we are hopeful will be a\nlandmark for more meaningful and enhanced\ncooperation among nations.\nWe have indeed been encouraged by the well-\ndeserved emphasis that was given to Africa and to\nAfrica's predicament at the Millennium Summit. It is\nour hope that the Summit may have helped create\ngreater determination for cooperation with the peoples\nof Africa so that Africa may make real progress in\naddressing the challenges of development, peace and\nstability.\nThe problems of Africa are defined by two very\nclosely related challenges. Africa's development\ncontinues to be arrested by problems of insecurity,\ninstability and lack of peace. On the other hand, it\nappears unrealistic to expect durable peace in Africa\nwithout hope in the future that could be brought about\nonly by visible indications of possibilities for progress.\nIn both areas, Africa has not had the necessary\nsupport commensurate with the complexity of the\nchallenges it has faced. It might be necessary to hasten\nto add here that indeed Africa itself might not always\nhave taken advantage of available opportunities for\nmaking progress, and that we might sometimes have\nsquandered real opportunities for breaking out of the\nvicious cycle of poverty and lack of peace and stability.\nWhile this may be partly true, the significance of\nthe missed chances that Africa has allowed to pass\nshould not be exaggerated. It is far from the truth that\nAfrica has enjoyed sustained, resolute and all-out\nsupport, either in the area of economic development or\nin the sphere of peace and security. On the other hand,\nit is precisely this type of cooperation that is required\nby many in Africa to be able to embark on sustainable\n4\n\neconomic development and growth. But whether with\nrespect to debt relief, or to declining terms of trade, or\nto all aspects of the challenges of and obstacles to\ndevelopment, the types of cooperation made available\nto our countries have always been limited as well as\nentangled with all kinds of conditions which have been\nfar from helpful.\nLike all regions of the world and like all\ncountries, Africa and African nations should and must\nassume primary responsibility for what happens in\nAfrica in general and in individual African countries.\nBut at one time or another in their history, most regions\nof the world and most countries have had occasions to\nrely on international solidarity and cooperation as a\ncatalyst for creating conditions for development and\nstability.\nBut Africa's fate has been different. For whatever\nreason, it has been easier to lose hope with respect to\nAfrica than to give the continent the benefit of the\ndoubt; this, even when little has been done to help\nAfrica address the real challenges it is facing in a\nvariety of areas.\nThis is not only in the area of economic\ndevelopment. We have seen the same thing taking place\nwith respect to the need for Africa to promote respect\nfor the rule of law and to create conditions for peace\nand stability. Africa is also being marginalized in terms\nof the universal applicability of the principles of\ninternational law. It is our hope that Africa will be\njudged by the same standard in this regard. Otherwise,\nthere can be little chance for peace and stability in our\ncontinent.\nWe say this from experience. There is no\neffective substitute, if opportunities are to be created\nfor the peaceful resolution of situations of crisis in\nAfrica and for a quick and an appropriate response by\nthe international community to violations of\ninternational law. Peace can never be promoted through\nappeasement of aggression or by creating the\nimpression that, depending on circumstances, on where\nthey take place and to whom they happen, some acts of\naggression can be tolerated.\nWe in Ethiopia have, only a week ago, celebrated\nour New Year. We have entered the year 1993 with\nconfidence that it will be a year of peace and progress.\nOur people have made the commitment to resume the\ntask of economic development with full force, a task\nwhich was rudely interrupted two years ago when our\ncountry became a victim of aggression.\nIt is also in this spirit that we are proceeding with\nfull commitment to put behind us the crisis we have\nhad with Eritrea. Even before the deployment of\npeacekeepers, contrary to experience in other places,\nthe cessation of hostilities has held for months now. We\nlook forward both to the deployment of the\npeacekeepers and to a speedy conclusion of a\ncomprehensive settlement. All those prepared to\ncontribute to this effort should rest assured that what\nthey should expect from Ethiopia, its people and their\nGovernment, is the fullest cooperation. For us,\nagreements concluded are made to be respected, not\nviolated. In any case, what our people wish to be\nidentified with, fully and with no ambiguity, is\npeacemaking, not war-making. We hope that we will\nhave the opportunity to work for peace and for\neconomic growth and development.\nThere are few who need the blessings of peace\nmore than the people of Ethiopia and of our subregion.\nAs much as our people refuse to see aggression\nrewarded at their expense, they have, on the other\nhand, never been wanting in demonstrating full\ncommitment to peace and legality. Our people will\nnever jettison this noble tradition.\nEthiopia also takes its responsibility for peace\nand stability in our subregion very seriously and in\nAfrica as a whole. In this regard, we have been\nenormously encouraged by the developments with\nrespect to the peace initiative on Somalia under the\nauspices of President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti.\nIt is Ethiopia's hope that what has already been\nachieved in Djibouti will be built upon and that the\nmomentum for peace and national reconciliation will\nbe maintained. We are convinced that if the remaining\nproblems are handled with realism, wisdom and mutual\naccommodation, there is little doubt that the people of\nSomalia will very soon be able to put behind them the\n10-year nightmare they have faced. I would like,\ntherefore, to take this opportunity to call on all\nconcerned to make this newly created opportunity for\npeace in Somalia, and for the restoration of the Somali\nState, irreversible. The process should not be allowed\nto be held hostage by those who may not be prepared\nfor national reconciliation. Nor should it be endangered\nby a failure to be sufficiently accommodating and\n5\n\nsufficiently patient. This is what the international\ncommunity should encourage.\nThe opportunity now created in Somalia should\nnot be allowed to slip away. This could easily happen if\nall attention is focused on seeking international\nlegitimacy rather than internal national reconciliation.\nIt would indeed be a tragedy and a recipe for further\nbloodshed in Somalia if efforts are not made to build\non the peace and stability that have already been\nachieved by some regions and parts of Somalia. The\nissue of Somaliland, for instance, requires great\nsensitivity and a sense of enormous responsibility.\nWhatever has been achieved in Djibouti is going to be\ntested by how well the peace and stability that some\nparts of Somalia have achieved is preserved.\nFor Ethiopia, and for Somalia's neighbours, these\nare critical issues. The formal stand we will be taking\nwith respect to the evolving situation in Somalia will\ndepend on how these issues are addressed by those who\nnow have the chance to affect the destiny of the people\nof Somalia. While we wish them well and promise\nthem our full cooperation, we also ask them to use this\nhistoric opportunity with a full sense of responsibility\nand wisdom.\nLet me take this opportunity to also state that\nEthiopia, along with its Inter-Government Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD) partners, will continue to do the\nmaximum possible for peace and national\nreconciliation in the Sudan. It has always been our firm\nconviction that the Declaration of Principles provides a\njust and realistic basis for reaching a settlement on the\ncrisis in southern Sudan. It is also our view that a\nbroader national reconciliation in the Sudan can easily\nbe achieved on the basis of democratic principles and\nmutual accommodation. Ethiopia will continue to be\ncommitted to peace in the Sudan on this basis and to\ncooperate with all those who have the goodwill to\ncontribute to peace in our subregion.\nLet me reiterate: Ethiopia will do the maximum\npossible for peace and durable stability in Africa as a\nwhole, with the full knowledge that without peace we\nin Africa will have little chance to ensure a better\nfuture for our peoples.\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a few\nwords on how vital it is that the reform of the Security\nCouncil be completed as speedily as possible. The\nreform of the Council is critical for the credibility of\nthe United Nations and for its increased legitimacy. As\nmatters stand now, it is only too obvious that not many\nbelieve that the work of the Security Council is\nconducted with sufficient transparency. In fact, there is\na growing conviction that the Council is being less and\nless representative and more and more distant from the\nsentiments of the majority.\nThis situation, we believe, needs to be rectified.\nThis can be done in two ways. First, by ensuring that\nthere is equitable representation of all regions of the\nworld on the Council. Secondly, it is also important\nthat the work of the Council be made more open and its\ndecision-making more transparent. The interests of\npeace and security will be better served if the Council\nis more transparent and more open to the views of\nothers, most particularly to the views of those directly\naffected by its decisions.\nIt is our earnest hope that the United Nations will\nbe more relevant to all in the twenty-first century, and\nin equal measure, than it has been in the past 55 years.\nThis is not an unrealistic objective, but it requires the\ncommitment of all, big and small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to extend to\nyou, on behalf of my country's delegation, our\ncongratulations on your election as President of this\nsession, and to wish you every success in the\nmanagement of its affairs. I would also like to express\nour appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, who\nadministered the work of the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly most competently. I wish also to\nseize this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nSecretary General Kofi Annan for his initiatives, which\nhave been instrumental in putting an end to tension in\nmany parts of the world and for his endeavours aimed\nat reform of the United Nations and the enhancement\n10\n\nof its role, so that it may better fulfil its duties,\naccording to the Charter. A word of welcome is also\ndue to the Republic of Tuvalu, which joined us a few\ndays ago as a new member of the United Nations.\nThis session is convened in the aftermath of\nseveral developments. In the past few days, the\nSecretary-General submitted Comprehensive report on\npeacekeeping operations; it included a number of\nrecommendations that would assist the United Nations\nin assuming its responsibilities in this field.\nFurthermore, over the last few months, the General\nAssembly convened two special sessions, the first\nconducted a review of the progress made in the\nimplementation of the outcome of the World\nConference on Women, and the second reviewed\nprogress in the implementation of the outcome of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development and beyond.\nLast week, this hall witnessed the convening of the\nMillennium Assembly, at the conclusion of which the\nleaders of the world expressed their adherence to the\nUnited Nations and renewed their commitment to the\npurposes and principles of its Charter, as well as their\nintent to lend it their support and to enhance its role to\nenable it to cope with the new century, with all its\nchanges and challenges. In our view, these\ndevelopments will undoubtedly contribute to the efforts\naimed at achieving the goals of this Organization.\nHowever, it must also be noted that we are still far\nfrom achieving the ultimate goal for which we strive \nnamely, the establishment of a world that enjoys peace,\nsecurity, freedom, equality, and justice, a world free\nfrom oppression, acts of aggression, and attempts to\nimpose hegemony and domination.\nThere are many regions in the world today that\nsuffer from wars and conflicts. Famine and diseases\nsuch as cancer, malaria, and acquired immune\ndeficiency syndrome (AIDS) still threaten the lives of\nmillions. Resources provided by nature for the\nsustenance of life are being seriously endangered.\nDeveloping countries have not benefited from the\nadvantages of globalization in a manner proportional to\ntheir suffering from its negative impact. In fact,\ninternational financial institutions have started to\nimpose severe conditions on these countries to the\nextent that they find themselves at the mercy of a new\nform of colonialism. Attempts to intervene in the\ninternal affairs of other States have threatened to\neliminate sovereignty  not only to violate it.\nThere are also unilateral boycott policies and\nimposition of unjust sanctions, even aggression, under\nthe pretext of so-called international legitimacy. Old\nideological barriers have been replaced by new barriers\nthat obstruct the States of the South from access to\ntechnology they desperately need for development, and\nthat impose trade protection measures on their products\nby making other markets inaccessible to them. We are\nalso witnessing selectivity in the sphere of\ndisarmament and double standard policies in the\ntreatment of international issues. Furthermore, criminal\nactivities have increased, including illicit drug\ntrafficking, the financing of organized crime and all\nkinds of transnational crimes.\nSuch is the current state of the world, with its\nvarious variables and challenges, after the collapse of\ninternational equilibrium. Such a state of affairs\nnecessitates the adoption of certain measures to combat\nand rectify the prevailing conditions. The United\nNations, in its capacity as an instrument and reference\nauthority for all, should perform a pivotal role in\ndealing with these variables. However, we believe that\nthe Organization will not be capable of making an\neffective contribution in this respect unless radical\nreforms are introduced into the composition of its\norgans and the working mechanisms of its entities. In\norder to guarantee success for this process, we should\nmake it a comprehensive one that takes into account\nthe aspirations, ideas, and proposals of all Member\nStates, big and small, strong and weak. The\nresponsibility for success or failure of this process\nmust ultimately be a joint responsibility.\nMy country, wishing to contribute to the ongoing\nefforts aimed at reforming the United Nations, believes\nthat the required reform should achieve the following\nobjectives: first, strengthening the role of the General\nAssembly so that it becomes the authority responsible\nfor determining and deciding the conditions that must\nbe deemed truly threatening to international peace and\nsecurity. A mechanism answerable to the General\nAssembly should be established to ensure the\nimplementation of its resolutions and to enable it to\ncontrol and hold accountable other United Nations\norgans, including the Security Council, which itself\nshould be an executive entity for the implementation of\nGeneral Assembly resolutions.\nSecondly, restructuring the Security Council so\nthat it achieves fair geographical representation in its\nmembership, with equity for African, Asian, and Latin\n\n\nAmerican States that are not fairly represented in the\nmembership of the Council.\nThirdly, improving the ways and methods by\nwhich the Security Council conducts its work so that\nits activities are rendered more transparent. Its rules of\nprocedures should also be reviewed. In fact, the\nGeneral Assembly, which represents all the Member\nStates of the Organization, should issue such rules;\notherwise, it would be meaningless to say that the\nCouncil acts on behalf of the international community.\nFourthly, we urge the abolition of the\nprerogatives that the victors of the Second World War\ngranted to themselves, particularly the right of veto,\nwhich should be eliminated because it is non-\ndemocratic and undermines the principle of the full\nequality of Member States, as enshrined in the Charter.\nFifthly, in order to enable the Organization to\nfollow up on its plans and programmes, we propose the\nestablishment of an international committee answerable\nto the United Nations, with subcommittees that cover\nmost regions of the world, empowered with the\nnecessary mandates and resources to undertake the\ntasks of inspecting and implementing United Nations\nprogrammes.\nDespite the problems suffered by many African\ncountries, the current year has witnessed some\nencouraging developments. In Somalia, Parliament was\nable to choose a new President for the country and the\ndisputing parties in Burundi signed a national\nreconciliation agreement. The fighting that broke out\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea has been contained and\nboth sides have signed a ceasefire agreement. These\nsolutions were the fruits of efforts made by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and a number of\nAfrican leaders who sincerely care for the security,\nstability and development of the continent. For its part,\nmy country has contributed to all these efforts and will\npursue, in cooperation with the OAU and the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, our initiatives\naimed at securing a just settlement acceptable to all\nparties to the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will also\ncontinue our good offices with the aim of finding a\nsolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo and the Great Lakes region on the basis of the\nimplementation of the Sirte agreement, which was\ncompleted in Lusaka, for the purpose of ending the\ndispute in that region.\nFrom the outset, we in Libya have realized that\nAfrica's problems are partly due to its disunity and the\nfragmentation of its own peoples' efforts. Therefore, in\norder for the continent to be truly capable of facing the\nchallenge of disputes, disease and backwardness, as\nwell as others imposed by new international situations,\nBrother Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, the leader of\nthe revolution, has pursued his efforts to unify the\ncontinent so that it may be ushered into the new\ncentury strong and unified. It was in this spirit that a\nmeeting of African foreign ministers was held in\nTripoli last April, at which the founding law for the\nAfrican Union was drafted. This law was approved in\nLom\u00c8 last June at the Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment. At the invitation of the leader of the\nrevolution, the African presidents will meet in Sirte\nearly next year to declare the official establishment of\nthe African Union. This bears witness to the fact that\nAfrica has overcome the negative aspects of the past\nand realized the dream of unity, which has been the\naspiration of African peoples for decades.\nAll these initiatives and endeavours provide new\nevidence that Africa fully realizes that the solution to\nits problems and the advancement of its capacities\nreside basically in the efforts of its own sons and\ndaughters. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that\ninternational peace is indivisible and that international\nstability cannot be achieved partially. This means that\nthe international community has an obligation to assist\nAfrica in its efforts to realize peace and stability on its\nsoil. As we reiterate today our invitation to all States to\nhelp Africa in developing a programme to eliminate\nepidemics and diseases, provide a solution to the\nproblem of its external debt and ensure that the\ncontinent is dealt with on new, just and equitable terms,\nrather than be considered merely as a consumer market\nfor the products of the industrialized world, we wish to\nrecall, as we have always done, that Africa's problems\nlie in the abuse of its resources, the plundering of its\nwealth and riches, intervention in its internal affairs\nand the imposition of foreign concepts alien to its\ntraditions and culture. We demand that such practices\nbe discontinued, as they constitute one of the main\nreasons for political instability in many parts of the\ncontinent and for economic backwardness in most. We\nalso call upon the States that colonized Africa, drew its\nborders and scattered and enslaved its people to offer\ntheir apologies to the continent and to fully compensate\nit for all the damage inflicted by colonialism.\n12\n\nNo solution has yet been found to the Palestinian\nquestion because the essence of this problem has been\nignored. My country emphasizes once again that there\nis no solution to the Palestinian problem other than the\nreturn of the Palestinian people to their homeland and\nthe establishment of their State on the land of\nPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital. On this\noccasion, as we salute the people of Lebanon who,\nthanks to their steadfastness, were able to defeat the\nenemy and liberate their occupied land, we once again\nstress the need for an end to the occupation of the\nSyrian Golan Heights. We also demand the immediate\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and call upon\nthe international community to put an end to the human\ntragedy endured by that country's people, to preserve\nthe unity and integrity of its territories, to respect its\nsovereignty, to refrain from interfering in its internal\naffairs and to cease the military aggression waged daily\nagainst it.\nThe international community has made\ncontinuous efforts in the field of disarmament. My\ncountry, which is a party to most international\nconventions in this area, is still fully convinced that\nsome international conventions addressing certain\naspects in this field should be reviewed. I would refer,\nas one example, to the Ottawa Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, which deals only with simple weapons of\nlimited effect. We, as one of the third world peoples\nwho are incapable of defending our borders and lands\nagainst the powerful who possess aircraft carriers and\naircraft that refuel in flight, feel that humanity should\nbe preoccupied with the destruction of nuclear,\nchemical and biological weapons, as well as with\nballistic weapons, rather concern itself with mines,\nwhich are a simple form of weaponry.\nOn the other hand, we have noticed that a number\nof obstacles still hinder the efforts to establish a world\nfree of weapons of mass destruction. Those who\npossess nuclear arms have not yet undertaken actual\nmeasures to dispose of their nuclear arsenals. In fact,\nsome of them have continued to develop these weapons\nvertically, instead of beginning to destroy them. The\nIsraelis, who possess hundreds of nuclear warheads\nwith which they threaten the Arab people from the\nAtlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf, still refuse to join\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and to place their nuclear installations under\nthe supervision and the safeguards system of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\nIn raising this most serious and momentous\nsubject, we are fully convinced that, unless the\ninternational community adopts effective measures to\nforce the Israelis to accept and implement the\ninternational conventions on nuclear disarmament, and\nunless the nuclear-weapon States take practical steps to\nprove the seriousness of their undertakings, efforts to\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear arms will be utterly\nworthless and any claims concerning the destruction of\nnuclear arms will be a major act of deception that will\nnot fool the peoples of the world.\nTerrorism still constitutes a source of grave\ndanger to humanity, because no effective measures\nhave been taken to trace the roots of this phenomenon\nin order to eradicate it. My country, which has been a\ndirect victim of state terrorism, has relentlessly\nreiterated its strong condemnation of terrorist acts and\nits willingness to cooperate with all international\nefforts aimed at their elimination. My country's\neagerness to put an end to terrorism was so strong that\nwe called in 1992 for the convening of a special\nsession of the General Assembly to consider methods\nto eradicate all forms of terrorism and violence.\nToday, in reiterating this request, it is most\nimportant that we clarify that the correct approach to\neliminating terrorism must begin with providing a\ndefinition for terrorism that is universal, objective,\ndemocratic and scientific. It is genuinely unacceptable\nthat some still classify the struggle of peoples for their\nfreedom and the fight of persecuted groups against\ntheir persecutors as forms of terrorism, whereas they\nturn a blind eye to real terrorism, embodied in unjust\nsanctions, occupation, invasion, foreign military bases,\nnaval fleets, weapons of mass destruction and the use\nand threat of use of force. Unless all such matters are\ndealt with, it is certain that any international efforts to\neliminate terrorism will be of no avail.\nWe believe that it has become necessary to take\nadditional measures to reinforce international systems,\nsuch as the Statute of the International Criminal Court,\nconcerned with the punishment of perpetrators of the\nmost serious crimes against international security. In its\npresent form, the Statute is designed to try only the\nweak. We ask that it be modified to guarantee the trial\nof all perpetrators of acts of aggression, drug\nsmugglers and their trading partners, those responsible\n13\n\nfor massacres of innocent people, and those who\ncommit acts of aggression against United Nations\ntroops.\nWe look forward to the establishment of a world\nin which equality and justice prevail and which is free\nfrom discrimination, oppression and injustice. This will\nrequire the drafting of laws that preserve the rights of\nmother and child and guarantee that a person may own\nhis own house and be a partner in his own productive\nwork, that his basic needs will not be subject to\ncommercialization and that his rights are not usurped\nas a source of income.\nWe also look forward to taking practical measures\nthat lead to the realization of a world free from motives\nof aggression, manifestations of violence, epidemics\nand diseases. We also hope that efforts will be joined to\ncombat the phenomenon of the white poisons'.\nMoreover, in order to protect our planet from the\ndangers that threaten it, we should work to eradicate\npests, strive to establish low-cost water desalination\nsystems and seek to prevent the flow of waters of\nrivers, rain and snow to seas and oceans. Furthermore,\nall factors that hinder the prevention of desertification\nand the expansion of agricultural development should\nbe removed. One of these factors is the problem of\nmines and other remnants of war from which many\ncountries, including my own, still suffer. There are still\nmillions of mines in our lands planted by the fighting\nforces during the Second World War. We hope that the\nStates responsible for planting these mines will\nrespond to the international decisions that call upon\nthem to make available maps for their locations and to\nprovide technical assistance for their removal.\nAllow me now to raise a subject that has\npreoccupied the attention of the international\ncommunity for the last seven years, namely the dispute\nbetween my country and a number of Western States\nconcerning the Lockerbie incident. I would like to\nfocus on the manner in which the Security Council has\ndealt with this issue since the suspension of the\nsanctions in April of last year. As you are well aware,\nmore than a year and a half have now elapsed since the\ntwo suspects appeared before the Scottish court\nconvened in the Netherlands. Almost the same period\nhas elapsed since the Secretary-General submitted his\nreport to the Security Council pursuant to resolutions\n883 (1993) and 1192 (1998), in which he confirmed\nthat my country has fulfilled the demands stated in the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Despite all these\ndevelopments, however, the Council has been\nprevented from adopting the resolution that requires\nthe lifting of the sanctions, because of the intransigence\nof one country, the United States. This intransigence\nhas been such that a threat to use the right of veto was\nvoiced.\nThe United States gave a number of justifications\nto prevent the Security Council from lifting the unjust\nsanctions imposed upon the Libyan people. The first of\nthese justifications is that Libya still supports\nterrorism. This is a groundless pretext. My country,\nwhich was itself a victim of terrorism in 1986 and\nbefore, has repeatedly declared its condemnation of\ninternational terrorism in all its aspects and forms, and\nstressed its support for all international efforts aimed at\nits eradication. Moreover, the Secretary-General's\nreport has given irrefutable proof concerning the\nvacuity and lack of truth of all American claims that\nLibya supports terrorism.\nThe second of these American justifications is\nthat Libya should cooperate with the Scottish court\nconvened in the Netherlands. This is a refutable\njustification, as my country has pledged from the\nbeginning, that it will cooperate fully with the court.\nThis pledge has, in fact, been proven since the court\nstarted reviewing the case. In fact, the United States is\nthe one that has not fully cooperated with the court by\nhiding basic information requested by the court, which\nin itself violates Security Council resolutions that call\nupon all States, and in particular the concerned ones, to\ncooperate with the Scottish court sitting in the\nNetherlands.\nThe third, and the strangest of these justifications,\nis the demand that Libya pay compensation to the\nfamilies of the victims of the Pan Am Flight 103. The\nquestion to be raised here is: How could the United\nStates ask for compensation while the Scottish court\nhas not yet reached a verdict? Does this not constitute a\ncomplete disregard for the legal principle that\nstipulates a presumption of innocence until the accused\nis proven guilty? Furthermore, why does the United\nStates jump to conclusions and deliver a ready\nconviction, while acquittal or conviction is a matter for\nthe court alone to decide? Libya's fulfilment of its\nobligations was confirmed by the Secretary- General's\nreport a year and a half ago. It was also reaffirmed by\nthe decisions of the Summit of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement, the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab\n14\n\nLeague and lastly the Group of 77 and China, which\ncalled for a complete lifting of the unjust sanctions\nimposed on the Libyan people.\nIn view of all of the above, my country demands\nthe following:\nFirst, this issue should not politicize, as it has\nnow become a legal matter that should be left to the\ndiscretion of the Scottish court convened in the\nNetherlands without interference from any parties.\nSecondly, the Security Council should, as early as\npossible, adopt a resolution under which the sanctions\nimposed on the Libyan people are fully and irrevocably\nlifted. This is the only procedure that reaffirms the\ncommitment of the Council to paragraph (16) of its\nresolution 883 (1993), and the second paragraph of its\nresolution 1192 (1998). It would also reaffirm the\nCouncil's response to the wishes of the absolute\nmajority of the international community, on whose\nbehalf the Council is supposed to work.\nShould the Council be further hindered from\nadopting the required resolution, my country will have\nno choice but to resort to this august Assembly so it\ncould take the necessary measures to vindicate us vis-\n\u2021-vis one State that refuses to lift the sanctions, a State\nthat was behind the imposition of these sanctions in the\nfirst place."

        "file_text": "Brazil applauds your\nelection, Sir, to preside over the fifty-fifth session of\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations. Your\npersonal political experience and Finland's historic\ncontribution to the promotion of peace, human rights\nand social development are valuable credentials that\nyou bring to the honoured task of chairing our work.\nOn behalf of the Brazilian Government, I pay\ntribute to your predecessor, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben\nGurirab. His diplomatic skills and commitments to the\nhighest ideals of the United Nations insured him a\ndecisive role at the helm of the fifty-fourth session.\nI wish to make a very special reference to our\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. His moral authority\nhas served as a beacon as we strive to fulfil the\nprinciples and goals of the United Nations. His report,\n\u201cWe the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century\u201d, is a contribution of fundamental\nimportance to the cause of peace and justice, and to a\nstronger United Nations. It will serve as a permanent\nsource of inspiration as we ponder the crucial decisions\nthe Organization is called upon to make.\nBrazil had the satisfaction to co-sponsor the\nresolution bringing Tuvalu into the United Nations\nfamily. We salute Tuvalu as our newest member.\nFor the sixth consecutive time it is my honour to\ntake part in the opening of the general debate. On all\nprevious occasions, I took stock both of the positive\nand negative aspects of the current state of world\naffairs, the facts that afford us satisfaction and those\nthat are cause for frustration and even indignation. This\nis our daily challenge and the motivating force behind\nour work.\nWe meet here for the last time this century. We all\nknow that the twentieth century has been marred by a\nfundamental contradiction. We have seen a growing\nabundance of intellectual and material resources that\nshould have brought about a greater convergence of\nopportunities and expectations as well as of living\nstandards throughout the world. Yet, what we also saw\nwas a failure to harness the necessary political will to\ntranslate those extraordinary possibilities into a reality\nof progress shared by all. This applies not only to the\ninternational community as a whole but is equally valid\nfor the great majority of nations represented here,\namong which is Brazil itself.\nNo doubt, we have much to gain in identifying\nthose aspects of our relations with the international\nenvironment that are a hindrance to national\ndevelopment. Yet it is equally illuminating to seek\nwithin our own countries examples of success and\nfailure that help explain the world we live in.\nGlobalization is asymmetrical in part because it flows\nfrom national societies that are themselves socially\nunbalanced and seem to have lost some of their urge to\nbring about social justice.\nFreedom \u2014 the greatest of values \u2014 continues to\nadvance on all fronts and in all continents. That is a\ncrucial development. There is cause for concern,\nhowever, that the core values of equality and fraternity\nare dangerously being put aside. It is imperative that\nthese two other essential elements return to the top of\nour agenda. They must retake their rightful place at the\ncentre of our policy decisions before it is too late \u2014\nbefore some are misled into believing that the\ninevitable price for preserving freedom is the\nperpetuation of the divide between the rich and the\npoor, between those who are included and those who\nsuffer exclusion, between the \u201cglobalized\u201d and those\nleft behind.\nIf democracy and freedom are to put down firm\nroots within our countries, we must foster a genuine\nsense of solidarity that translates into effective action.\nOnly thus will we build an international order that is\nconducive to the preservation of peace and can\nfunction as an engine of sustained growth. It is\nunacceptable that major global issues and campaigns\nfor transnational solidarity be manipulated and\nexploited in order to disguise what amounts to the\nprotection of narrow interests. Unfortunately, this is\nwhat is happening in the field of international trade.\nFirst, the inconsistency between free trade\nrhetoric and the continued use of protectionist policies\nof various types by developed countries. As I stated at\nthe World Trade Organization conference in Seattle, the\nname of this game is discrimination. And\ndiscrimination, especially when waged against the\nweakest, is the absolute negation of solidarity. We must\n5\n\nreverse these grave distortions in international trade,\nand especially as concerns agricultural products.\nIt is inadmissible that the most prosperous\nnations, whose economies are strongly based in the\nmanufacturing and service industries, should be legally\nentitled to restrict access to their markets for\nagricultural goods, while they call for the free flow of\nthose goods in which they benefit from an enormous\ncompetitive advantage. It is even more intolerable that\nthese countries be allowed, as is presently the case, to\nsubsidize the production and export of agricultural\ncommodities to the tune of dozens of billions of\ndollars. These policies cause enormous harm to\nexporting nations that are more efficient and\ncompetitive in this field, but lack the financial means\nto offer equally generous fiscal incentives to their\nfarmers.\nSecondly, not satisfied with the persistence of this\nhighly discriminatory situation \u2014 where what is said\noften deviates from what is done \u2014 there are those in\nthe developed countries who give voice to sectional\ninterests and defend a new offensive against the\nexports of developing nations. This is what the new\nlanguage of protectionism, camouflaged as\nhumanitarian internationalism, would seem to suggest.\nIt unfurls the seductive banner of labour and\nenvironmental standards, which, if adopted, would\nfurther restrict the access of products from developing\ncountries to the markets of rich countries.\nThis rhetoric and its appeal to certain segments of\npublic opinion might suggest that the exports of\ndeveloping countries pose a threat to the economic\nwell-being and the way of life of the more developed\nsocieties. We all know this is not true. After all, these\nexports represent less than a third of world trade and\nare made up mostly of raw materials.\nThe main objective of those who wish to\nintroduce labour conditionalities into trade rules has\nlittle to do with improving the quality of life of\nworkers in poor countries. Their fundamental aim is to\nprotect backward sectors of their own economies that\nstrictly speaking are no longer capable of competing\neffectively in a free trade environment.\nSanctions and commercial barriers are inadequate\ntools to enhance labour standards and to protect the\nenvironment in developing countries. Our countries\nand our own societies, more than any other, are\ninterested in achieving those very same objectives,\nwhich is why we need more \u2014 not less \u2014 exports and\neconomic growth.\nThis is a message that developing countries must\nmake ring out in a clear and powerful voice. We must\ninstil in developed societies an understanding that they\nare not alone in the world. Above all, they must not\npresume to unilaterally write the rules of international\ntrade solely according to their interests and points of\nview, as if the other 5 billion human beings did not\nhave equally legitimate aspirations to progress, justice\nand well-being.\nNations must come increasingly to comprehend\nand respect differing realities and objectives among\nthemselves. At the same time, they must recognize\ntheir commonalties and affinities; explore and enlarge\nareas of convergence and opportunities for cooperation;\nand overcome suspicions, rivalries and disputes.\nNowadays it is above all through regional\nintegration that this learning process takes place. For\nmost countries, it opens the door to a more intensive\nand meaningful participation in global affairs.\nIn the Americas, and more specifically in Latin\nAmerica, we have set ourselves firmly on this course.\nThe countries of the region are increasingly integrated\namong themselves and into the world. These are the\ntwo inseparable faces of the same forward movement.\nA few days ago in Brasilia, on the initiative of\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a meeting of\nPresidents of South America took place for the first\ntime in our history. This gathering sought to bring\ntogether the leaders of South America around the\ncommon challenges that grow out of our shared\ngeography and physical proximity. It is only natural\nthat this first meeting should have occurred in Brazil,\nwhich shares borders with nine of its 11 South\nAmerican neighbours, and has lived in harmony with\nall for over a century in a spirit of peace, friendship\nand growing determination to move ahead on the road\nto full integration.\nThe Presidents took important and concrete steps\nin this direction that will bear lasting fruit. In the\npolitical realm, they agreed to underscore the\ncommitment of the countries of South America to\ndemocracy and decided that participation in future\nSouth American gatherings would hinge on the\npreservation of the rule of law and full respect for\ndemocratic values and procedures. They also agreed to\n6\n\nhold consultations among their Governments in the\nevent of a threat to democracy in our region.\nIn trade matters, they resolved to begin\nnegotiations on a free-trade zone between\nMERCOSUR and the Andean Community, to be\nestablished before January 2002 and to be expanded\ninto an economic zone covering all of South America,\nincluding Chile, Guyana and Suriname. To this end the\nPresidents decided to coordinate the planning and\nfunding of projects for integrating the region's\ninfrastructure, in particular in the priority areas of\nenergy, transport and telecommunications. By working\ntogether in this way we will more quickly set up the\nphysical links that will enhance South American unity.\nDrug trafficking and organized crime are issues\nthat affect, in different forms, all regions of the world.\nThe Presidents highlighted the role of the Organization\nof American States in the fight against drugs in the\nhemisphere and the setting up last year of the\nmultilateral evaluation mechanism to assess the\nperformance of our countries in this effort. They also\ndecided to establish systematic consultations among\nnational agencies and to set up a South American anti-\nlaundering task force.\nThe meeting of Presidents of South America was\nan event unique in the almost two centuries of\nindependent nationhood for most of the subcontinent.\nAs well as having historic significance and long-term\nimpact, this summit will also generate results in the\nimmediate future.\nNone is more significant than the commitment to\ndemocratic values. President Fernando Henrique\nCardoso was very much to the point when he said:\n\u201cthe South America of today is synonymous with\ndemocracy ... In this dawning of democracy, we\nwill not tolerate abuses. And we will increasingly\ndemand the right not only to vote, but to defend\nfreedom, access to information and the judicial\nguarantees that make elections an effective\nexercise in democracy\u201d.\nThe United Nations has seen important\nachievements over this last year. Let me recall a few.\nThe goal of creating a more just, tolerant society was\nreaffirmed during the follow-up world conferences on\nwomen \u2014 Beijing +5 \u2014 and on social development \u2014\nCopenhagen +5. At the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nreview conference, modest but nevertheless significant\nprogress was made towards freeing the world from the\nscourge of nuclear arms. As one of the New Agenda\ncountries, Brazil is proud of its contribution to the\nsuccess of the conference, whose results will be a\nlitmus test for future advances in the nuclear\ndisarmament field.\nEfforts to establish an International Criminal\nCourt have moved ahead, and Brazil signed the Rome\nStatute. Those that commit crimes against humanity\nmust not, under any circumstances, go unpunished.\nIn the Brahimi report (A/55/305), a valuable\nframework has been laid out on how to strengthen the\nwork of United Nations peacekeeping operations and,\nas a result, on how to overcome recent failures. The\ncourageous Rwanda and Srebrenica reports offer us a\nprecise diagnosis of what needs to be done.\nIn Timor, under the leadership of a model\ninternational official, Sergio Vieira de Mello, a new\nState is taking form and coming to life. We express our\nstrongest condemnation of the attack on innocent\nworkers at the United Nations office in Atambua, West\nTimor, who were helping to achieve this very goal.\nIn contrast with these achievements, the\nfrustrations are well known. Peacekeeping operations\nin Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo have still to show results; the conflict in Angola\ngoes relentlessly on as a result of UNITA's inexcusable\nfailure to comply with international directives and law;\nand there is growing awareness of the devastating\ndimensions of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and in the\nrest of the world.\nLess than a week ago, in a historic meeting in this\nvery Hall, world leaders took stock of the work and\nachievements of multilateralism. The outcome was a\nclearer reaffirmation of our determined and\nunequivocal commitment to reinvigorate the United\nNations. We reinforced our convictions about the\ncrucial role of this Organization in ensuring that justice\nis done and that international peace takes root.\nBrazil has always been convinced of this.\nIn the absence of the United Nations, human\nrights would be more vulnerable; the distance between\nantagonists would be wider; the difficulties in\neradicating poverty would be greater; the growth of\ntolerance would be slower and democratic practices\nwould face even stronger opposition.\n7\n\nIt may be that the Millennium Summit only gave\nexpression to what we already knew. The historic\nlegacy of this Summit should, then, be our renewed\nwillingness to act.\nWe all know that it is by mobilizing political will\nthat we can make a difference. The United Nations is\nthe model political forum of the international\ncommunity and its central goal is to provide the ways\nand means to bring to life our dearest ideals, values and\naspirations.\nIn this hall there has often been a divorce\nbetween words and deeds, between objectives and the\ntools to achieve them, as if they hailed from different\nuniverses, distant and isolated from each other.\nIt is only through political dialogue, and\nconsultation among States made possible by\nmultilateralism that a degree of rationality and\npredictability can be brought to the workings of global\nforces.\nTo foster multilateralism is to strengthen the\nUnited Nations and the modern understanding of the\nindividual as the central beneficiary of international\naction. Only thus can we look forward to progressive\nand just governance in this integrated world.\nIt is our obligation to fulfil our common\ncommitments, so vigorously underscored during the\nMillennium Summit. We must do so with determination\nand a sense of urgency."

        "file_text": "Allow me at\nthe outset to join previous speakers in congratulating\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the\nMillennium Assembly of the United Nations. Allow me\nalso to express my confidence that under your skilful\nstewardship this session of the General Assembly will\nsuccessfully accomplish its mandate. I also wish to\ncommend our outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, for his eminent leadership during the previous\nsession of the Assembly.\nMy delegation extends its warm welcome to the\nGovernment and the people of Tuvalu, whose\nmembership has brought the United Nations yet\nanother step closer to universality.\nThis session of the General Assembly is entrusted\nwith the honourable mission of following up on what\nwas agreed by the Millennium Summit of world\nleaders. For me personally, this session is also very\nspecial. For 26 years, or most of my diplomatic career,\nI have been associated with the United Nations. I feel\nparticularly privileged to deliver as Foreign Minister a\npolicy statement of my Government from this rostrum.\nA few days ago, Member States reaffirmed at the\nhighest level their commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, their\nunequivocal support for a more efficient and\nreinvigorated United Nations and their firm resolve to\ncollectively work towards a healthier and cleaner\nworld, free from fear and free from want. The\nMillennium Declaration underscored the collective\nresponsibility of world leaders to uphold the principles\nof human dignity, equality and equity at the global\nlevel.\nThat sense of solidarity and shared responsibility\nis, in our view, crucial for the international community\nto be able to address effectively the formidable\nchallenges at the dawn of the new millennium. The\nchallenges the world faces today are indeed manifold\nand complex, both in scope and nature. The central\nchallenge, as identified in the Secretary-General's\nmillennium report, is how to make globalization more\ninclusive and have its benefits equitably enjoyed by all\nnations.\n4\n\nAs recently as the mid-1980s, the notion of\nglobality was virtually unknown in the international\nvocabulary, let alone the concepts of global governance\nor global climate change. Yet just a little more than a\ndecade later, not only does the idea of globality blend\nwith our day-to-day life, globalization per se has turned\ninto a powerful and inevitable process. Globalization\nhas been generously showered lately with both praise\nand criticism. Along with greater opportunities, it can\nalso lead to situations of heightened insecurity,\nespecially for the weak and poor nations. As my\nPresident, Natsagiyn Bagabandi, noted in his\nMillennium address,\n\u201cMongolia believes that, with its impartiality and\nuniversal legitimacy, as well as its Charter-based\nprevalence over any other international\nagreement, the United Nations is uniquely placed\nto provide an overarching general guidance to the\nprocess of globalization \u2026 so that it incorporates\nthe human dimension in its seemingly unruly\ntrends\u201d. (A/55/PV.4)\nAs we draw lessons from the 1997-1998 Asian\nfinancial crisis, it has become more evident that the\nprocess of globalization ought to be managed so as to\nmake the best of its opportunities and diminish its\nnegative effects; and that internal policies, no matter\nhow righteous, are not sufficient to ensure sustained\neconomic growth in this era of growing\ninterdependence. This is even more true for\ndeveloping, structurally disadvantaged countries. In a\nglobally liberalized trade and financial system, these\ncountries need to be assisted to withstand powerful\nexternal forces, which so often are utterly destructive.\nAgain, this necessitates a genuine display of solidarity\nand shared responsibility on the part of the\ninternational community.\nThe global fight against abject poverty, inequality\nand disparity, violence, HIV/AIDS, organized crime\nand other acute problems is being impeded by, inter\nalia, the increasing external debt burden, the decline in\nofficial development assistance and the growing digital\nand development divides between haves and have-nots.\nThe affluent countries could exhibit their solidarity and\nshared responsibility by further opening their markets,\nproviding deeper and faster debt relief, and giving\nmore and better-focused development assistance and\nincentives for foreign direct investment flows to their\nless fortunate partners. In this context, Mongolia looks\nto the upcoming high-level international conference on\nfinancing for development, the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, and the\nnew multilateral trade negotiations to produce specific,\ntime-bound commitments.\nMongolia welcomes the South Summit\nDeclaration and the Havana Programme of Action as\nwell as the outcome of the meeting between the G-77\nand the G-8 in Okinawa as important junctures\nproviding an inspiring vision for more action-oriented\nSouth-South cooperation and a meaningful North-\nSouth partnership.\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\ndecisions adopted at the tenth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), which underscored the necessity of\ncreating a legal environment that would facilitate\ntransit traffic for landlocked developing countries,\nimprove transit infrastructure and increase efficiency of\ntrade by eliminating transport and bureaucratic\nbottlenecks. Here, I am pleased to announce that a first\nspecific step to enhance and facilitate multilateral\ntransit transport cooperation is being taken in the\nNorth-East Asian region. As a result of a tripartite\nmeeting held in Ulan Bator under the auspices of\nUNCTAD earlier this year, Mongolia, Russia and\nChina have agreed to conclude a transit traffic\nframework agreement. Negotiations to draft such an\nagreement are under way.\nMy delegation further believes that the upcoming\nfifth meeting of governmental experts from landlocked\nand transit developing countries and representatives of\ndonor countries and financial development institutions,\nas well as a ministerial meeting on transit transport\nissues, expected to be held in 2003, will play a critical\nrole in strengthening a common framework of action to\nease the burden faced by landlocked developing\ncountries.\nWe support the proposals put forward in the\nmillennium report by the Secretary-General on\nimproving the provision of health services and\ncommunications in areas stricken by natural disasters.\nAs some might be aware, heavy snowstorms and the\nextremely cold winter of 1999-2000 in Mongolia\ncaused the loss of nearly 3 million heads of livestock,\nor about 10 per cent of the nation's entire livestock\npopulation. Besides the direct loss of livestock, these\nheavy winter conditions, known as dzud, had other\ngravely devastating economic and social consequences,\n5\n\nincluding the loss of precious human lives. I would like\nto take this opportunity to express, on behalf of my\nGovernment and the people of Mongolia, our sincere\ngratitude to those Governments, international\norganizations and individuals that rendered timely\nassistance and support in our efforts to overcome the\nconsequences of dzud.\nAs world leaders solemnly reaffirmed in their\nMillennium Declaration,\n\u201cthe United Nations is the indispensable\ncommon house of the entire human family,\nthrough which we will seek to realize our\nuniversal aspirations for peace, cooperation and\ndevelopment.\u201d(A/RES/55/2, para. 32)\nIf the United Nations is to adequately respond to\nthe challenges of today's increasingly interdependent\nand rapidly changing world, a great deal will depend\non its ability to adapt itself to an environment that is\nmarkedly different from the one in which it was\nconceived by its founders 55 years ago.\nThe demands on the Organization have increased\nmany times over, especially in the area of\npeacekeeping. The lessons of Srebrenica, Rwanda and\nSierra Leone have made it abundantly clear that a\nthorough and critical review is needed to make\npeacekeeping operations succeed in meeting our\ncommitment under the Charter. We are deeply indebted\nto the United Nations Panel on Peace Operations,\nchaired by Ambassador Brahimi, which, in its report,\npresented a frank analysis of the prevailing situation\nand forthright recommendations for change. The report\ndeserves serious consideration and specific action at\nthis session of the General Assembly.\nMongolia stands committed to making a practical\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. As part of its efforts to adequately equip its\nmilitary officers and units for participation therein,\nMongolia took part for the first time in recent training\nexercises held in Kazakhstan for Central Asian\ncountries.\nEfforts to reform the Security Council have not\nyet brought us closer to resolving some of the\nfundamental issues on the agenda of the Open-ended\nWorking Group on that question. Like many others, we\ncontinue to believe that the expansion of the Security\nCouncil should take place made in both categories,\npermanent and non-permanent. In the former category,\nalong with major industrialized Powers such as Japan\nand Germany, developing countries from Asia, Africa\nand Latin America that are able to contribute to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security should\noccupy their rightful place in the Council. A reasonable\nincrease in the number of non-permanent seats would\nreflect the representative character of the Council and\nenable a growing number of Member States to\ncontribute to its work. An essential part of the reform\nprocess should deal with the veto power, the use of\nwhich should be considerably curtailed.\nMongolias vision of the future of the United\nNations has been elaborated in the memorandum of its\nGovernment on enhancing the role of the United\nNations in promoting the security interests of small\nStates, circulated in the United Nations as document\nA/55/310.\nNorth-East Asia is a region where the interests of\nthe big and powerful intersect, where the leftovers of\nthe cold-war era are still discernible, and where\nterritorial disputes await a positive solution.\nNonetheless, groundbreaking developments are taking\nplace which give rise to optimism and hope. I have in\nmind the historic inter-Korean summit, which has\nplayed a crucial role for building trust and confidence\nbetween the two countries. This and other recent\ndevelopments may well have a positive impact on the\nsituation in North-East Asia as a whole.\nDue to its historical and geopolitical realities,\nNorth-East Asia is probably the only subregion that\nlacks a mechanism at the governmental level where\nsecurity issues of concern can be discussed\ncollectively. Various ideas and proposals to this effect\nhave been floating around for some time, but no\nserious discussion of this issue has taken place so far at\nthe track one level. The time may have come to start\nthinking about the possibility of engaging in a\ndialogue, starting with a free exchange of views on the\nframework of these discussions.\nAs we review the progress made in the area of\narms limitation, disarmament and non-proliferation,\nour reaction can at best be termed as mixed. While\nthere has been some movement forward in certain\nareas, there has been little or no progress in others.\nThe 2000 Review Conference of the States\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) included in its Final\nDocument a number of agreed conclusions and\n6\n\nrecommendations related to nuclear disarmament. For\nthe first time ever, with reference to article VI, all the\nnuclear-weapon States made\n\u201can unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the\ntotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading\nto total nuclear disarmament to which all States\nparties are committed under article VI\u201d.\n(NPT/CONF.2000/28, part I, p. 14, para. 15 (6))\nThe Conference also agreed on the need to\nestablish in the Conference on Disarmament an\nappropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to deal\nwith nuclear disarmament. It called for the immediate\nestablishment of such a body. The Conference also\ncalled for further efforts by the nuclear-weapon States\nto reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally and for\nfurther reductions of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\nbased on unilateral initiatives as an integral part of the\nnuclear disarmament process. A call has been made for\nthe engagement, as soon as appropriate, of all the\nnuclear-weapon States in a process leading to the total\nelimination of their nuclear arsenal. These elements\nconstitute an important statement of purpose and, if\ntranslated into practice, will open the way to practical\nnuclear disarmament measures.\nMongolia welcomes the ratification by the\nRussian Federation of the Comprehensive Test Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) and START II treaties, and we look\nforward to the United States' ratification of the CTBT\nat an early date. We urge the Russian Federation and\nthe United States to follow up on their earlier\nannouncement regarding the discussions on the\nSTART III Treaty.\nMongolia joins the international appeal to the key\nStates to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban\nTreaty so that it could be brought into force as soon as\npossible. The urgency of this call becomes even more\ncompelling in light of the activities that could seriously\nundermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nMy delegation also believes that it is important\nfor the Conference on Disarmament, which for several\nyears has been unable to agree on a programme of\nwork, to end its stalemate and to engage in earnest\nnegotiations on an early conclusion of a universal and\nverifiable fissile materials cut-off treaty. Pending the\nnegotiation of that treaty, we would welcome a\nmoratorium by the nuclear-weapon-States on the\nproduction of weapons-grade fissile materials and for\ngreater transparency through disclosure of their present\nstocks. Better still, we would urge the United Nations\nto establish a register for all stocks of weapons-grade\nfissile material. This would help establish an important\nbalance with the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms.\nWe welcome the decision taken by the United\nStates to postpone the deployment of a national missile\ndefence system. The undermining of the Anti-Ballistic\nMissile (ABM) Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic\nstability, could trigger an uncontrollable nuclear arms\nrace.\nThe growing emphasis placed of late on nuclear\nweapons in military doctrines is a cause of increasing\nconcern. It is, therefore, only natural that countries like\nMongolia favour the adoption of such steps as de-\nalerting of nuclear weapons, removal of nuclear\nwarheads from delivery vehicles and joint undertakings\nby the nuclear-weapon powers of a pledge not to be the\nfirst to use nuclear weapons. These are essential safety\nmeasures that would reduce the risk of unauthorized or\nmiscalculated use of nuclear weapons. In addition,\nprovision should be made for legally binding negative\nsecurity assurances to non-nuclear States Parties to the\nNPT, as has become customary for nuclear-weapon\nStates in signing Protocols to nuclear-weapon-free\nzone treaties. In this context, Mongolia welcomes the\nSecretary-General's proposal to convene a major\ninternational conference aimed at identifying ways of\neliminating nuclear dangers. We hope that this timely\nproposal will be given serious consideration at this\nsession of the General Assembly, followed by the\nadoption of a relevant resolution to this effect.\nMongolia shares the legitimate concern of the\nworld community over the global proliferation of small\narms and light weapons, which are the principal\ninstruments of death wherever conflicts and wars\noccur. We hope that the United Nations Conference on\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nAll Its Aspects, scheduled for 2001, will result in\npractical measures designed to tighten control, curb the\nspread and destroy surplus weapons.\nAs is known, in 1992 Mongolia declared its\nterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone; this was widely\nsupported by the international community. Since then\nwe have come a long way. At its fifty-third session the\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 53/77 D entitled\n\u201cMongolia's international security and nuclear-\nweapon-free status\u201d. As a follow-up to its declaration,\n7\n\nthe Mongolian Parliament adopted a law last February\non Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status, thus\ninstitutionalizing it at the national level. At this\nsession, we expect a joint statement by the nuclear-\nweapon States to provide security assurances to\nMongolia in connection with its nuclear-weapon-free\nstatus, which would represent an important step along\nthe road to institutionalizing that status at the\ninternational level. I wish to put on record my\nGovernment's appreciation to the five Permanent\nMembers for their constructive cooperation and\nsupport.\nWe believe that the aforementioned security\nassurances would be more credible if Mongolia's other\nexternal security issues were duly addressed. In that\ncase, not only would the status be more credible; but it\nwould also allow Mongolia to serve as a positive factor\nof stability and predictability in the region. In this\nconnection, we certainly share the view of the\nSecretary-General, expressed in his report on this item,\nthat consultations with the relevant United Nations\nbodies will produce concrete and action-oriented\napproaches to addressing the non-nuclear aspects of\nsecurity.\nIn line with the broader approach to security, and\non the basis of relevant provisions of the\naforementioned resolution, the International\nConference on Human Security in a Globalized World,\nin the context of Mongolia, was held this year with the\nparticipation of the United Nations and international\nexperts; it produced detailed recommendations on a\nwide range of human security-related areas. In many\nrespects, the recommendations of our Conference\nparallel the spirit and concepts of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nIn July of this year parliamentary elections were\nheld in Mongolia, the fourth elections since the onset\nof democratic reforms a decade ago. The elections\nwere recognized as free and fair by all political forces,\nas well as by international observers, and served as a\ntestimony of further consolidation of democratic norms\nand institutions in my country. They proved once again\nthat the embrace of democracy and respect for human\nrights are an irreversible choice made by the\nMongolian people. As a result of the elections, the\nMongolian People's Revolutionary Party won an\noverwhelming majority of seats in the Parliament.\nFrom this high rostrum, I wish to reiterate my\nGovernment's robust commitment to the consolidation\nof democracy and the continuity of reforms. The task\nof ensuring human security and promoting human-\ncentred development is high on the agenda of the new\nGovernment, as envisaged in its action programme.\nThe Government is resolved to ensure sustained\neconomic growth through reinvigorating and\nencouraging the development of domestic industry,\nupgrading the living standards of the people by\nreducing poverty and unemployment and ensuring\nequitable social and educational opportunities.\nThe Government of Mongolia will intensify the\nstructural reforms and encourage an export-oriented,\nprivate sector-led economy. Mining, the processing of\nraw materials of animal origin, tourism and other\nexport-oriented sectors are the priority areas of\ndevelopment. The privatization of State assets,\nincluding the most valued State enterprises, will\ncontinue. The creation of a favourable environment for\nthe attraction of foreign investment is also a priority\nobjective.\nI fully share the view expressed in the\nMillennium Report that success depends to a\nconsiderable degree on the quality of governance the\ncountry enjoys. Hence, my Government attaches\nparticular importance to enhancing the effectiveness,\ntransparency and accountability of public offices and\nfighting corruption in both corporate and public areas.\nThe Government of Mongolia is determined to\ncooperate closely with non-governmental organizations\nand other representatives of civil society in enhancing\nthe rule of law throughout the country.\nIn its endeavours to carry out simultaneous\neconomic and political reforms, Mongolia is\nencountering a multitude of challenges. The eighth\nmeeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group will be held\nlater this year in Paris, and my Government is\nconfident that our foreign partners will continue to\nextend their generous support and cooperation so as to\nease the transition challenges faced by my country.\nIn pursuing its foreign policy, based on the\ncontinuity of a multi-pillar, open and proactive\napproach, Mongolia will continue to develop and\nexpand its friendly relations with the Russian\nFederation and the People's Republic of China on the\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness, mutual benefit and\nequality. My Government will accord high importance\nto the further development of bilateral relations with\nthe industrialized nations, including the United States\n8\n\nof America, Japan, other Asian and Pacific countries\nand members of the European Union. Their political,\nmoral and financial support will continue to play an\nimportant role in facilitating our reform efforts. The\nMongolian Government will actively strive to\nstrengthen our traditional long-standing relations with\nEastern and Central European countries, as well as with\nthe developing countries of Asia and the Pacific, Latin\nAmerica and Africa.\nMongolia will continue its active participation in\nmultilateral processes and international organizations,\nsuch as the United Nations, and will spare no effort to\nensure that the world Organization remains a focal\npoint for the coordination of the efforts of the\ncommunity of nations towards peace and development\nin the years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend to you,\nMr. President, my sincere congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\nthe General Assembly, the Millennium Assembly. We\nare confident that your expertise and knowledge of\ninternational issues are an outstanding asset that will\nenrich the deliberations of this session and help the\nAssembly reach a successful conclusion. We assure\nyou of our readiness to cooperate with you in fulfilling\nthe objectives to which we all aspire.\nI wish to extend our gratitude and appreciation to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the friendly Republic of Namibia,\nfor the successful manner in which he steered the work\nof the previous session. That session was marked by a\ngenuine desire to enhance and reinvigorate the work of\nthe General Assembly.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nexpress our warmest appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for his\nstrenuous efforts and commendable endeavours to\npromote the role of the United Nations and the\ndevelopment of its organs, in order to cope with\nexpectations attached to the Organization in the third\nmillennium.\nThe Sultanate of Oman welcomes the accession\nof the Republic of Tuvalu to United Nations\nmembership. We hope that its membership will enrich\nthe efforts of the international community to reach the\nnoble goals of this important international forum in a\nmanner that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of all\npeoples of the world.\nOur heads of State and Government have already\ndescribed our main concerns and preoccupations during\n18\n\nthe Millennium Summit. They perceptively identified a\nnumber of lofty values and principles that will guide\npresent and future generations towards secure and\nstable living conditions based on cooperation and\npeace. If this goal is to be achieved, we must remain\nfully committed to it.\nWe bid farewell to a century, the memory of\nwhich includes a host of calamities and human\nsuffering, due to both natural and man-made causes.\nThat century was also marked by many bold and\nvisionary initiatives that greatly benefited humanity.\nThis stage of the third millennium is\ncharacterized by great technological progress that has\nopened vast horizons for development and prosperity.\nYet the emerging international order, commonly called\nglobalization, has created and increased economic,\nsocial and political disparities at both the international\nand national levels. Globalization presents many\nconcerns and challenges to developing countries,\nsometimes with unpredictable results. This is a real\nhindrance to the growth and progress of developing\ncountries, limiting the effectiveness of their economic\nintegration into a globalized economy.\nWe in the Sultanate of Oman support\nglobalization. However, present indications and\napproaches, stemming from the World Trade\nOrganization, point toward wealthy countries banding\ntogether with the aim of using that Organization as a\ntool to advance their own interests, to open the markets\nof developing countries for their own trade and to\ndeplete natural resources of developing countries,\nregardless of any negative economic and social impact.\nOne of the most important factors that led to the\nfailure of the Seattle Conference to achieve its\nexpected conclusions was the aggregation of about 20\ncountries within the Organization attempting to impose\ntheir philosophies on the entire world. This conduct is\nbased on an old doctrine of discriminatory policies and\nselectivity, which insinuates the presence of hidden\ndisputes among various countries. If the World Trade\nOrganization were to be transformed into a wrestling\narena, globalization and free trade would not then be\nable to meet the needs of developing countries.\nFurthermore, if developing countries are to\nsurvive and to uphold the basic rights of their citizens,\nthey must obtain their fair share of the fruits of\nglobalization. It is necessary to enact laws and\nregulations and to honour agreements in an equal\nmanner that applies to all, because the dominance of\nminority law contradicts the principles of good\ngovernance. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to\ndevise new measures to assure the utilization of ever-\ngrowing technological progress so as to achieve\nprosperity and development for all.\nThe international economy continues to prosper\nafter the setback of the 1997-1998 recession, following\nthe economic crash of emerging markets. We need to\nredouble our efforts in order to avoid recurrence of\nthis. When the G-8 countries met in Okinawa, Japan,\nthey were obliged to consider the problems of the\ndeveloping countries. The financial assistance offered\nby the G-8 was itself vivid proof that advanced\ninformation technologies are designed in such a\nmanner that they can be monopolized by some and not\naccessed by others, except with great difficulty and at\ncolossal cost. However, we still welcome some of the\ndecisions of the Okinawa Summit, particularly the\nfinancial assistance pledged to combat certain\ndebilitating diseases.\nThe decision of the G-8 to invite the Group of 77,\nfor the first time, to its deliberations was not merely a\nceremonial event. It made the vast disparity that exists\nbetween developed and developing countries all the\nmore tangible. The Okinawa Summit addressed the\nproblem of debt, which we believe should be totally\nabolished, and reviewed the policies of the\nInternational Monetary Fund and international financial\nmechanisms. Among those policies, the fluctuation of\ninternational currencies in particular has created\ndifficult economic conditions for developed countries,\nlet alone for countries with small economies that have\nto trade their resources for hard currency.\nThe stumble of the Asian economies occurred\nbecause of the power of the free market, and largely\nbecause of currency instability. The prosperity\nachieved by the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) during decades of dedicated work\nevaporated. Developing countries therefore have every\nright to take all necessary precautions against the\nrecurrence of a similar situation.\nTogether with a number of other countries, the\nSultanate of Oman has played a constructive role in\nestablishing and launching the Indian Ocean Rim\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. It has done so\nbecause the countries of the Indian Ocean possess\nnatural resources and enjoy a geographic location\n19\n\nbetween three continents and because it is convinced of\nthe importance of that region as a vital economic vein\nfor all its member States and their peoples. The\nlaunching of this new Association to join the many\nregional economic groupings that exist in the world\ntoday is a manifestation of the firm desire of its\nmember States to promote such a grouping, which\nenjoys huge potential and looks forward to creating a\nhuge market.\nBased on my country's belief in the importance of\nregional cooperation as a means to propel the wheels of\ndevelopment and exchange expertise in different fields,\nwe are working on an agreement to establish a regional\ncooperation group for fisheries in the Indian Ocean. We\nhope that that initiative will soon see the light of day,\nthereby bringing about many benefits in the service of\nregional stability and development. In this context, we\nlook forward to a pragmatic translation of the\nobjectives of the General Assembly Declaration of the\nIndian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\nSince the dawn of the Omani renaissance, on 23\nJuly 1970, we in the Sultanate of Oman have embraced\npeace and dialogue as basic principles. We are\nconvinced that dialogue is the natural foundation upon\nwhich all forms of conflict between States and peoples\ncan be resolved. Throughout history, mankind has\naspired to enhance confidence on the basis of agreed\ncreative ideas that deepen and widen common interests\nand mutual benefits. We believe that dialogue, rather\nthan conflict and confrontation, will always remain the\nsurest path to security and stability.\nThe tripartite Camp David summit on the peace\nprocess in the Middle East was an extremely\nsignificant political step and a display of unique\ncourage by the summit participants. The summit\nimposed upon itself the task of discussing and\nnegotiating the fundamental issues of a final settlement\nin an unprecedented and distinguished manner,\nparticularly with regard to the future of Al-Quds Al-\nSharif. We express our admiration for, and appreciation\nof, the historic role and great efforts made by the\nPresident of the United States, Bill Clinton. Despite the\nfact that the summit did not produce a final agreement\nbetween Palestine and Israel, it nevertheless opened the\ndoor for dialogue on the most complex issues.\nSignificant progress has been achieved on those issues,\nand the summit established an important understanding\nof the true scope of peace and the spiritual and\nemotional sentiments attached to it. It is now vital to\nconclude an agreement that will lay the cornerstone for\nlasting peace.\nIn our view, there has been tangible and clear\nprogress regarding the positions and claims of each\nparty as well as their capability to complete the\nnegotiations. We are confident that the continuation of\nnegotiations and contacts between Palestinians and\nIsraelis, on all levels, is the proper and responsible way\nto reach the desired objective of establishing a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace. We look forward\nwith confidence to a second round of negotiations\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis, with the\ncontinued sponsorship of the United States. Time has\nbestowed upon all parties a historic opportunity to put\nin place a solid foundation for peace.\nWe reiterate our full support to the Palestinian\npeople and their rights to self-determination on their\nland and to establish an independent Palestinian State\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. In order to\nstrengthen the pillars of peace and security in the\nregion, there is no other sovereignty possible in Al-\nQuds Al-Sharif except that of the Palestinian State. We\nexpect the State of Israel to understand this fact, which\nmeans that the sovereignty of the State of Palestine\nover Al-Quds Al-Sharif would also allow Israelis full\nfreedom of access to worship and conduct their rituals\nin peace and security.\nWe strongly support the position of the sisterly\nSyrian Arab Republic concerning the restoration of its\nland to the line of 4 June 1967. We encourage Israel to\nresume negotiations on this important track in\naccordance with legitimate international principles and\nresolutions, particularly Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for\npeace. Israel should not feel exposed to security threats\nin the future because a peace founded on those\nprinciples, whether that peace be with Syria, Palestine\nor Lebanon, will build an effective relationship and\npartnership that will serve the purposes of security and\nstability. This, by itself, is one of the most important\nguarantees of mutual security and stability, especially\nif it is based on economic development within the\ncontext of globalization.\nDespite all serious international and regional\nefforts to alleviate the suffering of the brotherly people\nof Iraq, the overall situation in Iraq continues to\ndeteriorate as a result of the economic embargo\nimposed on that country over the last 10 years.\n20\n\nTherefore, we call for the establishment of a\nmechanism to end the siege and to lift the embargo that\nhas undoubtedly done great harm to the people of Iraq.\nDespite the fact that sanctions regime were\nintended as a political mechanism to guarantee that\nGovernments fulfil their commitments in accordance\nwith United Nations resolutions, that mechanism has\nnow become a weapon that harms the basic rights of\npeoples and societies. This clearly contradicts the letter\nand spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Accordingly, we call upon the Security Council\nto adopt new policies and effective mechanisms that\nwill relieve the suffering imposed on States such as\nIraq, Libya and the Sudan.\nThe Security Council, in accordance with its\nresponsibilities as enshrined in the Charter, should play\na positive and unifying role in the maintenance of\ninternational security and stability, with the aim of\ndeveloping new vision, for economic globalization.\nThe mechanisms available to the Security Council\nwith regard to Iraq are no longer positive tools. United\nNations inspectors have exerted substantial efforts to\neliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and have\ndestroyed such known weapons. This could represent\nsufficient grounds to review the situation once again\nand determine how to end this tragedy. New\nmechanisms could be established that would enable the\nSecurity Council to continue monitoring Iraq's\nimplementation of relevant United Nations resolutions\nonce economic sanctions have been lifted.\nWe do not believe that it is justifiable to punish a\npopulation simply on the basis of fear and suspicion.\nThe Security Council should protect the Iraqi people\nfrom the deterioration of their living conditions. The\nUnited Nations has a historic responsibility to\ncooperate with Iraq in order to minimize the intense\nsuffering that could befall the people of Iraq in future.\nWe look forward to Iraq's positive cooperation in\nclarifying the fate of the Kuwaitis who remain captive\ninside Iraq.\nWe deeply appreciate the efforts made by the\nSecretary-General in preparing his annual report. It is\nimportant to be willing to adopt a new vision for the\nrestructuring of the United Nations, in particular the\nSecurity Council, as its principal organ, whose primary\nresponsibility is the maintenance of international peace\nand security. We should consider the expansion of its\nmembership to promote equitable representation, and\nreassess United Nations activities in regions of conflict\nand tension, ensuring that there is no interference in\nStates' internal affairs.\nWe fear that the United Nations could become a\ndirect participant in regional conflicts, which would\nentail financial and moral obligations that it may not be\nable to fulfil.\nWe have in the past emphasized the need for\ninternational cooperation, which the United Nations\ncan foster in support of regional organizations to\nachieve peace and development.\nThe problems of the African continent are\nintensifying, and it is vital to uncover the causes of\nthese problems. It is incumbent upon the international\ncommunity to work together and redouble its efforts in\na positive and effective manner to resolve current\npolitical and social problems as well as ameliorate\ndeteriorating health conditions. The United Nations\nshould elaborate a solid plan in which all States would\nparticipate and contribute to the development of Africa\ninstead of fighting for control of its wealth.\nWe are facing real challenges, which we must be\nprepared to confront with courage if we are to focus on\nall aspects of development. We are in need of a new\ncentury and a new millennium marked by a sound\nbalance between material values and humankind's\nlegacy of ethical and spiritual values. We are in need of\na world in which the strong sympathize with the weak\nand help them out of their plight. We need a plan of\naction to increase the standard of living of all peoples\nthroughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me\ngreat pleasure to join preceding speakers in offering\nyou the Pakistan delegation's warm felicitations on\nyour election. We pledge to you our wholehearted\ncooperation in your efforts dedicated to the success of\nthis historic fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nleadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nHis commitment and dynamism have reinforced the\nrightful role of the United Nations in addressing the\nchallenges of our times.\nThe millennial transition is unique in the lives of\nthose fortunate to witness it. We are fortunate, too, that\nwe start this session in the glow of the Millennium\nSummit. We shall be inspired in our work by the\nringing commitment of our leaders to values and\nprinciples fundamental to the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity; by the resolve of our leaders to free peoples\nfrom the scourge of war, on the one hand, and to free\nhumanity from dehumanizing poverty, on the other.\nTheir determination to protect the environment,\npromote human rights, democracy and good\ngovernance, and to meet the special needs of Africa,\nwill be our guide and mandate in our deliberations.\nIt will be our duty at this and future sessions of\nthe General Assembly, to translate the Millennium\n13\n\nDeclaration into action. This is no doubt a difficult\nchallenge. But it is a challenge we must meet. Only\nthus can we contribute to the building of a future better\nthan the past.\nTo all these ends \u2014 at once necessary as well as\nnoble \u2014 our leaders pledged to spare no efforts to\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument of\ninternational cooperation.\nWhat is needed, if I may borrow an apt phrase\nfrom the Secretary General's report, is a stronger\ncommitment to action \u2014 action to achieve peace, and\naction to achieve development.\nEach of our States can and must take action on\nboth fronts. But individual efforts cannot achieve\noptimum results. All of us need to work with\ndedication and a strong sense of commitment in a\ncooperative and harmonious environment to promote\nthe twin objectives for a better future.\nThe Millennium Declaration emphasizes the\ndetermination of world leaders to save peoples from\nthe scourge of war. Also the Secretary General's report\nhighlights peace and security as:\n\u201ca central objective of the United Nations at the\ndawn of the twenty-first century, as it was when\nthe Organization was founded over half a century\nago\u201d. (A/55/1, para. 29)\nThe problem is how to prevent war and achieve\npeace. The solution is not difficult to find. What is\nneeded is a stronger commitment to action. Given that\ncommitment, crises and conflicts can be prevented and\npeace can be achieved. Peace not merely possible; it is\nrealizable through a civilized approach to conflict\nresolution based on justice and international law and\nthe principles of the Charter, the United Nations can\nensure effective remedial action to maintain peace and\nsecurity.\nPeople watched with relief as the world\ncommunity joined together to prevent genocide in\nBosnia and Kosovo. With the commendable\ncooperation of the Government of Indonesia and the\nimaginative contribution of the Secretary-General, we\napproached the situation in East Timor in a similar\nway. The imaginative and diligent efforts of the\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Ambassador\nJamsheed Marker, to promote the settlement in East\nTimor are a matter of pride for the people of Pakistan.\nThese are all examples of how the United Nations and\nthe international community can and should act to\naddress conflicts by implementing its principles and\ndecisions.\nIn the Middle East, too, the peace process has\nmade steady, if agonizingly slow, progress. For the\ngains so far made, tribute is due to the idealistic efforts\nof the peacemakers and the realistic approach of the\nPalestinian and Israeli leaders. The residual issues are\ndifficult and delicate, involving as they do principles of\nlaw and equity on the one hand, and deep emotions on\nthe other. Yet we ardently hope that the peace process\nwill succeed soon. Final settlement of the Palestinian\nquestion will be a crowning achievement and a\nmomentous contribution to peace in the Middle East.\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1977) are imbued with an\nirreplaceable international sanctity. Their\nimplementation involves the prestige and credibility of\nthe United Nations. An end to occupation and the\nreversion of holy Jerusalem to Palestinian sovereignty\nwill ensure reconciliation and durable peace in the\nMiddle East.\nThe Kashmir question, involving the life and\nfuture of the people of the State, has been the root\ncause of tensions in South Asia since 1947. Its\nsettlement is an indispensable condition for peace and\nstability. The ten million people of that State will not\nbe denied their right to freedom. They seek nothing\nmore than the fulfilment of the commitments contained\nin the resolutions of the Security Council. Their right\nto decide their own future cannot lapse. The passage of\n53 years has only compounded the tragedy of the\nKashmiri people and prolonged their travail. The long\ndelay has only heightened the terrible dangers inherent\nin the festering dispute.\nAccording to the All Parties Freedom\nConference, 72,000 Kashmiris have been killed since\n1989. Thousands more have been tortured and maimed\nor have disappeared. The massive human rights\nviolations in Kashmir, and the repression and brutality\nperpetrated on the Kashmiri people by occupation\nforces, are a grave crime of State terrorism.\nIn a desperate attempt to undermine and suppress\nthe Kashmiri Freedom Movement, the perpetrators of\nrepression and violence against the Kashmiri people\nhave tried to portray the freedom struggle as terrorism.\nSuch propaganda did not carry credibility in the past\nand it cannot do so now. It is familiar to all those who\n14\n\nhave won freedom after protracted struggles against\ncolonialism and foreign occupation.\nPakistan has consistently vowed to seek a\npeaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Two years\nago, the Security Council once again emphasized the\nneed to resolve the dispute, which has been the source\nof tension and conflict in the region. The provisions of\nArticle 33 of the Charter place an obligation on\nMember States to settle disputes through recourse to\nnegotiation, inquiry, conciliation, mediation, arbitration\nor adjudication. Each and every one of these means is\nacceptable to Pakistan. Faced with the intransigent\nrejection of peaceful means, the Security Council has a\nresponsibility to act. The Charter empowers the\nSecurity Council to do so. What is needed is a stronger\ncommitment to action. In its absence, mere talk of\ncrisis prevention and dispute resolution will lack\ncredibility.\nAfghanistan remains trapped in a terrible tragedy.\nIts protracted war of liberation in the 1980s left it\ndevastated. The internecine war in the 1990s has\ninflicted further ravages. The economy of the country\nis in shambles. Drought in southern Afghanistan this\npast year has added to the misery of the people of this\nancient land.\nTied to the Afghan people by bonds of geography,\nhistory and culture, the people of Pakistan view the\ntragedy in Afghanistan with a deep sense of sympathy.\nDespite economic stringency, we continue to provide\nshelter to 1.5 million Afghan refugees. The interruption\nof the food supply from, or via, Pakistan would further\naggravate hardship and trigger a fresh influx. That is\nwhy Pakistan is opposed to sanctions that hurt people.\nNo people except the Afghan people themselves\nhave suffered more from the conflict and instability in\nAfghanistan than the people of Pakistan. It is natural\ntherefore that Pakistan should support all efforts for\npeace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. We were\nencouraged to note a similarity of approaches by the\nForeign Ministers of the six contiguous countries, the\nRussian Federation and the United States at the \u201cSix-\nplus-Two\u201d group meeting convened on 15 September\nby the Secretary-General. Pooling our resources and\ninfluence, we should make more energetic efforts to\npersuade the Afghan parties and assist the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations in his efforts to promote\na broad-based Government acceptable to the Afghan\npolitical parties and ethnic groups.\nWe support the Islamic Republic of Iran as it\nleads a parallel effort for peace in Afghanistan on\nbehalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\n(OIC). We also appreciate the efforts recently\nundertaken by Turkmenistan. In our view, all these\nefforts complement and reinforce each other.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization\n(A/55/1), the Secretary-General referred to the influx\nof war materiel to Afghanistan from outside. Pakistan\nurges not only a ceasefire but also a ban on the supply\nof military equipment to the Afghan parties and the\nestablishment of a monitoring mechanism for its\nenforcement. We also remain cognizant of the\nimperative of respect for sovereignty. The Afghan\npeople have a history of fierce resistance against\noutside interference. Engagement with the Afghan\nGovernment offers better hope for amelioration than\nattempts to drive it into a corner and isolate it. The\nUnited Nations has been providing humanitarian relief\nin Afghanistan. Programmes aimed at rehabilitation\nand reconstruction may help bring the country back\ninto the international mainstream sooner. That is also\nthe more compassionate way.\nPakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, condemns\nthat evil in all its forms and manifestations, whether\ncommitted by individuals, groups or States. Our\nGovernment has ratified nine international conventions\nagainst terrorism and we join all international efforts to\ncombat this menace.\nPakistan has historically supported all proposals\nand agreements aimed at the limitation, progressive\nreduction and eventual elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction. For over a quarter of a century we made\nefforts and initiated proposals to keep our area free of\nnuclear weapons. Also, Pakistan has been prepared to\nsupport universal and non-discriminatory measures and\nproposals. Pakistan voted in favour of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 and\nintended to sign it along with all others, especially the\ndesignated States. The process of bringing that Treaty\ninto force was derailed due to events not of our own\nmaking. Even then, Pakistan was not the first to\nconduct tests in 1998. Pakistan will not be the first to\nresume them. We still hope the Treaty can be brought\ninto force. Pakistan will not obstruct the realization of\nthat aim. Our Government continues efforts to build\ndomestic consensus in favour of signing the Treaty.\n15\n\nMeanwhile, restraint and responsibility remain\nthe guiding principles of our nuclear policy. Pakistan\nwill not enter into any nuclear arms race. Our sole aim\nis to retain minimum credible deterrence. I wish to\nreaffirm in this Assembly that our nuclear capability is\nonly meant to deter aggression against Pakistan; it\nposes no threat to any country.\nWe support efforts aimed at the prevention of the\nvertical or horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nDuring the past year we have further strengthened\ndomestic regulations against export of nuclear\nequipment or materials. Our power reactors are under\ninternational safeguards.\nPakistan is prepared to cooperate in efforts to\nintroduce restraints on the development, production\nand deployment of ballistic missiles. To be successful,\nhowever, such efforts must be non-discriminatory.\nTheir aim must be stabilization of the situation.\nAny use of nuclear weapons is inconceivable.\nHowever, the Charter obliges Members to refrain from\nthe threat or the use of any force. The world\ncommunity should, therefore, emphasize no-first-use of\nforce, nuclear or conventional.\nAt the global level, Pakistan supports calls for the\ncontinued observance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile\nTreaty. The militarization of outer space would be a\ndisservice to hopes for the maintenance of existing\nrestraint and stability.\nPakistan will participate in negotiations on the\nproposed fissile material cut-off treaty and make a\npositive contribution to evolving a fair and an equitable\ntext that all countries can support.\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\nChief Executive of Pakistan, General Pervez\nMusharraf, stated:\n\u201cThe best assurance for the consolidation of\nglobal peace lies in the economic development\nand prosperity of all regions and all peoples.\nEconomic progress in one region supports and\ncomplements prosperity in the other.\u201d (A/55/PV.4)\nDevelopment is not a zero-sum game.\nAccordingly, the Millennium Declaration commits\nworld leaders to\n\u201cmaking the right to development a reality for\neveryone\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 11) and freeing\nthe entire human race from want.\nGlobalization raised hopes, as it offered\nopportunities for faster economic growth, higher living\nstandards and accelerated benefits from the flow of\nknowledge and technology. But there have been\ndisappointments. Experience has shown that the\nbenefits of globalization have been uneven and that the\nnumber of people living in poverty has actually\nincreased. Technological and information revolutions\nhave accentuated global inequality, and a new digital\ndivide has led to the marginalization of a large number\nof developing countries.\nGlobal trade regimes benefit the rich, and the\nSouth has become poorer. Competition, standards, a\nvariety of non-tariff barriers, increasingly complex\ntrading practices, protectionism in selected sectors such\nas agriculture, and restrictions on technology transfers\nall militate against the interests of the developing\ncountries. They find it hard to secure adequate returns\nfor their products or to attract investment to improve\ntheir competitiveness. As a result, economic disparities\nare widening. This belies the promise of free markets\nto ensure the well-being of all.\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\nmeeting in Seattle last November and dissenting voices\nheard in Washington last April make it clear that the\ninternational economic system needs to be fixed.\nConcerted global action is required for sustained\ndevelopment to benefit and protect weaker economies.\nThe industrialized countries have a special\nresponsibility to adopt bold initiatives. Professions of a\ndesire for the eradication of poverty must first lead to\nthe establishment of an international economic policy\nframework responsive to the needs of the developing\ncountries.\nOne important area is the debt issue. In one of the\ninteractive dialogues the Secretary-General proposed\nthat the United Nations could mediate between\ncreditors and debtors to address the debt problem. We\nwelcome this proposal. Our Chief Executive, speaking\nat the same meeting, suggested that developing\nindebted countries should be allowed to utilize\nresources allocated to debt servicing for the\ndevelopment of the social sector, especially education\nand health care. Substantive debt relief through\ninnovative approaches will go a long way to help\ndeveloping countries ensure global harmony and\nregenerate a new economic partnership between the\nNorth and the South.\n16\n\nA holistic approach to deal with problems of\ndevelopment and poverty eradication is necessary.\nWhile we welcome the Secretary-General's initiative to\nbridge the digital divide, the emphasis must remain on\naddressing mass literacy, capacity-building,\ninfrastructure and basic health facilities. Similarly,\nmultilateral trade regimes should be development-\noriented. Environmental concerns about the prudent\nuse of natural resources must be pursued\nsimultaneously with emphasis on sustained economic\ngrowth in the South.\nThe High-level International Intergovernmental\nEvent on Financing for Development, which will be\nheld next year, must involve the world's finance, trade\nand development organizations in discussing the issues\ncomprehensively. The conference should promote good\ngovernance at the international level. It must address\nhow we can manage globalization appropriately so that\nits benefits reach everyone, ensuring universal\nprosperity.\nThe upsurge of democracy in the past decade has\nbeen a good omen for the start of the new millennium.\nThis salutary trend can only be sustained through\nequitable economic development. Unless the\ndeveloping nations are able to have a fair share in\nrising levels of global prosperity, the advocacy of\ndemocratic values and human and social standards will\nremain hollow.\nIn Pakistan we are addressing the challenges of\nboth economic revival and institutional reforms that\nemphasize accountability, good governance and the\ndevolution of power to grass-roots levels political\ninstitutions. In this endeavour, the Government is\nbanking on the support and enthusiasm of our people.\nWe believe that democracy is, first and foremost,\nempowerment of the people, based on strong\ninstitutions.\nThe world community is well aware of the\nravages inflicted on fragile economies of developing\ncountries and their poor people as a result of corruption\nand the transfer of illegal funds to safe havens abroad.\nThey are often the worst victims of such malpractice\ndue to socio-economic forces within and banking\npractices outside their countries.\nThe welfare of humanity in developing countries\ndemands international cooperation for the prevention\nof corruption. Such cooperation was urged in\nresolutions 53/176 of 15 December 1998 and 54/205 of\n22 December 1999. The South Summit, held in Havana\nin April 2000, also requested remedial action.\nTransfers of illicit funds from developing\ncountries will not make the rich countries much richer,\nbut they will make the poor countries poorer. It is a\nparadox that some rich countries have such lax laws\nthat they provide safe havens and encourage private\nbanks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons\nfrom poor countries by facilitating the establishment of\nsecret accounts. That is tantamount to the\nencouragement of plunder, indeed, of financial\nterrorism.\nThe nexus between corruption and the failure of\ndemocracy was recognized also in the Final\nDeclaration issued by the meeting of the Community of\nDemocracies in Warsaw, held from 25 to 27 June 2000.\nIt emphasized the need to combat corruption, which\ncorrodes democracy. We need, therefore, to take\neffective action. We propose that the General Assembly\nshould proclaim a policy of zero tolerance of all types\nof corruption and urge a ban on the laundering of illicit\nfunds.\nThe United Nations has emerged as the only\nforum with the universal recognition and authority to\naddress the entire spectrum of issues relating to human\naspirations for peace, justice and development. To meet\nthese growing expectations, this world body must be\nstrengthened. Its role must be reinforced in order to\nensure a better future for the world.\nWe support the call for enhancing the capacity of\nthe United Nations in the areas of conflict prevention\nand peacekeeping. In this regard, we commend\nMr. Brahimi and members of the high-level Panel for\ntheir extensive report. As an important participant in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, we in\nPakistan look forward to discussions on the useful\nideas and concepts that have been presented in the\nreport to enable the United Nations to respond more\neffectively to existing and incipient conflicts and\nthreats to international peace and security.\nNo other aspect of reform of the United Nations\nmerits as close attention as the need to make the\nSecurity Council more democratic, transparent and\naccountable. Periodic elections of a larger number of\nmembers will make the Security Council not only more\nrepresentative but also more responsive to the\naspirations of the world community. That will enhance\nthe capacity of this vital organ to contribute to the\n17\n\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\nthe realization of the purposes of the Organization.\nThat objective will not be achieved by the creation of\nnew centres of privilege which detract from the\ncardinal principle of the sovereign equality of States.\nFor the same reason, the decision-making process\nneeds to be made more democratic.\nFor the Security Council to command universal\nrespect, its reform should have the general agreement\nof the membership. Nothing should be done in haste or\nin a manner that divides the membership or impairs the\nauthority and prestige of the Council.\nIn this increasingly interactive world, we share\nwith other nations the desire for a peaceful\nenvironment and mutually beneficial cooperation, and\nwe see a pivotal role for the United Nations. The\nuniversality of the United Nations gives it a stature and\nlegitimacy that is unprecedented in history. The\nOrganization should begin the twenty-first century by\ndemonstrating a clear commitment to addressing and\nresolving the key development and security challenges\nfacing our peoples. It must be enabled to apply its\nimmutable principles and its decisions consistently and\nforcefully to ensure durable peace, sustained economic\nprogress and a better future for all humanity.\n\n\n\n\n"

I take the\nopportunity to assure him of my delegation's full\nsupport as he carries out his difficult but uplifting task.\nI feel sure that with his experience and abilities as an\nable diplomat he will successfully guide our\ndiscussions.\nI should also like to extend my sincere and warm\ncongratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for\nthe ability and authority he demonstrated throughout\nthe fifty-fourth session.\nI also take this opportunity of extending once\nagain to Secretary-General Kofi Annan our full\nappreciation and support for his constant efforts and\nresolve to find a better world in spite of the many\ncomplex challenges in the new millennium. His\nexcellent report, \u201cWe the peoples: the role of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d, is evidence\nof this.\nMali welcomes Tuvalu to the Assembly. Its\nadmission to membership further strengthens the\nuniversality of the Organization.\nMore than ever before, our world aspires to peace\nand security and sustainable human development. In\nthis respect, our fifty-fifth session is unprecedentedly\nimportant both historically and politically. The\nexceptional opportunity offered us in the Millennium\nSummit, which has renewed our hope in humankind,\nmust not be lost. The Millennium Declaration\ndemonstrates our maturity and our elevated sense of\nresponsibility for the future of humanity. Now we must\nbuild this better world to which we all aspire. The\npeoples of the United Nations look to us. They are\nimpatient. More than ever before they want to be actors\ndetermining their own future, particularly people who\ndo not have very much, our people. They want to be\nactors and to benefit from globalization.\nThat is how I see the historical and political\nmeaning of this session, which must give effect to the\ndynamic now under way. Here, all together, we\nreaffirm the place and the role of the United Nations in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\nin cooperation for development, which require that the\nUnited Nations become more legitimate by being more\ndemocratic and stronger. What I say will be set against\nthis backdrop.\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity must remain our priority. The Organization is\nincreasingly faced with violent, deadly internal\nconflicts that have taken the lives of millions of\ncivilians. It is therefore crucial to improve the system\nof prevention and strengthen our institution's capacity\nto organize and conduct operations effectively and\nsuccessfully. Here I pay tribute to the report of the\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations, led by\nLakhdar Brahimi. It is indeed a milestone in the\nprocess of trying to make the United Nations \u201ctruly\ncredible as a force for peace\u201d (A/55/305), so we must\nquickly ensure that it has positive results. As the report\nrightly emphasizes, United Nations intervention must\nbe decided upon on the basis of uniform criteria,\nregardless of the region in which conflicts occur. The\nmultidisciplinary nature of new United Nations\npeacekeeping missions demands clear and precise\nmandates.\nMali welcomes efforts to strengthen cooperation\nwith regional organizations in regard to maintaining\npeace, while respecting the competence of the Security\nCouncil. Recent events in Sierra Leone remind us of\nthis and are a real challenge to us. Efforts by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional\norganizations must be supported to establish regional\ncapacity. This also applies to the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS), which already has\na peacekeeping force and will soon have an early\nwarning system.\nPeacekeeping operations cannot be a permanent\nsolution to conflicts or an answer to the underlying\ncauses. The international community must move from a\nculture of reaction to a culture of prevention based on a\nmultidimensional approach, helping to save many\nhuman lives and making additional resources available\nfor development. We must also emphasize that the\neffectiveness of the United Nations in peacekeeping\ndepends largely on its capacity for prevention, crisis\nmanagement and peace-building. Here I appeal to the\ninternational community to provide a stable and\nhealthy financial base for the Organization's\npeacekeeping activities.\n14\n\nI pay tribute to the second Security Council\nsummit held on 7 September, which dealt with the need\nto give the Council an effective role in the maintenance\nof international peace and security, particularly in\nAfrica. The resolution that emerged from that summit\ndeserves the support of us all, for it will certainly\nstrengthen our capacity for prevention and crisis\nmanagement.\nWe must also continue work to free the world\nfrom the fear of weapons of mass destruction and face\nup to the threat of light weapons.\nWith regard to nuclear non-proliferation, the\nindefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) regime, the entry into force of the\nChemical Weapons Convention, the signing and\nratification of many other treaties on important aspects\nof disarmament, and the creation of nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones, are all important contributions to\nconfidence-building and nuclear disarmament.\nMali is fully committed to work to halt the plague\nof the proliferation of light weapons. I appeal for\ngreater coordinated support for regional efforts,\nincluding support for moratoriums, respect for\nembargoes on arms deliveries and the strengthening of\ncontrols. The United Nations conference in 2001 on\nthis issue must give the international community an\nopportunity to take appropriate steps to end the\nexcessive destabilizing accumulation of such weapons.\nThe conference must look at all aspects and be fully\ntransparent.\nI must mention here the troubling issue of\nchildren affected by conflict, child soldiers, for the link\nbetween the proliferation of light weapons and the\nintolerable fate of these children is only too obvious.\nWe have a great responsibility for them, and we must\nput an end to the destruction of so many hopes. The\nInternational Conference on War-affected Children,\nheld in Winnipeg, which ended just a few days ago,\nwas an opportunity for us all to strengthen our\ncommitment to guarantee all children better health,\nschool for all, both boys and girls, free from war,\nviolence and famine.\nAt the beginning of the third millennium one of\nthe most urgent tasks facing humanity is to end the\ngrowing inequality between rich and poor countries.\nWe must tackle the underlying causes of conflict \u2014\nprimarily their economic and social dimensions. In an\ninternational environment that is increasingly marked\nby globalization, continuing poverty is our most\ndifficult challenge. The problem of the debt of the\ndeveloping countries must remain our focus, because it\nis a major obstacle to their development. Complete\ncancellation of the debt is needed in the overall\nframework of finding a new development strategy.\nThis new development strategy involves direct\ninvestment, unhampered access to markets through\nspecial, differential treatment, fair prices for our goods,\nand transfers of new technology, all of which are major\nfactors in development. This means that financing\ndevelopment must remain on our agenda. My\ndelegation welcomes the convening in 2001 of a high-\nlevel conference to deal with this issue at the\nintergovernmental level. The challenges of\ndevelopment cannot be taken up unless there is a stable\ninternational financial system. My country advocates a\nreform of the international financial system that takes\naccount of the social dimension of development and\ndoes not jeopardize nations' capacity to pursue their\nnational development objectives.\nAfrica has understood full well that its role and\nplace in the emerging world implies a renewed political\napproach of integration and unity of our continent.\nThat is the backdrop to the creation of the African\nUnion, which calls for a united Africa, strengthened by\nan integrated development of its full potential and a\nheightened awareness of its strategic advantages. Mali\nwas the first country to ratify the Constitutive Act of\nthe Union, which we are convinced is the springboard\nfor the development of the continent, and for a\nresponsible Africa, an Africa that counts.\nWe must work together to eradicate poverty. We\nhave a responsibility to guarantee all human beings a\nlife of decency and dignity, with equal opportunities\nfor all peoples. We can do this. It requires enhanced\ncooperation and international solidarity through a\nmultilateral approach guided by the United Nations.\nWe must promote global social development, for\nwe believe that excessive unshared wealth is a poor\nkind of wealth, a wealth with no social value and\ntherefore contrary to the essence of our life.\nThe values that give meaning to the wealth of the\nworld are those of democracy. Here I refer to the strong\nwords of President Konar\u00e9, who rightly told the\ncommunity of democracies conference, held in\nWarsaw, that the development of democracy is the\nbasis for a world of peace, solidarity and social justice,\n15\n\nand that only democracy can allow each of us to\nshoulder the burden, but also the honour, of being a\nhuman being and serving humankind. \u201cWhat an honour\nit is to be a human being!\u201d he said.\nThe Ministerial Conference on Security, Stability,\nDevelopment and Cooperation in Africa said rightly\nthat democracy, good governance, respect for human\nrights, the rights of peoples, and the rule of law, are\nprerequisites to achieving security, stability and\ndevelopment in Africa. Nothing must prevent open\ndiscussion of ideas and the promotion of political\npluralism. Despite inadequacies, difficulties and\nsometimes violent breakdowns, the democratic process\nis gaining ground in Africa. A democratic Africa is\nbecoming increasingly real, but it is still a fragile\nreality that must be supported and helped. Mali\nwelcomes the adoption last June by the [Community of\nDemocracies] of the Warsaw Declaration, advocating\nthe strengthening of cooperation among democratic\ncountries with a view to sharing the best practices,\nprotecting themselves against threats to democratic\nprocesses, and promoting the emergence of a\npartnership forum to help democracies in transition.\nWe must be strong against unconstitutional\nchange of political regimes so that we can strengthen\ndemocracy. We must condemn such changes as a matter\nof principle and there must be consequences. President\nKonar\u00e9 said that pressure must be credible and can\nonly attain its goal if the international community\nadopts a firm consistent and constructive approach in\nthe event of any putsch or attempted coup d'\u00e9tat. It\nmust avoid encouraging those who are tempted to\nviolate republican and democratic rules by removing\nany ambiguity. In this respect, the international\ncommunity must be clearer and more rigorous in its\napproach and support the OAU which seeks to deter\nputsches by taking a clear position and by imposing\npolitical sanctions. Could this position not also be\ntaken up in the United Nations?\nAlong the same lines the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court with the Rome Statues\nwould be a permanent body to act against impunity. It\nwould allow us to try those responsible for the most\nhorrible crimes and it would also be a tool for\ndeterrence that could contribute to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Mali has already\nratified the Court's Statute, thus showing that it\nsupports the struggle against the culture of impunity\nand to ensure respect for human dignity.\nIn view of the progress in achieving some\nsettlement in the Lockerbie matter, we would call for\nthe definitive and immediate lifting of sanctions that\nare unjustly inflicting suffering on the brother people\nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We must be careful\nabout sanctions because of the humanitarian cost\ninvolved. We must use more effective, targeted\nsanctions.\nOn the Korean peninsula we welcome the recent\ninter-Korean summit and the exchange visits by\npeoples of both countries. We welcome and support\nthese initiatives which begin a direct dialogue between\nthe parties involved and promote peace and stability in\nthe Korean peninsula.\nHIV/AIDS jeopardizes the future of millions of\nmen, women and children in Africa and it is also a\nthreat to international peace and security. A failure to\ndeal with this would be culpable and suicidal\nindifference. In this connection we fully support the\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\nAssembly on AIDS.\nAdapting the United Nations to the requirements\nof the age is absolutely essential. The challenges facing\nus in the political, economic and social areas force us\nto demonstrate creativity and realism so that we can\ncome up with innovative and constructive suggestions\nand translate them into action in the true interests of\nour peoples. My delegation believes in the need to\ndemocratize the United Nations further, to restructure\nall its principal organs. Reform of the Security Council\nwill give effect to our desire to modernize this\nimportant organ that the Charter makes primarily\nresponsible for threats to and breaches of international\npeace and security. A reformed Council must be more\ntransparent in its working methods, more democratic,\nmore representative, more legitimate in its\nmembership, and it must be more credible in the way it\nis perceived by other member States. Mali reaffirms\nAfrica's demand for equitable distribution of seats in\nthe two categories, pursuant to the Harare Declaration\nadopted by the OAU Summit of Heads of State or\nGovernment.\nMore than ever before the human being must be\nthe very heart of the new millennium. The peoples\nexpect the United Nations to promote and ensure a\nworld of progress for all, a world of peace, a world of\nsharing. In this respect Mali sees the Millennium\n16\n\nDeclaration as the fabric we can use to build a better\nworld. Now is the time for action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I have\nthe honour of speaking this year on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, which France is presiding over until\nthe end of December.\nIn this capacity, it is a great pleasure for me to\ncongratulate the President on his election. It\nsymbolizes the respect the international community has\nboth for his country and for himself.\nI would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, for his skill in guiding the\nproceedings of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Sam Nujoma and Ms. Tarja Halonen for\ntheir work with you, Mr. President, as Co-Chairpersons\nof the Millennium Summit.\n19\n\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\nof the Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan. His international\naction, his independence and his vision have made a\ndecisive contribution to asserting the key role the\nUnited Nations plays and must continue to play. The\nEuropean Union wishes to assure him of its support for\nhis work and for the Organization and its\nrepresentatives.\nThe Millennium Summit, an unprecedented\ngathering of 155 heads of State and Government,\nallowed us to address the main challenges facing the\nworld community and the role of the United Nations in\nthe twenty-first century, which will begin on 1 January\n2001.\nThe Union notes with great satisfaction that the\nSummit produced a political document setting forth a\nroad-map for the Organization for the years to come.\nThese guidelines are based on ideas outlined in the\nSecretary-General's report. It is now up to the General\nAssembly to implement them. The Union will\ncontribute actively to this.\nPeacekeeping, strengthening international\nsecurity and defending human rights are the central\nprinciples underpinning the European Union's foreign\npolicy. Recent crises on Europe's very doorstep have\nconvinced us that we cannot remain idle when these\nfundamental principles are violated. In this regard, the\nEuropean Union approves of the priority given to\npeacekeeping during last week's meetings. Mr.\nBrahimi's report offers an in-depth analysis on this\nsubject. It presents useful recommendations for the\nmandates of peacekeeping operations, operational\nplanning in New York and deployment. It presents a\nunique opportunity to strengthen the United Nations\ncapacity for peace operations. The European Union\nwill actively participate in considering these\nrecommendations.\nThe Union has decided to equip itself to be a\nmajor political actor and to play its full role on the\ninternational stage. To this end, and within a very short\ntime-frame, it has undertaken decisive measures. New\ndecision-making, action-oriented political and military\nbodies have been set up: a political and security\ncommittee, a military committee, a European Union\nmilitary staff, a situation centre and a committee for\ncivilian crisis management. These bodies will enable\nthe European Union to intervene quickly and credibly\nin the management of international crises.\nThe European Union has also announced its\nintention to establish by 2003 a force of 60,000 troops\nfor international missions involving the whole range of\nconflict-prevention and crisis-management operations,\nwith the requisite air and naval support for deployment\nwithin 60 days for a period of at least one year. This\nautumn there will be a conference for the commitment\nof capability at which each Member State shall pledge\nits contribution to this joint endeavour.\nThe Union has also set ambitious and realistic\ntargets for developing collective capabilities. In\naddition to its military resources, it will develop\ncivilian intervention capabilities, including a corps of\ncivilian police, whose contribution to peacekeeping is\ninvaluable. In this connection, Member States have set\nthemselves the goal of being able, by 2003, to provide\nup to 5,000 police officers, 1,000 of whom will be\ndeployment-ready within 30 days.\nThese decisions now enable the European Union\nto complement its already sizeable economic and\nhumanitarian programmes with the full range of\nresources required for crisis management. Of course,\nthese activities are designed in full respect for the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Now more\nthan ever, it is vital to establish working ties with the\nUnited Nations. To initiate this cooperation, the\nEuropean Union troika will discuss this issue for the\nfirst time with the Secretary-General. On behalf of the\nEuropean Union, I hereby invite Mr. Kofi Annan to go\nto Brussels for a working meeting with the organs of\nthe Union.\nThe European Union hails the considerable\nefforts and determination shown by the President of the\nPalestinian Authority and the Israeli Prime Minister\nduring recent negotiations to reach a final agreement\nbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. We\nwelcome in particular the renewed vigour with which\nvery sensitive issues have been addressed at this time.\nWe commend President Clinton and the Secretary\nof State for their unflagging efforts to facilitate\nnegotiations. Circumstances favourable to reconciling\npositions continue to exist. We urge the parties to seize\nthis historic opportunity, show courage in decisive\nchoices, take fully into account human realities and the\nrecognized rights of all, and thereby achieve a final\nagreement.\nThe European Union welcomes Israel's\nwithdrawal from the zone it occupied in southern\n20\n\nLebanon. It welcomes the redeployment of the United\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon and the presence of a\njoint security force, sent to the area by the Lebanese\nGovernment. It urges all parties to fulfil their\nresponsibilities in order to defuse tensions. The\nEuropean Union believes that only a comprehensive\nsettlement encompassing every track of the peace\nprocess, including the Israeli-Syrian track, is likely to\nguarantee lasting stability in the region. It will continue\nto support the efforts of the parties to this end and\ncontribute to the implementation of any agreements\nthat may be reached.\nTurning to Europe, the situation in the western\nBalkans is a matter of serious concern to the entire\ninternational community. Ten years of conflict have\nravaged the region, leading to severe human suffering\nand to politically unstable and therefore dangerous\nsituations. But beyond accumulated hardships and the\nlagging economic and social development of many of\nthose countries, all of the peoples and nearly all of the\nleaders of the region have realized that it does have a\nfuture, and that future is Europe. Today, all Europeans\nnow share the belief that these countries are bound one\nday to join the European Union.\nThis is why the European Council has reiterated\nthat its goal is to firmly attach the countries of the\nregion to Europe. This means the greatest possible\nintegration into the political, economic and social\ncurrents of Europe through the stabilization and\nassociation process, political dialogue, trade\nliberalization, the harmonization of their laws with\nthose of the European Union, and cooperation in justice\nand domestic affairs.\nThe assistance provided by the European Union\nto countries of the region over the last 10 years \u2014\nnearly 8 billion euros \u2014 is considerable. The European\nUnion will continue to sustain this stabilization and\nassociation process by providing the western Balkan\ncountries with massive technical, economic and\nfinancial assistance and by granting them asymmetrical\ntrade advantages in farming and industry very soon,\nwhich will pave the way for the creation of a free trade\nzone with the European Union. In the context of\nelections concerning almost the entire region, we will\nencourage them to develop regional cooperation and to\ncontinue to make determined efforts for political,\neconomic and social reform in order to consolidate\ndemocracy and human rights, to build the rule of law\nand lay the groundwork for sustainable development.\nIn this context, the European Union has reaffirmed its\ndetermination to continue to be the driving force in the\nStability Pact for South-eastern Europe, which\nrepresents a new vision of cooperation between the\ncountries of the region and the international\ncommunity.\nThe summit to be held shortly in Croatia of the\nEuropean Union and the Western Balkan countries \u2014\non the basis of a French proposal \u2014 will signal our\ncommon resolve to overcome the divisions of the past.\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not be\nable to participate in the conference, as the nature of its\npresent regime does not allow it to do so. But the Serbs\nknow that they have their place in the European family\nand that the European Union is looking forward to the\nday when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is in a\nposition to participate fully in the stabilization and\nassociation process and to recover its rightful place in\nEurope. The elections to be held on 24 September\ncould be decisive in this respect.\nIn Kosovo the international community, acting on\nthe basis of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999),\nhas achieved praiseworthy results. Thanks must be\ngiven to all those who have made this possible in spite\nof enormous difficulties, especially the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, the United\nNations staff and the Kosovo Force soldiers, the many\ninternational organizations there on the ground and the\nnon-governmental organizations. The first democratic\nmunicipal elections in Kosovo, to be held in a few\nweeks' time, will constitute a major step in the\nimplementation of resolution 1244 (1999). I would\nforcefully reiterate that the international community\nwill not allow unacceptable acts of violence, whatever\ntheir motivation, to cause the democratic electoral\nprocess under way to fail. We will not let extremists\nfrom whatever faction sabotage the work accomplished\nover the past year under the auspices of the United\nNations.\nThe European Union considers the status quo in\nCyprus unacceptable, and it supports the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to reach a negotiated,\ncomprehensive, fair and lasting settlement consistent\nwith relevant Security Council resolutions. It reiterates\nits commitment to stability and prosperity throughout\nthe Mediterranean region. With talks beginning right\nhere under the auspices of the Secretary-General, it\n21\n\ninvites the parties concerned to enter into substantive\ntalks.\nThe European Union is equally determined in its\nsupport for efforts to prevent and settle conflicts in\nAfrica, in close cooperation with the United Nations,\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and other\nsubregional organizations and in accordance with the\nobjectives agreed at the Africa-Europe Summit, held\nlast April in Cairo under the Portuguese presidency of\nthe European Union. It will lend its backing to the\nmeasures taken jointly by the OAU and the United\nNations to implement the peace settlement between\nEthiopia and Eritrea. In supporting the deployment of\ninternational observers, the European Union is also\nwilling to lend its support to the establishment and\ndemarcation of borders, to demining and to assistance\nto refugees and displaced persons. It is endeavouring to\nprovide assistance to the war-stricken populations of\nboth countries, whose immense suffering has been\ncompounded by drought.\nThe European Union is deeply concerned by the\ndevelopments in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. It calls on all parties to the Lusaka Agreement\nto implement their commitments, including those made\nat Kampala. This will allow for progress with respect\nto the military and political provisions, all of which are\nunder threat due to the continued fighting and the\ndeadlock in preparing for a national dialogue. It also\nurges them to abide by the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, in particular resolution 1304 (2000), which\ncalls for an orderly withdrawal of foreign forces from\nCongolese territory and for the cooperation of all\nparties in the deployment of the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC) through the lifting of restrictions\non the freedom of movement of MONUC personnel\nand by ensuring their security.\nThe illegal exploitation of the natural resources of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, a violation of\nthe country's sovereignty, is also unacceptable. The\nEuropean Union therefore commends the establishment\nby the Secretary-General on 15 August last of a group\nof experts in charge of analysing ties between the\nillegal exploitation of those riches and the continuation\nof the conflict.\nWe are pleased to note greater awareness about\nthe illicit trade in diamonds and other minerals, which\ndirectly fuels conflicts. This is the case in particular\nwith the illicit trade in diamonds in Angola, whereby\nUNITA has been funding its war effort. We underscore\nthe importance of complying with Security Council\nresolutions on this matter. We welcome the decision to\nplace this important question on the General\nAssembly's agenda. The discussion should be based on\nthe Kimberley process. It should reflect the work of the\npreparatory conference co-chaired by the United\nKingdom and Russia. Lastly, it should examine the\nproposal made at Miyazaki to establish a standing\ngroup of independent experts to formulate ways of\npreventing illicit trade.\nThe European Union reiterates its support for\nresolution 1306 (2000) on Sierra Leone, which\ntightened existing arms sanctions and established an\nembargo on raw diamonds illegally exported from\nSierra Leone. The European Union calls on all the\nparties to the conflict to comply with the principles and\nobjectives of the Lom\u00e9 Agreement and to be fully\ninvolved in the re-establishment of peace and stability\nand compliance with human rights in Sierra Leone.\nThe European Union and its member States will\ncontinue to contribute to African capacity and means of\naction in conflict prevention and resolution, in\nparticular through support for the OAU and\nsubregional organizations and initiatives.\nThe European Union is deeply concerned at the\nsituation in Myanmar. It asks the Myanmar authorities\nto immediately restore Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's\nfreedom of speech, movement and communication with\nthe outside. It is urgent for dialogue to begin between\nthe Myanmar authorities and the democratic\nopposition, including the National League for\nDemocracy and national minorities. The Union\nsupports the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for\nBurma, Mr. Razali, in his efforts to find a solution.\nThe European Union expresses its solidarity with\nthe people of East Timor and commends the work done\nby the United Nations Transitional Administration in\nEast Timor (UNTAET) in close cooperation with the\npolitical authorities of East Timor. It is in favour of\naccelerating reconstruction assistance in order to\nguarantee a successful transition and avoid any delay in\nthe timetable leading to independence.\nWe are extremely concerned by the instability\ncaused by the militias in both East and West Timor.\nThe new outbreaks of violence by them have taken the\nlives of two \u201cblue beret\u201d peacekeepers and, more\n22\n\nrecently, of three personnel of the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThe European Union calls on the Indonesian authorities\nto adopt effective measures to control the militias\nwithout delay.\nThe European Union also calls for the termination\nof terrorist activity in Kashmir, the implementation of\nconfidence- and security-building measures and strict\nrespect for the line of control in order to restore a\npeaceful local climate and enable the dialogue between\nPakistan and India to resume in the spirit of the Lahore\nDeclaration. The European Union will be looking\nclosely for such signs from the parties involved and\nwill encourage initiatives likely to resolve all the\ndisputes between the two countries.\nIt is important for the specific measures laid\ndown in Security Council resolution 1172 (1998) to be\nimplemented and for Pakistan and India to subscribe to\nthe international non-proliferation regime and sign the\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\nHaving advocated direct dialogue between the\ntwo Koreas for many years, the European Union\nwelcomes the historic inter-Korean Summit that took\nplace in Pyongyang from 13-15 June this year. This is\nan important step on the road to reconciliation between\nthe Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, opening bright prospects for\nstrengthening the stability of the region. We invite the\ntwo countries, who have been members of the United\nNations since 1991, to continue this process in order to\nhelp the Korean people heal the wounds of the past.\nOn the subject of Haiti, the European Union\nrecalls that full respect for the constitutional provisions\nconcerning the elections and electoral legislation\ncurrently in force is the basis of democracy and the rule\nof law.\nThe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and their delivery systems is a crucial issue\nthat the European Union \u2014 which shares the concern\nfor international peace and security that ought to\ninspire the nations represented here \u2014 is resolved to\ncombat relentlessly. To this end, international\ncooperation must be stressed, along with the\ndevelopment of multilateral standards for non-\nproliferation, arms control and disarmament.\nThis is particularly true of chemical and\nbiological weapons, which have now been banned. The\nUnion is working towards the early conclusion of a\nprotocol containing reliable and effective verification\nmeasures to strengthen the 1972 Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production and\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\nWeapons and on their Destruction. We are equally\ndetermined to ensure nuclear non-proliferation and\ndisarmament, where so much progress has been made\nsince the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to which 187 States are\nnow parties.\nSince the end of the cold war, effective\ninstruments for ending the arms race and achieving\ndisarmament have begun to see the light of day, with\nthe halt to testing, the treaty enshrining it, the first two\nSTART agreements to reduce the largest nuclear\narsenals and a host of unilateral decisions following the\nsame trend. Our priority must be to consolidate this\nmechanism. A start was made with the Review\nConferences of 1995 and 2000; the results, which we\nwelcome, must be fully implemented.\nWe must give full weight to strengthening the\nsafeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) through the widespread implementation of the\nmeasures contained in the 1997 Model Protocol and to\nremain alert to the issue of NPT compliance. We must\nalso revive the momentum of the multilateral\nnegotiations.\nThe entry into force of the Comprehensive Test\nBan Treaty, the completion of the operational readiness\nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization\n(CTBTO) and the negotiation at the Disarmament\nConference of a fissile material cut-off treaty are all\nnecessary steps that are of concern and ought to\nmobilize all States, be they parties to the NPT or not.\nThe start of this negotiation implies urgent negotiations\non a working programme in the Conference on\nDisarmament. International standards in this field can\nonly be effective if they are universal. Arsenal\nreductions, which are the prime responsibility of the\nnuclear-weapon States, must also be continued. This\nwill enable us to move closer to our common\nobjectives \u2014 namely, the elimination of nuclear\nweapons and general, comprehensive disarmament\nunder strict and effective international control.\nThe issue of small arms and light weapons is just\nas sensitive in many regions of the world. It deserves\nspecial attention. The 15 European Union members\n23\n\nwill contribute to the preparation of the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, which will take place\nduring the summer of 2001, with the objective of\nobtaining a positive and enforceable plan of action to\ncombat the destabilizing accumulation and spread of\nsmall arms and light weapons. At the same time, the\nUnion shall continue its drive for the implementation\nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on their Destruction. It will join in the\nefforts to achieve the total elimination of anti-\npersonnel mines.\nOn the very important subject of human rights,\nthe European Union will continue to support the efforts\nof the United Nations to reach the goal set by the\nSecretary-General to put human rights at the heart of\nevery aspect of its work. The best guarantee of solid\nprogress in this area is each person's awareness of the\nimportance of human rights and democracy and the\nemergence of groups who actively promote them in\nevery country. In this connection, the European Union\nwelcomes the designation, thanks to the support of\nmany countries, of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General on Human Rights Defenders, Ms.\nJilani; we welcome her appointment and assure her of\nour full backing as she undertakes her duties.\nThis year the United Nations has once again\ndemonstrated that it is the main forum of progress in\nsetting standards for human rights, as witnessed by the\nadoption of two optional protocols to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child on the sexual exploitation of\nchildren and on children in armed conflicts. This\nrepresents a major step forward in favour of the\nprotection of children. The European Union intends to\ncontribute actively to the special session of the United\nNations General Assembly for the follow-up to the\nWorld Children's Summit, to be held next year, which\nwill give the international community yet another\nopportunity to help this cause move forward.\nAnother important task, the World Conference\nAgainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\nand Related Intolerance, lies ahead. At the European\nPreparatory Conference, to be held in October under\nthe auspices of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg,\nthe European Union will demonstrate its commitment\nto combat all expressions of racism, whatever form\nthey take. The Union, all of whose members have\nabolished the death penalty, calls on States that have\nnot yet done so to adopt a moratorium as a first step\ntowards the eventual abolition of this punishment,\nwhich is contrary to human dignity.\nThe European Union will endeavour to strengthen\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism\nand will play an active role in the negotiations to be\nheld to that end. It earnestly hopes that this General\nAssembly will adopt the Convention Against\nTransnational Organized Crime and its Protocols at the\nPalermo Conference next December. Given that such\ncrime, that one of its most odious manifestations is the\ntrafficking in human beings, and that it poses an ever-\ngrowing threat to our societies, it is vital for the\ninternational community to develop the means to\ncooperate and fight against it effectively.\nLastly, the European Union looks forward to the\nearly establishment of the International Criminal Court.\nI would like to recall that ratification by 42 States is\nstill needed for this.\nBy way of conclusion, I would like to stress one\nlast point, and that is sustainable development. The\nEuropean Union's contribution to international\ncooperation is substantial. With 30 per cent of the\nglobal gross domestic product, the Union contributes\n36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget and\n39 per cent of the peacekeeping budget. As you know,\nit also contributes the rather large amount of around 55\nper cent of the world total of official development\nassistance. We are pleased with everything that was\nsaid last week on this extremely important matter, and\nwe will continue our exemplary work on sustainable\ndevelopment. Indeed, we believe that development is\none of the key ways of resolving all of the problems\nfacing us throughout the world, as outlined in my\nstatement, and the European Union wishes to express\nits strong, continuing commitment to that end."

        "file_text": "Your election, Sir, as\nPresident of the Millennium Assembly is fitting\nrecognition of your great dedication to international\npeace. Ireland is especially grateful for your\noutstanding contribution to the Good Friday agreement\nsigned in Belfast in 1998. We are sure that the qualities\nthat you displayed then will serve you well in guiding\nthe work of this session.\nOur thanks are due also to Foreign Minister\nTheo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, the wise and thoughtful\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly. We are happy also to welcome Tuvalu as a\nnew Member of the Organization.\nMy colleague, Foreign Minister V\u00c8drine of\nFrance, has already addressed the Assembly on behalf\nof the European Union. Ireland is fully associated with\nhis remarks.\nThe Declaration adopted at the historic\nMillennium Summit sets out the principles, objectives\nand targets which should inspire the work of this\nsession. Ireland is fully committed to these principles\nand objectives, and we are determined to work\nvigorously to achieve real results. Critics of the United\nNations may doubt our ability to achieve such results;\nwe are determined to prove them wrong. Such critics\nignore the considerable achievements of the\nOrganization in recent years. Major reform of all\naspects of the Organization has resulted in a more\nefficient, streamlined operation. We will work with\nothers to strengthen the United Nations in order to\nfulfil the commitment made in the Declaration  to\nensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the\nfight for peace and development and against poverty,\nignorance and disease.\nThe cause of peace transcends all other\nchallenges. Whether in the Middle East, the Western\nBalkans, Africa or, indeed, in our own island of\nIreland, determined efforts to build a secure and\ndurable peace must be tirelessly pursued. Our own\nexperience in Ireland has taught us that there is no\ngreater prize, no more difficult task and no greater\nsatisfaction than to begin to heal the wounds of history\nand the scars of intolerance.\nOur own efforts at building peace have convinced\nus that to be effective, such efforts require international\nsupport and validation. We have also learned that\neconomic development goes hand in hand with\nbuilding a society with hope in its own future and\npledged to overcome the bitterness of the past. It is this\nexperience which helps guide our approach to peace-\nbuilding in the wider world. It is this experience of\npeace-building and development which we will bring\nto the deliberations of the Security Council if elected\nby the membership in the coming weeks.\nSecurity and development are indivisible and\ninterrelated. Yet too often we in the international\ncommunity stand aside as hapless witnesses, hesitating\nto become involved, while the innocent suffer. We need\nto strengthen the capacity and commitment of the\nOrganization to fulfil its mandates. I therefore strongly\nwelcome the exercise of its authority by the United\nNations in East Timor last year and, more recently, in\nSierra Leone. It is our duty as Governments to\nunderpin that authority.\nWe must address those issues which prolong\nconflict, even when root causes become blurred. Let\nme give two examples. First, the illicit flow of small\narms and light weapons into areas of conflict must be\nstopped; and secondly, trafficking in high-value\ncommodities, particularly the trade in so-called blood\ndiamonds', which has exacerbated conflicts in Africa,\nmust be prevented. Carefully targeted, time-limited\nsanctions will help to counter this menace.\nEnhancing the role of the United Nations in\npeacekeeping is a priority for this session. To broaden\nthat role, we urge an integrated approach combining\nprevention, settlement and post-conflict peace-\nbuilding. While the Security Council has a global remit\nto maintain international peace and security in every\nregion of the world, it is right that it pay special\nattention at this time to the promotion of durable peace\nin Africa. We therefore welcome the declared intention\nof the Security Council at the Millennium Summit to\nensure that it plays a more effective role in this urgent\nand necessary task.\nPeacekeeping is at the heart of Ireland's\ncontribution to the United Nations. For more than 40\nyears we have participated continuously in United\n21\n\nNations peacekeeping operations. Irish personnel have\nserved under United Nations command in the Middle\nEast, Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. We are\nproud of the contribution which our peacekeepers have\nmade in so many areas of the world. At the same time,\nwe deeply regret that 82 of our Irish soldiers have died\nin the service of the United Nations. Other Member\nStates have also sustained losses, and I would like to\nexpress my deep regret at the brutal attack last week on\nUnited Nations personnel in West Timor as well as at\nthe recent outrages in Sierra Leone.\nIt is because of our own long, and at times\nfrustrating, experience of peacekeeping that Ireland\nwelcomes the publication of the Brahimi report. In the\nlight of this experience, I will focus in particular on\nthree aspects.\nFirst, the United Nations must have the resources\nand capacity to deliver well-planned and effective\npeace support operations. The Member States must\ngive the Secretary-General and his staff the means to\ndo the job.\nSecondly, if the United Nations is to save lives, it\nmust be capable of deploying into conflict areas\nrapidly. This requires rapid decision-making.\nThirdly, effective operations depend on well-\ntrained peacekeepers. A more integrated approach must\nbe taken to develop training and equipment of United\nNations peacekeeping personnel. Ireland's own United\nNations Training School has provided such training to\nover 170 officers from 40 countries, and we intend to\nenhance this role in cooperation with like-minded\ncountries.\nTo those ends, we will contribute actively in this\nAssembly to the urgent follow-up of the proposals that\nhave been put forward.\nProgress in disarmament remains crucially\nimportant both to the maintenance of peace and to\ndevelopment. At the sixth Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, very considerable efforts were made\nby all the States parties to ensure a successful outcome.\nThat reflects the central role of the Treaty in the\nachievement of a world free of nuclear weapons. The\noutcome highlights the underlying premise of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty: that these weapons do not provide\nassurances of peace and security. The threat to\nhumanity posed by their continued existence will\nremain until we achieve an effective and global ban.\nThere have been welcome and significant\nreductions by the nuclear-weapon States of their\narsenals. But defence strategies based on nuclear\nweapons continue to include the possible use, even the\nfirst use, of those weapons. The Non-Proliferation\nTreaty is not a charter for the indefinite retention of\nnuclear weapons by any State. It represents a clear\nobligation to make nuclear disarmament a reality. At\nthe Review Conference, the parties to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty came closer in their common\nunderstanding of what is demanded by the Treaty. In\nthat connection, the unequivocal commitment to the\ntotal elimination of their nuclear weapons made by the\nnuclear-weapon States is of fundamental significance.\nHowever, let us not lull ourselves into\ncomplacency because we have reached agreement on a\nprogramme of action. We now have an opportunity to\nbegin the root-and-branch elimination of these\nweapons. Progress is primarily dependent on action by\nthe five nuclear-weapon States. States which\nparticipate in security arrangements involving nuclear\nweapons have a particular responsibility to diminish\nthe role of nuclear weapons in security policies. All\nStates share a responsibility to advance negotiation on\nthose measures needed to guarantee a world free of\nnuclear weapons. For our part, Ireland and our partners\nin the New Agenda Coalition are determined to work\nvigorously for the achievement of that goal.\nI referred earlier to the role of conventional arms\nin conflict situations. The ravages and suffering caused\nby small arms as well as by landmines are immense.\nWe are, at least in the case of landmines, beginning to\nsee positive results from the implementation of the\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. The practical outcome\nhas been the destruction of over 22 million mines by\nsome 50 States; expenditure on mine clearance has\nmore than doubled, and countless lives have been\nsaved.\nNext year, the United Nations will focus on small\narms with the first international conference specifically\naddressing that issue. We must set ambitious goals for\nthe conference so that we may have a basis for making\ngenuine inroads on the culture of violence fostered by\nthe dissemination of those weapons.\n22\n\nPeace and development are essential to each\nother. Without peace, there can be no development.\nWithout development, peace is hard to sustain. Without\nfreedom from the threat of war, from human rights\nabuse and from famine, there can be no lasting human\nprogress. The elimination of poverty and access to\nbasic health care and education are crucial to\nsustainable development. Nonetheless, we witness\ntoday an unprecedented contrast between the prosperity\nof developed countries and the poverty of those that\nhave been left behind. And yet, at the same time, we\nare witnessing an actual decline in the international\ncommunity's development aid levels. Clearly, that\ntrend must be reversed.\nIt has long been an objective of Irish\nGovernments to bring our development cooperation\neffort into line with our national economic growth and\nto meet the United Nations development cooperation\ntarget. Last week our Government took an important\nstep forward by when our Taoiseach, our Prime\nMinister, Bertie Ahern, speaking at the Millennium\nSummit, committed Ireland to meet the United Nations\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by the\nend of 2007, and to reach the level of 0.45 per cent by\nthe end of 2002. This will clearly represent a\nsignificant increase in volume terms. Indeed, in\nmeeting our targets, we anticipate a fourfold increase\nby Ireland in our aid over the next seven years. That\nwill greatly increase our ability to make a real impact\non the lives of some of the poorest people on earth. Our\naid budget is both a test and a reflection of our\ncommitment to the values and principles set out in the\nMillennium Summit Declaration. We shall not fail in\nthis task we have set ourselves as a country: to be an\nexample to all who could contribute more.\nAs we enter the new millennium, we are faced\nwith several development issues which require\nimmediate attention. We must begin to address the\nquestion of debt relief in a more coherent manner. The\nmost heavily indebted countries need a sound basis for\nthe achievement of acceptable levels of growth free\nfrom grinding debt. We must recognize that the burden\non those States is unsustainable in the face of the\nchallenges of poverty alleviation and AIDS.\nSpeed is essential in delivering results from the\nEnhanced Debt Initiative if it is to remain credible. In\naddition to a European Union contribution of almost\n$1 billion, Ireland has bilaterally contributed over\n$40 million in debt relief, although as a matter of\nprinciple we have never extended loans in the guise of\ndevelopment assistance. That is why our aid has always\nbeen in grant form, and why all of our development aid\nis also untied.\nGreater market access by the least developed\ncountries must be a priority. With the early\nimplementation of the European Union's commitment\nto grant duty-free and quota-free access to its market\nby the least developed countries by 2005, a major step\nin this direction will have been taken.\nOne of the greatest challenges to development is\nHIV/AIDS. If the spread of AIDS is to be arrested, we\nneed: strong political will in the leadership of the most\naffected countries; we need greater international\nresources; we need greater access to essential drugs at\nprices that are affordable; and we need more research\nfunds for the development of vaccines. The fight\nagainst AIDS is now an integral part of all Irish\ndevelopment activities, with funding budgeted for both\nprevention and the search for vaccines.\nRespect for human rights is central to the\nmaintenance of peace and the promotion of\ndevelopment. It underpins all the activities of the\nUnited Nations. Putting weapons in the hands of\nchildren and sending them into conflict undermines the\nmost basic rights and the innocence of the child. That\nis a scandal which cannot be allowed to continue.\nThrough the Optional Protocol to the Convention on\nthe Rights of the Child on the involvement of children\nin armed conflicts, which Ireland was among the first\nto sign, a start has been made in addressing this issue.\nBut much more must be done.\nThe establishment of an International Criminal\nCourt offers a unique opportunity to bring to justice the\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity and other\nserious violations of international law. Ireland is\nmoving rapidly to ratify the Statute. The international\ncriminal tribunals for former Yugoslavia and for\nRwanda demonstrate how necessary it is to exercise\ninternational jurisdiction to end the culture of impunity\nwhere violations of basic human rights occur.\nRacism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nintolerance persist in all our societies. The 2001 World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance will provide an\nopportunity to create a vision for the fight against\nracism and all intolerance for the coming century. I pay\ntribute here to the United Nations High Commissioner\n23\n\nfor Human Rights, Mary Robinson. Taoiseach Bertie\nAhern, TD, our Prime Minister, was pleased to be\namongst the first to sign the declaration entitled:\nTolerance and diversity: a vision for the twenty-first\ncentury', which was presented at the Millennium\nSummit. I believe that it will generate a positive\napproach to the World Conference.\nI know that our friends in the international\ncommunity continue to follow developments in the\npeace process in Ireland with close interest. Indeed, the\nGovernments of many Member States have played an\nimportant and concrete part in the successes we have\nachieved to date. I am particularly pleased therefore to\nbe able to report that in the past year, in the face of\nmany difficulties, we have made real progress towards\nthe full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe new political institutions are up and working\nwell. In Northern Ireland there is an Executive on\nwhich all parts of the community  nationalist,\nunionist and republican  are represented as of right,\nand where Ministers are working constructively\ntogether to improve the quality of life for all the\npeople. The North/South Ministerial Council, which\nbrings together Ministers from both jurisdictions on the\nisland, and the Implementation Bodies which it\noversees, are developing new ways of working\ntogether, delivering tangible benefits in areas of mutual\nimportance and interest. In the British-Irish Council,\nwe are forging new relationships, including with the\ndevolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.\nWe are firmly committed to ensuring that all\nother aspects of the Agreement are implemented in full.\nPolicing reform is a vital part of the new\ndispensation we are striving to create in Northern\nIreland. All sides of the community want to see an\neffective, accountable policing service to which they\ncan give allegiance and which young people, whatever\ntheir background, can join. The Agreement promised a\nnew beginning in this area, and the Patten Report set\nout how it can be achieved. It is now crucially\nimportant that the legislative proposals currently before\nParliament at Westminster secure that outcome.\nThe Agreement also contains extensive\ncommitments in the area of human rights, and we are\nworking to ensure that they are delivered. My\nGovernment has established an independent Human\nRights Commission, with a mandate and remit that\nsurpass the standards set in the Paris Principles. We are\nin the process of appointing its members. We look\nforward to the Commission working closely with its\ncounterpart in the North for the protection and\npromotion of human rights throughout the island of\nIreland.\nWe also need to see continued progress towards\nsecurity and justice arrangements appropriate to a\nsociety in which peace will become the norm, and to\nsee the question of arms resolved for all time. To this\nend, we have made great strides forward in recent\nmonths.\nOur task in the peace process has always been\nmore than the putting in place of a new set of\ninstitutions and arrangements, important though they\nundoubtedly are. We are endeavouring to create a new\nbeginning for what has been a deeply divided society, a\nnew beginning where the divisions of the past are\novercome. The task which the Irish Government has set\nitself is to work with others in peace and partnership,\nand in a spirit of mutual tolerance and respect, building\ntogether a better future for all of the people of Ireland.\nThis demands patience, persistence and perseverance.\nA great deal remains to be done.\nFar too many people continue to have their lives\nblighted by sectarianism and hatred. There are still\nthose who prefer to foster division, retarding rather\nthan advancing the cause of reconciliation. On both\nsides there are still small groups of dissidents prepared\nto use violence to bring down the Agreement and to\nfrustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the\npeople. They have nothing to offer, and they will not be\nallowed to succeed.\nIn Northern Ireland many people have yet to\nexperience the full benefits of change and the return of\nhope and normality to their lives. Some remain\nsceptical about the benefits of the Agreement. But,\nworking together with the British Government and with\nthe representatives of all sides of the community, we\nwill continue to do all in our power to convince them\nthat the Agreement represents not only a balanced and\nhonourable accommodation, but also the only way\nforward.\nThe international community has made an\nimportant contribution to our achievements to date.\nWithout the support and encouragement of the\ninternational community, we could not have come so\nfar. When we embarked on our journey towards peace,\nwe knew that it would take a great deal of time and of\n24\n\nwork to see the Agreement implemented in full. We\nremain firmly committed to the task and take heart\nfrom the substantial progress we have made and draw\ncourage from the international community's continued\nsupport.\nIn the course of my statement I have set out my\nGovernment's position on the key issues facing the\nUnited Nations. It is this approach and commitment\nthat will inform our actions if we are elected to the\nSecurity Council. Ireland is standing for election after\n20 years absence from the Council. We do so as a small\nState which has already made a significant contribution\nto the work of this Organization. Faithful to the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter, we have faced\nand tried to overcome the legacies of strife and\nunderdevelopment that have marked our own history.\nMembership of the Security Council will allow us to\nbring to the service of all the lessons of our own\nexperience, as well as our full commitment to the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "It gives me great\npleasure to address the Assembly under the leadership\nof Mr. Harri Holkeri. I offer him our heartiest\ncongratulations on his election to preside over this first\nsession of the new millennium and assure him of the\ntotal support and cooperation of my delegation.\nWe would like also to thank Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, for the\nexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This\nyear again, we wish to compliment the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his remarkable leadership\nin the conduct of the work of the United Nations. We\npay special tribute also to the President of the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly and to the\nSecretary-General for their imaginative and tireless\nefforts in achieving the resounding success of the\nMillennium Summit, held here just a few weeks ago.\nWe also wish to welcome Tuvalu as the newest\nMember of the United Nations family.\nDuring that historic Summit \u2014 the largest\ngathering of heads of State or Government the world\nhas ever seen \u2014 the relevance and importance of the\nUnited Nations in a global society was emphasized.\nWorld leaders pledged most prominently their\ncommitment to ensuring that the United Nations adapts\nto the new era and strengthens its capacity to deal with\nthe challenges of maintaining peace and security,\neliminating poverty and promoting development and\nprogress for the benefit of all humanity.\n13\n\nSince its inception, the United Nations has been a\nbeacon of hope to mankind for a more secure and\nprosperous world. The recently adopted Millennium\nDeclaration provides fresh impetus to the United\nNations to rededicate itself to the fulfilment of the lofty\nideals of our Organization, namely to uphold world\npeace and security and promote cooperation and\ndevelopment in all areas of human endeavour.\nThe maintenance of world peace and security\nremains the biggest challenge for our Organization.\nThe continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the\nthreat of a nuclear disaster represent a major\nimpediment to the maintenance of peace and security.\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the feeling of\ninsecurity created by nuclear militarization has\ndiminished, but the international community's\naspiration to global disarmament and the complete\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction within a\ndefined time-frame has eluded us.\nWe welcome all the efforts the international\ncommunity is making towards achieving universal\nacceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). Yet more than 30,000 nuclear\nweapons are deployed around the world, including\nweapons that are still maintained in a high state of\nreadiness. The risk that nuclear weapons may explode,\nwhether by design or by accident, is ever growing. My\ndelegation is convinced that the early convening of an\ninternational conference on nuclear disarmament to\naddress issues of global denuclearization, including the\ntotal elimination of all existing nuclear weapons within\na specific time-frame, is of critical importance. Such a\nconference would allow all States, most importantly\nthose possessing nuclear capabilities and which do not\nfall under the purview of the NPT and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), to\nvoice their concerns and contribute substantially\ntowards achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.\nThis is a debt we owe to generations yet unborn.\nThe role of the Security Council in the crucial\narea of international peace and security is evident.\nHowever, this central organ of our Organization will be\nrendered even more effective if it is further\nstrengthened to make it respond positively to the\nemerging new realities which the new millennium is\nbound to confront.\nMembers of the United Nations attach great\nimportance to the need for reform of this supreme\nbody. It is to be noted that under the existing provisions\nof the Charter, which date back from a time when two\nthirds of the Members of the United Nations were still\nunder colonial rule, a handful of States on the Security\nCouncil have the power to make decisions that bind the\nwhole membership. Such a mode of operation is\ncompletely out of tune with today's realities, and, for\nthis institution to retain its credibility, it should\nundergo a comprehensive reform, taking into\nconsideration proper and equitable geographical\nrepresentation.\nIn this regard, Mauritius supports the position of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) on the expansion and\nrepresentativity of the Security Council, and we look\nforward to an early conclusion of the work of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council.\nWe support an increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, and we are in favour of making the\nCouncil an effective representative body that can act in\nthe interests of humankind at large at all times.\nThe meeting of the Security Council at the level\nof heads of State during the Millennium Summit was\nan unparalleled opportunity for the 15 Members to\ndiscuss, at the highest level, how to make peacekeeping\noperations more responsive. We are all aware that\ndeployment of United Nations troops in conflict\nsituations is seen as the last chance for the restoration\nof peace and, in this venture, we simply cannot afford\nto fail. Therefore, the discussions that took place at the\nsummit level of the Security Council need to be\nseriously pursued so that the future orientation of\npeacekeeping operations may be effected on a sounder\nbasis.\nIn this respect, we welcome the proposals for\nimproving the United Nation peacekeeping\nperformance, as contained in the report of the Panel on\nUnited Nations Peace Operations \u2014 the Brahimi\nReport \u2014 and we look forward to their speedy\nimplementation.\nIt is indeed a sad reflection that at the dawn of a\nnew century, several African nations, such as Angola,\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\nBurundi, Somalia and the Comoros remain trapped in\ncivil conflicts with disastrous consequences for\nmillions of people on the continent and in the\n14\n\nsubregion. At the regional level, the OAU, as well as\nleaders of the subregions concerned, have spared no\nefforts to address each of these conflicts, but we need\nto realize that no great success has been achieved so\nfar. The intransigence of the main protagonists\ninvolved continues to remain the stumbling block\ntowards the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.\nThe involvement of the United Nations in these\nconflicts has unfortunately also met with little success.\nWe need to be imaginative, and we need to explore,\nwith the civil society in each country in conflict, ways\nand means to convincingly establish that the fruits of\npeace are achievable. We need to look at the\npermanence of our interests, and these are based in\npeace and stability.\nWe also note with great concern that, despite all\nthe efforts and steps taken by the OAU for a speedy\nreturn to constitutional order in the Comoros, the\nAnjouanese separatists and the military leadership in\nMoroni have signed the Fomboni Declaration in\ndefiance of the OAU and the international community.\nWe urge the international community to refrain from\nlending any support to the Fomboni Joint Declaration\nwhich, we believe, will undermine the unity and\nterritorial integrity of the Comoros. Indeed, it is\nunacceptable that the future of the archipelago of the\nComoros be compromised by two individuals who are\nnon-elected and do not represent the aspirations of the\npopulation. We reiterate our support to the OAU in its\nongoing efforts aimed at resolving the crisis, in\naccordance with the provisions of the Antananarivo\naccord, which remains the most viable framework for a\nlasting, consensual and durable solution to the crisis.\nWe call on the military regime and the separatists in\nAnjouan to cooperate with the OAU so as to achieve an\nearly resolution of the crisis.\nWe welcome the signing of the Agreement on\nCessation of Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea\nthis year. This is a positive step, and we urge the OAU,\nthe United Nations and other States to continue support\nfor these two countries to take the next steps to\nconclude a settlement for lasting peace. Our region\ndeserves no less.\nWhile, inevitably, the international community,\nthrough the United Nations and regional and\nsubregional organizations, must continue to do all it\ncan to end the existing conflicts and prevent new ones,\nthere is an important aspect of civil conflict that cannot\nbe overlooked any longer. It has been established\nbeyond doubt that civil conflicts such as those in\nAngola and Sierra Leone have resulted from personal\nambition or greed for private enrichment on the part of\npowerful individuals, rather than in pursuit of a\nlegitimate cause and struggle for the common good. In\npursuit of their sinister designs, these individuals wage\nlong wars on and against their own people and, acting\nwith impunity, inflict untold suffering on the masses,\nincluding women, the elderly and children, cause\nrefugee problems within and outside their national\nfrontiers, and retard development and progress of their\ncountries We believe that such dangerous persons\nshould not only be condemned and stopped as early as\npossible from pursuing their unpatriotic designs, but\nalso should be made to answer to their people and to\nthe international community for the crimes they\ncommit.\nThe proposed International Criminal Court should\nserve as the tribunal of the international community to\ntry and punish such individuals and, the sooner it starts\nfunctioning, the better it will be for humanity at large.\nThe International Criminal Court will not only be a\ndeterrent for people who engage in heinous crimes but\nwill also be an important instrument for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Unless\nsuch a step is taken, the world will continue to face\nsimilar tragedies, and the perpetrators of such tragedies\nwill go unpunished.\nAt long last, we have seen a glimmer of hope for\nthe suffering people of Somalia. We congratulate the\nleaders of the Intergovernmental Authority for\nDevelopment (IGAD) for their initiative in putting\ntogether a peace and reconciliation process that will\nallow for the establishment of a representative\ngovernment to take charge of the affairs of the country.\nWe appeal to all factions in Somalia to come together\nand to take part in this new initiative, with a view to\nstopping the misery that the Somali people have\nendured for too long.\nImportant steps have been made this year towards\npeace in the Middle East. We congratulate President\nArafat and Prime Minister Barak for the courage they\ndemonstrated recently during the difficult negotiations\nin Camp David under the guidance of President\nClinton. We believe that, having reached such a crucial\nstage of the negotiations, President Arafat and Prime\nMinister Barak must meet the daunting challenge of\ntaking further steps forward to reach a final agreement.\n15\n\nWe are confident that both leaders have the capacity to\nbridge the gaps and reach a mutually acceptable and\nsatisfactory agreement. We appreciate that the issues\noutstanding in the path of such an agreement are\ndelicate, but we are confident that the leaders of the\nregion will respond to the ardent wish of peoples\naround the world for a peaceful Middle East.\nIt may sound like an anachronism, but it has\nhappened just a few months ago in the Pacific\nregion \u2014 namely in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands \u2014\nthat small bands of thugs have overturned\ndemocratically elected Governments. In the case of\nFiji, Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry together with\nhis whole Cabinet of Ministers, was held hostage for as\nlong as 56 days, in a struggle for political power. The\nPrime Minister was set free only after he finally\nconceded that his Government would resign.\nThe international community watched helplessly\nas the tragic situation unfolded in Fiji. The fact that\nthis is not the first time that a democratically elected\nGovernment is overthrown by unorthodox and violent\nmeans makes the situation all the more serious and\ncalls for the immediate attention of the international\ncommunity. Mauritius condemns unreservedly all\nattempts by any group, anywhere, to thwart the will of\nthe people by force. I am reminded here of the\nstatement of the United Nations Secretary-General at\nthe opening of the OAU Summit in Lom\u00e9 this year\nwhen, applauding the OAU decision to exclude\nGovernments that have come to power by\nunconstitutional means from participating in OAU\nmeetings, he expressed the wish that some day the\nUnited Nations also would take a similar decision. The\ntime has come for us to seriously consider such\navenues in order to send a clear signal to people who\nare bent upon perpetrating constitutional violations in\ntotal disregard of the will of the people.\nMauritius remains fully committed to the respect\nand promotion of human rights, democracy, good\ngovernance and the rule of law. These principles are\nenshrined in our Constitution. With regard to human\nrights, our commitment goes far beyond our national\nborders, as reflected in our membership in various\nUnited Nations committees, where we play an active\nrole. Multi-party, free and fair elections constitute core\ntraditions jealously cherished by the people of\nMauritius. In the exercise of our valued democratic\nrights, on 11 September last, just 10 days ago. the\npeople of Mauritius, for the seventh time since our\nindependence in 1968, elected a new Government. This\nGovernment remains committed to supporting strongly,\nat the national, regional and international levels, the\nprinciples I have mentioned earlier.\nSince we met in September last, we have\nwitnessed several acts of terrorism in various parts of\nthe world endangering the lives of numerous innocent\npeople. The hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet, the\nkidnapping of unsuspecting tourists from a Malaysian\nholiday resort and bomb attacks in some capitals are\ngrim reminders of the dangers we face at the hands of\nunscrupulous and heartless fanatics. We condemn all\nacts of terrorism and call on the international\ncommunity to take concerted action to deal with this\nproblem. For our part, Mauritius stands prepared to\nplay a significant role in the United Nations and its\nvarious organs to combat all such acts which pose a\nthreat to international peace and security.\nI had some remarks on people-centred\ndevelopment, debt and globalization. I refer delegates\nto the text that will be circulated. I will now talk about\nregional cooperation.\nMauritius attaches great priority to global\npartnership in addressing the key issues of poverty\nalleviation, achieving sustainable growth and\ndevelopment, and peace and security. We believe that\nregional cooperation continues to be the inevitable\nroute towards strengthening international partnership\nand cooperation. Regional cooperation not only is\ndesirable, but constitutes a necessary dimension in the\nprocess of the regional integration of many economies\ninto the global economy.\nSmall island developing States, which constitute\none fifth of the membership of the United Nations, are\nin a particularly difficult situation due to their\nvulnerability to a wide range of ecological, climatic\nand economic factors. The specificities of these States\nhave been articulated in the Barbados Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States. Constraints to their\nsustainable development include a narrow resource\nbase that does not allow them to benefit from\neconomies of scale, and the fact that they have small\ndomestic markets. They also rely heavily on external\nmarkets, which are usually geographically distant, and\ncosts for transportation, energy and infrastructure are\nhigh. In addition, small island States have little\nresilience to natural disasters. A vulnerability index of\n16\n\nsocio-economic and other parameters has been\nprescribed for these States in the Barbados Programme\nof Action. We urge the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations to coordinate their efforts in\ndeveloping and refining such an index, which should\nbe used, together with other factors, by the World\nTrade Organization and the Bretton Woods institutions\nto accord special and preferential treatment to this\ncategory of State.\nI wish to say a few words now about the Chagos\narchipelago and the island of Tromelin. Respect for\nsovereignty and territorial integrity is, under the United\nNations system, an acquired and inalienable right of\nevery State, however big or small. We are conscious\nthat the United Nations favours the completion of the\nprocess of decolonization.\nFor a number of years now, we have continuously\nbrought before the General Assembly the question of\nthe Chagos archipelago, which has always formed part\nof the State of Mauritius. This Assembly will recall\nthat the Chagos archipelago, including the island of\nDiego Garcia, was detached by the colonial Power just\nbefore our independence, in violation of General\nAssembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of December 1960 \u2014\nthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\nColonial Countries and Peoples \u2014 and 2066 (XX) of\n16 December 1965, which prohibits the\ndismemberment of colonial territories prior to the\naccession to independence. We have all along sought to\nresolve this issue bilaterally with the United Kingdom\nthrough dialogue, but there has been no tangible\nprogress so far. This issue has now reached a critical\nstage and we are extremely anxious to have meaningful\nnegotiations with the United Kingdom with a view to\nresolving this matter within the shortest possible time.\nWe also reiterate our demand that, pending a resolution\nof this issue, the former residents of the Chagos\narchipelago and their families, who were forcibly\nevicted and sent to Mauritius by the colonial Power, be\nallowed to return to their homeland.\nWe launch a fresh appeal to the former colonial\nPower, the United Kingdom, to come forward and\nengage in serious and purposeful discussions with us\ntowards the early settlement of the Chagos archipelago\nquestion. We wish to stress that Mauritius will never\nabandon its intention to reunite its territory and to\nassert its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago.\nWe also urge France, with which we have been\ndiscussing the issue of the return to us of the island of\nTromelin, another outer island territory of Mauritius, to\nwork with us constructively for an early resolution of\nthis important issue. There is an agreement in principle\nfor the co-determination of the island and its\nsurrounding maritime space and we need to work out\nfurther modalities so as to arrive at a final solution on\nthis issue.\n(spoke in French)\nI was gratified by the meeting, on 6 September\n2000, of heads of State and Government of French-\nspeaking States Members of the United Nations. That\nmeeting allowed us to consider and arrive at the truth\nthat the United Nations is the keystone that will allow\nmankind to free itself from the chains and other\nprejudices that hinder the evolution of international\naffairs and globalization, the two main engines of a\nbetter future for all. This meeting offered French-\nspeaking States Members of the United Nations the\nopportunity firmly to assert their determination to\nachieve that objective.\nI wish to stress that the future to which we aspire\nand in which we place our hopes must develop in\nconditions of respect for and promotion of the plurality\nof our peoples, their cultural and ethnic diversity and\ntheir multilingualism. We are duty-bound to respect,\nmaintain and preserve the nature of our world, that\nrainbow of many cultures which, through globalization\nand the United Nations, will be a source of enormous\nwealth for States and individuals.\nThe Republic of Mauritius daily lives out this\nvision of the future. Our experience prompts us to\nsubscribe to that vision for the common good. Hopes\nand dreams are built on concrete action. With the\nassistance of all its Member States, the United Nations\nmust enjoy better and greater means. Only thus will\npeace become a tangible reality. Without peace and\nsecurity, any effort at development is doomed to failure\nand the happiness to which the peoples of the world\naspire will remain dead letter.\n(spoke in English)\nIt goes without saying that, to achieve the\nobjectives of a more peaceful, just and prosperous\nworld, nations need to rededicate themselves to new\ncommitments in the twenty-first century. Our\ndelegation is ready to assume this responsibility and\n17\n\nlooks forward to a fruitful outcome for the session that\nlies ahead under Mr. Holkeri's leadership.\nI wish to end on a note of optimism with regard\nto the capacity of the United Nations to address global\nissues and to spearhead development and progress. My\ndelegation is confident that our Organization and its\nspecialized agencies are poised to play an even greater\nrole in global reconstruction. We live in a highly\ndemanding world. It wants results, seeks accountability\nand is not ready to condone failures. We all have a\nresponsibility to make the world a safer place and to\nensure a better future for our people. We can do it. Let\nus do it.\nBefore I conclude, however, I wish to take this\nopportunity to confirm the candidature of Mauritius for\nelection to one of the non-permanent seats in the\nSecurity Council in the elections that are scheduled to\ntake place next month. As far back as January 2000,\nMauritius announced to all countries of the East\nAfrican region that we would seek election to a non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council. At that time,\nMauritius was the only declared candidate. The\nGovernment of Mauritius considers itself fully\nqualified to serve on the Security Council, which is the\nsupreme organ of the United Nations, in the larger\ninterests of peace and security and to contribute in a\nsubstantial measure to the important work of our\nOrganization.\nAs a multi-party democracy in a multi-ethnic\nsociety, Mauritius has a track record in international\nrelations and we consider that the standing of the\nSecurity Council depends upon that of its constituent\nmembers. The Security Council will be called upon to\ntake important decisions in the interests of peace and\nsecurity and it is important that the Security Council\nact as a homogeneous body. It is the wish of my\ncountry that our candidature be considered on its\nmerits. We will very much appreciate the General\nAssembly's support in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " wish at\nthe very outset to convey to the countries and\ninstitutions represented here a message of sincere\nfriendship from the people of Niger along with its\nfervent wish to maintain and continue to strengthen the\nlinks of peaceful coexistence and of fruitful and\nmutually beneficial cooperation with all the other\npeoples of the world.\nMy warm welcome and hearty congratulations go\nto Tuvalu, the latest country to join the United Nations\nfamily.\nWith the 24 November 1999 presidential\nelections and the 31 December 1999 legislative\nelections, our people emerged from a period of political\ninstability and economic decline with every confidence\nin the resiliency of the democratic institutions\nestablished by our 18 July 1999 constitution, and with\nstrengthened determination to ensure that the universal\nideals of peace, freedom, justice and equity will prevail\nin Niger, throughout Africa, and everywhere in the\nworld.\n34\n\nWe are participating in this great gathering at the\nbeginning of the twenty-first century, proud of being\namong the democratic nations and committed, at home\nand internationally, to the establishment of institutional\nand legal provisions based on free and equal\nparticipation by all, on transparency, on responsibility\nand on solidarity.\nToday's Niger is experiencing the same freeing of\ncreative forces that results from the triumph of\nfreedom, and the same upsurge in individual and\ncollective initiative that is today being generated in\ndemocratic societies everywhere. We are no less\noptimistic about the inevitable triumph of the universal\nvalues of which the General Assembly is the shrine.\nBut we also feel the same wrenching pain over the\nuncertain future caused by the persistence of conflicts\nand the destitution of the vast majority who are crushed\nbeneath the burden of debt, endemic diseases, illiteracy\nand, above all, the troubling inadequacies of the\nremedies prescribed to deal effectively with the ills\nafflicting humankind.\nHence our even more profound attachment to the\nprinciples and ideals of the Charter and our full\nconviction that the United Nations, which is at risk of\nbeing out of step with current developments towards\nincreasingly participatory management of our common\npublic resources, will undertake the necessary reforms\nto make its institutions and organs more responsive to\nthe aspirations of the people they are supposed to\nrepresent.\nRefashioning the Organization to match the new\ncentury that is beginning, to make it a real instrument\nof change and to renew our hope goes far beyond\nsimply restructuring its main bodies, subsidiary bodies\nand specialized agencies. We must also strive\nvigorously to open up the entire system to increasingly\nactive partners, such as Parliaments, governmental\nregional organizations, non-governmental organizations,\norganizations of civil society, the media and the private\nsector, without ever losing sight of the primary\nvocation of the United Nations as an expression of the\nnational will of Member States. This would greatly\nincrease the international community's capacity for\naction in such varied areas as peace and international\nsecurity, the fight against pandemics, especially\nHIV/AIDS, poverty eradication, the resolution of the\nquestion of debt and, generally speaking, the promotion\nof sustainable development in the world.\nFor many countries represented here the primary\nongoing source of anguish comes from the absence of\nbasic physical security for citizens who are victims of\narmed conflict, and the unacceptable proliferation of\nlight weapons and small arms, which States that are\nunstable and economically drained have difficulty\nhalting. Other forums, including the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, have pointed out ways of resolving the\nconflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, in close cooperation with the\nUnited Nations.\nWith regard to the Middle East, the recent failure\nof the Camp David process should further strengthen\nour determination in the tireless search for a just and\nlasting peace that can restore the inalienable rights of\nthe Palestinian people, including their right to an\nindependent State, and ensure the return of the Golan\nHeights to Syria. In Western Sahara, it is time that the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions were implemented\nfor the self-determination of the Sahrawi people. In\naddition, the Iraqi people continue to be victims of an\nembargo that chiefly affects the most vulnerable\nsectors of society, including women and children. It is\nhigh time that the international community took the\nnecessary measures to alleviate the pain of the Iraqi\npeople.\nWith regard to small arms and light weapons,\nwhich are one of the major challenges facing the\ninternational community, my Government feels that\nconcrete and sustained measures should be taken at\nthree levels \u2014 national, regional and worldwide \u2014 to\ncombat the illicit trade, proliferation and use of this\ntype of weapon. In this regard, my Government is\npleased that a United Nations mission recently visited\nthe Niger in order to evaluate in the field the relevance\nof the request for financing submitted by my\nGovernment.\nIt is a pleasure for me to warmly thank the\nGovernments of all interested States, particularly of\nFrance, Germany, Japan and Norway, for their financial\ncontributions to the United Nations fund to assist\nStates in the collection of small arms, which made that\nmission possible.\nA draft submitted by my country forms part of the\nsubregional and regional initiatives aimed at halting the\nillicit traffic in small arms and light weapons, such as\nthe Moratorium adopted on 30 October 1998 by the\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the\n35\n\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\nintegrated project on security and development called\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for\nSecurity and Development.\nThe handover, on 5 June, of weapons held by\nvarious groups of the former rebellion and the lighting\non 25 September 2000 of a flame of peace at Agadez,\nNiger, create hope for a return to calm for the people of\nthe Niger and the full implementation of projects\ndesigned with the welcome assistance of bilateral and\nmultilateral partners of the Niger. In this regard, the\nconvening of the United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects next year bodes well. For the Niger the goal\nof that Conference should be to develop and strengthen\ninternational, regional and national efforts to prevent,\ncombat, limit and eradicate illicit traffic in small arms\nand light weapons through strengthening national\ncapacities in the areas of customs, police, justice and\ninformation.\nNever before has humankind had such wealth and\nso much potential to create common well-being. Yet\ntoday more than half of the world population still lives\nin destitution, excluded from the benefits of\nglobalization and of the digital revolution. We can\ncertainly welcome the unanimous will expressed by the\ninternational community to reduce poverty by half by\n2015. But we need to go beyond statements of faith to\nestablish a real international development strategy\nfirmly based on the eradication of absolute poverty and\non reviving growth in the developing world, and\nparticularly in Africa, the most vulnerable region.\nThe treatment of the question of the external debt\nof poor countries is one of the best barometers by\nwhich we can measure the real degree of the\ninternational community's commitment in the search\nfor appropriate solutions to eradicate poverty. The\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative, the present framework for debt alleviation, is\ntoo slow and too selective and comes with restrictive\neligibility requirements that need to be made more\nflexible; otherwise, many countries will remain in\nperpetual poverty. Hence the urgent need to give fresh\nimpetus to this Initiative.\nIt is also essential to cooperate closely at the\ninternational level in order to further strengthen the\ncohesiveness of the coordination mechanisms of the\nvarious initiatives for Africa, so that that continent can\nbenefit more from development assistance.\nMoreover, while not a panacea, information and\ncommunication technologies are important factors, for\nthe developing world in general and for Africa in\nparticular, of growth and integration into the global\neconomy. The United Nations has a leading role to play\nin creating a partnership framework that would\npromote initiatives aimed at closing the digital divide\nso that technological benefits will not remain a remote\npromise.\nThe recent high-level debate of the Economic and\nSocial Council on the role of information technology\nhighlighted in a timely manner the urgent need to make\nthe digital revolution a tool for development and to\nfairly distribute its benefits through international\ncooperation. My country also fully supports the\nrecommendation of the high-level expert group,\ncontained in the Secretary-General's report, calling for\nuniversal access to new technology to be set out in a\nGeneral Assembly resolution as a basic human right.\nThe global partnership against AIDS in Africa,\nwhose vitality was demonstrated during the Durban\nConference, must henceforth be based, among other\nthings, on the mobilization of sufficient resources, on\nprevention and on access to drugs.\nIn an altogether different area, my delegation\nbelieves that particular attention should be given to the\ninsidious problem of malaria. Increasingly resistant to\nthe medical treatment used so far, this illness \u2014 which\nabove all affects the most vulnerable populations of\nwomen and children \u2014 is currently a source of\nprofound concern for Africa. This was confirmed by\nthe recent summit of heads of State held at Abuja,\nNigeria, on the issue. That meeting highlighted the\nimportance of preventive action and of increasing the\nmeans to combat malaria. There is thus a need for the\ninternational community to give this problem the full\nattention it deserves and to contribute further to\nmobilizing the necessary resources for the research,\nprevention, treatment and eradication of that disease.\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, the time\nis certainly right to rethink development. As the\nSecretary-General said at the tenth session of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), held in Bangkok, the time has indeed\ncome for a new global deal for least developed\ncountries. That new global compact will be aimed at\n36\n\ncorrecting imbalances and at making it possible for\neveryone to participate in the new world economy and\nto share equally in its benefits. Today, it is undeniable\nthat globalization has been accompanied by heightened\ninequalities and that, given the way it has evolved, it\nwill not be able to meet the expectations of poor\ncountries, whose rural and urban populations are\npaying a heavy social price for that process.\nMoreover, the failure of the recent World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Conference in Seattle has\ncompromised the launching of what was supposed to\nbe the development cycle that was finally to make it\npossible to attain the benefits of the much-touted trade\nliberalization. That development, it has been said in\npassing, is constantly being slowed by the\nprotectionism of industrialized countries.\nThe United Nations, as the democratic and\nuniversal body with the mandate to achieve the\nobjectives of development, must more than ever\npromote reform and coordination of the international\nmechanisms of trade and finance. To that end, our\ncommon Organization has the necessary moral\nauthority to regulate the process of globalization in the\ncommon interest of all. There is therefore a need to\nstrengthen its role and to put in place rules for good\nglobal governance that are capable of promoting \u2014 in\nthe words of that hallowed phrase \u2014 globalization with\na human face.\nWith the holding in 2001 of the international\nconference on financing for development and the third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, we hold out the resolute hope that there will\nbe greater mobilization of financial resources, better\ncoordination of policies and more effective cooperation\namong development actors, in particular among\nGovernments, the United Nations system, international\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and civil\nsociety, so as to achieve the major objectives of\npoverty eradication and development.\nThe praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations to\npromote and consolidate new and restored democracies\ndeserves strong support, as that is in keeping with the\nwill of our Organization to meet the aspirations of the\npeoples of the world.\nWe in Niger fully appreciate all the valuable\nassistance given by the United Nations system and\nfriendly countries for the restoration of democracy.\nAfter more than a decade of political and institutional\ninstability, Niger \u2014 one of the least developed\ncountries of the world, which is bowing under the\nweight of the debt burden and the impact of the\ndownward trend in official development assistance and\nof climatic vagaries \u2014 has seen a return to democracy,\nin accordance with the profound aspirations of our\npeople. However, as was so well put in his swearing-in\nstatement by the President of the Republic, Mr.\nMamadou Tandja,\n\u201cWe are aware that the support of the\ninternational community is essential to succeed in\nthis recovery. We therefore appeal to all countries\nthat support peace and solidarity and to\ninternational organizations to accompany us in\nour efforts, on the basis of mutual beneficial\ninterests and with strict respect for national\nsovereignty.\u201d\nWe would like formally to reiterate here our\ngratitude to the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\nUnited Nations Children's Fund and all of Niger's\ndevelopment partners for the invaluable support they\nhave constantly given my country and its people during\ntheir most difficult times.\nBy chance the schedule has it that Niger is\nspeaking just before the end of the general debate of\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the socalled Millennium Assembly. What, then, could be\nmore natural than for me to conclude my statement by\nrepeating our satisfaction with the outstanding work\ndone by our brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of the\nuniversal Organization? Whether it be in the area of\nmaintaining international peace and security or that of\ndeveloped countries' providing development assistance\nto the least developed, the Secretary-General deserves\nour full trust, support and encouragement.\nNamibia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, your predecessor, Mr. President,\nwas a good President. His old companion in the\nstruggle, the late Mr. Johnny Makatini, as demanding\nas he was in his lifetime, would have been as proud as\nwe at seeing the unequalled diplomatic talents Mr.\nGurirab displayed for a whole year. I pay humble\ntribute to him here on behalf of Niger. I say to him:\n\nTheo, you will always be a freedom fighter.\n\nAs for you, Mr. President, we know that the torch\nthat has been passed to you is in good hands. Your\npersonal competence and Finland's tradition of always\nstanding with the weakest leads us fervently to believe\nthat the Millennium Summit's conclusions will find in\nyou a true and committed advocate, so that at last our\nOrganization can acquire the new habits required by\nthe advent of the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the Burundi delegation and on my own\nbehalf, I first congratulate you warmly, Sir, on your\nelection to lead the work of the current session. Your\nelection is an honour and a sign of the great esteem in\nwhich the United Nations family holds you and your\ncountry, Finland, which maintains friendly, cooperative\nrelations with Burundi.\nI would further like to pay a well deserved tribute\nto your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, who\nmasterfully led the work of the previous session. We\nparticularly appreciated his competence, dedication and\nhigh level of commitment to successfully fulfilling his\nmandate.\nI also salute the dynamic and innovative work of\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, to achieve\npeace, security and development throughout the world.\nMy delegation greatly appreciates his report, \u201cWe the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twentyfirst century\u201d, which undertakes a painstaking and\nuncompromising analysis of the great challenges of\nthese times and proposes an approach to overcoming\nthem so that it will be possible to live in a world free\nfrom want and fear, in a world that meets our\naspirations.\nFinally, it is my pleasure to welcome warmly\nTuvalu as a new Member of our Organization, and at\nthe same time to congratulate it on its wise decision to\nour ranks at this beginning of the new millennium.\nMy delegation unreservedly supports and\nendorses the Millennium Declaration, adopted by our\nheads of State and Government on 8 September 2000.\nWe very much hope that its pertinent\nrecommendations, made by almost all the world's\nleaders, will not become a dead letter. The United\nNations, and each country in particular, must\nimplement the appropriate strategies to translate the\nrecommendations into concrete actions that can\nimprove the future of our populations and peoples \u2014 in\nparticular the most disadvantaged.\nAt one of the meetings of the Millennium\nSummit, which concluded on 8 September 2000, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\nBurundi, speaking on behalf of the head of State,\nstated:\n\u201cThe Burundian people are in the process of\nturning a page in their history. The agreement on peace\nand national reconciliation was signed on 28 August in\nArusha, Tanzania, before the eyes of the entire world,\nwhich hailed the occasion. This was a qualitative leap\n12\n\nforward towards a better future for the Burundian\npeople.\u201d (A/55/PV.7)\nLater the Minister said, however:\n\u201cEverything has not yet been resolved ... the\ngreatest remaining challenge is ending the war,\nwithout which the implementation of the\nagreement is practically impossible.\u201d (ibid.)\nThe end to the war was to have been negotiated\nyesterday, 20 September, at a meeting scheduled in\nNairobi between the Government and the rebels, and\nbefore the heads of State of the region. The President\nof the Republic himself represented the Government.\nThe heads of State of the region and, of course, the\nmediator were also there. The three political parties\nthat had not signed the 28 August peace agreement\nwere also there, and they signed the agreement. Thus\nthe maximum number of parties have now accepted\nthis agreement.\nAs for the rebels, only one movement, the FNL,\nwas represented by its leader. The head of the other\nmovement \u2014 the CNDD-FDD, which is the more\nimportant group \u2014 did not make the trip. The two\nmovements refused to negotiate anything or to meet\nwith the Government delegation. Rather, they\ncontented themselves with repeating their\npreconditions and pleading that they had to consult\ntheir rank and file before making any commitments.\nThus the meeting was a failure. The hopes of the\nBurundi people of seeing the violence come to an end\nwere dashed. The implementation of the peace\nagreement has been called into question. The\nsignatories to the agreement on peace and national\nreconciliation \u2014 negotiated two years ago \u2014 are now\naccused of being traitors and men of straw, and are\nbeing asked to return to the negotiating table. Those\ntaking part in the rebel uprising go so far as to call into\nquestion the good faith of the leaders who sponsored\nthe negotiations and the signing of the peace\nagreement.\nBefore denouncing the 28 August peace\nagreement, the rebel uprising had hidden itself behind a\nseries of preconditions for the ceasefire negotiations.\nThe two principal preconditions were as follows.\nThe first precondition was the dismantling of the\nregroupment camps. This precondition has been\nmeaningless since 31 July 2000, because the\nGovernment had committed itself to dismantling the\ncamps by that date, and it kept this promise, as the\nUnited Nations has confirmed on the basis of reports\nfrom its agencies working in the field in Burundi. The\nfacilitator, Mr. Nelson Mandela, himself publicly\nreaffirmed these reports during the signing of the peace\nagreement on 28 August.\nThe second precondition related to the release of\npolitical prisoners \u2014 an issue that has been the source\nof a great deal of disagreement between the negotiating\nparties. But since then, thanks to the compromise that\nthe parties have reached, contained in article 15 and\npoint 20 of the second protocol to the peace agreement,\nthe current Government can create an independent\ncommission to look into, inter alia, the issues of prison\nconditions and political prisoners.\n\nThat is why it has just asked the Secretary-General to send to Burundi a team of experts in\ncriminal law to inquire freely into the existence or nonexistence of political prisoners in Burundi. It is no\nlonger possible to deal with this question outside of the\npeace agreement unless one wants to imperil the entire\npeace process. The Government and the people of\nBurundi were very grateful for the opportunity they\nhad to explain to the Facilitator during his two visits to\nBurundi how delicate the problem was.\nBurundians suffer enormously from war; they\nwant finally to breathe the air of peace. Deadly, wanton\nambushes against people travelling on the roads,\nattacks on innocent people in the hills and in the\ndisplaced persons camps, theft of livestock, destruction\nof houses, crops, social infrastructure and so on \u2014 all\nof this must stop so that, finally, our country can regain\nits peace and tranquillity.\nSetting conditions to halt violence is cruel, and\nthe international community must condemn this\nattitude and those responsible for it. Given the\nintransigence of the rebels, the Government of Burundi\ncalls upon the region and the international community\nto implement the provisions of article 2 of the peace\nagreement, which states that if the armed groups of the\nnon-signatory parties reject the invitation made in the\nagreement to suspend hostilities and to start\nnegotiations for a ceasefire, the guarantors of the\nagreement, particularly the Governments of\nneighbouring States, and the international\norganizations will take \u201cthe necessary steps to stop,\n13\n\ndemobilize, disarm and, where appropriate, arrest,\ndetain and repatriate the members of these armed\ngroups and, furthermore, take all appropriate steps\nagainst any party which encourages and supports such\nactivities\u201d.\nIn the absence of a ceasefire not only do the\ninnocent continue to die, but also the refugees and\ndisplaced persons cannot return home; assistance to\nrebuild the country cannot begin; and even the\ntransitional institutions established cannot function\nproperly. Why is the international community silent\nwhen two armed movements are holding hostage an\nentire people that had pinned so many hopes on the\npeace agreement which has now been signed by 19 out\nof 19 parties \u2014 in other words, all of the negotiators?\nThe Government, as it has often repeated, is\nprepared to negotiate directly with the rebels and to\nconclude the ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. It\nwill also continue to explain the peace agreement to the\npeople so that they will support its contents and its\nprogramme. It is also continuing consultations in order\nto arrive at compromise solutions regarding the\nreservations expressed by certain parties about the\nagreement and other questions that are still pending.\nWe would be deluding ourselves if we said that\nBurundi will attain peace and security without a\nfavourable environment in the subregion and in Africa\nin general. Unfortunately, nothing leads one yet to hope\nthat peace will be established in the Great Lakes region\nany time soon. The Lusaka agreements signed in\nAugust 1999 still offer a few glimmers of hope before\nactually entering into force. However, they are an\nimportant basis for the resolution of the conflict in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The summit that\ntook place, again in Lusaka, on 14 and 15 August 2000\nunfortunately ended in failure, even though it was one\nmore chance to establish the basis for peace. However,\na lost opportunity should not discourage us. We would\nlike here to say that we very much support President\nFrederick Chiluba of the Republic of Zambia for his\ntireless efforts to find a solution to the question of the\nCongo, and we encourage him to persevere.\nContrary to the allegations made by the head of\nthe delegation of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo from this rostrum on 16 September, I wish to\nreaffirm that the only interest of my country, Burundi,\nis to maintain security over our borders. We have no\nother ambitions, political or economic, with regard to\nany neighbouring country. And we hope that the same\napplies to our neighbouring countries, in particular\nthose who give refuge to and assist the Burundian\nrebels.\nEach country, and the subregion in general, must\nfocus on problems of development. The ideology of\ngenocide, which is undermining the entire Great Lakes\nregion, and the many armed rebellions by those who\nchampion that ideology, will be overcome only through\nthe concerted and determined efforts of all States of the\nGreat Lakes region, with the active support of the\ninternational community.\nIn this context, the conference on peace, security\nand development for the Great Lakes countries,\nenvisaged for several years now, can be successful only\nif each country of the region makes a meaningful effort\nto improve their domestic policies.\nBy holding the Millennium Summit, the United\nNations chose a very opportune moment to discuss the\ngreat challenges that await us in the coming century:\npeace, security and disarmament, on the one hand, and\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty, on the\nother.\nAs is so well summarized by the SecretaryGeneral in his report, we must live free from fear and\nfree from want. Although these two goals are the very\nessence of our Organization, it must be stated that,\nunfortunately, we are still wide of the mark. Fratricidal\nwars continue to break out in various parts of the world\nand it takes too long to put the fires out. Conflicts\nbreak out on the borders of neighbouring countries, and\nentire communities are forced into exile. Given the\nmultitude of these conflicts and their complexity, the\ninternational community has only a mixed record of\nsuccess. Like other heads of delegations that have\npreceded me, I am inclined to wonder why our\nOrganization does not do better in preventing and\nresolving conflicts and in peacekeeping.\nOn this subject, we very much support the\nimplementation of the valuable recommendations in the\nBrahimi report, which was the outcome of an in-depth\nstudy at the request of Mr. Kofi Annan on the activities\nof the United Nations in the area of peace. We welcome\nthe steps already taken by the Secretary-General to\nprepare a detailed plan for the implementation of these\nrecommendations.\n14\n\nIf our Organization were to engage in some selfquestioning, we would probably find that one of the\nprimary causes for failure lies in the very functioning\nof the United Nations. The Security Council decides on\neverything, and it decides too slowly. In the face of\nurgent situations, there is too much procrastination due\nto political expediency which is very often\ninsufficiently understood by the international\ncommunity.\nOver the last fifty years, it is the same people\nwho decide the fate of humanity while safeguarding the\ninterests of some States as a matter of priority. People\nwho seek urgent assistance thus have the impression\nthat they are being held hostage or are being abandoned\nto their fate because international solidarity, so keenly\nawaited, does not materialize. My delegation,\ntherefore, reiterates the hope that we will re-think the\nfunctioning, composition and attributes of the Security\nCouncil in order to revitalize it and to adapt it to this\nongoing state of change.\nThe question of the equitable representation of all\nregions of the world on the Security Council and the\nquestion of increasing the number of members, both\npermanent and non-permanent, deserve our attention.\nThey are in tune with the imperatives of democracy\nand legitimacy in making decisions in this highly\nimportant Organization \u2014 the United Nations. Only\nsuch a reform can restore the confidence of all Member\nStates in reviving the force of law in international\naffairs, because today, weak nations are confronting,\nbasically, the law of force.\nIn order to do this the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court, the Statute of which was\nadopted in Rome in 1998, will, I am sure, be a useful\ntool to combat impunity.\nAlthough sanctions fall exclusively within the\ncompetence of the Security Council, from 31 July 1996\nuntil January 1999, Burundi lived under a regime of\neconomic sanctions imposed by neighbouring\ncountries, which was in violation of the United Nations\nCharter because it was not an initiative of the Security\nCouncil. As has been pointed out, such sanctions have\nproved to be both unfair and counterproductive.\nBecause of the adverse effects of these sanctions in the\neconomic and social area, those who suffer the most\nare innocent people \u2014 the elderly, women and\nchildren. The Security Council should therefore resort\nto targeted sanctions only in serious and exceptional\ncircumstances when other methods of pressure have\nfailed, in order to avoid causing harm to the entire\npopulation.\nThe other major obstacle to world peace is the\nproliferation of light weapons \u2014 paradoxically, in poor\ncountries. Only with the combined efforts of all States\nwill we be able to deal with this phenomenon, because\narms manufacturers and merchants form a worldwide\nnetwork that represents big financial interests. Any\npeacekeeping programme should therefore include, as a\nmatter of priority, the monitoring of flows of light\narms, since it is such weapons that are used by most\nclandestine movements to cause death and destruction\nthrough terrorism.\nFurthermore, fear cannot be dispelled from the\nworld as long as competition to produce weapons of\nmass destruction continues. Our Organization should\ndo everything it can to bring about complete global\ndenuclearization in the medium term. This standing\nthreat to humanity undermines all hopes for a world of\npeace, to which the founding fathers of our world\nOrganization aspired.\nThose with the responsibility of governing some\nof the poorest countries in the world appreciate, on a\ndaily basis, just how hard it is to ensure that peace can\nprevail in a community that is bereft of food and other\nbasic needs. A proverb in our national language,\nKirundi, says, \u201cIf you go to sleep with an empty\nstomach, you will wake up with a heart full of hatred\u201d.\nIt is no secret that the world has an abundance of riches\nand resources of all kinds. But that does not prevent\npeople in some parts of the world from dying of hunger\nor malnutrition, while their fellow human beings in\nother parts of the world \u2014 and sometimes even in their\nown countries and cities \u2014 are wallowing in luxury.\nThis means that true cooperation is the kind that\nencourages growth in production and income to enable\npeople to take control of health, education, nutrition\nand decent housing. By giving greater assistance to the\npoorest countries, the rich countries would be working\nnot only for a fairer world but for greater security for\ntheir own people.\nThe millennium report of the Secretary-General,\nsubmitted under agenda item 49 (b) of the fifty-fourth\nsession, rightly stresses the seriousness of the tragedy\ncaused by the HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout the\nworld, focusing particular attention on Africa. Of the\n36 million people who are HIV-positive, more than 23\n15\n\nmillion are in sub-Saharan African. According to that\nreport, in the same region, more than one child in ten\nhas lost its mother to AIDS. The very pessimistic\nprediction has been made that by 2010 there will be 40\nmillion orphans. Burundi has not escaped this\ndangerous epidemic, which appeared at the beginning\nof the 1980s and is continuing to cause devastation\ntoday, particularly among the most active and,\ntherefore, the most productive people.\nIn the meantime, with the assistance of the World\nHealth Organization, the United Nations Children's\nFund and other actors, to which we extend our heartfelt\nthanks, my Government has launched a robust\nprevention policy against HIV/AIDS. A special fund\nhas been established to combat this scourge, which\ncould decimate entire generations. That is why we\nendorse the recommendations of the Secretary-General\nto reduce the HIV infection rate, particularly by\nincreasing access to information, education and health\nservices for people who are already infected. At the\nsame time, we recommend that the pharmaceutical\nindustry be provided with all the financial support\nnecessary to develop an effective and affordable\nvaccine to eradicate this scourge by the end of the\ncentury.\nBefore we can be sure of having built a more\nsecure and prosperous world, we must be mindful of\nthe need to bequeath to our children an\nenvironmentally balanced planet. Unfortunately, we\nhave to say that the industrial progress that was\nsupposed to have generated prosperity is making our\nnatural environment increasingly unhealthy. We must,\nas a matter of urgency, control the quality of industrial\nproduction and the phenomenon of population growth,\nparticularly in urban areas, if we wish to safeguard\nquality of life for future generations.\nWe have often behaved as if nature would remain\nhealthy without our making any effort. Today,\ndesertification is a threat to many countries that used to\nbe covered with vegetation. Drought has invaded\nregions that used to be crossed by great rivers and\nstreams. In those places where there is still enough\nwater, it takes millions of dollars to treat it to make it\npotable.\nMy delegation would like to reiterate the\nSecretary-General's appeal to all Member States at the\nMillennium Summit to fund an assessment of\necosystems before it is too late. The result would no\ndoubt be a clear, realistic programme to protect our\nenvironment.\nDespite the difficult situation in which we have\nbeen living for several years, Burundi, in close\ncooperation with other Member States, will work\nsteadfastly to achieve the goals pursued by our\nOrganization. We hope that the United Nations will\nadapt to current challenges and to changing\ninternational relations for the benefit of all humankind.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to\nconvey our warm congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri\non his election to the presidency of this fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish also to extend\nour greetings to Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\nNations.\nThis year's session of the General Assembly is of\nspecial significance, as it is taking place right after the\nMillennium Summit. The Summit marked an important\nmilestone for the United Nations in the discharge of the\nlofty responsibilities of the Organization and its\nMember States towards the future of humankind. The\nMillennium Declaration adopted by the Summit points\nout humanity's most pressing issues and the\nOrganization's primary priorities and directions at the\nbeginning of this new era. Thus the Millennium\nDeclaration can be considered a new charter and\nplatform of action of the United Nations.\nThe question now confronting the international\ncommunity is how to translate the Millennium\nDeclaration into reality. This session of the General\nAssembly must mark the beginning of a new awareness\nand determination, to be demonstrated by concrete\nresults. Only by so doing can we further consolidate\nthe confidence of the world's people in the work of the\nUnited Nations, the largest Organization on our planet.\nThe realization of the Millennium Declaration\nwill be a long process, but not a simple one. It will\nrequire the strong determination and efforts of each\ncountry, the international community and the United\nNations, especially since globalization is having\nnegative effects, leading to the uneven distribution of\nopportunities and benefits at the expense of developing\ncountries.\nPoverty eradication and development must be\naccorded primary priority and supported so that we can\nachieve the targets set by the Millennium Summit,\nincluding the target to halve, by the year 2015, the\ncurrent proportion of the world's poor people,\nendeavouring to make the right to development a\nreality for everyone. Among human rights, the right to\ndevelopment is of paramount importance. With poverty\nand without development, there can be no peace and\nstability, let alone human rights. On the other hand, the\nconsolidation of international peace and security will\nhelp to create a stable, enabling environment for\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, in each country\nand each region, as well as throughout the world.\nTo achieve development and poverty eradication,\nthe first decisive requirement is for countries to\n\nenhance their efforts and adopt suitable policies and\nprogrammes aimed at making the fullest use of their\nresources and potential, while at the same time fully\nmobilizing and effectively utilizing resources from\noutside. The United Nations, for its part, should\nstrengthen its capacity and direct the necessary\nresources necessary to support the poverty-eradication\nefforts of the Member States.\nAnother extremely important point is that the\ndeveloped and industrialized countries, as well as\neconomic centres, must further enhance their assistance\nto developing countries in their endeavour to achieve\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. That should\ninclude debt-relief and write-off measures and an\nincrease in official development assistance to 0.7 per\ncent of gross domestic product, to which they have\ncommitted themselves.\nThe objectives set out in the Millennium\nDeclaration have long been considered by Viet Nam as\nits primary policy priorities. For example, through our\nown determined efforts and with the assistance of the\nUnited Nations and other countries, we have reduced\nthe poverty rate, according to Viet Nam's criteria, to 11\nper cent in 2000 from 30 per cent in 1992. We hope\nthat this support and assistance will be further\nenhanced to facilitate Viet Nam's consolidation of the\nachievements recorded.\nIn the final analysis, all of these issues are aimed\nat serving the human being. Human resources and\ncultural development are two closely related aspects\nwithin the overall programme of development and\npoverty eradication. They are therefore both the goal\nand the driving force of development. This is the lesson\nthat we can draw from the experience of many decades.\nIt needs to be given appropriate and close attention in\nthe policies of all countries.\nThose objectives have been reflected also in\nVision 2020 of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) and in the Hanoi Programme of\nAction. They include the expansion of cooperation in\nSouth-East Asia and in East Asia and the building of\ndevelopment triangles and quadrangles crossing poor\nregions. Concrete examples include the promising\ninitiatives of the East-West corridor for development\nand the proclamation of the first decade of the twenty-\nfirst century as the Decade of Greater Mekong\nSubregion Development Cooperation, a proclamation\nwhich is supported by the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Those\nprogrammes are fully compatible with the directives\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and they\nshould therefore be properly supported by the United\nNations and by the international community. Viet Nam\nand ASEAN will also contribute to further advances\nalong this path.\nIn many regions of the world, protracted conflicts\ncontinue, causing instability and hindering the efforts\nof those regions and the countries in them to eradicate\npoverty eradication and attain development. Viet Nam\nand ASEAN support the resolution of disputes by\npeaceful means, without interference or imposition, so\nas to improve and consolidate regional peace, and not\nto further complicate the situation and adversely affect\nthe confidence of the peoples of the countries\nconcerned in the endeavours of the international\ncommunity. Our common responsibility is therefore to\nguarantee that there will no repetition of interference of\nthe kind that occurred recently in violation of the\nUnited Nations Charter and to put an end to the\nembargoes that have imposed untold sufferings on the\npeoples of Cuba and Iraq.\nGreater efforts should be made to further enhance\ndisarmament, especially disarmament relating to\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction, and to curb the growing danger of a new\narms race, including attempts to deploy new missile\nsystems.\nIn South-East Asia and in East Asia, the ASEAN\ncountries have been leading the effort to build a region\nof amity, cooperation and prosperity, free from nuclear\nweapons; to resolve outstanding issues in the region; to\nimplement the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in\nSouth-East Asia and the Treaty on the South-East Asia\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone; and to promote the\nASEAN Regional Forum for dialogue and cooperation\nwith other countries and organizations. In this field,\nconfidence-building measures should be enhanced on\nthe basis of strict respect for the principles of non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, and\nof the preservation of the national and cultural identity\nof each country and of each region as a whole. Viet\nNam and ASEAN, bilaterally or through the Regional\nForum, will further promote efforts to develop a\nregional code of conduct on the South China Sea\nbetween ASEAN and China. We fully support the 1992\nASEAN Declaration on principles for resolving\n24\n\ndisputes in the South China Sea, and we welcome\nrecent positive developments on the Korean peninsula.\nIn order to implement the new major directives of\nthe Millennium Summit and to follow up the\nmomentum created by it, the General Assembly should,\nat this session, further enhance the process of\nreforming, revitalizing and democratizing the United\nNations. Viet Nam supports the restoration and\nstrengthening of the central position of the General\nAssembly, an organ that represents all Member States\non the basis of sovereign equality. The reform of the\nUnited Nations  and most important, the reform of\nthe structure, composition and decision-making process\nof the Security Council \u00f3 is the responsibility of all\nMember States.\nReform of the Security Council should be based\non the principles of the United Nations Charter. It\nshould ensure increased representativeness, democracy\nand equitable geographical distribution, through which\ndeveloping countries will be represented appropriately\nand will participate fully in the Council's decisions on\nimportant matters of world peace and security. Viet\nNam supports expansion in both categories of Council\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent. Regarding\nthe increase in the permanent membership, the general\npackage to be agreed upon should ensure that\ndeveloping countries from the three continents of Asia,\nAfrica and Latin America are represented; and it may\nalso take into account the inclusion of some developing\ncountries that can play a significant role and of certain\ndeveloped countries that have made major financial\nand material contributions to the United Nations. Such\ncountries would include India, Japan and Germany.\nNow more than ever before, the United Nations\nmust ensure that it can demonstrate the ability to\nreform itself and move forward with tangible steps. We\nneed to act, and to ensure that the reform reflects the\nabundant vitality of the United Nations.\nAs it participates in this session, Viet Nam shares\nthe common resolve to implement the historic\nMillennium Declaration to build a just and better world\nand a worthier and more effective United Nations.\nFully aware of its responsibility as a Member State\ntowards the United Nations and towards the\ninternational community, Viet Nam has for many years\nbeen making an effort to attain the common goals of\nmankind and of the United Nations, and it will\ncontinue to do so in the future. A very recent vivid\nexample was the proposal put forward by the President\nof the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at the\nMillennium Summit, recommending that the first\ndecade of the twenty-first century be proclaimed a\ndecade of the greatest efforts towards development and\npoverty eradication.\nIn its capacity as a Member of the United Nations\nand as Chairman of ASEAN, Viet Nam will do its\nutmost to contribute actively to the development of the\nUnited Nations in general and of ASEAN in particular,\nand to promote cooperation between Viet Nam and the\nUnited Nations as well as between ASEAN and the\nUnited Nations. We wish at the same time to develop\nclose and effective cooperation with other Member\nStates and with organizations of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Allow me to join my\ncolleagues in congratulating you, Sir, on your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. I am\nconfident that this fifty-fifth session will be most\neffective and successful under your guidance. I would\nalso like to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Gurirab, for his skilful leadership, and\nI welcome Tuvalu to the United Nations as a new\nMember.\nHere in this great city just two weeks ago, an\nunprecedented number of heads of State gathered and\noutlined the challenges facing the world in the new\nmillennium, together with their nations' achievements\nand their visions for the future. It is true that the\nmyriad views expressed differed in perspective, focus,\nattitude and outlook, but it is also true that the leaders\nof the world left the Summit having renewed their\ncommon commitment to universal values and\nprinciples and to a more peaceful and prosperous\nworld. All these were clearly reflected in the Secretary-\nGeneral's report and the Millennium Declaration,\nwhich provide us with a blueprint for a common\nagenda in the years to come.\nThis is a global agenda to meet global goals, but,\nas is often said, all politics is local and everything\nbegins at home. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is\neach individual State that must take up the\nresponsibility in its own country and region to make a\ndifference that will have a cumulative impact on the\nquality of the world in which we all live. Armenia is\ncognizant of its own responsibility and is committed to\ndoing its part to enhance regional peace and security\nand to elevate the quality of life of everyone involved.\nThe Secretary-General's millennium report\ngroups our global challenges under three blunt\nheadings: freedom from want, freedom from fear and\nthe freedom of future generations to sustain their lives\non this planet.\nGlobalization is expected to drive economic\ndevelopment around the world in order to allow future\ngenerations to sustain their lives and to make possible\nthe kind of economic self-sufficiency we all want for\nour peoples. The major task of Governments around\nthe world today is the pursuit of sound policies and\nappropriate structural adjustments to meet the\nchallenges that globalization presents and to take\nadvantage of the opportunities it offers without falling\nvictim to the hazards it threatens.\nAt the same time, the revolution in\ncommunication and information technologies has\nopened up the global market to new players.\nInformation technology and the Internet have become\nthe moving engines for economic growth and, at the\nsame time, if used appropriately, its great equalizers.\nThey hold the promise of unlimited progress and allow\neven small and landlocked countries to take advantage\nof global access in almost every area of their lives.\nArmenia is fully cognizant of this and has made\ninformation technology development the axis of its\neconomic growth. We have already taken concrete\nsteps towards bolstering the development of\ninformation technology and telecommunications and,\ntogether with foreign investors, have begun preliminary\nwork towards an information technology industrial\npark on the outskirts of the capital.\nAt the same time, well aware that Armenia's\neducational system must be up to matching this call for\ninfusing the existing intellectual capacity and talent\nwith new skills, we will ensure that education\ncurriculums include computer literacy and Internet\nfamiliarity. By 2005, all our schools will have\ncomputer capabilities with unlimited Internet access.\nFreedom from want and freedom from fear go\nhand in hand. Without a free, democratic, open system\nat home and peace and security in our neighbourhood,\nit is not possible to achieve economic prosperity.\nDuring the nine years since the establishment of\nArmenia's independence, we have made great strides in\nanchoring democratic values, the rule of law and\nrespect for human rights in our society. This year, with\nArmenia's membership in the Council of Europe, these\nprocesses will become irreversible. The responsibilities\nassociated with membership will strengthen and\nreinforce all that has been achieved to date.\nEconomic prosperity also hinges on regional\nstability. At the same time, long-term peace, security\nand prosperity in our region depend on its equitable\neconomic development and the development of\nmultifaceted economic arrangements among countries\nand regional organizations. It is apparent that the new\n\n\nenvironment of coexistence requires new approaches\nfrom international organizations. Regional and\nsubregional integration has become politically and\neconomically expedient. This is especially true in the\nCaucasus, which is emerging as a region for competing\npolitical and economic interests. We look at our\nsecurity not only in a bilateral, but also in the broader\nregional European context. We are convinced that, in\nthe long run, our national security must be anchored in\nregional stability.\nWe are confident that economic cooperation will\nhelp us transcend political problems and facilitate the\nresolution of political issues. A stable and democratic\nCaucasus is a work in progress. Still, the promise of\ndemocracy in the region must not shroud the fragility\nof the emergent equilibrium. We recognize and\nwelcome the constructive role that the United Nations\nand other international organizations \u2014 such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe, the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States \u2014 can and must play to consolidate\nthis regional equilibrium. Armenia intends to expand\nits cooperation within those organizations and more\nactively to participate in various regional institutions.\nThese diverse bodies, however, must not, by the\nuneven or inconsistent application of their principles,\nexacerbate existing regional disparities. Armenia is\nconfident that the Caucasus is in need of a regional\nsystem for stability and security and we stand ready to\nwork towards its formation. We were the first to\npropose, last year at the OSCE Istanbul Summit, the\nbeginning of a process towards comprehensive regional\nsecurity leading to a stability pact for the region.\nArmenia has adopted and will abide by its policy of\ncomplementarity, conducting relations with all\ncountries which have political or economic interests in\nthe Caucasus. This approach has worked quite\neffectively over the past several years and we believe\nthat it has contributed to the reduction of polarization\nand tension in the region.\nHowever, the region continues to remain\nadversely affected by the lack of formal relations\nbetween Armenia and our neighbour, Turkey. Although\nArmenia, from day one of its independence, opted for\nthe normalization of relations and the establishment of\ndiplomatic ties, Turkey insisted and continues to insist\non certain conditions related to Nagorny Karabakh and\nthe recognition of the Armenian genocide.\nTen days ago at the Summit, from this podium\nPresident Kocharian addressed this issue and extended\na hand to our neighbour in order that we might together\nfind a way to live with the truth of the past without\njeopardizing the promise of the future. Unfortunately,\nTurkey's response indicated that it continues to let the\nfear of history limit its freedom to act. However, there\nis no national history in a vacuum. France and\nGermany, England and France, the United States and\nJapan, in order to transcend their histories of conflict,\nwar and hatred, had to transcend the past together.\nIndeed, many nations have founded their spiritual and\nmoral resurrection on exorcising their guilt, on the\nsearch for validation through truth, on facing their own\npast squarely. Redemption and reconciliation without\ntruth will remain forever elusive.\nThe Millennium Summit Declaration addressed a\ntopic that is very important in relation to Armenians'\nright to freedom from fear. The Millennium\nDeclaration provided for the right to self-determination\nof peoples who remain under colonial domination and\nforeign occupation. In Nagorny Karabakh, there was\nboth colonial domination by the Soviets and foreign\noccupation by Azerbaijan, which was illegally and\nunjustly given jurisdiction over the Armenian region in\n1923. For a people whose compatriots lay just over the\nborder, but out of reach, such a divisive act and the\nensuing double layer of subjugation was untenable.\nDuring the decades of Soviet rule and then after the\ncollapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the\nArmenians of Nagorny Karabakh resorted to\ndemanding their right to self-determination, the refusal\nof which led to military conflict, refugees and loss of\nlife.\nDuring the last six years, the military phase of the\nconflict has ceased, and Armenia remains committed to\na lasting resolution that will provide for peace and\nsecurity for Nagorny Karabakh, with a continuous\ngeographical link with Armenia. We will continue to\nwork intensely with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group\nand wish to underscore their contribution to\nmaintaining the ceasefire regime. With equal fervour,\nwe are ready to maintain direct contacts with\nAzerbaijan in order to search for compromise.\nHowever, we think that direct negotiations between\nAzerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh would be more\nproductive, as it is the people of Karabakh who will\nultimately determine their own destiny and future.\n12\n\nIn his report the Secretary-General rightly stated\nthat today more wars are being fought within States\nthan between them. Yet no attempt is being made to\naddress this new challenge in a more effective,\nmeaningful and realistic way.\nEach conflict must ultimately be addressed on its\nown terms, and through the actions and the\naccommodations of its own peoples and its political\nleaders. What the international community can do is\nprovide not only the support and the potential\nincentives for this process of transformation, but also\nthe intellectual, conceptual models for exploring\nappropriate and suitable arrangements for the\nresolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. We\nbelieve that in designing appropriate frameworks\nwithin which hostile parties can find a common\nlanguage, reassurances may be designed in a flexible\nmanner which must be specifically geared to\naddressing particular types of conflicts. If I may be\nallowed a truism, we should think along the lines of\n\u201cform follows function\u201d. The function of the probable\nsolutions that must emerge, as well as the broad outline\nof an eventual peace agreement, must rely, we believe,\non devices or principles that are tailor-made, highly\nspecific and perhaps even unique. Without that kind of\ncustomization, we believe that generic, standard-issue\nformulas will not be well-suited to the resolution of the\nconflict in which we find ourselves at this moment\ndeeply involved, and whose long-term outcome is of\ngreat concern to us.\nFor us, peace in Nagorny Karabakh represents, of\ncourse, the promise of transforming a situation of\nhostility and confrontation with our neighbour,\nAzerbaijan, into one of cooperation and mutually\nreinforced security. We would like to think of the day\nwhen Karabakh is transformed from being a chasm\nseparating our countries into a bridge built for the\nbenefit of all the populations concerned.\nThe political document adopted by the\nMillennium Summit sets the guidelines for the\ndevelopment of the United Nations in the coming\nyears. Armenia is confident that this Organization,\ngiven its outstanding role and track record, has the\ncapacity to address the new challenges in a most\nsatisfactory manner. The vast experience accumulated\nover the last five decades can be successfully applied\nto secure peace and stability all over the world.\nHowever, in response to today's new challenges\nand new demands, United Nations reforms must be\ncarried through to strengthen this dynamic\norganization. With the proposed expansion of the\nSecurity Council, that strategic body will become more\nrepresentative, and its decisions will be endowed with\ngreater authority.\nMay the twenty-first century be the one that sees\nall nations united in shared goals and collective action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation,\nSir, I wish to congratulate you sincerely on your\nelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. This session is indeed historic,\ncoming as it does in the wake of a Millennium Summit\nthat witnessed the presence of the largest-ever\ngathering of political leaders of the international\ncommunity. I also wish to commend the other members\nof the Bureau on their election.\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay a richly\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, whose deep\nsense of duty and commitment to social justice helped\nshape the United Nations agenda for the new century.\nIndeed, the General Assembly gave impetus to such an\nagenda when, in December 1998, it decided to hold the\nMillennium events, believing strongly that the turn of\nthe century was a unique and symbolically compelling\nmoment to articulate and affirm an animating vision for\nthe United Nations in the new era.\nBarely a fortnight ago, world leaders met here in\nNew York, following that commitment, to address the\nchallenges of the new century, reaffirm their\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and\nto demonstrate political will for the new process. The\nmessage that emerged from the statements made by the\nheads of State or Government at the Millennium\nSummit was the reaffirmation of the unique role of the\nUnited Nations in offering the best, and only, universal\nframework for confronting the challenges of the\nmillennium.\nIt recognized a United Nations capable of\npromoting a new development agenda that is people-\noriented and which also guarantees greater\nparticipation of stakeholders, particularly women, the\nyouth, the private sector and civil society at large; a\nUnited Nations that has been revitalized to play a more\nmeaningful role in helping developing countries meet\nthe challenges of poverty reduction, political pluralism\nand the ongoing process of globalization; a United\nNations that boldly plays its role as an Organization\nworking for the good of all, with the confidence of the\nworld's people.\nThe conjunction of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and the beginning of a new\nmillennium provides a symbolic departure point for the\ninternational community to seek to do better in all\nareas of its endeavour. Today, there is no greater\nchallenge facing our world and no greater issue\ndefining this millennium than the debilitating\ninhumanity of poverty, its heavy hand on wealth\ncreation, its fast spread across the world, the deadly\neffect of economic insecurity on peace and security and\nits impact on the environment. It is thus perplexing that\nunder the effect of globalization, deprivation and\ninequality are accelerating globally with as much speed\nas innovation, technological progress and integration,\nalthough in different directions. Our collective\ningenuity, that of both developed and developing, is\ncalled upon to produce answers that will bring us\ncloser than ever before to the purposes of the Charter.\nWe have encountered disappointments as the\ninternational community has striven for peace, security,\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. We have\nalso sought ways of dealing with the impact of\nglobalization on international trade and investment. We\nshould not resign ourselves to these reversals, nor\nshould we accept living with them. To do so would\ndefeat the objective of development. The way forward\n18\n\nis not only to revitalize the United Nations to enable it\nto strive more boldly for a more equitable global\nsociety, but also to work together to ensure that equity,\nfairness and solidarity characterize international\nrelations.\nOn the important question of maintaining\ninternational peace and security, the role of the United\nNations has been, without doubt, that of facilitating\nconditions under which countries and peoples may live\ntogether securely and harmoniously in order to give\nfree rein to their creative talents. One important means\nof achieving this objective in the midst of violent\nconflicts that keep erupting has been to undertake\npeacekeeping all over the world. Ghana has been and\nwill continue to be a major contributor to this effort, as\nconflicts in Africa especially pose a major challenge to\nthe United Nations efforts to bring about global peace\nand prosperity.\nThe situations in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Sierra Leone, to name only two examples,\namply demonstrate the complexities of the challenges\nwhich the United Nations must show it can handle. In\nthe West African subregion, for example, we must all\ncooperate in imposing a ban on the purchase of small\narms and especially on the purchase of diamonds that\nare not controlled by the Certificate of Origin regime\nfrom countries in conflict. Unless the international\ncommunity helps by implementing this aspect of\nSecurity Council resolutions, international peace and\nsecurity will continue to be prejudiced by the greed and\nambition of individuals.\nEnhancing Africa's peacekeeping capacity to\ncope with challenging missions, through training,\nlogistics and financial support, as well as a stronger\npartnership between the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, is a\ncrucial goal if we are to return the continent to peace\nand security. That is one of the reasons why Ghana\nattaches importance to regional and subregional\npeacekeeping initiatives. However, such initiatives\nshould not become an excuse for the United Nations or\nthe Security Council to shirk their primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity in Africa.\nDisarmament lies at the heart of the United\nNations efforts to ensure and sustain international\npeace and security, conditions necessary for all\nproductive human activity. The nuclear threat of the\ncold-war era still looms large over all of us and will\ncontinue to do so until the nuclear Powers and\nmilitarily significant countries disarm. It is therefore\nreassuring that, despite the gloom that has beclouded\nthe United Nations disarmament machinery over past\nyears, positive results were achieved at the Sixth\nReview Conference of the State Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nThe United Nations must capitalize on this\nmomentum and continue its search for new ways and\nmeans to achieve nuclear disarmament and arms non-\nproliferation. It must also embark on confidence-\nbuilding measures in order to enhance the process. In\nthis regard, the Disarmament Commission and other\nrelevant machinery on disarmament established by the\nGeneral Assembly should be given every opportunity\nto fulfil their mandates through the demonstration by\nMember States of commitment, flexibility and the\nnecessary political will.\nGhana would therefore use this opportunity to\nreiterate its support for the proposal by the Secretary-\nGeneral of convening a major international conference\non the nuclear threat. We will also play an active part\nin the preparatory process leading to the United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All its Aspects, to be held in\n2001.\nGhana believes that the efforts of the United\nNations to promote and maintain international peace\nand security should rest on a firm international legal\nframework, hence the need to maintain support for the\nuseful work being done by the International Law\nCommission and related institutions in the United\nNations system. We believe that the tremendous\nprogress made in the establishment of legal\nframeworks for the pursuit of crimes against humanity,\nfor example, must continue if our societies are to be\nmaintained.\nIn the particular case of Africa, support for the\nInternational Criminal Court is not only desirable; it is\na must, since censure by the international community is\nnow very necessary in dissuading warlords and rebels\nfrom committing the heinous crimes that we continue\nto witness in countries such as Sierra Leone, Rwanda\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ghana\nrecommends, therefore, that international law should\n19\n\nensure that the perpetrators of such crimes are punished\nand that they do not enjoy amnesty from any country.\nThe spirit of compromise which led to the\noverwhelming endorsement of the Rome Treaty\nestablishing the International Criminal Court, must be\nkept alive to achieve our objectives in this field.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to\nengage the serious attention of us all. Ghana\nacknowledges the current propitious climate in the\nMiddle East as a result of the revival of contacts\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the\nhighest levels. The withdrawal of Israeli Defence\nForces from Southern Lebanon has given these talks a\nsense of optimism, and so have the meetings between\nChairman Arafat and Mr. Ehud Barak. While we\ncommend President Clinton's efforts, the two leaders of\nthe Middle East are urged to show flexibility and stay\nthe course, as the obstacles to peace cannot be removed\nwithout compromise, painful sacrifices, diplomacy and\na strong desire for durable peace. Both sides should\nremember that this is perhaps the finest hour for\nreaching agreement. The negative forces in Israel,\nespecially, are regrouping, while the younger\ngeneration in Palestine are growing more and more\nimpatient. No sacrifice should therefore be too great\nfor success.\n\nIn this new era we must have the boldness to end\nattitudes and situations that are no longer helpful to the\nprocess of globalization. In spite of the regular\nacknowledgement by world leaders and other\ninfluential policy makers of the need for poverty\nalleviation, those in a position to do so have failed to\noffer credible arrangements for debt relief, market\naccess and financing for development which would go\na long way in enabling developing countries to build\nviable socio-economic systems capable of overcoming\nthe fragmentation and marginalization being suffered\nas a result of globalization. On the contrary, they are\nusing their pre-eminent political and economic\npositions to try to control and manipulate developing\ncountries, especially countries whose Governments\nthey do not support.\nIt seems to me that the world community is yet to\ntranslate the traditional parochial affirmation of the\nneed for equity, fairness and solidarity for national\ndevelopment into concrete international actions.\nFurthermore, the United Nations will be able to teach\nlessons of equality and justice to its members only\nwhen it practises those norms itself.\nAt the end of the cold war the peoples of the\nworld heard a lot about the peace dividend. Only a\ndecade after this new concept was trumpeted from the\nrooftops, it has turned out to be non-existent. But that\nconcept can be real if the tenor of our negotiations\nreflects an awareness of our common humanity and its\nhighest values rather than the diplomatic stock-in-trade\nof an era shaped by competitive warfare and an\nunequal advantage of the rich and powerful over the\npoor and militarily insignificant countries.\nInternational cooperation for development must replace\ninequity and war.\nTransforming the context of international\ncooperation for development depends as much on the\nlevel of commitment of individuals and groups in our\nrespective countries as it does on what we do as\npolitical leaders and policy makers. In this connection,\nreinforcing and enhancing the network of linkages\nbetween the United Nations and civil society is a\nfundamental necessity. Unless our actions reflect this\nstrategic understanding of the nature of decision-\nmaking in the world today, we are unlikely to benefit\nfrom the mistakes of our past efforts.\nWe accordingly urge the Secretary-General to\nexamine ways of ensuring common, acceptable\nstandards for accountability and transparency, even in\nthe operations of non-governmental organizations with\nrespect to their participation in the United Nations. In\naddition, a greater effort should be made to build the\ncapacity of non-governmental organizations in\ndeveloping countries so that non-governmental\norganization participation in the United Nations could\nreflect the diversity of interests across the world.\nGhana welcomes the contribution of non-\ngovernmental organizations to the work of the United\nNations and individual countries, but must at the same\ntime caution against replacing the genuine and\ndemocratic voice of a people with those of externally\ncontrolled non-governmental organizations and the\nprivate sector. Non-governmental organizations and the\nprivate sector are vital agents of change in developing\ncountries, but they should not replace the voice of a\npeople, if democracy is to retain credibility.\nIn an age of globalization and of our increasingly\nknowledge-based society, we feel that the United\n20\n\nNations has a major responsibility to support the\ndevelopment efforts of the developing countries, and\nthat the international community should provide the\nnecessary resources for it to do so. We therefore call\nonce again on all Member States to fulfil their financial\nobligations under the Charter in full and on time.\nThe challenges facing the international\ncommunity, such as the growing income and\ntechnology gaps between the North and the South,\npoverty and deprivation, point to the need for stronger\ncooperation between the developed and developing\ncountries. A concerted effort will be required to\npromote a systematic dialogue between the two groups\nto find solutions to these problems.\nIt must be the vocation \u2014 indeed, the\ncommitment \u2014 of the North-South partnership to\nensure that in the new millennium governance,\nnationally and globally, rests on the recognition that the\nwealth of some must not lead to the impoverishment of\nothers, and that every person on this earth must have\naccess to certain basic social services, such as health\ncare, education, food and safe water, no matter which\ncorner of the earth he or she inhabits. Thus the rich\ncountries have an indispensable role to play by further\nopening their markets, by providing larger and faster\ndebt relief and by giving more and better focused\ndevelopment assistance, which would enable poorer\ncountries to sustain a meaningful level of development.\nIt is only fitting that as a developing economy,\nGhana identifies itself with the cause of the least\ndeveloped countries, most of which are in Africa. In\nthis connection, we fully subscribe to the preparatory\nwork for the Third United Nations Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries. We expect consensus to be\nreached on the accessibility of products of least\ndeveloped countries to the developed markets.\nOur comments on this occasion would be\nincomplete without touching upon the crucial question\nof the empowerment of women and the attainment of\ngender balance. We also wish to express concern about\nthe persistence of discrimination against women in\nmost parts of the world in spite of the progress\nachieved since the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, held in 1995. The challenges to the\nachievement of gender balance can be eliminated\nthrough a renewed commitment to the implementation\nof the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women. We therefore call on all\ncountries which have not yet ratified the Convention to\ntake steps to do so, and urge prompt implementation of\nthe provisions of the Convention. We also urge those\nwho have entered reservations incompatible with the\npurpose of the Convention to reconsider their stance, in\nthe interest of advancing the cause of women.\nThe promotion and protection of the rights of\nchildren are of equal concern to my delegation. They\nare the compelling reasons for our co-hosting jointly\nwith the Government of Canada a workshop on\nchildren in armed conflicts. It is our expectation that\nMember States will endeavour to ratify the Optional\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\nbefore the General Assembly's special session in 2001\nthat will review the implementation of the World\nDeclaration on the Survival, Protection and\nDevelopment of Children and of the Plan of Action. It\nis also our hope that the positive outcome of the just\nended International Conference on War-affected\nChildren, held in Winnipeg, Canada, will be fully\nimplemented to ensure the worldwide protection of\nchildren during conflicts.\nI now turn to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, whose\nimpact has been greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, where\nit is estimated to have affected the modest gains in\nsocial development. Statistics released during the XIII\nInternational AIDS Conference in South Africa in July\nthis year showed that almost a third of all people with\nHIV/AIDS are between the ages of 15 and 24 years.\nEvery minute six people under the age of 25 catch HIV,\nwith girls more than 50 per cent more likely to contract\nthe virus than boys. Based on this data, the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has emphasized\nthat to defeat the disease, Governments must commit\nthemselves to \u201cthe largest mobilization of resources in\ntheir history\u201d and organize themselves as if they were\nfighting \u201ca full-blown war of liberation\u201d, with young\npeople in the forefront.\nThis staggering situation must prick the\nconscience of the entire international community into\nrendering full support for efforts to control and\nminimize the spread of the disease. Ghana supports the\nSecretary-General's proposal for the adoption of 2005\nand 2010 respectively as deadlines by which to reduce\nthe rate of infection of young persons through the\nassurance by the developed partners and their\npharmaceutical industries of the easy availability of\ninexpensive vaccines. To reach that goal, we must also\ninvest in education, publicity, open discussions and\n21\n\nmoral counselling of our youth, in particular. They\nmust understand that it is indeed possible to avoid the\ndisease by exercising care, since this fatal disease is\ntransmitted in a very limited number of ways. We\nappeal to our developed partners for their full\ncooperation.\nFinally, there is no doubt that the United Nations\nremains the only instrument for confronting the\nchallenges of this millennium. However, it can\nsurmount these challenges only by sustaining the good\nwill and credibility it enjoys among Member States and\nthis can be achieved only by expediting the\ndemocratization of the Organization. May the new\nvision which our leaders have charted for the\nOrganization in this new century spur us all to concrete\naction to free our peoples, whose faith and trust reside\nin us, from fear, want and exclusion."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should first of all like to congratulate\nyou on your election to the Presidency of the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish you every\nsuccess in this task which is both difficult and\ninspiring.\nAllow me to include in this tribute the Secretary-\nGeneral who has a crucial role in promoting\ninternational cooperation for peace, security, justice\nand development in the world.\nI fully associate myself with the speech made by\nmy French colleague, Mr. Hubert Vedrine, on behalf of\nthe European Union. His declaration covered quite\nbroadly European concerns regarding different regions\nof the world and the crises they continue to experience.\nLike my European colleagues, I will confine myself to\nrepeating the encouragements of the European Union\nfor the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this historic\nopportunity now within their reach to conclude a\nframework agreement in the coming weeks.\nThe new century is a blank page. It depends on us\nand on our Organization to provide the appropriate\nanswers to the challenges inherited from the past\ncentury. The Heads of State and Government who\ngathered here for the Millennium Summit set forth the\nobjectives that will mobilize our energy for the coming\nyears. I will only mention three of our highest\npriorities. \nFirst, world peace. This is the primary\nresponsibility of the Security Council. It is therefore\nessential to bring the ongoing reforms to a successful\nconclusion and to improve the Council's legitimacy as\nwell as its representative character. To adapt the\nSecurity Council to the evolution of the world is the\nprimary condition for its ability to respond to our\nexpectations. Belgium coordinates a group of ten small\nand medium-sized countries in the quest for\nconstructive compromise formulas. Regarding the\nenlargement of the Security Council, the creation of ten\nnew seats, five permanent and five non-permanent,\nwith an equitable geographical distribution, seems to us\nto be a path worth exploring. As for the right of veto,\nwe have put forward a number of concrete and\nmoderate proposals seeking a voluntary and partial\nlimitation to the right of veto. Such a reform, a\nbalanced one along these lines and responding to the\nwishes of most Member States can, and should make\nsignificant progress in the months to come.\nSecondly, the elimination of poverty and\nattainment of sustainable development. The\nglobalization of the economy must proceed hand in\nhand with job creation and economic take-off in the\npoorest regions as well as with universally recognized\nsocial and environmental norms. There is no more\ndenying that great inequalities, differences in\ndevelopment, the lack of good governance and\ndisregard for human rights are factors which create\ninstability, both within States and among States in their\ninternational relations.\nThirdly, the defence and promotion of democracy\nand human rights. For us this requires equal\nparticipation of men and women in public life and\ndecision-making, as well as the fight against all forms\nof racism, intolerance, discrimination and xenophobia.\n8\n\nSerious violations of human rights and universal values\nmust therefore never be allowed to go unpunished.\nThis also implies a permanent quest for the\nconditions, modalities and terms that underlie common\nhuman values. Democracy  and on this at least we\nshould all agree  is much more than a statement of\nfact regarding an established balance of power or an\narithmetic majority. It is a political morality that\nincludes loyal electoral behaviour. It is respect for, and\nencouragement of the open expression of differing\npoints of view. It is a frame of mind based on a lofty\nand optimistic conception of the human being.\nI say this because, even at home in our old\nEuropean democracies which one would consider safe\nand sheltered, we see reappearing the vile spectre of\nrejection of differences, exclusion and xenophobic or\nslanderous prejudice.\nEuropean parties are again raising and exalting\nwhat is most sordid and most barbarous in human\nnature. Saying nothing or resigning oneself to this fact\nis tantamount to trivializing the phenomenon and\ntrivialization means corruption of the spirit.\nI say this also because we must recognize that our\npolitical systems, in theory well equipped to withstand\nsuch assaults, unfortunately tend all too often to give in\nto the temptation to minimalize them under the\nspecious invocation of so-called higher demands of\nrealpolitik.\nIt is not my purpose here to allege some moral\nsuperiority but simply to remind ourselves that history\nalways exacts a price when one refuses to learn from\nits lessons.\nBelgium has participated over the past decade in\nnumerous peacekeeping operations under the auspices\nof the United Nations, among others in Somalia,\nRwanda and in the Balkans.\nReviewing these experiences, the Belgian Senate\nissued a detailed report in December 1997 containing\nrecommendations that prefigure, to some extent, the\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report. I\nwill point out a few aspects on which there is complete\nconvergence between the two reports.\nFirst, United Nations forces must be prepared to\nconfront the worst case scenario. The Blue Helmets\nmust be trained, equipped and commanded for such an\neventuality.\nSecondly, these forces must have at their disposal\nall relevant information, as well as the capacity to\nanalyse such information in terms of strategy and\ntactics, so they must be able to rely on an effective\nintelligence capability.\nThirdly, troop-contributing countries must be\nclosely involved in the preparation of the mandates and\nin the management of operations. The Assembly will\nnot be surprised to hear me plead for the\nrecommendations formulated in the Brahimi report to\nreceive wide support of all Member States. I hope that\nall actors concerned  the Member States, the Security\nCouncil and the Secretariat  prove their\ndetermination and their will to extend reforms to all\nlevels and bodies of the Organization. I pledge the full\nsupport of the Belgian Government to Deputy\nSecretary-General Louise Fr\u00c8chette, who is responsible\nfor their implementation.\nI would also like to point out that, in our opinion,\nthe conclusions of the Brahimi report cannot be\ndissociated from other discussions to be held during the\nfifty-fifth session, specifically those on the revision of\nthe scale of assessments for peacekeeping budgets. In\nthis regard as well, Member States will have to keep an\nopen mind in order to set up an equitable system of\nfinancial burden sharing that is adapted to the current\nshape of the world.\nAnother sensitive question manifests itself clearly\nin the light of recent experiences, namely the proper\nrole of the United Nations in relation to regional\norganizations, and indeed even in relation to the\ninitiatives of neighbouring States in a conflict zone.\nLessons to be learned from the Yugoslav crisis are not\nthe same as those that can be drawn from recent crises,\nparticularly those in Africa. The goal in this regard is\nnot to deny the merits of the regional approach. On the\ncontrary, Belgium supports the creation of regional\nrapid reaction forces in the service of peacekeeping, as\nwas underlined one week ago by our Prime Minister,\nGuy Verhofstadt, before this very body.\nIt has to do more with highlighting the fact that\nthe merits of the regional approach clearly can never\njustify inaction on behalf of the international\ncommunity or some sort of oratory diplomacy that\npasses off solving problems to regional bodies and\norganizations or to temporary coalitions. The Security\nCouncil, as the supreme authority in matters of peace\nand security, must be able to play its role, although it\n9\n\nshould certainly be possible to refer some tasks to\nregional institutions most able to take action.\nI would like to make one last observation\nregarding preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. The\narsenal at the disposal of the United Nations is not\nlimited to sending troops. Other means are available\nand, moreover, have been used repeatedly during recent\nyears. I am referring to sanctions, and in particular to\neconomic sanctions. This type of coercive measure, if\napplied by the Security Council in accordance to the\nCharter, can indeed produce the results envisaged when\ntheir use is well targeted and limited in time or when\nthey are inscribed in a realistic timeframe. But\nexperience also shows that when they are applied\nindiscriminately or when they serve overtly ambitious\npolitical objectives, their effectiveness tends to\ndecrease after a certain amount of time, and they may\neven produce results wholly opposite to the ones\ninitially envisaged. It is increasingly rare for sanctions\nto be an useful instrument. Too often, they only\npenalize populations without reaching the targeted\nrulers, who often understand how to exploit the\nboomerang effect of such sanctions.\nI would like to move now to a subject dear to my\nheart, Central Africa. During the past year, my country\nhas expressed strongly its desire to be involved in, and\nto contribute to, the mobilization of the international\ncommunity in support of the Lusaka peace process. It\nis essential that all Congolese parties engage resolutely\nand without preconditions in a dialogue, as they agreed\nto do in Lusaka. It is equally essential that our\nOrganization and its Members who have the means to\ndo so support the rapid deployment of the United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC), even though some\nof the conditions and modalities of that operation may\nhave to be reviewed in the light of the Brahimi report.\nOne thing is certain: without the presence of a\npeacekeeping force there will be no peace. Nor will\nthere be peace, or even a permanent cessation of\nhostilities, without a dialogue between the Congolese\nparties. Both these questions are obviously linked. In\norder to overcome the current impasse it is essential to\nmake progress where possible. It therefore seems to us\nthat the problem should not be stated in terms of\npreconditions, order of events or priorities. In any\nevent, the responsibility of the Security Council and\nthe international community remain in place. Without a\npolitical leap by the parties to the conflict, and without\nthe necessary material support of the international\ncommunity, the peace process is doomed to fail.\nIn Burundi, where action by the countries of the\nregion and the remarkable facilitation undertaken by\nformer Presidents Nyerere and Mandela have started to\nyield promising yet still incomplete results, it is also\ntime for our Organization and the principal donor\ncountries to act to consolidate the gains achieved and\nto set the country once and for all on the path to peace\nand development. It is in this spirit that Belgium will\nparticipate actively in the meeting organized by the\nEuropean Commission that is to be held in Brussels on\n15 September to prepare for the donors' conference\nsoon to be convened by France on the request of\nNelson Mandela.\nRegardless of how well-intentioned they may be,\nefforts in the cause of peace can sometimes be to little\navail, given the greed and rivalries fuelled by the\nillegal exploitation of local resources. Resources\nattained in that way are financing wars, which\nthemselves become a source of profit. The problem of\nthe diamond trade in conflict areas is at the centre of\nthis question. We know that war diamonds represent\nonly a fraction of international trade, but these illegal\nrevenues nevertheless contribute to destabilizing the\nsituation, encourage the logic of war and spread\ncorruption and anarchy. Belgium is active in the efforts\nto create a global system of verification. It is high time\nindeed to put in place a realistic and effective legal\nframework binding on everyone in order to regulate the\ntrade in diamonds.\nI would now like to speak about non-proliferation\nand disarmament. Last April, during the Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Belgium intervened\nvigorously to express its concerns regarding a certain\nnumber of elements that could lead to the weakening or\nputting into question the very foundation of the non-\nproliferation regime negotiated in recent decades. We\ncertainly welcome the conclusions of the Conference\nand the reflection that it triggered. That has led to a\nfavourable climate for the implementation of the plan\nof action. That being said, numerous States still refuse\nto adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, while others\nhave not yet ratified the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe have followed closely, and with some\nconcern, the debate in the United States on anti-\nballistic defence. Belgium is not opposed in principle\n10\n\nto the idea of anti-missile defence. We are only stating\nthat the political perception, the analysis of the threat\nand the means to counter it vary greatly from region to\nregion. There is no unique or universal response, but\nwhat is essential is to make sure that an anti-missile\nsystem, whatever it may be, should contribute to\ngeneral stability and to the consolidation of mutual\nconfidence. In other words, the decisions will have to\nbe taken not only on the basis of a strategic and\ntechnical analysis, but also on a consensual basis that\nbuilds upon the overall political and strategic balance.\nWe welcome the decision by the American\nAdministration to postpone its decision on the\nlaunching of a programme. Besides the question of the\nfeasibility of such a programme, its unilateral nature\nwould have a negative impact on our common\ndisarmament objectives. We now hope that this\ndecision will encourage negotiations for a START III\nagreement between the United States and Russia. Rapid\nprogress on a new, substantial reduction of strategic\nnuclear arms could in turn lead to breaking the impasse\nin negotiations for a fissile materials cut-off treaty at\nthe Disarmament Commission in Geneva.\nBelgium also welcomes heartily the adherence to\ndate by 138 States to the Convention on the prohibition\nof anti-personnel mines. Further efforts have to be\nmade in order to implement it and mobilize the\nnecessary funding to eliminate these especially\ninhumane weapons forever.\nI have dwelled mainly on peace and international\nsecurity. I would like to turn to the two other subjects\nthat Belgium considers a priority in the programme of\naction of the Millennium Summit. Without these\npriorities, our efforts in the field of security would be\nfruitless. I am referring to universal respect for human\nrights and worldwide development.\nThe protection of human rights is a leading\nfeature of my country's foreign policy. Our\nparticipation in the Commission on Human Rights will\nenable us to further enlarge our initiatives and our\npolitical action. We will be able to act more directly in\nthe fields where we have a particular interest, such as\nthe fight against racism and xenophobia, and the rights\nof the child. Belgium was actively involved in the\nnegotiation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child aimed at sparing children as\nmuch as possible from the suffering and consequences\nof armed conflict. The signing of that Protocol on the\noccasion of the Millennium Summit, as well as our\ncountry's signature of the second Protocol, on sexual\nexploitation of children, are specific signs of our\ncommon will to reinforce the protection of the rights of\nthe child.\nI would like to reiterate my country's wish to see\nthe death penalty permanently abolished all over the\nworld. I also appeal to countries that are not in a\nposition to do so at this time to adopt a moratorium as\na transitional measure. We certainly cannot accept the\ndeath penalty still being implemented in cases of those\nwho were minors at the time of the offence, pregnant\nwomen or the mentally ill.\nWe are following very closely the evolution of\ninternational law and jurisprudence aimed at\ncondemning persons convicted of crimes against\nhumanity. My country has been at the forefront of\nnational legislation in this context and hopes that these\nmeasures can serve as a deterrent and an example for\nother States. We have just ratified the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, and we are encouraging\nother States to do the same in support of this important\ncommitment.\nLet me say a few words on globalization and its\nproblems. Globalization is the expression of an\ninevitable technological evolution. It makes little sense\nto condemn this evolution as a whole, for it is natural\nand has many positive effects, but we need to channel\nits dynamics towards real economic and social progress\nfor the well-being of a larger number of people. But the\nglobalization of the economy and trade cannot simply\nmean the renunciation of our political and institutional\nresponsibilities. The risk is very real. We are already\nwitnessing a form of abandonment of responsibilities in\nthe case of Governments and Parliaments confronted\nby the gigantic challenges of globalization and the\nalmost impossible task of dealing with them at the\nnational level. In the absence of a really effective and\nrecognized global authority, the dynamics of\nglobalization could lead us into a political vacuum.\nThere will be no new economic world order without a\nnew political world order in which national democratic\ninstitutions, politically representative and accountable,\ncan play a role. This is another challenge facing our\nOrganization and its Member States. We will have to\nprovide an answer in the new millennium.\nThe United Nations system is at the heart of the\nissue of globalization, whose effects are becoming\n\n\nmore and more evident. Questions have been raised;\nnow it is time to find the answers. We are convinced\nthat only the United Nations system, with all its\nspheres of activity, is in a position to harmonize global\neconomic development with human development.\nHere, more than anywhere else, we realize that human\nbeings, wherever they come from, share a high degree\nof common aspirations, as well as the same fears, the\nsame needs and the same dreams. This belief has to\nguide us in all our actions, both here and at home.\n\n\n "

        "file_text": "Let me first welcome\nTuvalu as a new Member of the United Nations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\nan important landmark for the international community.\nWe are still feeling the beat of the Millennium Summit.\nOur crucial task now is to seek specific ways to\nimplement the provisions of its final Declaration.\nIn his address to the Summit, President\nAlyaksandr Lukashenka of Belarus clearly defined an\nultimate objective, as we see it, for shaping the image\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century, which\nis to meet the needs and aspirations of our respective\nnations and seek practical opportunities for real\nimprovement of the quality of life of every single\nindividual. This is the imperative that reality has been\ndictating to us. It is also the main thrust of the\nSecretary-General's report (A/54/2000) \u201cWe, the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century\u201d.\nBelarus holds in high respect the unique historic\nrole played by the United Nations in international\ndevelopments of the second half of the twentieth\ncentury. As can be seen from all the Organization's\nprevious experience, a stable, just and prosperous\nworld can only be attained on the basis of the sovereign\nequality of States, their territorial integrity and political\nindependence, non-interference in their internal affairs\n20\n\nand respect for national traditions. Humanity has had to\nconfront conflict and humanitarian stress every time\nthose principles were disregarded. We believe that they\nwill continue to be of similar importance in the next\ncentury.\nJust as was the case 55 years ago, there is hardly\na more pressing task for the United Nations than the\nmaintenance of international peace. All Member States\nhave equal rights to peaceful and sustainable\ndevelopment. Thus the security of no State, whether\nsmall island country or super-Power, can be achieved\nthrough disrespect for the interests of others.\nThe Republic of Belarus is committed to its\nchoice of a nuclear-weapon-free world. We believe in\nthe generosity and great meaning of the initiative by\nthe head of our State to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\nspace in Central and Eastern Europe. We are confident\nthat in due time this idea will receive a sufficient\nnumber of proponents.\nDuring this session Belarus has deposited its\ninstruments for ratification of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the additional Protocol to\nthe Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the\nProtocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. At the same time,\na continuing absence of visible consensus within the\nUnited Nations on the key issues of the international\ndisarmament process is becoming a dismaying reality.\nTo exit this dead end would essentially require setting\npriorities and embarking upon an active dialogue aimed\nat achieving progress in both nuclear and conventional\ndisarmament. Five million victims over the past\ndecade \u2014 is this not serious enough to make real\naction imperative?\nIt is crucial to maintain and consolidate the\nstrategic global parity built under the complex\nconditions of the twentieth century. In this regard,\npreservation of and respect for the Anti-Ballistic\nMissile (ABM) Treaty is a logical basis for the\nmaintenance of international stability. Its violation\ncould result in an extremely dangerous disruption of\nthe established set of interdependent agreements in this\narea. The Republic of Belarus will again sponsor the\nresolution on the ABM Treaty during this session.\nThe time-span between the two most recent\nsessions of the General Assembly has been marked by\nthe United Nations active involvement in the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, post-conflict peace-building and\nrehabilitation. We observe with satisfaction the actions\ntaken by the Security Council, more resolutely and\nconsistently than in the past, with respect to such\ncomplex situations as conflicts in Sierra Leone, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and\nEritrea, Angola and East Timor. My country has been\nfollowing with hope the developments in the Middle\nEast. We believe that the withdrawal of Israeli troops\nfrom Southern Lebanon and the Palestinian-Israeli\npeace talks will favour the resolution of the crisis in the\nregion.\nFor over a quarter of a century attempts have\nbeen made to break a stalemate in the settlement of the\nCyprus problem. It is crucial that the United Nations\ncontinue its work to resolve this crisis on the basis of\nthe appropriate resolutions of the Security Council and\nthe General Assembly.\nThe development of specific preventive measures\nfor the elimination of root causes of potential conflicts\nshould be the focus of United Nations attention in the\nnear future. It is important to make irreversible the\ngrowing trend in international efforts to define\nuniversal mechanisms and specify practical measures\nof conflict prevention and crisis management. The\nactivities of the Panel of experts headed by\nAmbassador Brahimi, in addition to the upcoming\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, are an important\ncontribution thereto.\nAs the Secretary-General has rightly observed,\nthe very credibility of the Organization as regards\nplaying a decisive role in the war and peace process is\nat stake. In this respect, the Republic of Belarus has\nbeen and remains firmly committed to the preservation\nof the primary role played by the Security Council in\ndecision-making on actions to avert threats to peace\nand security. Viewed from that perspective, further\nimprovement in the working methods of the Council\nand reform of its membership on the basis of equitable\ngeographic representation are not merely an important\ntask, but a pressing imperative.\nBelarus reconfirms its determination to\nconstructively contribute to the activities of the\nCouncil should my country be elected as a non-\npermanent member for the period 2002-2003.\nThe tremendous benefits of globalization will be\nreduced to nothing unless there is a clear understanding\nof the dire need for the international community to\nlearn a common language \u2014 that is, the language of\n21\n\nlaw. In recent years we have witnessed practical\ndemonstrations of situations in which even the slightest\ndeviation from internationally accepted norms would\ninevitably present an extreme danger not only for the\nviolators themselves, but also for the entire\ninternational community. It is an encouraging fact that\nsince its outset the United Nations has gained\nsignificant potential by accumulating all the far-\nreaching ideas, hopes and aspirations of humankind for\nbuilding a better world.\nImplementing the norms of international law at\nthe national level should become a priority for the\nUnited Nations and its partners. Today my country is a\nparty to the United Nations most important conventions\nand treaties. The establishment of a legislative model\nbased on the United Nations Charter and international\ntreaties and conventions, complemented by national\nlegislation, is the objective we must all strive for.\nThe stability of the interdependent world is\nhardly attainable when the system of international\npolitics is perceived solely as the domination of one\nState or interaction among separate groups of States.\nDifferences in social and economic advancement will\npersist for a long time. Therefore, in a globalizing\nworld the United Nations should play a more active\nrole in promoting the economic development and social\nprogress of all countries.\nBelarus supports a sharper focus in international\nefforts on the problems of the developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa. We also deem it expedient to\ntake into account the needs of countries with\neconomies in transition, which would by no means\nsoften the focus on the problems of the developing\nworld. We see no contradiction in such an interlinkage,\nas appropriate goals and objectives to this end could\nonly be formulated jointly with the United Nations.\nThe Republic of Belarus shares the apprehensions\nexpressed by many States over the environmental\nfuture of our planet. In this regard, we perceive as\nhighly indicative the debates at the Millennium Summit\nand at the Summit meeting of the Security Council.\nBelarus has signed and ratified a number of important\ninternational agreements in the area of environmental\nprotection, including the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Convention on\nBiological Diversity.\nAgainst this background, we continue to be\nacutely sensitive to the ever-diminishing interest by the\ninternational community in the Chernobyl disaster, the\nworld's largest technological catastrophe of the past\ncentury, to which Belarus fell a major victim. In this\nregard, I should like to quote once more from the\naddress by the President of our country at the\nMillennium Summit:\n\u201cWithout awareness of our joint responsibility for\npreserving the common human environment, all\ndiscussions of a fair distribution of the benefits\nand disadvantages of globalization will remain\njust shallow talk.\u201d (A/55/PV.4)\nWe are confident that the United Nations, which has so\nfar contributed significantly to assisting our people in\nthe relevant area, will be in a position to find new\nsources and mechanisms to help Belarus overcome the\nChernobyl tragedy.\nThe ideas of democracy and respect for human\nrights can certainly play a key role in continuous\nhuman development in the twenty-first century. Yet to\nmake this goal attainable, it is essential to relinquish\nattempts to use those principles to discriminate among\npeoples and \u201cpunish\u201d unwelcome States and\nGovernments. Regrettably, we must note a certain\ninvolvement by the United Nations in efforts to\nestablish a \u201cclub of countries of advanced democracy\u201d\non the basis of some random criteria. It is inadmissible\nthat the idea of the forum of new and restored\ndemocracies approved within our Organization should\nlead to the separation of peoples into teachers and\npupils.\nThe principle standpoint of Belarus on this issue\nis the following: a truly democratic world can only be\nbased on an equal dialogue among different\ncivilizations.\nThis year is of special significance to the\ndevelopment of democracy in my country.\nParliamentary elections due in October will be held in\nfull conformity with democratic standards. We have\ninvited international observers to monitor the elections\nand look forward to seeing them carried out and\ncontributing in real terms to democratic development in\nBelarus.\nEach session of the United Nations General\nAssembly is a milestone in the evolution of the United\nNations itself and the development of the system of\ninternational politics as a whole. In that sense, the\ncurrent session has been endowed with very special\n22\n\npowers. It is up to us all to determine how much the\nUnited Nations will be able to show that the hopes and\naspirations of our nations at the dawn of the new\ncentury were justified. In the discharge of these noble\nduties, the international community can invariably\ncount on a due contribution by the Republic of Belarus."

        "file_text": "Still fresh in our minds is\nthe strong plea made by the leaders of the world at\ntheir historic meeting on the eve of this fifty-fifth\nAssembly for a universal recommitment to\nmultilateralism and to the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations. Their Declaration at the Summit's\nend was unanimous and unambiguous. Humanity's\nfuture lies in the hands of this Organization and its\nability to create a new global order for the promotion\nof peace and development. It is a conclusion which the\nAssembly must take to heart if it is to fulfil this urgent\nmandate.\nI am confident that our task will be facilitated by\nour President's skilful direction. Coming from Finland,\na country that has been forged by history on the anvil\nof political, economic and social endurance, he will\nundoubtedly bring to bear on our deliberations a sense\nof purpose and urgency. In congratulating him on his\nelection, Guyana pledges a readiness to cooperate to\nmake this Assembly abundantly successful.\nMy delegation also offers its appreciation and\nthanks to His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for the\nable leadership he provided the fifty-fourth General\nAssembly.\nOur gratitude is also due to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, who continues to manage the Organization\nwith a sure and steady hand. The report that he\nsubmitted to the Assembly, \u201cWe the peoples \u2014 the role\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d,\namply addresses the many important challenges that lie\nahead of us. It is well worth our study to see what\nmeasures the Assembly can take to promote global\npeace and development through strengthening of the\nOrganization.\nAs the report demonstrates, a high level of\ntension now exists in the governance of the global\neconomy. While it has been generally acknowledged\nthat markets offer opportunities for growth and\ndevelopment, there is still the caveat against excessive\nreliance on them. As many developing countries have\ndiscovered, the market is often blind to their particular\ncircumstances and needs. Their concerns have raised\nserious questions about the fairness of the trading\nsystem, leading to much public protest, as was\ndramatically expressed in Seattle and almost every city\nwhere the Bretton Woods institutions and the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) have tried to hold meetings.\nThe message is clear: the international\ncommunity must find a consensus on ways and means\nto ensure more democratic governance in international\naffairs so that the developing countries can have a\ngreater say in shaping their own future.\nThe gap between the richest and poorest countries\nhas widened so dramatically during recent years that\nstrong and urgent action must be taken to avoid a major\nhuman disaster. For most developing countries such as\nmy own, a scarcity of financial and human resources\nplaces serious constraints on the policy options they\nare able to exercise. Despite the fact that many have\nembraced market-based reforms and democratic\ngovernance, they have had limited success in\nimproving the socio-economic conditions of their\npeople.\nTheir efforts to undertake important reforms and\nto lift themselves up by their boot-straps have been\nrewarded by a denial of much-needed assistance to\nsustain the progress achieved. The hostile international\nenvironment in which they find themselves not only\n21\n\nfrustrates their economic and social development but\nalso renders the strengthening of the democratic\nprocess extremely difficult.\nThus, while globalization has benefited strong\neconomies, it has weakened many developing countries\nand forced them into the backwaters of development.\nSevere economic and social dislocation has followed in\nmany cases, accentuating the particular vulnerabilities\nof small economies, many of which are often\ndependent on a single agriculture crop for the\nlivelihood of their peoples. While the proponents of\neconomic liberalization contend that the market offers\n\u201ca level playing field\u201d, they conveniently forget and\nfail to realize that the players are not equally matched\nand that the rules of the game are stacked in favour of\nthe strong. The weak can hardly compete and are\neventually marginalized. Indeed, it is a zero-sum game,\nwhere both winners and losers are known in advance.\nThe majority of developing countries continue to\nbe crippled by weak infrastructure such as roads,\ncommunications and other physical requirements and\nthe inadequacy of skilled labour to take advantage of\nopportunities in the market. Moreover, they must face\nnot only high production costs but also low prices and\ninadequate access to markets. Trade liberalization has\nalso led to a rapid growth in imports by developing\ncountries, while their own exports remain sluggish and\ntheir trade deficit widens. In the process, Governments\nlose much-needed revenues from duties and taxes,\nwhich hitherto made an appreciable contribution to the\nnational budget.\nMeanwhile, official development assistance has\nfallen to its lowest since the target of 0.7 per cent of\nGross National Product (GNP) was established by the\nUnited Nations in 1970. Only four countries \u2014\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden \u2014\nhave reached the mark. On average, developed\ncountries contribute less than a third of this target\nfigure, with the richest countries contributing even less.\nAssistance is now apparently seen by some as both\nwasteful and wasted, a perception which may serve to\nexplain this rapid decline. Yet for many of the poor\ndeveloping countries, such assistance is indispensable\nif they are to improve their economic performance. To\nmake matters worse, they find it difficult without the\nrequisite technology and human resource base to attract\nforeign direct investment, which is increasingly\nconcentrated in a small number of emerging\neconomies.\nThe challenge facing the international community\nand policy-makers in the new millennium, therefore, is\nto redress these inequities in the global economy in a\ncomprehensive and sustainable manner so as to ensure\nthe smooth integration of developing countries, in\nparticular the smaller economies, into the globalizing\nworld economy. Developing countries are not asking\nfor charity \u2014 merely the opportunity to develop their\npotential and to take their rightful place in the\ninternational community. As they have said, they\nrecognize their primary responsibility for their own\ndevelopment. They ask only for assistance in creating a\ndomestic environment that will enable them to\nparticipate fairly in the global economy.\nA helpful measure would be to integrate\ntransition periods into current economic models and\nmake provisions for targeted assistance to small\neconomies. Another would be to provide significant\ndebt relief and debt cancellation as necessary, together\nwith development assistance to boost the overall\nproductive capability of developing countries.\nDeveloped countries could also assist in\npromoting regional integration, as well as South-South\ncooperation, to allow developing countries to benefit\nfrom the many complementarities that they possess.\nEqually indispensable is the provision of new and\nadditional resources through the establishment of a\nglobal development fund that would help to bridge the\ngap between the developed and developing worlds. An\naction-oriented programme, somewhat along the lines\nof the post-Second World War Marshall Plan, is\nnecessary to achieve meaningful progress.\nPolicies aimed merely at creating unsustainable\nsocial safety nets are hardly lasting solutions. The root\ncauses of the social and endemic problems of the\ndeveloping countries, which ultimately lead to global\ninstability, must be addressed. To this end, we must\nfind a way to direct aid and investment into building\ncapital, both human and physical. We cannot speak\nseriously of closing the digital divide in an\nenvironment in which many Governments are\nstruggling to meet even the most basic needs of their\npopulations and where degraded infrastructure does not\nsupport a \u201ccommunications revolution\u201d.\nIn this context, we have noted the Secretary-\nGeneral's initiative to forge a global compact between\nthe United Nations, the private sector and non-\ngovernmental organizations in an effort to maximize\n22\n\nthe development effort. Such a strategic alliance can\nindeed enhance cooperation on a wide array of global\nissues, including aid, trade and investment, and\nprotection of the environment as well as satisfy urgent\neducation, health and housing needs. To succeed,\nhowever, such a compact must be based on mutual\nunderstanding and respect through a clear definition of\nthe respective roles of the partners. There must be\ncommon objectives and agendas, as well as a clear\ndefinition of the roles of each partner.\nFinally, the international community, and more\nparticularly the developed North, must recognize the\nclose link between freedom from want and freedom\nfrom fear \u2014 between development, peace and stability.\nAt the national level, we know that good governance\nmust be practised to ensure that the population are\nprotected from all forms of oppression and allowed to\nenjoy their inalienable human rights. Correspondingly,\nat the international level, the principles of the Charter,\nas well as the laws which we, as civilized nations, have\ncome to accept, must be respected to provide an\nenvironment conducive to development.\nIn chapter IV of his report the Secretary-General\nremarks:\n\u201cEconomic globalization has largely eliminated\nthe benefits of territorial acquisition, while the\ndestructiveness of modern warfare has increased\nits costs.\u201d (A/54/2000, para. 192)\nThis lesson must be learned by States which, despite\ntheir professed commitment to the Charter, often resort\nto various forms of coercion in international relations.\nThe United Nations, and more particularly the Security\nCouncil, should not \u2014 and, indeed, must not \u2014\ntolerate such actions. All disputes must be resolved\nthrough peaceful means.\nWhile many of the proposals made by the\nSecretary-General in his report will undoubtedly help\nto contain the threats to peace and development in the\ntwenty-first century, we rather fear that they will be\ninsufficient to meet our requirements if they are\npursued in a piecemeal fashion without a more\ncomprehensive and holistic framework. It is for this\nreason that Guyana sought the inclusion on this year's\nagenda of an item on promoting a new global human\norder. Time does not allow me to provide the details of\nthis initiative. However, so that the concept may be\nmore fully understood and widely supported, I have\nasked that, along with copies of my statement, an\nexplanatory memorandum outlining the aim of our\nproposal be circulated. Very shortly we will also make\navailable a more extensive document that could serve\nas the basis for discussion in plenary session. It is our\nhope that out of this consideration will emerge a\nresolution that expresses the determination of the\ninternational community to find a consensus on the\nway forward to securing global peace and\ndevelopment.\nThe time is now opportune, I believe, for us to\nsummon up our collective political will to devise a\ncommon and cogent strategy for managing the global\nagenda in the twenty-first century. Should we fail to\nheed this imperative, we will continue to plough the\nsea and reap only disillusionment and despair. This\nMillennium Assembly affords us a singular opportunity\nto define the terms and conditions of a new global\npartnership. Let us not waste it in futile debate, but,\nrather, use it to give new hope to our peoples for a\nbetter future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May\nI first, on behalf of our Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nwho could not be here, on behalf of my delegation and\non my own behalf, join previous speakers in extending\nto the President our heartfelt congratulations on his\nelection to preside over the fifty-fifth session.\nIn addition, I congratulate his eminent\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on the quality and great\nquantity of activities carried out during the recent\nSummit.\nI also take this opportunity to congratulate and\nwelcome Tuvalu, the 189th Member of our\nOrganization. We hope that other potential Members,\nsuch as Western Sahara in Africa, will soon be able to\njoin us.\nThe Millennium Summit \u2014 in which the Head of\nState of Rwanda, Mr. Paul Kagame participated \u2014\nevaluated the twentieth century and formulated\nrecommendations for enhancing the work of the\nOrganization in the twenty-first century, now\nbeginning. As a number of speakers emphasized, the\ntwentieth century was the era both of great and\nunprecedented technological triumphs and of crises as\ngreat as the new means of destruction.\nThe distressing feature of the First and Second\nWorld Wars was that they made use of the advanced\ntechnologies of the late nineteenth century and the first\nhalf of the twentieth century to cause enormous human\nand material devastation. In 1918 and again in 1945 all\nhumanity was overwhelmed by the terrifying\nconsequences of a world war. \u201cNo more wars leading\nto the loss of millions of human lives\u201d; \u201cNo more\ngenocide\u201d: these were the calls of the founding\ncountries of the United Nations when they met in San\nFrancisco in October 1945.\nToday, as in the past, the international community\nfinds itself reliving horrors that it thought it had\nbanished for ever, horrors that include the genocide in\nRwanda in 1994. It certainly was not a lack of\ntheoretical principles of public morality or\ninternational law that contributed to preventing or\nstopping this genocide. These principles had even been\ngreatly strengthened in 1948 by the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and had been widely\ndiffused throughout the world by many organizations\nthat took up the banner of human rights.\n2\n\nThe Brahimi report (A/55/305) was needed. We\nwelcome its conclusions and recommendations, and\ntake this occasion to warmly congratulate our\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, on having\ncommissioned it and the two others that preceded it:\nthe Srebrenica report and the courageous Carlsson\nreport. Our Organization had its failures, but the\nBrahimi report tells us that we can do better in the\nfuture. To miss this unique opportunity to reflect on\nwhat must be done, and how, would be to renounce our\nresponsibilities and the principles and values expressed\nin the Charter of our Organization. Another Rwanda or\nSrebrenica would disgrace us all.\nUndoubtedly, we must look elsewhere for the true\nsource of the problem. It is surprising that even today\ncountries that claim to embrace human rights are\ndelaying and using pretexts to block prosecution of the\nauthors of the genocide. There are even some who \u2014\nafraid to accept or think about what happened \u2014 refer\nto this genocide as what happened in Rwanda in 1994,\nbeing afraid even to think about it. To take just one\nexample, I refer to the observations of Minister Yerodia\nNdombasi on 16 September.\nIn sum, my delegation calls on the international\ncommunity to draw every possible lesson from the\ngenocide committed in our country, so that \u201cNever\nagain such a human tragedy\u201d ceases to be an empty\nphrase. Much more urgent is the question of assistance\nto Rwanda for rebuilding and making good the huge\nmaterial and moral damage caused by the 1994\ngenocide. Such assistance was recommended in the\nreports of the Independent Inquiry set up by the United\nNations and of the Organization of African Unity's\ninternational panel of eminent persons. All the\nmembers of the international community represented\nhere can help Rwanda rebuild and develop. And each\ntime we wish to do more for the Organization and\nhumanity let the Brahimi report serve as a source of\ninspiration.\nI take this opportunity to salute the Security\nCouncil discussions of 15 April, when the\nrecommendations of the Carlsson report were\nconsidered and the Council was urged to use its\ninfluence to ensure that they were effectively followed\nup by other United Nations institutions and agencies,\nincluding the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), from which we are awaiting special\nassistance as part of the development assistance\nprogramme for Rwanda. We venture to hope that the\nreforms under way at UNDP will lead to the provision\nof assistance based on a sincere and enthusiastic\npartnership according to the British model eloquently\noutlined by Prime Minister Tony Blair during the\nMillennium Summit. It is a partnership steeped in\nequality, justice and fraternal solidarity for all. We\ninvite all our partners to embrace this initiative, in their\nrelations not only with Rwanda, but with all the other\ndeveloping countries \u2014 especially the former colonies.\nThe reports that I have mentioned also justly call\non the international community \u2014 beyond contributing\nto the task of overcoming the devastating effects of\ngenocide \u2014 to contribute vigorously to preventing this\ncrime against humanity, in particular by suppressing it.\nThose who hide, protect and advocate for the criminals\nresponsible for the 1994 genocide should think twice\nbefore persisting in this evil behaviour.\nI now come to the Congolese crisis, certain\naspects of which can be seen as an extension of the\ngenocide committed in Rwanda in 1994. It is worth\nrecalling that after their defeat and withdrawal many\nmilitia members and former Rwandan soldiers who\nwere authors of the genocide took refuge in what is\nnow the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not only\nwere these former soldiers and militia members not\ndisarmed at the time, but they have benefited from new\nmilitary equipment and training, allowing them to\ncommit acts of genocide along the borders and prepare\nfor a repetition of the previous widespread genocide\ncampaign. Is this not sufficient reason to ask a\nresponsible Government to act to preserve the\nsovereignty of its country and the security of its\npeople? The Assembly can well understand that this is\nhardly a case of a security pretext, but, rather, of a\ncurrent reality.\nThe plan for a massive invasion by the genocidal\nforces was thwarted in November 1996 \u2014 thank\nGod \u2014 by the forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Army.\nBut from May 1997 to August 1998 it was necessary to\nonce again repel infiltrations from the Congo and to\nresist other acts of genocide committed in the north-\nwestern part of our country. The horrors of this\nrebellion have been the source of a number of\nresolutions, but the world seems to have rapidly\nforgotten them.\nIt is in this context that our country now has a\nmilitary presence in the Congo \u2014 a presence whose\nonly purpose is to prevent a recurrence of genocide in\n3\n\nRwanda by the same Interahamwe militia and soldiers\nof the previous regime. We have more or less\nsucceeded in achieving our objectives. Since 1998 we\nhave captured many soldiers of the previous regime\nand Interahamwe militia, contrary to what Minister\nYerodia Ndombasi told the Assembly on 16 September.\nMost of these soldiers \u2014 there are many of them \u2014\nhave rejoined the army. We are continuing to hold 135\nof them while they await a decision.\nWe have also succeeded in saving some of the\nInterahamwe and the soldiers of the former regimes, as\nwell as innocent civilians who had been held hostage\nduring all this time for purely military and political\npurposes. In the category of liberated hostages, 12,000\nwere repatriated since August 1998, and the process\ncontinues. We have established centres to receive them\non our borders with the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, and several humanitarian organizations,\nincluding the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have also been\ninvolved. This is a secret to no one, and it has been\ndocumented by the UNHCR at Goma and Gisenyi.\nThose who are against our successes say that these\npeople are Congolese citizens that we have forced into\nexile in Rwanda, because their departure has created a\nvacuum in the operations of the allies of these forces of\ngenocide. They are our citizens, and no one can claim\nto love them as much as we do. They are at home,\nawaiting the others with open arms.\nMy Government welcomed the signing of the\nLusaka agreements in July 1999 and still upholds them.\nTheir main principles are, first, that the inter-\nCongolese political negotiations should lead to a new\npolitical order in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo; and, secondly, that the armed groups should be\npursued and disarmed, including former Rwanda\nmilitary and the Interahamwe authors of the 1994\ngenocide, who are still attempting to continue their\nmisdeeds, encouraged by certain of our Congolese\nbrothers who go so far as to deny their presence on\nCongolese territory with the sole purpose of vilifying\nus, to judge by the statement by Minister Yerodia\nNdombasi last Saturday.\nThe Rwanda delegation deplores the Kinshasa\nGovernment's recently calling into question these same\nagreements, despite the fact that they are upheld by all\nthe countries concerned of the subregion, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Security\nCouncil. Just before that, the Congolese Government\nhad created controversy by refusing to authorize the\nfree movement of United Nations military observers;\nand that free movement would not be possible outside\nthose agreements, to which that country is a party.\nAs far as Rwanda is concerned, we believe that,\nat this time, the Lusaka agreements constitute the only\nframework that will guarantee a lasting peace in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the\nsubregion. Any other approach in this matter would run\nthe risk of dangerously jeopardizing the peace process\nnow under way.\nFurthermore, the slowness and hesitations\nobserved in our Organization regarding the deployment\nof the forces of the United Nations Mission in the\nCongo must be reviewed, and advantage must be taken\nof the current offers to strengthen the presence of the\nUnited Nations in the zones evacuated by the signatory\nparties of the Lusaka agreements. Any attempt to\nreduce the force would only lead to the kind of\ncatastrophe from which the Brahimi report tries to\nspare us.\nI should like to take this opportunity to commend\nthe growing role of regional and subregional\norganizations in resolving conflicts. As is well known,\nsuch a positive involvement has already led to\nconsiderable results in various parts of the world,\nincluding in South-East Asia and Western Africa. It is\nour hope that the United Nations will adopt a similar\napproach to regional contributions to its machinery for\nconflict resolution.\nIf the question of conflicts in the world continues\nto be one of the major preoccupations of our\nOrganization, it would no doubt be a good idea to pay\nspecial attention to their prevention. This requires\nbeing attentive to the efforts made to eradicate, or at\nleast attenuate, the root causes of conflicts, both\ndomestic and external.\nWith respect to Rwanda, the halting of the 1994\ngenocide was followed by courageous policies inspired\nby the tragic lessons of our recent history. These\npolicies were translated into the following actions for\nand factors of national reconciliation, as follows:\nIn July 1994, a Government of National Unity\nand a Parliament were established including all the\ncomponents of the Rwanda population and all the\npolitical circles of the country. This was an integrative\napproach such as had never before been known in\n4\n\nindependent Rwanda, despite the linguistic, socio-\ncultural and historical advantages that militate in its\nfavour.\nThe policy of exclusion, which lasted more than\n30 years in all sectors of national life, from education\nto employment, was eliminated. We are pleased to have\nabolished, 60 years after its introduction, the\nidentification card, which categorized people according\nto their ethnic origin and their place of origin and on\nthe basis of which decisions were taken to kill people\nor to spare their lives.\nA skilled, professional national army was\nestablished, including the forces of the Rwandan\nPatriotic Army, which liberated the country, as well as\na portion of the forces of the former regime that had\nseparated themselves from the perpetrators of\ngenocide. We welcome their bravery and their\ndiscipline. The United Nations needs troops of this\ntype for difficult operations in Sierra Leone and\nelsewhere.\nIn March 1999 the National Commission on\nHuman Rights and the Commission for Unity and\nNational Reconciliation were established.\nThe judicial system was rehabilitated, which\nguarantees the independence of the magistrature. This\njudicial system has been strengthened by a form of\njustice called gachacha, which, while keeping to\ninternational judicial norms, will benefit from major\ninputs of the population at the early stages of a trial.\nThis will have the advantage of accelerating the\nprosecution of those accused of genocide.\nIn two and a half years more than 3 million\nrefugees have been repatriated. This is all the more\nstriking since Rwanda's refugee problem, having lasted\nfor more than 30 years, is the most numerous and\nlongest-standing in Africa. At present the only ones\nremaining outside the country are families of criminals\nresponsible for genocide and some refugees whom\nRwanda wants to repatriate, but who are still being\nmanipulated by those criminals. Our head of State\nasked them to return in his inaugural statement at the\nSupreme Court, and some of them have begun to come\nback voluntarily to the country.\nDemocratic elections were held last year.\nFollowing the upcoming local elections, they will be\ncompleted in October. These are orientations that today\nguide the policy of unity and national reconciliation,\nthe need for which became clear after the genocide of\n1994.\nBeyond the eradication of genocide, there are\nmany challenges that deserve the attention of the\ninternational community at the beginning of the new\nmillennium. These relate to the gaps between\ndeveloping countries and prosperous countries in the\ncontext of globalization, the reform of the United\nNations system and many other current problems, such\nas the spread of AIDS.\nWith respect to the gap between developing\ncountries and prosperous countries, the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries saw gaps between industrialized\ncountries and poor countries grow even wider. This\nresulted from technology as well as from political and\ncommercial inequalities left over from the colonial era.\nAfter independence many development proposals were\nmade, such as the provision of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product for development assistance,\ntechnology transfers, a new international economic\norder favouring fair remuneration for commodities, and\nso on.\nAll these strategies have been the subject of a\nnumber of international conferences. None of them has\nbeen implemented sustainably or consistently. Some of\nthem have remained theoretical and have not even\nbegun to be implemented as programmes. But it is\nnever too late.\nFor some time now, we have been in an age of\nglobalization of economies in the context of structural\ngaps that have not changed much since the sixties. My\ndelegation would like to emphasize the urgent need for\nthe preliminary adoption of certain measures to\nfacilitate the establishment of machinery for efficient\nglobalization. Is there any need to recall that the\nexternal debt of developing countries constitutes, in\nand of itself, a real handicap to their economic\nrecovery? How can one talk about growth in a context\nwhere external debt absorbs 60 per cent or more of the\nexport income of these same developing countries?\nWhat will be the result of globalization in an\nenvironment where the competition of market\neconomies reduces in advance the role of certain parts\nof the world to that of eternal consumers, with the\nmonopoly on production elsewhere? These are all\nquestions that deserve urgent answers and solidarity on\nthe part of the international community.\n5\n\nMy delegation believes more particularly that the\nsuccess of globalization requires courageous\naccompanying measures, such as eliminating the debt\nfor poor countries and providing support for economic\nintegration policies, in particular in Africa. This\nrequires our world Organization to endow itself with\nmachinery that can help to guide globalization.\nFor some time now, the United Nations has\nrightly been concerning itself, at the highest level, with\nthe reform of the functioning of its structures. This is\nan urgent matter, as it affects what is at stake for the\nfuture and even the survival of all of humankind, which\ncan no longer be managed in the same spirit and with\nthe same structures as 55 years ago. We should\nremember that the number of Member States has\nincreased from 51 in 1954 to 189 today; that is an\nirrefutable argument for democratization. In this same\ncontext, Africa, which has 10 times as many Member\nStates in the United Nations as it did when the\nOrganization was founded, must occupy the place it\ndeserves in the major decision-making bodies of the\nUnited Nations, such as the Security Council and\nothers. The Bretton Woods institutions must also\nchange their character and behaviour if globalization\nand equity are to be real and consistent.\nIn conclusion, I would like to speak about that\nother challenge for our times: the AIDS pandemic. This\ndisease is currently responsible for the loss of more\nhuman lives that the most deadly wars. The people of\nthe poorest countries are the most vulnerable in the\nface of this disease of the century. The delegation of\nRwanda would like, from this rostrum, to make an\nurgent appeal to the international community to show\nsolidarity in the face of the threat of extinction of the\nhuman race that AIDS represents. Put simply, taking\nAIDS lightly trivializes the crime of genocide. Both are\nexterminating people and should be combated with\nvigour and determination.\nMore specifically, aid should be provided for\nhumanitarian \u2014 if for no other \u2014 reasons, so that the\nleast developed countries can benefit from the most up-\nto-date medicines, at affordable prices, that can provide\nrelief from people suffering from AIDS and do all that\nthey can to contain this scourge.\nFurthermore, my delegation is convinced that an\neffort to mobilize the greatest possible financial\nresources would enable scientific research to take place\nto bring this disease, and others, such as malaria, which\nare devastating a large part of the population, under\ncontrol.\nWe hope that the twenty-first century, which is\njust beginning, will usher in a world of peace and\nsolidarity that will meet the greatest aspirations of\nhumanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First, I would like to\nextend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, a\nformer Prime Minister of the Republic of Finland, on\nyour assumption of the office of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.\n\nI would also like to pay my respects to Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, Foreign Minister of the Republic of\nNamibia, for all his efforts during his tenure as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession.\nIt is also my great pleasure to welcome the\nadmission of Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\nNations.\nBefore proceeding to my main topic, I would like\nto mention two important developments that took place\nin the international community in recent months.\nConcerning the situation on the Korean peninsula, the\nrecent inter-Korean summit was indeed epoch-making\nand I strongly hope that this positive development will\ncontinue, advance in the future and lead to peace and\nstability in North-East Asia. With regard to the Middle\nEast peace process, Japan is very much encouraged by\nthe commitment of both parties to continuing their\nnegotiations and, together with the international\ncommunity, will strongly support the efforts of the\nparties to achieve a lasting peace in the region.\nIn order to ensure that the twenty-first century is\ntruly a century of peace, it is of the greatest importance\nthat the international community make united efforts to\naddress the issues of disarmament and non-\nproliferation.\nIn 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki became the first\ntwo cities in human history to suffer indescribable\nnuclear devastation. That experience is the starting\npoint of Japan's actions aimed at the realization of a\nworld free of nuclear weapons. With succeeding\ngenerations in this half-century, the extremely shocking\nexperiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki might very\nwell be pushed to the edge of our memory. In such\ncircumstances, new signs of proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and missiles are arousing our concern. I\nbelieve, however, that engraving the tragic experiences\nof Hiroshima and Nagasaki in our minds is the first\nstep toward the creation of a world free from the\nnuclear threat, which is one of the biggest challenges\nfacing the United Nations. In light of such experiences,\nJapan has maintained the three non-nuclear principles\nas its fundamental national policy and has focused\nparticular attention on nuclear issues. It will continue\nto stress the importance of this issue.\nSince the Second World War, we have adopted as\nthe basic ideas of our nation: democracy, commitment\nto peace and respect for fundamental human rights,\nwhich are enshrined in the Japanese Constitution.\nMoreover, under its basic policy of not becoming a\nmilitary power, Japan has mobilized all its available\nresources for the prosperity of its people and achieved\neconomic development. It hopes to utilize that\nexperience and make a further contribution to the\neconomic development and enhancement of the welfare\nof developing countries.\nThroughout my political career, I have been\ndeeply committed to nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation issues. A senior politician for whom I\nhave great respect once told me with great fervour:\nI hope that somebody among the peoples\nof the world will take the lead in advocating\npeace, and that all others will cooperate for that\ncause, so that the earth will avoid a crisis. I\nbelieve that Japan must play the role of that\nsomebody.\nThese words have become my political credo, as\nwell as the resolve of many Japanese people. When I\nwas Foreign Minister in 1994, Japan submitted to the\nGeneral Assembly for the first time a resolution\nentitled Nuclear disarmament with a view to the\nultimate elimination of nuclear weapons (49/75 H),\nwhich gained the support of an overwhelming majority\nof Member States. Japan's support of the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995 is attributed to the\nstrong will of the Japanese people. I highly appreciate\nthe final document adopted at the 2000 NPT Review\nConference this spring, since it contains practical steps\nto be taken in the future in the fields of nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, including an\nunequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total\nelimination of nuclear arsenals. I also appreciate the\npostponement by the United States Government of its\ndecision to deploy a national missile defence, as a\nresult of prudent consideration with an emphasis on\nfurther dialogue on this important issue. Japan hopes\nthat this announcement will inspire a further deepening\nof the discussion on issues surrounding national missile\ndefence. I hope other countries respond to this move by\ntaking actions to avoid a vicious circle of an arms race\nand to create a beneficent circle toward nuclear\ndisarmament. The international community must\ncontinue its efforts aimed at non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and demand that the\nnuclear weapon States further reduce their nuclear\narsenals. This will definitely require a further reduction\n14\n\nby the United States and Russia in their nuclear\nweapons through the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks\n(START), as well as efforts by other nuclear weapon\nStates, unilaterally or through their negotiations, to\nreduce their nuclear arsenals. I also believe that we\nmust seriously consider what kind of practical paths we\nshould take to realize a world free from the fear of\nnuclear weapons. A world free of nuclear weapons is\nnot a dream; it is within our reach.\n\nTo that end Japan will submit to this session of\nthe General Assembly a draft resolution on the\nelimination of nuclear weapons, which sets forth a path\ntowards the realization of a world free of nuclear\nweapons, while ensuring the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass-destruction. It does so through\nmeasures such as the early entry into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\nthe immediate commencement and early conclusion of\nnegotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty, as\nwell as the promotion of the Strategic Arms Reduction\nTreaty III negotiations, and through further, deeper\nreductions at a later stage in nuclear arsenals, leading\nin the final stage to total elimination. Japan expects\nthat this resolution will gain wide support from the\ninternational community.\nFurther, I would like to point out the importance\nof concluding negotiations on the protocol to the\nBiological Weapons Convention (BWC) by the year\n2001, and strengthening efforts to cope with missile\nproliferation.\nNow I would like to discuss international efforts\nfor conflict prevention. For the effective prevention of\nconflicts, it is important to employ various policy\nmeasures in a comprehensive and effective manner. As\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan advocates, it is\nincumbent upon the international community to nurture\na culture of prevention. The G-8 Miyazaki Initiatives\nfor Conflict Prevention, which was drawn up at the G-8\nForeign Ministers meeting in Miyazaki, over which I\npresided, embodies this idea of a culture of\nprevention.\nOn the issue of small arms and light weapons, in\nwhich Japan has been actively engaged, the G-8\ncountries made clear for the first time that they will not\nauthorize the export of small arms if there is a clear\nrisk that these might be used for repression or\naggression against another country. I hope this\nachievement will lead to the success of next summer's\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Moreover,\nat Japan's initiative, a fund relating to small arms was\nestablished at the United Nations this spring. The\npurpose of this fund is to extend assistance for the\ncollection of small arms and the reintegration of ex-\ncombatants into civilian society.\nUnder the G-8 Miyazaki Initiatives for Conflict\nPrevention, we will actively work to strengthen such\ndevelopment assistance that contributes to preventing\nthe outbreak or recurrence of conflicts. For this\npurpose, Japan will promote its collaboration with non-\ngovernmental organizations by, for example, providing\nassistance for their emergency humanitarian activities\nand dispatching joint study missions for emergency\nrehabilitation.\nIn recent years, United Nations peacekeeping\noperations have had to be deployed more rapidly.\nMoreover, as the examples of Kosovo and East Timor\nhave shown, peacekeeping operations are now required\nto carry out diverse mandates that include humanitarian\nassistance, emergency rehabilitation and even civil\nadministration. To make possible the rapid and\neffective deployment of such peacekeeping operations,\nstrengthening the Secretariat's functions as well as\nmore, quick-response cooperation on the part of the\ninternational community are all the more important.\nJapan welcomes the report and recommendations by\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations\nestablished at the initiative of the Secretary-General.\nThe continued high toll in human life among\nUnited Nations personnel taking part in peacekeeping\noperations and humanitarian missions is a matter of\nprofound concern. Recently there was an unforgivable\nmilitia attack on the local office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in West\nTimor. Measures must be taken to ensure the safety of\nUnited Nations personnel through close cooperation\nbetween the United Nations, the country concerned,\nand its neighbouring countries.\nWith regard to United Nations peace operations,\nJapan intends to continue to do its best, including\npersonnel and financial contributions to peacekeeping\noperations and assistance for emergency rehabilitation,\ndemocratization and the establishment of legal\n15\n\nframeworks, as well as assistance to international\norganizations.\nPoverty reduction is a high-priority issue for the\nleader of every country. Japan, consistently aware of\nthe importance of this issue, has been providing more\naid than any country in the world for nine consecutive\nyears, since 1991. Henceforth, considering what would\nbe most effective for the development of developing\ncountries, Japan will continue to make active efforts on\ndevelopment issues in cooperation with those\ncountries. It accordingly intends to contribute towards\nthe success of the high-level international and\nintergovernmental event on financing for development\nexpected to be held in 2001 under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations and others.\nMoreover, it is extremely valuable that\ndeveloping countries that have achieved certain levels\nof development put their own experience and know-\nhow to use in providing assistance to other developing\ncountries. Japan, in collaboration with the United\nNations and other organizations, will strengthen its\nendeavours for South-South cooperation.\nConcerning Africa, where poverty is an especially\nserious issue, Japan twice hosted the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD)  in 1993 and 1998. It intends to continue to\nactively cooperate for African development through the\nTICAD process. Bearing in mind the possibility of also\nhosting a third such conference, Japan is considering\nholding a ministerial-level meeting before the end of\nfiscal year 2001, and would like to ask for the\ncooperation of the countries and organizations\nconcerned.\nIn April Japan hosted the second Japan-South\nPacific Forum summit meeting, at which it, together\nwith small island States burdened with geographically\ndisadvantageous conditions, put forward a common\nvision and a course for mid- and long-term\ncooperation. Moreover, this fall Japan will hold the\nfirst ministerial-level conference with the countries of\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM). As for the\nissue of sustainable development in landlocked States,\nit is Japan's policy to extend active cooperation for the\nimprovement and development of their transportation\ninfrastructure, and other matters.\nRegarding the debt problem of the heavily\nindebted poor countries, Japan has decided to\ncontribute up to a total of $200 million to the Trust\nFund of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\n(HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank. It will continue to\nmake its utmost efforts for the speedy and effective\nimplementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative, for\nexample, by extending technical assistance to heavily\nindebted poor countries as they prepare their poverty-\nreduction strategies.\nAs we enter the twenty-first century we are faced\nwith various issues, such as conflicts, poverty,\nrefugees, human rights violations, health, crime,\nterrorism and environmental degradation. Also we need\nto build communities in which the rights of women,\nchildren and various vulnerable members of society are\nprotected, in which they can demonstrate their talents,\nand in which all people can live together. In addressing\nsuch issues, it is increasingly important from the\nviewpoint of securing the existence, life and dignity of\neach individual to strengthen efforts that place human\nbeings at the centre. This is the concept of human\nsecurity.\nI would like first of all to touch upon the issue of\ninfectious diseases, which are not only a threat to the\nlife of the individual, but also a serious obstacle to\ndevelopment and nation-building. Japan will extend\nassistance to the efforts of developing countries to\ncombat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria\nand tuberculosis. It will also actively support the\nactivities of non-governmental organizations in\ndeveloping countries working in this area.\nMoreover, Japan believes that the development of\na United Nations-centred legal framework for\ncombating transnational organized crime and terrorism\nis urgently required.\nEfforts to address global environmental issues are\nbecoming increasingly important from the viewpoint of\nhuman security as well. Attaching greater importance\nto development assistance that takes the environment\ninto consideration, Japan has allocated approximately\n40 per cent of its official development assistance to\nenvironmental cooperation. The primary tasks at this\nmoment on the environmental agenda are the success\nof the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange and the entry into force no later than 2002 of\nthe Kyoto Protocol on global warming issues.\nConcerning the Rio+10 event to be held in 2002,\nJapan believes that an agenda looking to the future\nshould be set, taking into account the debates on the\n16\n\neffective implementation of many international\nenvironmental conventions, as well as globalization\nand the technological innovations that have occurred\nsince the Earth Summit in 1992. Mapping out strategies\nto implement more effectively the large number of\nenvironmental conventions concluded in recent years\nwill also be important. Japan strongly supports holding\nthe Rio+10 conference in Asia and welcomes\nIndonesia's candidacy to host the conference.\nFurther endeavours must be made to solve the\nproblems confronting women, children and various\nvulnerable members of society. Japan highly\nappreciates efforts made in this regard by the United\nNations, including its convening in June of the special\nsession of the General Assembly entitled Women\n2000: gender equality, development and peace for the\ntwenty-first century. Furthermore, Japan will host the\nSecond World Congress against Commercial Sexual\nExploitation of Children, and will advance its efforts\nfor the protection of the rights of the child.\nI have touched upon only a limited part of the\nefforts focusing upon human security. Japan has\ncontributed more than 9 billion yen  well over $80\nmillion  to the human security fund that was\nestablished at the United Nations last year, and in the\nnear future intends to make a further contribution of\napproximately 10 billion yen \u00f3 or roughly $100\nmillion  to this fund. The fund has borne fruit in\nassisting efforts particularly in such areas as post-\nconflict emergency assistance and reconstruction,\nhealth and medical care, and basic education. To\nfurther develop and deepen the concept of human\nsecurity and to study ways to strengthen efforts in this\ncontext, Japan intends to establish an international\ncommittee on human security, with the participation of\nleaders of opinion.\nAs I have stated, issues requiring action by the\ninternational community are becoming ever more\ndiverse and complex. We must urgently strengthen the\nUnited Nations system to enable it to deal with these\nissues.\nFirst of all, this requires, as a matter of urgency,\nthat the Security Council be re-created as a body that\nreflects the tremendous changes in the international\ncommunity. At the Millennium Summit held last week\nthe representatives of approximately a hundred\nMember States referred to this issue in their speeches\nwithin the limited time. The Millennium Declaration,\nexpressing the determination to intensify our efforts to\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\nCouncil, reflects the overall views of the heads of State\nand Government of Member States. In particular, there\nis a need for reform that reflects the views of\ndeveloping countries, which are playing an ever more\nimportant role in the international community, and that\nfosters the participation of those countries with the\ncapability to contribute to the solution of various issues\nfacing the developing countries.\nI believe that both the representativeness and\neffectiveness of the Security Council can be enhanced\nthrough an expansion of both the permanent and non-\npermanent membership, and the inclusion of both\ndeveloping and developed countries in the new\npermanent membership. Although we have already\nspent seven years discussing reform, during which\nrelevant aspects of the issue have been exhaustively\nexplored, we have yet to see the reform materialize.\nEven during the discussions, conflicts have broken out,\nand poverty is worsening in various parts of the world.\nI would like to emphasize that the time has come to\nseek a convergence of views among Member States on\nthe concrete form of Security Council reform.\nToday the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity requires action, not only in political and\nsecurity areas, but also in economic, social and various\nother areas.\nWhen the reform of the Security Council is\nrealized, Japan would like to assume a greater\nresponsibility as a permanent member of the Council,\nmobilizing its capabilities and its experiences in\nvarious areas, such as disarmament and non-\nproliferation, development and human security, and\nbased upon the ideas which I have discussed today.\nA prerequisite for the strengthening of United\nNations functions is securing a sound financial base. In\naddition to streamlining as well as improving the\nefficiency and transparency of United Nations finances,\nachieving a balance in financial burden-sharing is\nespecially important. Today's financial burden sharing\ncannot be considered to reflect the economic strength\nof respective countries or their positions and\nresponsibilities within the United Nations. Japan would\nlike to appeal for its urgent revision. I strongly hope\nthat an agreement can be reached on a more equitable\nscale of assessments for the regular budget at this\nsession, as an important step towards the establishment\n17\n\nof a more stable financial base. Moreover, I hope that\nthe substantive discussions for peacekeeping operations\nbudgets, which are rapidly increasing, will also be\nconducted during this session and that a more equitable\nscale of assessments for these budgets can be agreed.\nAs we welcome the twenty-first century, while\nrespecting diversity, we must transcend the differences\nthat arise out of our sense of belonging to an ethnic,\nreligious or cultural group. The foundation for these\nendeavours is provided by international relationships\nbased on universal values common to all humankind,\nsuch as democracy, human rights and freedom. The\nUnited Nations must play a central role in our efforts to\nconstruct such international relationships.\nIn order to achieve peace, we must engage in\ndialogue with each other in a spirit of tolerance, and\njoin hands in tackling various challenges. At the United\nNations this year is designated the International Year\nfor the Culture of Peace, and next year, 2001, is\ndesignated the United Nations Year of Dialogue\namong Civilizations. These designations and the\nimplementation of related substantive activities reflect\na growing recognition of this idea.\nAs globalization progresses and economy-\noriented rationalism prevails, we should pay special\nattention to the task of raising awareness of cultural\ndiversity, nurturing the special character of respective\ncountries and regions, and preserving historical and\ncultural heritage. The United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should\nplay a central role in this regard. Every country should\nrecognize the role of UNESCO, and join together in\nextending assistance to strengthen its activities.\nI believe that this Millennium Assembly, which\nbegan with the Millennium Summit, should be an\nepochal starting point of meaningful progress in the\ntwenty-first century, both in consolidating our efforts to\ntackle various challenges and in strengthening United\nNations functions through Security Council and\nfinancial reform. Towards that end, I should like to\nconclude by underscoring once again the growing\nimportance of cooperation among all Member States."

        "file_text": "I congratulate the\nPresident on behalf of the Botswana delegation on his\nelection to lead the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. He can count on our support as he\ndischarges his onerous responsibilities during this\nhistoric session and in the year that lies ahead.\nI also take great pleasure in saluting my brother\nand colleague, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly \u2014 the last\nsession of the twentieth century \u2014 and for steering it\nto a successful conclusion.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has continued to\ngive a good accounting of himself as the chief\nexecutive of this, our United Nations. We owe him a\ndebt of gratitude for the manner in which he has,\nwithout fear or favour, led the United Nations during\nthe past four years.\nFive years ago, in this very Hall, we celebrated\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United\nNations. On that historic occasion, the former President\n12\n\nof the Republic of Botswana, Sir Ketumile Masire, had\nthis to say about the United Nations:\n\u201cThe United Nations has served us well.\nSmall States such as my own have found in the\nUnited Nations a vital forum for collective\nbargaining. It has contributed to the advancement\nof international cooperation in solving economic,\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian problems. It is a\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\nthe attainment of these common ends.\u201d\n(A/50/PV.37, p. 3)\nBotswana's faith in and commitment to the\nUnited Nations remains undiminished, and we are here\non the eve of the new millennium to renew that faith\nand to reaffirm that commitment.\nThe United Nations begins the new millennium\nheavily laden with the residual problems of the\noutgoing century. Even as we meet here, bloody\nconflicts of varying degrees of intensity and savagery\nare ravaging societies in many places around the globe.\nEndemic poverty holds sway in the developing world,\nin contrast with the lavish opulence of the West.\nDiseases, the most virulent of which is the devastating\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, have continued to cause untold\nmisery all over the world, particularly in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. All these problems pose a serious challenge to\nthe United Nations and to the international community\nas a whole. The character of the twenty-first century\nwill no doubt be determined by our ability and\ncommitment to face this challenge.\nOn the African continent, the struggle for peace\nand against war remains an all-consuming\npreoccupation. The agendas of the United Nations\nSecurity Council and the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) attest to this vexing state of affairs. All the\nefforts of the leaders of Central and southern Africa,\nwhich a little more than a year ago produced the\nLusaka Agreement aimed at bringing peace to the war-\ntorn region of Central Africa, have thus far come to\nnaught. There is no peace in the region because the\nAgreement remains unimplemented even as the parties\nhave continued to profess their fidelity to it.\nThe United Nations now has the authorization of\nthe Security Council to deploy more than 5,000\nobservers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nmonitor the ceasefire and pave the way for the\ndeployment of a full-fledged peacekeeping force in the\nnear future.\nA crucial element of the Lusaka Agreement,\namong others, is that there must be dialogue in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, among the people\nof that country, if the international efforts spearheaded\nby the United Nations and the OAU aimed at creating\nconditions for national reconciliation in that country\nare to bear fruit. Regrettably, there is no dialogue in\nprocess in that country, although a facilitator has been\nin place for nine months.\nWe hope the Congolese leaders will soon realize\nthat without the implementation in full of the Lusaka\nAgreement, their country will be bereft of any hope for\npeace. There may be no second chance. The Lusaka\nAgreement is their only salvation.\nThe leaders of Burundi, next door to the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, recently gathered\nin Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, to make peace\nunder the facilitation of the former President of the\nRepublic of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela. Their\ngathering in Arusha attracted the presence of leaders\nfrom near and far, including the President of the United\nStates of America, Mr. Bill Clinton.\nRegrettably, the peace agreement reached was\nembraced by some and denigrated by others, which\ndoes not augur well for peace in Burundi. It is our\nfervent hope that those who have not embraced the\nArusha peace agreement will do so. In having President\nMandela as Facilitator, the people of Burundi could not\nhave been more fortunate \u2014 and for the second time.\nBefore President Mandela, it was the late\nPresident Mwalimu Nyerere, may his soul rest in\npeace, who gave so much of himself for peace in\nBurundi. Burundi may not be so fortunate a third time.\nOn that occasion, President Clinton had this to say: \u201cSo\nI plead with you: you have to help your children\nremember their history, but you must not force them to\nrelive their history.\u201d Burundi would do well to heed\nthese words and save its children from the scourge of\nendemic conflict.\nThe Great Lakes region of Central Africa needs\npeace. The neighbours of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo and Burundi, all of them, will not have\npeace so long as carnage continues in their backyard.\nAngola will not have peace so long as its neighbours to\nthe north are strife-torn.\nThe United Nations is making steady progress in\nSierra Leone, following initial mishaps which\n13\n\nthreatened to reduce this Organization to an object of\nridicule. The size of the United Nations force in that\nsmall country should be enough to frustrate the\nmurderous activities of the bandits of the\nRevolutionary United Front (RUF). In the final\nanalysis, however, the future stability of Sierra Leone\ncannot be imposed by the United Nations or even,\nindeed, by the Economic Community of West African\nStates. It is the people of Sierra Leone themselves who\nmust embrace the logic of peace through national\ndialogue and reconciliation.\nThe silence of the guns in the Horn of Africa in\nthe tragic war between Eritrea and Ethiopia could not\nhave been more welcome. The region has more than\nenough problems without endless war. Famine is\nstalking the area, evoking earlier episodes of human\ndevastation, particularly in Ethiopia and Somalia. In\npeace, it is hoped the international community will be\nable to assist the affected areas without hindrance. Our\nhearts and best wishes go out to the people of Somalia\nin their difficult endeavour to restore normalcy to their\nfractured country. We hope the new central authority\nthey have established will be respected by all the\nparties in the country.\nThe struggle for peace in Africa, if it is to be\nsuccessful, must be prosecuted on two fronts \u2014\npolitical and economic. On both fronts, I can assure\nthis Assembly that Africa is not a hopeless continent,\nas some of our detractors would have the world\nbelieve.\nThe Secretary-General's seminal report on the\ncauses of conflict in Africa has not fallen on deaf ears.\nOur continent has been changing for the better for\nsome time now. Changing democratically elected\ngovernments by unconstitutional means, whatever the\nreason, is no longer tolerated. Coup makers are no\nlonger welcome in the councils of the OAU. We have\ncome to accept that good governance and the rule of\nlaw, far from being regarded as sinister neo-colonialist\nconcepts as some may wish to stigmatize them, simply\nmean accountability and transparency on the part of\nthose who are entrusted with the responsibility of\nrunning the affairs of their nations. They mean\ncultivating a culture of incorruptibility, openness and\ntolerance.\nOn the economic front, I cannot gainsay the\nobvious fact that people cannot eat democracy or good\ngovernance. Democracy in an environment\ncharacterized by abject poverty and ignorance is an\nendangered species. Africa needs investment and aid to\nbuttress its democratization process. The challenge\nfacing the United Nations in the new century is\ntherefore to strive to ensure that Africa's difficult\nrenaissance is not simply encouraged but also\nsupported in material ways.\nThe western world would do well not simply to\nshout at Africans, to pontificate about human rights\nand good governance and deprecate the continent's\ncivil wars and endemic instability, from the privileged\ncomfort of Western Europe and North America.\nAfricans need and deserve hands-on solidarity and\nconstructive engagement with the developed world if\nthey are to succeed in their struggle for peace and\ndevelopment.\nLet me state the obvious. Small States like my\nown derive a sense of security from our membership in\nthe United Nations. The United Nations is our shield\nagainst the vagaries and predatory nature of world\npolitics. That is why we have been unstinting in the\nfulfilment of our obligations to the Organization. We\npay our dues to the Organization without fail. We have\nparticipated in its peacekeeping activities. And we have\ndefended it against its many detractors.\nIt is no secret, however, that this United Nations\nto which we all habitually profess our unflinching\ncommitment and devotion is perpetually tottering on\nthe brink of insolvency. This is unfortunately so, even\nas we equally habitually burden the Organization with\nescalating tasks for it to perform on a shoestring\nbudget. The Secretary-General is right in challenging\nus, the Member States, to hold one another responsible\nfor the financial difficulties faced by the United\nNations. We alone can resolve these difficulties. We\nmust honour our Charter obligations and do so without\nconditions.\nWe must strengthen the United Nations in order\nto secure our future, the future of mankind. We must\ncontinually reform the Organization to adapt it to the\nrealities of the post-cold-war world and the new\nmillennium. A crucial part of this reform and\nadaptation is the reconfiguration of the Security\nCouncil, on which there is sufficient consensus in our\nUnited Nations family. The Council needs a heavy dose\nof democratization and accountability; about this, there\nis no dissension.\n14\n\nWe must strengthen the peacekeeping arm of the\nUnited Nations to make good or deliver on our\nCharter's pledge \u201cto save succeeding generations from\nthe scourge of war ...\u201d. Peacekeeping has always been a\ncrucial function of the United Nations. And so the need\nto enhance the rapid reaction of the United Nations to\nconflict situations around the world has long been\nrecognized and is deeply felt. The lessons in Kosovo,\nEast Timor and, more recently, Sierra Leone have\ntaught us that the United Nations needs better trained\nand well-equipped troops, as well as innovative,\nimaginative and realistic mandates from the Security\nCouncil.\nLet there be no repetition of the kind of\nhumiliation the United Nations recently suffered in\nSierra Leone at the hands of a ragtag army of bandits.\nThe conflicts that are wreaking havoc on societies\ntoday are radically different from those that\npreoccupied the United Nations during the cold war\nera. We must therefore devise new and creative\nmechanisms and strategies for responding to them.\nLet me conclude my statement by reiterating\nBotswana's commitment to the United Nations and its\nCharter. This Organization is irreplaceable, and I am\nsure the presence here two weeks ago of so many world\nleaders to mark the turn of a new millennium is more\nthan enough testimony to this obvious fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession. At the same time, I record my thanks and\nappreciation to your predecessor, the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia.\nWe are meeting just after the historic Millennium\nSummit, which brought together more than 150 leaders\nof the world. Clearly, there is not much left to say. On\nthe other hand, there is much to be done. Urgent action\nis needed; the time for implementation is now.\nNational action is needed more than ever in all\ncountries. The fact is that each nation has the primary\nresponsibility for dealing with its own problems. It is\nnot sufficient to make visionary statements and well-\nintentioned commitments. The will to bring about\nchange in our societies must be demonstrated in all\nnations. We should remember that we are the solution\nto our problems, and that if we are to be effective the\npartners of others, we must demonstrate a willingness\nto help ourselves.\nWe must eliminate poverty. It is an indictment\nagainst humanity that in the twenty-first century more\nthan a billion of the world's people are mired in the\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. Each\ncountry must adopt those policies necessary to\nengender growth in their economies and to ensure that\nall their citizens have access to the opportunities that\nare being created. It now behooves the international\ncommunity to take concrete and positive action to\nbring to fruition the commitment made by heads of\nState or Government in the Millennium Declaration: to\nreduce poverty levels by the year 2015.\nTrinidad and Tobago has already taken action\nthrough an appropriate policy framework and other\nmeasures of reform. As a result, our economy\ncontinues to grow, and we are generating employment\nwhile keeping inflation low. We are making efforts to\nensure that all our citizens benefit from the country's\nsuccesses, and we are making strides towards the\nelimination of poverty and are today ranked very\nfavourably in the United Nations Human Development\nIndex.\nEducation is the key. It is a powerful force for\nsocial change. It is a human right. It goes far beyond\nschooling. It assists in combating poverty, empowering\nwomen, promoting human rights and democracy and\npromoting international peace and security. According\nto the United Nations Children's Fund report, \u201cThe\nState of the World's Children 1999\u201d, 130 million\nchildren in the developing world are denied the right to\nbasic education. Regrettably, almost two thirds of them\nare girls. This cannot continue. All children must have\naccess to all levels of education. This must be a\nnational objective in every country. United Nations\ndeclarations by themselves will not help.\nSince independence, Trinidad and Tobago has\nplaced considerable emphasis on education, which\ncontinues to rank among the largest items of\nGovernment expenditure. The laws of Trinidad and\nTobago provide that education is mandatory for all\nchildren between the ages of five to 12 years. Tuition is\nfree at public and Government-assisted schools. We\ncontinue to improve our system. Pre-school education\nhas developed rapidly in Trinidad and Tobago, and\n17\n\nspecial education is also being given greater attention.\nIn further recognition of the importance of education,\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago recently\nembarked on a programme which will ensure free\nsecondary education for every child of secondary\nschool age, and this took effect with the opening of the\nnew academic year 2000-2001.\nIf people are not healthy, they can neither find\nfulfilment nor contribute to their country's\ndevelopment. The poor of the world need easier access\nto essential drugs and vaccines to reduce mortality and\ndisability. It has to be a travesty that only one per cent\nof the budget of global health research is directed to\ndiseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and\nmalaria, all of which are concerns of developing\ncountries. In Trinidad and Tobago, health care is given\nhigh priority. The health budget continues to be one of\nthe major areas of Government expenditure and,\nthrough a decentralized system of regional health\nauthorities, health care is made accessible and\naffordable to all. The Government is constantly\ninvesting in human resources and physical\ninfrastructure to meet the demands of the population.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has reduced\nthe cost of medication for some chronic diseases, such\nas glaucoma, diabetes, asthma and arthritis. We are also\nensuring that equipment for our physically challenged\ncitizens is affordable. Every effort is being made to\nreduce the backlog of certain common surgical\nprocedures. Next year, a National Health Insurance\nPilot Project is expected to be instituted to cover every\ncitizen. Under the proposed system, the Government\nwill pay the contribution on behalf of those persons\nwho cannot afford to do so.\nThe ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its\ndevastating socio-economic consequences constitute\nanother of the major health-related challenges for the\ninternational community in the twenty-first century.\nThe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is of particular\nconcern to the Caribbean, the second most seriously\naffected region. The Government of Trinidad and\nTobago views this matter very seriously, and we have\nlong embarked on a programme of action designed to\ncombat this scourge. It is based on research and\neducation and building partnerships with the public and\nprivate sectors, as well as actors in civil society. We are\nalso convinced of the need for greater global\npartnership to develop an effective and more affordable\nvaccine against HIV/AIDS. The present HIV-related\ndrugs should be made less expensive. We support the\nconvening as well of a special session of the General\nAssembly to consider all aspects of this problem.\nOur planet continues to experience environmental\ndegradation. The problem will never be solved unless\nthere is international cooperation, especially on the part\nof industrialized countries, which are mainly\nresponsible for the emission of greenhouse gases. We\nin the smaller countries, especially small island\nnations, are the most severely threatened. But even in a\nsituation where we are victims, we do not absolve\nourselves from responsibility. Trinidad and Tobago is\nalready doing its part. We have established a Ministry\nof the Environment and an Environmental Management\nAuthority. We have recently enacted legislation to\nempower this Authority. We have operationalized an\nenvironmental policing system, and we are now in the\nprocess of establishing a Green Fund, through which\nthe industrialists in our country will contribute to\nfinancing programmes for protecting the environment.\nThe Government is working in close collaboration with\nthe international community on environmental issues\nand, in this regard, we are a State Party to all of the\nmajor Conventions concerning the environment.\nTrinidad and Tobago is actively involved in the\ndevelopment of national legislation to give effect to\nthese international treaties.\nI must join my Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) colleagues in lamenting the blatant and\npersistent misuse of the Caribbean Sea as a trans-\nshipment route for hazardous wastes. This continues to\nbe a cause for major concern to the Governments of the\nregion. We are not comforted by the assurances of\ncompliance by those who use this route for economic\ngain. A single accident can threaten the very viability\nof our societies. Can the commercial benefit from using\nthis route override its potentially horrendous\nconsequences? Accidents can occur, and we again call\nfor a halt to these shipments.\nNo country can progress without democracy and\ngood governance, which create the environment for\nprogress and development, peace and security. All\ncitizens must be included in the mainstream of national\nactivity. All must be allowed to contribute. Every voice\nmust be heard; every view considered; and every\ncitizen must have access to the opportunities that their\nsocieties create. This should be the primary\nresponsibility of every Government in every country.\nGovernment must also be based on the rule of law.\n18\n\nEach nation, therefore, has the responsibility to\ndevelop effective judicial and legal systems to both\nprotect the rights of the individual and guard the nation\nagainst any usurpation of its democratic systems. We in\nTrinidad and Tobago are proud of our strong\ndemocratic traditions. Free and fair elections are held\npeacefully, regularly and on time. There is freedom of\nspeech and of political association and freedom of the\npress. Our democratic tradition is buttressed by a very\nactive civil society, involving strong trade unions,\ndynamic social and cultural groups and other non-\ngovernmental actors. We have an independent\njudiciary, and we have recently embarked on the\nmodernization of our laws and legal system to keep our\ncountry in step with modern trends.\nEach Government has the duty to ensure the\nsecurity of both its State and citizens. One of the\nserious threats to security is the escalation of the worst\nkinds of crimes within national borders in many\ncountries. This battle against the criminal element is\nfaced by all societies, on differing levels, but it is a\nbattle to which Governments must, of necessity,\nallocate adequate resources if they are to maintain\npeace and foster development. In many developing\ncountries, the rise in the level of violent crime is\ndirectly related to poverty and the deprivation suffered\nby individuals. This link between poverty and\ndevelopment on the one hand, and peace and security\non the other, should not be minimized. Like most\ncountries, Trinidad and Tobago is battling the\nphenomenon of crime. In addition to allocating\nincreased resources to our protective services, to\nprovide them with manpower, infrastructure and\nequipment to deal with crime, we are implementing\nsocial programmes to combat deviant behaviour,\nthrough the Ministries of Education, Culture, Social\nDevelopment, Youth and Sport.\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to face the\nchallenges of the illicit traffic in drugs. Due to our\ngeographic location, we are used as a convenient\ntranshipment point in the drug trade. We have taken all\nmeasures available to us on the national, regional and\ninternational fronts to combat this menace to our\nsociety. The Government has, in this regard,\nestablished an agency to coordinate the overall efforts\nagainst drug trafficking and has entered into regional\nand bilateral arrangements for cooperation in\ncombating this serious crime. Our strengthened legal\nframework has led to successes in the investigation and\nprosecution of crimes associated with drug trafficking.\nLegislative measures include the Dangerous Drugs Act,\nthe Drug Court Bill, the Drug Abuse Rehabilitation\nTribunal Bill and the Proceeds of Crime Bill.\nAt the international and regional levels,\ncooperative efforts include a number of bilateral\nextradition and mutual legal assistance agreements. In\nJuly, 2000, Trinidad and Tobago, along with six other\nGovernments, signed an agreement establishing a\nregional justice protection programme, which provides\na framework for regional cooperation in the protection\nof witnesses, jurors and legal and law enforcement\npersonnel. While we will continue to strengthen\nexisting measures and to expand the spheres of\ncooperation, we wish to reiterate that this is a problem\nwhich the international community cannot successfully\ntackle without the necessary commitment of all States\nconcerned.\nAnother growing threat, which is closely related\nto the menace of the drug trade, is the illicit trade in\nsmall arms. We therefore attach great significance to\nthe convening of the 2001 United Nations Conference\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\nin All Its Aspects, and we fully support the very\nimportant preparatory work which will precede the\nConference.\nThe disease of racism, racial discrimination and\nreligious intolerance continues to plague the world as\nwe enter twenty-first century. This is an intractable\ncultural problem that can be ameliorated only through\neducation and enlightenment. It is the expectation of\nmy delegation that the World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance, to be held in South Africa at the\nend of August 2001, will produce action-oriented\nrecommendations to eliminate this scourge. No effort\nshould be spared to rid human civilization of this ugly\naffliction.\nAs a pluralistic society, Trinidad and Tobago is\nproud of its record of harmony. In our country, as\nimmortalized in our national anthem, every creed and\nrace find an equal place. We have become well known\nas a rainbow society and at present we are seeking to\ncreate the institutions and the legal framework to even\nfurther deepen our world-renowned harmony.\nWhilst I have thus far emphasized the need for\nnational action, we are fully aware that cooperation at\nan international level is absolutely necessary if we are\n19\n\nto deal effectively with the problems of our planet. In\nthis global village, no country can survive on its own.\nToday's reality is globalization, borderlessness and\nintegration at the international, regional and\nsubregional levels. The United Nations, therefore, like\nall other international actors, has a pivotal role to play.\nFor example, the international financial institutions\nmust become more sensitive to the development needs\nof countries and the world trading system must take\ninto account the special concerns of the disadvantaged\nand the vulnerable.\nAs we have already demonstrated, Trinidad and\nTobago is willing to be an active participant in the\nconcerted effort of the international community to\nachieve the goals we have set for ourselves. We have\nalways proven this since becoming a member of this\nbody. We have participated, we have cooperated and\nsometimes, as with the International Criminal Court,\nwe have led the way.\nWe wish to achieve a humane global civilization.\nWe wish to bequeath to the future a planet of prosperity\nand peace for all"

        "file_text": "I am\nhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the\nUnited States and to reinforce the eloquent message\nPresident C1inton conveyed during last week's\nMillennium Summit. Because my father worked here\nwhen I was young, I have always considered myself a\nchild of the United Nations. And because I had the\nprivilege to serve here as America's Permanent\nRepresentative, I feel at home and so will speak\nplainly.\nThe members of this body reflect virtually every\nculture, ethnicity and geographical region. We are city\nand country, inland and island, tropical and temperate,\ndeveloping and industrialized. We are as diverse as\nhumanity.\nAnd yet, in responding to the daunting demands\nof this new era, we are bound together by the interests\nwe share and the ideals to which we aspire.\nWe all have a stake in building peace and\nrelieving poverty, championing development and\ncurbing disease. We all want to see the dangers posed\nby weapons of mass destruction reduced, refugees\ncared for, children nourished, the environment\nprotected, and the status of women advanced.\nWe all believe the benefits of globalization must\nbe allocated more broadly within and among societies.\nBecause if the new technologies are to ease the old\nproblems, they must help the many who today lack\naccess and skills, so that every village becomes a home\nto opportunity and every school a midwife to hope.\nAs the Millennium Summit reflected, we have no\nshortage of worthy goals. We are right to aim high and\ntake on the mightiest tasks.\nBut as the Secretary-General has said, progress\ndepends on working together. We need all hands on\ndeck, pulling in the same direction. For each of us, that\nresponsibility begins at home because the international\ncommunity cannot help any nation that is not striving\nto help itself.\nEach Government has an obligation to observe\ninternational norms on human rights, uphold the rule of\nlaw, fight corruption and raise awareness about\nHIV/AIDS. But in the twenty-first century, no nation\ncan protect and serve its people simply by going it\nalone and that is why we  all benefit from\nstrengthening regional bodies such as the Organization\nof American States (OAS), the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) and the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\nBecause of their unique expertise and regional\nlegitimacy, they can be instruments for solving some of\nthe hardest challenges we face. But they will succeed\nonly if we raise our expectations of these\norganizations, call upon them to act boldly and back\nthem when they do.\nRegional bodies can contribute much to the\npurposes outlined in the Charter, and the goals\nestablished during the Millennium Summit. But here\nagain, they cannot do it all.\n8\n\nThe role of the United Nations is also vital,\nbecause no other institution combines a comprehensive\nmandate with near universal representation and global\nreach.\nWe all have an interest in the success of the\nUnited Nations. That is its greatest strength, and also\nits burden, because 189 nations have to work very hard\nif they are to agree.\nI remember when I came to New York in 1993, I\nwas told by cynics that the United Nations was too\nbureaucratic to change, and too big ever to achieve\nconsensus on measures to improve its governance.\nThose cynics were wrong. With support from\nmany countries, we have made impressive progress.\nCompared to seven years ago, the United Nations\naccomplishes more and wastes less. Accountability has\nincreased and duplication diminished.\nThe Internal Oversight Office, which did not exist\nin 1993, has grown steadily more rigorous and is\nresponsible for tens of millions of dollars of savings. A\nculture of transparency and results is slowly but surely\ntaking hold. Moreover, both United Nations\nHeadquarters and the entire United Nations system are\nbetter led than they have ever been.\nUnited Nations leaders and Members can take\npride in the gains made, but we all know there is much\nmore work to be done.\nThat is why we must back the Secretary General's\nefforts to further improve United Nations management,\nrecognizing that every dollar wasted is a dollar lost to\nthe fight against poverty and to the achievement of\nother urgent goals.\nWe must also move ahead rapidly to strengthen\npeacekeeping, because it is the most visible and vital\nyardstick of United Nations success and, for people in\nstrife-torn regions, often means the difference between\na normal life and no life at all.\nThere is no magic formula for curing the ills that\nhave plagued United Nations peace operations in the\npast. But the report, just prepared by Ambassador\nBrahimi's team, is a solid place to start.\nAs President Clinton said last week, we need to\nensure that United Nations peacekeepers can be\ndeployed with the right training and equipment and the\nright rules of engagement so they can achieve, not\nmerely attempt, their missions.\nThis will require a larger peacekeeping staff, on\npermanent assignment, comprised of the best talent and\nexperience we can find.\nIt will require military planners the world over to\nrecognize that training for peace operations is a\nlegitimate part of every nation's security strategy. It\nwill require the ability to deploy rapidly not only\nUnited Nations military forces, but also civilian police\nand experts in law enforcement and judicial reform. It\nwill demand improved coordination between military\npeacekeepers and civilian builders of peace, so that\nmissions begun are completed and recovery bred by\nreconciliation can take hold.\nAnd it will require additional resources from my\nGovernment and from each of yours. And by\n\u201cadditional\u201d, I mean resources that should not come at\nthe expense of other core United Nations goals.\nThe United States will heed the Secretary-\nGeneral's request that we work together to consider\nand implement the best recommendations of the\nBrahimi report.\nWhether for peacekeeping or programmes, the\nUnited Nations also needs a sustainable and equitable\nsystem of financing. We do not have that today.\nMember States, including my own, must do a better job\nof making payments on time. But we must also look\nafresh at the method used to allocate responsibility for\nUnited Nations costs.\nLast week, the Security Council called for\nadjustments in the scale of assessments. This plea has\nbeen echoed by dozens of other countries and should\nbe acted upon by the General Assembly this fall.\nA more equitable system should provide a much\nstronger foundation for United Nations programmes\nand missions. It should preserve the special\nresponsibility for peacekeeping of the Security\nCouncil's permanent members. It should retain a\nheavily discounted rate for the poorest countries. And\nit should reduce the United Nations overall reliance on\npayments from the United States, while at the same\ntime enabling my Government to write a check to the\nUnited Nations for nearly $600 million in prior\nobligations.\n9\n\nClearly, adjustments are long overdue. The\nUnited Nations needs a firm and reliable financial base.\nIn the weeks ahead, the United States will be pleased to\nwork with members to accomplish this landmark goal.\nFurther improvements in management and\npeacekeeping and a sounder financial base are a vital\nstep towards a stronger and more effective United\nNations. But we must also stand up to the campaign\nlaunched by Baghdad against the United Nations\nauthority and international law.\nSecurity Council resolution 1284 (1999) provides\nan effective plan for protecting world security through\nresumed weapons inspections and monitoring inside\nIraq. It has expanded the oil-for-food programme that\nhas delivered $8 billion in humanitarian supplies to\nIraqi civilians, with $6 billion more on the way. And it\nwould enable Iraq, through compliance with the\nresolution's terms, to achieve an early suspension of\nsanctions. Thus far, Baghdad has flatly refused to\naccept the resolution. The regime's strategy is to ignore\nits United Nations Charter obligations and to seek to\npreserve at all costs its capacity to produce the\ndeadliest weapons humanity has ever known.\nWe must continue to do all we can to ease the\nhardships faced by Iraq's people. But we must also\ndefend the integrity of this institution, our security and\ninternational law.\nThe Millennium Summit illustrated the United\nNations long-standing role as a forum for articulating\nconsensus goals. But achieving these objectives will\nrequire action at all levels, from local to global. It will\nalso require a willingness to move well beyond the\nlimits and habits of the past.\nToday, the United Nations is taking on a wide\narray of new issues, what I call \u201cpeople issues\u201d,\nbecause they so directly affect the lives of our citizens.\nThey include the challenge of protecting our planet by\nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions; securing safe water\nsupplies; halting desertification; and putting a stop to\ntrafficking in human beings. They especially include\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS, which was highlighted in\na letter to the Secretary-General signed by the women\nForeign Ministers last night. These and similar\nchallenges are sure to be important components of\ntwenty-first century diplomacy, and because they are\nglobal in scope, require a global response.\nThe United Nations is also playing an increased\nrole in areas where cold war divisions once held it\nback. Over the past decade, United Nations entities\nhave contributed much by prosecuting war criminals,\npromoting democracy, supporting human rights and\naiding the fight against illegal drugs.\nThese issues require a willingness to take a stand,\nas the United Nations has done in holding accountable\nthe perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the\nBalkans; striving to end rebel outrages in Sierra Leone;\nand expressing opposition to the long-standing and\nongoing violation of basic human rights in Burma.\nLet me say this morning that when the Burmese\nGovernment tries to blame the victims for the crime,\nand say that Aung San Suu Kyi and her party are\nresponsible for their own repression, I can only reply\nthat much the same was once said about Gandhi and\nMartin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and V\u00e1clav\nHavel. The world is not fooled, and we must not be\nsilent.\nSome argue that speaking out in defence of\nhuman rights constitutes interference in internal affairs.\nI believe it helps to fulfil the purposes of the United\nNations Charter, because when international norms are\nassaulted, the United Nations must do more than\nsimply observe injustice, or report upon it, or\nsympathize with the victims. We must do all we can,\nwhere we can, to stop the perpetrators.\nThis requires the active backing and participation\nof United Nations Members, so that respect for\ninternational law becomes steadily more universal and\nthe incentives for observing global standards\nprogressively more clear.\nThe result, if we are united and determined\nenough, will be a world of greater security, justice and\npeace. Realistically, this is essential, if we are to\nachieve the ambitious social goals we have set.\nBut there is one other essential element as well,\nand that is democracy. This past summer in Poland, for\nthe first time, more than 100 nations came together to\nreaffirm democratic principles and ensure that the\ndemocratic tide remains a rising one around the world.\nWe did this not because democracy always\nproduces good Governments, for it does not. But we\nare convinced by the evidence of the old century that\nthe hopes we share for the new will more readily be\n10\n\naccomplished if people are able to live and work in\nfreedom.\nDemocracy is the one road we can all walk down\ntogether and the best system yet devised for sowing\nand growing the seeds of economic opportunity.\nIn promoting democracy, we are not attempting to\nimpose our values on anyone else. In fact, this is not\npossible, because democracy, by definition, enables\ncitizens within a country to shape their own destinies in\naccordance with their own convictions and ideals.\nMake no mistake. In any country, at any time,\ndictatorship is an imposition. Democracy is a choice.\nAs we have learned during the last 55 years, the\nUnited Nations provides no guarantees of global peace\nor prosperity. But it can play a vital role as catalyst and\ncoordinator, and as a bridge connecting the\ncontributions of one to another.\nTo those who would judge it harshly, I would\nrespond not by pointing first to the deliberations of\ndiplomats such as myself, in surroundings such as\nthese. Instead, I would point to the day-to-day efforts\nof United Nations workers caring for refugees, feeding\nchildren, providing shelter and preventing disease.\nI would point to the men and women on the front\nlines, from Port-au-Prince to Freetown, and from\nKosovo to Kisangani, doing some of the world's\nhardest work, and, as we have been reminded by the\nrecent slayings of employees of the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in\nEast Timor, also the most dangerous. It is their efforts\nand sacrifice, in partnership with so many indigenous\nand other non-governmental organizations, that truly\nremind us of the United Nations purpose and of our\nkinship with one another.\nThis is, I expect, my last official speech to a\nUnited Nations audience. As I stand before you, I am\ndeeply conscious not only of our many\naccomplishments, but also of the tasks not yet\ncompleted.\nI am grieved by the conflicts that still rage, and\nthe basic rights and freedoms still denied. I am\nfrustrated by the gaps that still exist between our ideals\nand actions, and alarmed by the deepening material\ndivide that ultimately threatens every nation, rich and\npoor alike.\nThere are those who say it is na\u00efve to think that\nthe future can be made better than the past. I am\nreminded that this institution was founded by men and\nwomen who were as realistic as any human beings\ncould be, for they were the survivors of the worst\nconflict our world has known and determined that\nsucceeding generations should be saved from holocaust\nand war. They had faith. Surely we, as well, must have\nfaith that by working together within and outside this\nOrganization, we can move together, step by step\ntowards the lofty goals we have set, and thereby bring\nabout a world more peaceful, prosperous and free than\nit has ever been. Since 1993, it has been my privilege\nto work with so many of you, from every part of the\nglobe, in support of the interests we have in common\nand the dreams our people share.\nThis morning, I want to thank you for your\nfriendship; pledge my cooperation in the months\nimmediately ahead; and ask respectfully, in turn, for\nyours. I promise, as well, to serve the cause of\ninternational progress and individual liberty not only\nfor as long as I am in office, but for as long as I am\nalive."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of\nthe stewardship of this historic Assembly and also to\ncongratulate your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\non his sterling guidance of the Assembly's work during\nthe previous session.\nThe dawn of the new millennium offers us a\nunique opportunity to reflect on the successes and\nfailures of the United Nations since its inception. It\nalso provides us with an opportunity to dream about the\nfuture of humanity in the third millennium. The\nfounders of the United Nations based the Charter on\nthe assertion of human dignity, human rights and the\nequality of women and men and the aim of promoting\nbetter social standards. Indeed, billions of people today\nenjoy human rights and live in dignity, free from\ndisease, ignorance and fear, enjoying the benefits of\ntechnology and scientific advances and able to take full\nadvantage of the process of globalization. Equally,\nthere are billions who are humiliated, degraded and\nstripped of their innate human dignity and worth by\npoverty, disease, ignorance, homelessness, hunger and\nwars.\nThis Assembly, following the very inspiring\nMillennium Summit, provides us with an opportunity\nto reflect on the wise words of the leaders of the world\nand on the Declaration they adopted. Global consensus\nhas at last emerged and confirms that we live in one\nworld and belong to the same human race; therefore,\nwhile each Government has the responsibility to take\ncare of its citizens, we all have to work together for the\ngood of humanity as a whole. This means that we have\nto create a people-centred world that is more caring,\nwith a strong sense of solidarity, where we are all our\nbrothers' and sisters' keepers, if I may borrow those\nwords from the Bible.\nThere is also universal consensus now that while\nbillions of people are being degraded and dehumanized\nby poverty, disease and hunger, there are indeed\nenough resources in the world to feed, educate and\nrestore the dignity of all human beings and make this\nworld a better place for all. It is therefore clear that the\neradication of hunger and poverty should be the\npriority of all priorities and should be our collective\nresponsibility.\nThere is also agreement that we have a collective\nresponsibility in dealing with infectious diseases, such\nas malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted\ndiseases, especially HIV/AIDS. There is a need to\nmobilize material and human resources, provide better\ninfrastructure, provide health education and ensure\naccess to affordable medicine.\nThere is also consensus that Africa poses the\nbiggest development challenge. The success or failure\nof the United Nations and of humankind as a whole in\nthis century will be determined by their success in\ndealing with the African development challenge.\nWe would like to urge the United Nations, in\npartnership with the Organization of African Unity and\nregional organizations, to accelerate the work towards\npeace and stability in many of the countries of our\ncontinent, such as Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Eritrea,\nSomalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Sudan and Burundi, so that these countries may\ntake their rightful place in the continent, be seized with\nthe needs of their people, promote development,\nproduce and export goods and not be areas of perpetual\nsuffering and war that result in their being the net\nexporters of refugees. We welcome the Brahimi report\nand are studying it, as it contains very serious\nsuggestions about the future operations of the United\nNations.\nThe United Nations, particularly the Security\nCouncil, is humanity's principal agent for collective\nsecurity and it needs urgent reform so as to be able to\nlive up to this solemn responsibility. The world has\nchanged dramatically and continues to do so. It is\nimperative that the composition and role of the\nSecurity Council reflect that change and not remain\nobsolete. The Bretton Woods institutions are equally in\nneed of urgent reform in order to discharge their\nmandate and respond to the new development\n12\n\nchallenge. The World Trade Organization has to adapt\nits international trade rules so that they are equitable\nand fair and take account of global development\nchallenges.\nIt is a source of great concern to the developing\ncountries that, increasingly, decisions are taken outside\nthe United Nations and other global structures by\ndeveloped and rich countries when these decisions\nhave a great impact on the poorer countries and\ndirectly affect the lives of billions of poor people. That\nis why a partnership between poor and rich countries\nand dialogue between North and South are so critical.\nNuclear weapons still constitute a threat to our\nplanet. We have to pursue the path of universal\ndisarmament and the destruction of all weapons of\nmass destruction.\nThe need to protect the environment has assumed\ngreater importance and we can succeed only if we work\ntogether.\nThe self-determination of the people of East\nTimor, Western Sahara and Palestine must be a concern\nto all of us. To this end, we urge the United Nations to\ndo all it can to expedite the processes in East Timor\nand Western Sahara. We commend the peace efforts in\nthe Middle East and the role of the United States. We\nwould like to pledge our support to the Palestinian and\nIsraeli leaderships as they try to find creative solutions\nto their problems. They must be urged to take\nadvantage of this unique historic moment, as it seems\nthat a real possibility exists for a solution.\nThe equality of women and men still remains a\nsubject of great concern. All we need to do is look\naround this Hall to realize how far we are from\nrealizing the vision of the founding Members of the\nUnited Nations. Secondly, the feminization of poverty\nis a big problem. The marginalization of women, both\nin their countries and in the multilateral forums, means\nthat our countries and organizations, including the\nUnited Nations, are functioning at half-capacity and are\ndeprived of the unique qualities, energies and creativity\nthat women would bring. In this context, I cannot\nforget the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She\ndeserves active support from this gathering and the\nworld.\nThe United Nations was founded in part to make\nsure that the monsters of fascism and racism should not\nrear their ugly heads again. Unfortunately, all over the\nworld racism and xenophobia are on the increase.\nSome countries and regions are responding by\ndeveloping a new fortress mentality, which does not\nhelp the situation. This should flash red warning lights\nto all of us and activate our utmost vigilance against\nthe scourges of racism and xenophobia.\nIt is only when we turn our backs on racism,\nxenophobia and other forms of discrimination that we\ncan succeed in building a caring world where we feel\ndiminished by the suffering and hunger of other human\nbeings. It was for this reason that we felt a sense of\nobligation and agreed to host the world racism\nConference next year. Of course, our country and\npeople experienced the most systematic, most brutal\nand most inhumane form of racism, which the United\nNations declared a crime against humanity. We are\nhappy to take our place in the fight against racism in\nour country and in the world. It is our fervent hope that\nthe Conference will come up with a programme of\naction against racism, xenophobia and other forms of\ndiscrimination.\nIn conclusion, let us all put our collective will,\ncourage and intellectual creativity together in shaping\nthe dream of a better world; a world of solidarity; a\nworld where no child should starve or die of\npreventable and curable diseases; a world where no\nchild will be deprived of schooling; a world where\nchildren will not be sent to war; a world where no child\ncan be a slave or be used as an object for trafficking; a\nworld where children grow up as children and play\nwith toys and do not have to be breadwinners or worry\nabout where their next meal is going to come from; a\nworld where women will enjoy all rights and where the\neradication of poverty and war is our collective\nresponsibility.\nThe dream for the new millennium is indeed\nrealisable. If we act with courage and determination,\nwe can turn the hopes of billions across the world into\nreality."

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset to extend my\ncongratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his election to\npreside over the work of this important fifty-fifth\nsession. It is indeed important because it is the first\nsession in the new millennium. We are confident that\nhis experience and diplomatic capability will be, God\nwilling, great assets in our effort to achieve the desired\nsuccess. I also extend my sincere thanks to the\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session, His Excellency Dr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, and to his friendly country,\nNamibia, noting that his outstanding efforts had a\ntremendous impact on solving numerous difficulties\nand achieving good results in many matters during the\npast session. I should further like to express my thanks\nand appreciation to His Excellency, Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, who tried his utmost and has not\ncompromised, in his effort to realize the goals aspired\nto by all peoples of the world. We also appreciate his\nendeavour in preparing the report before us.\nA few days ago the world witnessed a great event\nin time and place, hosted in this building. This very\nsame hall was crowded with a unique assemblage of\nworld leaders who came from every corner of the globe\nto attend the Millennium Summit. The attendance of so\nmany leaders and their desire to participate signifies\nmany things, most important of which is their firm\nrecognition of the role of the United Nations, which\nrepresents the hope of the peoples of the world for the\nachievement of a peaceful coexistence that guarantees\nsecurity, peace and well-being for all. The Summit\nDeclaration has deeply impressed us all. We trust that\nthe role of the United Nations will grow stronger when\nStates, particularly the great Powers, look beyond their\nnarrow, short-lived interests, work in the interests of\nthis Organization, and firmly abide by its Charter for\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and by\nresorting to the international judicial system. That\nwould be a civilized demonstration of the progress\nachieved by nations and an acknowledgement of the\nsignificance and fairness of the rule of law, which is an\ninstrument of security and peace, whose decisions\ndeserve respect and full obedience.\nWe, in the State of Qatar, under the leadership of\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the dearly\nbeloved Emir of the country, give the United Nations\nand all its international organizations their due\nappreciation and respect as part of the philosophy of\nour system, which is based on truth and justice, both\ninternally and externally. We consider democracy and\nhuman rights to be essential targets that we strive to\nattain according to our special cultural, religious and\nsocial characteristics. We thank God that we are aiming\nin the right direction.\nAs the Assembly is well aware, we live in a\nregion that has for two decades been plagued by\ndisasters and crises. No sooner does one problem calm\ndown than another erupts like an active volcano. But\nmany good people from the Arab Gulf, and honourable\npeople and lovers of peace from other parts of the\nworld, are trying their best to establish security in a\nregion of great importance to present civilization, as\nthe region has embedded in it a sizeable portion of the\nsources of energy needed by all. No sooner had the\nIraqi-Iranian war, which devastated the region and left\nit with bleeding wounds, come to an end and people\nhad hopes of a period of rest during which the wounds\ncould be healed, than another crisis occurred, greater in\ndimensions and more complex this time, namely, the\nsecond Gulf War, the invasion of Kuwait and its\nliberation and the economic boycott of Iraq, which has\ngone on for a decade so far, killing people, particularly\nchildren, the ill and the ageing. All of us now know\nthat the sanctions have failed to achieve the goal for\nwhich they were established. Their course has changed\nso much that they have become like a plague afflicting\npeople. Not only do we call for the lifting of sanctions\nimposed on Iraq and putting an end to the suffering of\nits people, but also for a reconsideration of the issue of\nimposing sanctions, whether by individual States or\nthrough the United Nations, for recourse to sanctions\nhas completely failed, leaving behind merely rancour\nand hatred.\nIn referring to the humanitarian situation in Iraq\nand realizing that humanitarian matters are indivisible,\nwe welcome the Secretary-General's appointment of\nYuli Vorontsov to be his representative regarding the\nfate of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, so as to\nbring this phase of human suffering to an end. The\nState of Qatar sincerely hopes that through concerted\nbilateral and regional efforts a solution will be found to\n17\n\nthe problem of prisoners and missing persons, whether\nthey be our Kuwaiti or Iraqi brothers.\nIn this context I should like to note that last year\nmy Government welcomed the positive development\nand the progress that had been made for the settlement\nof the \u201cLockerbie\u201d question. We commend the\ncooperation and positive response by the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya and its fulfilment of its obligations. On the\nother hand, we emphasize the necessity and\ninevitability of lifting the sanctions imposed on Libya,\nwhich had been temporarily suspended, because the\nwhole issue had been referred to a court following the\nextradition of the two Libyan suspects. Consequently,\nthere is no longer legal justification for the\ncontinuation of such sanctions.\nThe principle of dialogue or recourse to the\ninternational judicial system referred to at the\nbeginning of my address, fully applies to the dispute\nbetween the Emirates and Iran over the occupied\nislands. The State of Qatar strives, within the tripartite\ncommittee established by the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, which includes our sister States the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman, to reach a\nsolution acceptable to both parties through bilateral\ndialogue or recourse to international arbitration.\nSimilarly the Middle East question is foremost in\nour priority concerns. An endeavour to solve this\nquestion was launched but it faced obstacles and\nimpediments that prevented the attainment of the\nmuch-sought-after peace based on legitimate\ninternational resolutions, particularly Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which were the\nfoundations of the peace process. The Arabs consider\npeace their strategic option, yet a comprehensive peace\nis still beyond reach, owing to Israeli intransigence,\ninflexibility and disregard of the basic rights of the\nArab nation. This intransigence was an impediment to\npeace on the Syrian-Lebanese track. Israel's refusal to\nwithdraw to the 4 June 1967 borders did not meet the\nminimum conditions placed by the Syrian Arab\nRepublic, consistent with United Nations resolutions.\nSimply because of a few metres Israel wasted a rare\nchance for peace.\nThe situation on the Palestinian track, which is\nthe core and crux of the dispute in the region, is no\nbetter. At the Camp David summit the Government of\nIsrael proved that it was captive to the extremist wing\nof its people and that it was not mature enough to take\nthe brave decision of bringing to an end a conflict that\nhas lasted for half a century. Moreover, Israel's\ninsistence on the occupation of East Jerusalem is\nprovocative to the feelings of millions of Muslims and\nChristians throughout the world. Israel must abide by\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), on the basis of\nwhich the peace process was launched and which calls\nfor its withdrawal from all Arab lands to the borders of\n4 June 1967. Furthermore, the conflict will not come to\nan end without solving the question of Palestinian\nrefugees, in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 194 (III).\nThis leads to the question of Israeli settlements in\noccupied Arab territories. These settlements are time\nbombs standing in the way of any resolution to the\nconflict. Extremist Zionists planted these settlements to\nblock any peaceful solution, in contradiction of\nnumerous General Assembly and Security Council\nresolutions that explicitly declare them illegitimate.\nThe State of Qatar, declaring its full support of the\nlegitimate Arab demands on the Syrian, Lebanese and\nPalestinian tracks, hopes that the voice of reason, love\nand peace will eventually prevail, that a just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East will be achieved, and that an\nindependent Palestinian state, ruling over all\nPalestinian national territory with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as\nits capital, will be established. The United States of\nAmerica, whose efforts in the peace process are\nappreciated, is called upon more than at any time in the\npast, to exert pressure on Israel to respond to the\nchallenges of peace and not miss this historic\nopportunity as a result of narrow, short-lived\nambitions; the alternative to the peace process is too\ndangerous for international peace and security, and\ncould lead us all into a maze whose outcome would be\nknown only to God.\nThe State of Qatar supports attempts made at\nnational reconciliation in our sisterly State, the Sudan,\nand endorses the efforts of the Sudanese Government\nin this respect, and hopes that goodwill and sincerity\nwill lead to consensus so that people's efforts will be\ndirected towards development and reconstruction. At\nthe same time it requests that foreign parties refrain\nfrom prolonging the crisis at the expense of the\nbrotherly people of the Sudan, who pay the price with\nillness, hunger and blood.\nWe also support the tireless efforts of the\nPresident and the Government of Djibouti to solve the\nelusive and chronic Somali problem, and thank God\n18\n\nthat those efforts have been fruitful. Here we extend\nour congratulations to His Excellency, President\nAbdikassim Salad Hassan, the elected Somali\nPresident. We wish him and his Government every\nsuccess. We assure him that he will find in the State of\nQatar the necessary help and support in order to sail the\nboat of national reconciliation safely to land. We also\nhope that our Somali brothers will help treat each\nother's wounds, put an end to the chaos and destruction\nthat has befallen their country for a decade, and\nrespond to the hopes and aspirations of their people,\nwho dream of security, peace and a life of honour and\nfreedom, like all peoples of the world.\nThis leads us to the entire region of the Horn of\nAfrica, where war, drought and famine have inflicted\nuntold suffering on its people, with whom we have\nrelations of kinship and neighbourhood. We wish them\nstability and every good, and we hope that their efforts\nwill be directed towards action and construction.\nThe State of Qatar looks closely and with concern\nat what is plotted against our sisterly State, Indonesia,\nthe most populous Muslim State and one that has a\nprominent place in the minds of all Muslims. Intrigues\nare being secretly contrived to dissect this peaceful\nMuslim State under the pretext of human rights and\nother means of deception that fool nobody. We\nemphasize our strong and unreserved support for the\nsovereignty of Indonesia over all its territories, and for\nits territorial integrity and national unity. Events in\nIndonesia constitute a domestic affair, the like of which\noccurs in many States in the world. The Indonesian\nGovernment, God willing, is capable of putting an end\nto such problems among its citizens, regardless of their\nrace, religion or orientation. We realize too that\nfinancial difficulties and poverty are among the main\nfactors of these internal problems.\nIt is hoped that this session, the first in the new\nmillennium, will give us a strong impetus to reflect on\nour world today with all its disparities embodied in the\ndaily life of hundreds of millions of people. A close\nscrutiny of the world will reveal a rich, developed\nNorth enjoying prosperity, democracy, economic\nstability and ample opportunities for creativity and\ninnovation, and a poor South, many of whose States try\nhard to catch up with the march of civilization and\nprogress and utilize all their capabilities for the\ndevelopment of their infrastructures and the\nadvancement of their people. However, other States of\nthe South continue to suffer from war and conflict both\nbetween States and among citizens of the same country,\nthus causing their suffering to increase and their\nresources to be wasted on acquiring weapons instead of\nbeing used for education, health and the building of\ninfrastructures.\nSince economic factors contribute enormously to\nthe continuation of wars and disputes, it is incumbent\nupon us to solve the causes of these crises. That can\nonly be achieved with the cooperation of all,\nparticularly the rich States of the North. Foremost\namong those crises are indebtedness and the\naccumulation of interest that exhaust the income of\nmany States of the South. We hope that the States of\nthe North and their creditor institutions will respond to\nthe numerous appeals to write off, either wholly or\npartially, the debts or interest of the poorest countries\nwhich strive to upgrade their fragile economies. We\nmust also conduct a comprehensive review of the\ninternational banking system by holding an\ninternational conference in which all countries of the\nworld participate, with the aim of establishing a wise,\nfair and just pilot policy for the world economy in the\nnew millennium, taking into consideration the issue of\ndevelopment in third world countries and directing\ninvestment and capital towards the establishment of a\ngenuine partnership that promotes such development.\nGlobalization has impacted every region and\ntransformed the world into a small village, no part of\nwhich can be separated from the other parts. Therefore,\nthe transfer of technology, especially information and\ncommunications technology, must be accompanied by\ntransparent globalization, rather than selective\nglobalization wherein third world countries are no\nmore than markets for the products of developed\ncountries and large corporations.\nThe process of reforming the United Nations\nattracts the attention of all States, and I have referred to\nit on other occasions at past sessions. The Secretary-\nGeneral's efforts are outstanding in this respect. For the\nrealization of an active Organization responding\nharmoniously to contemporary requirements, its work\nhas to be activated, the number of its employees who\ndrain its resources has to be cut back, and the dynamics\nof its work, both at Headquarters and in its bodies,\norgans and offices elsewhere, have to be changed.\nMoreover, the process of reforming the Security\nCouncil requires the Working Group to proceed until it\nachieves the goal for which it was established. The\n19\n\nWorking Group has indeed gone a long way in that\nrespect, particularly with regard to the second cluster\nrelating to procedural matters in the work of the\nCouncil. As for expanding the Council and increasing\nits membership, the State of Qatar is committed to the\nposition of the Arab Group and the countries of the\nNon-Aligned Movement that calls for a minimum\nincrease of up to 26 members, taking into consideration\nequitable geographical distribution and the fact that the\nlast increase in its membership took place in 1963. We\nalso endorse the continuation of the Working Group,\nwhich, God willing, will reach a consensual solution.\nAt the same time we emphasize the right of the Arab\nworld to a permanent seat in any impending increase.\nA few terms and ideas have recently gained\ncurrency, and though they sound good they imply a\ngreat threat to States and nations. Danger is not\ninherent in these terms but is rather a consequence of\ntheir interpretation or application. Intervention in\nhumanitarian cases is one of these ideas that can be\nexploited by the great Powers to justify interference in\nthe internal affairs of States and the violation of their\nnational sovereignty. Promotion of democracies in the\nworld, the code of conduct and good governance are all\nrelative, and if they were to be used according to their\npresent interpretation, the world would run according\nto a single style of democracy and one culture would\nprevail. This is so serious that it would eliminate\npluralism, which is an enriching factor in the work of\nthe United Nations, since it indicates diversity and\ndifference among peoples and nations. This very same\ndiversity contributes positively to world interests,\npromotes humanitarian and cultural exchanges and\nenables each of us to accept other cultures and coexist\nwith them. True democracy is one that is freely chosen\nby any people for its mode of governance without\noutside intervention.\nThe year 2001, the United Nations Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations, may offer us a good\nopportunity to demonstrate more tolerance and\ncommunication among nations for the benefit of\nhumanity. I should like here to refer to the address by\nHis Highness, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the\nbeloved Emir of Qatar, on 5 September 2000 when the\ndialogue among civilizations initiative was launched,\nand to His Highness's emphasis on the significance of\ndialogue and communication as an alternative to\ndispute and conflict.\nPeacekeeping forces play a very important role,\nestablishing security and stability in many different\nregions suffering from conflict and war, and as time\npasses, the cost of operating these forces rise. At this\nsession the Fifth Committee will discuss the issue of\ncontributions to these forces. We maintain that the\nFifth Committee is the best forum for this, but since\nthis process is linked to Members' assessed\ncontributions to the regular budget, we believe that\nfinalizing the scale of assessments first is a reasonable\npriority. Our delegation will actively take part in the\nwork of that Committee with the aim of reaching a\nconsensus, without which we cannot find a solution to\nthe problem of committing any State to something it\ncannot meet in the future. We stress that all aspects of\nthe economic situation of each State should be\nconsidered, particularly the emerging economies that\nrely on one source of income and that are subject to\nmarket volatility. My country is one of those States.\nFinally, the State of Qatar firmly believes in the\nimportance of the role of the United Nations in\nestablishing security, stability and peace throughout the\nworld, and it also believes in the importance of\nrespecting the United Nations Charter and its lofty\ngoals, and the need to adhere to the Charter in\ninternational relations. We trust and hope that the\nfuture will be bright, when all peoples of the globe will\nrealize their goals and aspirations and will positively\ncontribute to the process of building, development and\ninnovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me\ngreat pleasure at the outset to convey to Mr. Harri\nHolkeri on behalf of my delegation our congratulations\non his election as President for this session. Aware of\nhis well-known diplomatic experience and skill, we are\nconfident that he will lead the work of this session to\nsuccess. I should also like to express our appreciation\nand admiration for the role played by his predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia,\nduring his presidency of the previous session, and for\nhis co-chairmanship of the Millennium Summit.\nIn this respect, I commend the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his remarkable efforts in preparing\nfor the Millennium Summit and the Millennium\nAssembly.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also welcome the\nState of Tuvalu as a new Member of our Organization.\nLast week, the Millennium Summit endorsed a\nhistorical declaration that laid out a strategy for\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nToday I should like to stress that it is our duty to\nconcentrate, during this Millennium Assembly and\nthrough its different forums, on translating that vision\ninto decisions and resolutions to achieve and\n23\n\nconsolidate international peace and security, total\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction,\nresolution of environmental problems, combating\ninternational terrorism and organized international\ncrime, prevention of conflicts before they erupt and\nresolution of the problems of poverty and socio-\neconomic backwardness. If we succeed during this\nsession, we can then say that we have contributed to\ncreating circumstances conducive to the achievement\nof human security and have liberated mankind from\nfear and want.\nOn the other hand, we believe that this\nMillennium Assembly should give equal importance to\nthe reform of the institutions of the United Nations, as\nthey represent the mechanisms through which the\ninternational community coordinates the\nimplementation of plans for achieving international\npeace and security, comprehensive sustainable\ndevelopment and prosperity for mankind.\nAt the apex of these institutions stands the\nSecurity Council. All countries continue to call for its\nreform by expanding its permanent and non-permanent\nmembership, in order to make it more representative of\nthe current membership of the United Nations. They\nalso call for reform of the Council's working methods\nand decision-making mechanisms, in order to render it\nmore democratic and transparent.\nWe share the Secretary-General's view, expressed\nin his report to the Millennium Summit, that the main\nchallenge we face today is how to transform\nglobalization into a positive power that benefits all the\npeoples of the world. The great scientific and\ntechnological achievements of the last millennium\nconstitute the common heritage of mankind. We call on\nthe international community to work out the necessary\nguarantees to prevent these achievements from being\nturned into a monopoly of knowledge or cultural and\nintellectual domination or from being used as a means\nto achieve political and economic hegemony or widen\nthe scientific and technological gap between countries\nof the North and countries of the South. While we\nwelcome protection of these scientific and\ntechnological achievements as elements of intellectual\nproperty, we call upon our development partners to\nmake this great wealth available to all humanity and to\nenable the developing countries to use such innovations\nin overcoming the chronic problems of production,\nfood, health, education and the environment.\nThe right to development is a basic human right.\nIn order to guarantee that right it is imperative that we\nestablish a democratic, just and transparent world\neconomic order that ensures fair terms of trade between\npoor and rich countries, increases the level of official\ndevelopment assistance to poor countries and alleviates\nthe debt burden crushing those countries. This is the\nonly viable means to enable the developing countries to\nbenefit from the aspects and opportunities that\nglobalization and the revolution in information\ntechnology offer \u2014 benefits that are still monopolized\nby a very small minority of the population of our\nglobe.\nIn this regard, Sudan looks forward to the United\nNations financing for development event and the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, which are scheduled to take place next year.\nWe sincerely hope that their results will receive the\neffective implementation they deserve by all United\nNations agencies.\nThis year the General Assembly convened two\nspecial sessions to follow up the results of the Beijing\nWorld Conference on Women and the Copenhagen\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Despite the\nremarkable achievements realized by national\nGovernments and the international community in\nimplementation of the commitments contained in the\ndocuments resulting from those gatherings, the\nmajority of those commitments were not realized, for\nseveral reasons, foremost being the failure to fulfil the\nfinancial commitments undertaken in Beijing and\nCopenhagen and the excessive debt burden and debt\nservice commitments of the developing and least\ndeveloped countries.\nWe also call for more support for efforts made by\ndeveloping countries to eradicate ever-increasing\npoverty and all pandemic and epidemic diseases such\nas malaria and HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa.\nSudan looks forward to participating effectively\nin the World Conference against Racism to be held next\nyear in South Africa. We believe that this important\nconference will help us tackle crucial issues very dear\nto the human race. My country also intends to\nparticipate in the special session of the General\nAssembly to review the results and achievement of the\ngoals of the World Summit for Children.\nRecently, the President of the Republic of Sudan\nestablished an advisory body, attached to his office, in\n24\n\ncharge of women's and children's affairs. This step is\nyet further proof of the special importance that the\nPresident attaches to the issues of women and children\nand his incessant work to strengthen achievements in\nthis field.\nWe view with great interest the report (A/55/305)\nof the Panel of Experts prepared by Mr. Brahimi on\npeacekeeping operations, because of its importance and\nthe new ideas and proposals it contains on the\ncontainment and prevention of conflicts and on\npeacekeeping operations. Our delegation will certainly\nparticipate in the discussion of this report in the\nGeneral Assembly and relevant Committees. In this\nconnection, we emphasize the need to set clear\nmandates for peacekeeping operations, ensuring the\nconsent of the country receiving peacekeeping\noperations and providing the necessary resources for\nsuch operations in order to ensure their success and to\navoid any possible dangers and setbacks.\nMy delegation expresses its deep concern about\nthe difficulties facing the peace process in the Middle\nEast. In this respect, we reiterate the importance of\ntotal Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab\nterritories in accordance with United Nations\nresolutions, in order to enable the Palestinian people to\nrestore full sovereignty to their territories, to establish\ntheir independent State with Holy Jerusalem as its\ncapital and to enable the Syrian Arab Republic to\nreinstate sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We are\nconvinced that without implementation of these\nresolutions, stability in this important region will never\nbe realized and will remain a mere dream. In this\ncontext, we commend the resistance and heroic\nstruggle of the people of Lebanon in the liberation of\ntheir territories.\nThe call to reform the international sanctions\nregime is gaining more momentum within the Security\nCouncil and other United Nations bodies, because the\nnegative effects of sanctions have compounded the\nsuffering of the peoples of the countries subjected to\nthem, in particular vulnerable groups such as children,\nwomen and the elderly. The most horrible and dreadful\naspects of the negative impacts of sanctions are seen\namong the Iraqi people. We add our voice to ongoing\nefforts to lift these sanctions.\nSudan also reaffirms the importance of\nmaintaining the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\nand rejects any measures taken outside the scope of\nUnited Nations resolutions and international\nlegitimacy. At the same time, Sudan reaffirms the need\nto respect and comply with all United Nations\nresolutions and to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait,\nand calls for a just and urgent solution to the issue of\nKuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners, through\ncooperation and understanding between the parties\nconcerned. We believe that it is high time to lift all\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\nsince it has complied with and fulfilled all its\nobligations regarding the Lockerbie incident.\nWe view with satisfaction the recent positive\ndevelopments in the Horn of Africa, namely, the\nceasefire agreement reached between our two sisterly\nneighbours, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We hope this\nagreement will culminate in a lasting peace between\nthe two parties, and we should like to commend the\nefforts deployed by President Bouteflika of Algeria\ntowards that end.\nWe should also like to hail and commend the\nefforts of Djibouti and its President Ismail Omar\nGuelleh to achieve national reconciliation and restore\nstability to the Republic of Somalia. The Sudan,\nrepresented by President Omer Hassan Ahmed\nAl-Bashir, participated in the inauguration ceremony of\nAbdihassim Salad Hassan as President of the Republic\nof Somalia. We call on the United Nations and the\ninternational community to support efforts to restore\npeace, stability and security to Somalia under its\nelected leadership.\nWhile we fully understand the concerns of the\ninternational community about the ongoing conflict in\nthe southern Sudan, we should like to recall that the\nSudan is waging a war imposed by a rebel movement\nseeking to undermine its territorial integrity and the\nsafety and security of its people. We should also like to\nrecall that it was the Government of the Sudan that\ninitially invited the United Nations to undertake the\ntask of coordinating international humanitarian\nassistance for citizens affected by this conflict.\nTen years have elapsed since the implementation\nof the Agreement known as Operation Lifeline Sudan.\nHowever, it has had to be reviewed because of repeated\nviolations of its terms by the rebel movement and some\nother organizations participating in this process.\nIn this regard, it is my honour to express our deep\nappreciation and gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and to his Special Envoy, Ambassador Tom\n25\n\nVraalsen, as well as to the personnel of the Office for\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for\nthe understanding they have shown regarding the\nGovernment's demands for ensuring impartiality and\ntransparency, as well as for determining the obligations\nof all parties to the agreement and ensuring the fair\nallocation of humanitarian assistance among citizens\naffected by the conflict on both sides. It is on the basis\nof this understanding that the Government has\ncommitted itself to ensure the safety and protection of\nall relief agency personnel operating in the southern\nSudan.\nWe believe it is our duty to brief the Assembly on\nthe current humanitarian situation in the Bahr el Ghazal\narea in the southern Sudan, where the rebel movement\nhas recently increased its violations of the partial\nceasefire. This has created obstacles and security\ncomplications that impeded the delivery of\nhumanitarian relief to affected citizens in that area. We\ntherefore urge the Assembly to bring pressure to bear\non the rebel movement to stop using civilian\npopulations and locations, such as hospitals and\nschools, as human shields and to fulfil its obligations\nby halting all military operations in order to ensure\nunhindered relief operations to all affected populations\nand to avert a humanitarian tragedy similar to the one\nendured by Bahr el Ghazal in the first quarter of 1998.\nThe Government of the Sudan has reaffirmed its\ncommitment to reach a just and lasting political\nsolution to the conflict in the southern Sudan based on\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development\n(IGAD) initiative and to respond to other initiatives\nintended to solve other problems. Nonetheless, these\npeace efforts have not succeeded because of the\nintransigence of the rebel movement, which continues\nto renege on its obligations, undermining any\nagreement reached.\nThis is clearly reflected in the position of the\nrebel movement regarding the ceasefire, which it\ncontinues to violate, as well as its continued rejection\nof the call by the Government for a lasting,\ncomprehensive ceasefire \u2014 a call that has received\nwide support from the international community, the\nIGAD partners and several other United Nations\nagencies, as well as regional and international\ngroupings.\nPresident Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir\nreaffirmed in his address to the Millennium Summit the\ncommitment of the Government of the Sudan to a just\nand lasting political solution based on the following.\nFirst, there should be an immediate and comprehensive\nceasefire in order to facilitate the delivery of\nhumanitarian assistance to the needy and to create a\nconducive atmosphere and confidence-building\nmeasures for the success of the peace efforts. Secondly,\nthere should be direct negotiations on the basis of\ncurrent peace initiatives, specifically, the IGAD\nprocess, which provides a negotiating forum for the\nGovernment and the rebel movement, as well as the\njoint Egyptian/Libyan initiative, which is aimed at\nachieving a comprehensive resolution to all of the\nSudan's problems with the participation of the\nGovernment, the rebel movement and the opposition in\nand outside the Sudan. Thirdly, a comprehensive\npeaceful settlement should be reached in order to lay\nthe foundation for a fair distribution of power and\nwealth, establish rights and duties based on citizenship\nand guarantee total adherence to international standards\nand instruments of democracy and human rights.\nIn addition to efforts being deployed to solve the\nmilitary conflict in the southern Sudan, the\nGovernment continues to make efforts towards national\nreconciliation through direct and indirect contacts with\nopposition groups. Agreement has been reached to hold\na comprehensive national conference in which all\npolitical and social denominations and factions will\ntake part in order to discuss national unity, freedom,\ndemocracy and the system of government. The\nconference is expected to agree on a national charter\nthat will provide the basis for a system of government\ncharacterized by pluralism, freedoms and peaceful\ntransfer of power.\nThe Government has taken the initiative of\norganizing a preparatory meeting for this conference in\nKhartoum, and a national preparatory committee has\nbeen formed. This will be followed by another\npreparatory meeting to be held in Cairo to determine\nthe agenda, date and venue of the inclusive national\nconference. It is my pleasure to commend the efforts of\nthe Governments of Egypt and the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya in this regard.\nWhile efforts for peace and reconciliation are\nbeing pursued, the Government is undertaking the\nnecessary legal and administrative measures to\nestablish a democratic, pluralistic system that provides\nall the necessary freedoms. The Government is also\npreparing to hold parliamentary and presidential\n26\n\nelections, and has invited and welcomed the\nparticipation of international and regional\norganizations to supervise these elections.\nIn the economic field, the Government continues\nto implement programmes of reform and liberalization\nof the economy and is encouraging local and foreign\ninvestment. In this context, it is my pleasure to inform\nthe Assembly that the Executive Board of the\nInternational Monetary Fund decided at its meeting last\nAugust in Washington to resume full cooperation with\nthe Sudan.\nThe Sudan has also managed to normalize its\nrelations with other international and regional financial\ninstitutions, and hopes that the flow of foreign aid and\nforeign direct investment to the Sudan will enable it to\novercome its economic difficulties and relieve its debt\nburden. We have also started preparations to draw up a\ndevelopment strategy for the coming decade, which\nwill concentrate on poverty alleviation and on\nproviding basic health services, education and rural\ndevelopment. Revenues from the export of petroleum\nwill be earmarked for socio-economic development\nprogrammes.\nIt has now been two years since the United States\nmilitary aggression on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical\nfactory in the Sudan, which resulted in the total\ndestruction of an important medical facility that used to\nproduce more than half of the Sudan's needs for basic\nand life-saving medicines. The debris of that factory\nand the effects of the missile attack by the United\nStates still bear witness to what happens when the\nmilitary might of a super-Power is used irresponsibly.\nIt is ironic that the same super-Power that claims to be\na pioneer in protecting and safeguarding international\npeace and security and the principles of international\nlaw should resort to such an action. This gathering will\nrecall that immediately after that aggression, the Sudan\ncalled on the Security Council to send a fact-finding\nmission to verify United States allegations concerning\nthe factory and its financing. Yet despite the fact that\nthe whole world, and indeed several media\norganizations inside the United States, have cast doubts\non United States allegations about the Al-Shifa factory,\nthe United States Administration continues to maintain\nits position, contrary to all facts, thus insisting on\njustifying a wrong that has deprived the people of the\nSudan, especially the vulnerable and children, of a\nsource of medicine at affordable prices \u2014 less than\nhalf of what those medicines cost on the international\nmarket.\nConvinced that rights do not die, we shall\ncontinue our efforts to urge the international\ncommunity, the Security Council and the General\nAssembly to send a mission to verify United States\nallegations, and we trust that our just cause has the\nsupport of all peace-loving countries that guard these\nnoble principles. We wish here to call on the United\nStates Administration not to use its position in the\nSecurity Council to block the sending of a fact-finding\nmission that will show the world the truth and expose\nthe unwarranted aggression against a basic health\nfacility.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is a principal\nobjective and cardinal role of the United Nations. The\nSudan adheres to this objective and seeks to realize it\nin the conduct of its foreign relations at all levels.\nBased on this position, and in order to realize this\nnoble objective, the Sudan has continuously committed\nitself to respect for the norms of international law as\nthe only way to settle disputes and to maintain\ninternational peace and security.\nThe Sudan is today one of only 62 States that\nhave fully accepted the jurisdiction of the International\nCourt of Justice. Furthermore, the Sudan, during the\nMillennium Summit, signed the 1998 Rome Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court and deposited its\ninstrument of ratification for the 1997 International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\nBy ratifying this treaty, the Sudan has become one of a\nfew countries that have completed the process of\nratification and adherence to all international\nconventions to combat international terrorism. This is\nindeed a source of pride to us. We believe the\nAssembly will agree that this record qualifies the\nSudan to make all possible contributions to maintaining\npeace and security through the highest specialized\ninstitutions.\nSince it became a Member of the United Nations\nfollowing its independence in 1956, the Sudan has\ncontinued to work in collaboration with the other\nMember States in order to develop and sustain\ninternational cooperation to realize the objectives of\nthe Charter in all fields. The Sudan looks forward to\npursuing this role in another important forum as a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\nperiod 2001-2002, for the first time in 28 years.\n27\n\nThe candidature of Sudan has been endorsed and\nsupported by the African continent, represented in the\nAfrican Group in New York, as well as by the Council\nof Ministers of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) at the OAU summit in Togo last July. The\nSudan looks forward with confidence and optimism to\nobtaining the support and endorsement of all United\nNations Members for its candidature in the elections\nthat will take place in the General Assembly in the\ncoming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Less\nthan a week ago, in this same Hall, the President of the\nRepublic of Guatemala, Alfonso Portillo Cabrera,\naddressed the Millennium Summit. On that occasion\nthe President underscored our commitment to the\npurposes, principles and values of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, and presented a summary of our view\nof the role of this universal Organization in the twenty-\nfirst century. In closing, he stated:\n\u201cIn the course of the general debate that will\nbegin in the General Assembly next week, we\nwill elaborate further on this vision and how it is\nreflected in the efforts we are making\ndomestically.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nI am honoured and pleased to deliver what our\nPresident promised.\nI shall address two issues: first, our Government\nprogramme and the implementation of the peace\nagreements, and secondly, our position vis-\u00e0-vis some\nof the items on the agenda for this session. Before\ndoing so, I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for\nhis vigorous conduct of the last session, and\nparticularly for his resolute work in the preparation for\nthe Millennium Summit. We are pleased that\nGuatemala had an opportunity to cooperate in this\nundertaking.\nI also wish to congratulate the President very\nwarmly on his election to preside over our debates. I\nhave no doubt that his recognized diplomatic and\npolitical experience will enable us to obtain the best\nresults.\n16\n\nI begin with a few words on the peace process in\nmy country, to which the United Nations has made\nsuch a significant contribution. December 1996 saw the\nsigning, following a protracted period of arduous\nnegotiations of Agreements that brought to an end four\ndecades of a fratricidal war that had tragic and lasting\nconsequences. Our political party was not a signatory.\nHowever, during the electoral campaign it affirmed,\nthat it accepted the Agreements as a State commitment,\nand President Portillo confirmed that in the speech he\nmade on taking office. Similarly, our Government is\nfully committed to complying with the provisions of\nthe Agreements, and indeed to extend their scope to\nincorporate new matters, such as democratizing access\nto credit.\nWe value highly the presence in our country of\nthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala,\nand request the Assembly's cooperation for the\nextension, in due course, of its mandate until the end of\n2003.\nIt is important to note that the purpose of the\nPeace Agreements coincides with our own Government\nprogramme in many areas, such as unrestricted respect\nfor human rights; consolidation of a full, participatory\ndemocracy; subordination of the armed forces to the\ncivil power; development of a multi-ethnic,\nmulticultural and multilingual society; strengthening\nand modernization of the justice system; reform of the\nState; and, above all, an adequate response to the\nunsatisfied demands of the majority of Guatemalans for\nmore and better social services, adequate incomes,\nbetter-paid jobs and equality of opportunity. In other\nwords, the Peace Agreements constitute a suitable\nframe of reference for the programme of our\nGovernment, which aims not only to fulfil, but to\nimprove on them.\nOur economic and social programmes for the\nperiod 2000-2004 fit within this frame of reference, as\ndoes the political covenant, which seeks to increase the\nparticipation of all sections of civil society in the\npublic policy decision-making process. These\nprogrammes also seek to reconcile the difficult\neconomic situation that we face with our commitment\nto carry forward a vigorous process of economic\nexpansion for the benefit of all Guatemalans \u2014 above\nall, the neediest. We are, in other words, grappling with\nthe classic dilemma of having to meet the requirements\nof a macroeconomic adjustment while coping with the\nimperative need to reactivate the economy.\nAt the centre of the national debate about how to\novercome this dilemma is a process of intersectoral\naccommodation that we call the \u201cfiscal covenant\u201d,\nwhich aims to fulfil one of the commitments in the\nPeace Agreements, namely, raising the tax take in\nGuatemala by 50 per cent between 1995 and 2000.\nThe arduous and lengthy negotiations that have\nbeen conducted in this connection are about to come to\nfruition with the adoption of a set of measures which,\nonce the commitment has been honoured \u2014 admittedly,\na couple of years late \u2014 will provide financial support\nfor implementing the other undertakings laid down in\nthe Peace Agreements.\nWe intend to establish the necessary bases so that\nin the period 2001-2004 we may secure dynamic\ngrowth of the economy, with the resulting generation of\ndecent, gainful productive employment together with\nhigher levels of savings and investment.\nWe shall invest in the future by according priority\nto the work force, particularly in the areas of health and\neducation, including multilingual education.\nWe shall carry out new productive activities in\nthose areas where we feel that we have comparative\nadvantages to offer at the international level.\nWe shall stimulate the institutional environment\nnecessary to facilitate the efficient functioning of the\nmarket through competition without privileges and the\ncompetitiveness of enterprises, all within the\nframework of absolute respect for labour law.\nWe shall devote special attention to combating\npoverty, by decentralizing the public administration\nand working closely with those who are to be the target\nof our policies.\nNow turning to our international relations, and\nbearing in mind those issues dealt with at the\nMillennium Summit, I wish to mention the significant\nadvance achieved in the process as we seek to resolve\nour historic dispute with Belize. With full regard for\nthe principles of peaceful settlement of disputes\nbetween or among States, we have reached a new stage\nwhereby dialogue has been chosen as the means to\nsettle differences. On 31 August, within the framework\nof the regional body to which both States belong,\nnamely the Organization of American States (OAS), a\nbody of facilitators, appointed by each party, has been\nset up. The facilitators enjoy full independence in the\nperformance of their duties. Their chief aim is to work\n17\n\nout and propose courses of action to advance the legal\nresolution of the dispute. These are significant steps\ntowards creating a peaceful environment, the adoption\nof confidence-building measures and a future-oriented\nor forward-looking outlook.\nSimilarly, we ratify, our deep commitment to\nsupporting Central American integration, as well as our\ncommitment to the rest of Latin America and the\nCaribbean. Our Government has taken important\ninitiatives in the area of regional and subregional\nintegration. Evidence of this is the tripartite declaration\nadopted last May by Guatemala, El Salvador and\nNicaragua in order to give fresh impetus to Central\nAmerican integration.\nThe question of migrations is also an important\nbranch of our international relations, one where\nGuatemala bases its policy on the principle that\nwhatever the legal status of migrants may be, they are\nhuman beings fully entitled to rights under the law and,\nas such, capable of invoking the full range of human\nrights. Evidence of this is the fact that during his visit\nto the United Nations in connection with the\nMillennium Summit, the President of the Republic,\nsigned the International Convention on the Protection\nof the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of\ntheir Families. The best way to discourage migration is\nto create sources of employment in the countries of\norigin. The industrial countries, therefore, must\ndismantle all kinds of barriers so that developing\ncountries are enabled to export commodities and not\npeople.\nI should now like briefly to explain our thinking\non those main items that will be discussed in the\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth regular session.\nFirst, I wish to restate our full backing for the\nUnited Nations, as expressed by President Portillo last\nweek, since the Organization is the highest\nembodiment of multilateralism. We are persuaded that\nthe Organization will have a crucial role to play in the\ntwenty-first century. I attest to the tangible contribution\nthat the United Nations has recently made in my\ncountry as regards both the consolidation of peace and\nin cooperation for development through the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and United\nNations agencies.\nSecondly, we also wish to observe that it is\nnecessary to adapt the Organization to the exigencies\nof globalization and to this post-cold war era. It is up to\nus, as member Governments, to promote this\nadaptation in various spheres such as\nintergovernmental bodies, efficiency and effectiveness\nof the Secretariat, the setting of priorities in the\nprogramme of activities and the financial strengthening\nof the Organization.\nOf the pending reforms, the one which has\nreceived most attention is the Security Council. Can\nthere be any doubt that its membership or its methods\nof work must reflect the prevailing circumstances of a\ncontemporary world? There is no need to be frustrated\nat the lack of progress in prior sessions of the General\nAssembly in connection with the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We appreciate that there are differing\nviewpoints in this regard and, of course, differences\ntend to stalemate or paralyse action. But this should not\nprevent us from redoubling our efforts to make this\nabsolutely vital organ of the United Nations more\neffective, more representative of the Members of the\nOrganization as a whole and more transparent in the\nway it operates. To achieve those ends we advocate,\namong other things, expansion of the membership of\nthe Council as well as an exercise of the veto in strict\nconformity with the Charter. We feel that, at any rate,\nregular use should be subject to review by the General\nAssembly and, in extreme instances, by the\nInternational Court of Justice in the interests of a\ngenuine rule of law of an international character, thus\navoiding abuses.\nThirdly, we are convinced that we need to\nstrengthen our collective capacity to prevent and settle\nconflicts, both across borders and domestically. We\nbelieve that the recently submitted report by the Panel\non United Nations peacekeeping operations offers an\nexcellent point of departure for this purpose. Our only\npreliminary observation on the matter is that\nstrengthening the United Nations capacity in this area\nshould not be carried out at the expense of our\neconomic and social activities. Rather, should we\ndecide to implement the recommendations of the Group\nof Experts, then the time will have come to put an end\nto an ill-conceived policy of zero growth of the United\nNations budget. As President Portillo stated:\n\u201cIf we want the United Nations to be a first\nclass institution, we must learn to provide it with\nthe necessary financial support.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nThis brings me to a fourth point that has gained\nconsiderable prominence in the agenda for this session.\n18\n\nI refer to the controversial question of revising the\nscale of assessments both for the regular budget and for\nthe peacekeeping counterpart. Our position is very\nstraightforward. We agree that the relative situation of\nmany countries has developed over the years and this\nwarrants a revision of the way in which we share the\nburden of financially maintaining the United Nations.\nAt the same time, however, we feel that the most\nimportant criterion for fixing the scale of assessments\nis ability to pay. The relative participation of countries\nin the gross domestic product of the world continues to\nprovide a basic yardstick. There is also justification for\nweighting this yardstick on the basis of certain special\nconsiderations, such as, for instance, recognition of the\nspecial situation of the least-developed countries on the\none hand, and, on the other, of the special\nresponsibility that should be assumed by the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council for maintaining\npeace.\nIn fifth place, as regards general disarmament, we\nemphasize the need to advance towards total\nelimination of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological\nweapons; illicit trafficking in small arms, and the use\nof anti-personnel mines and explosive devices. In\nrespect of these matters we strongly support all\npractical action being undertaken by the United\nNations to achieve these aims as well as those designed\nto establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts of\nthe world.\nIn the sixth place, we offer our full support for\nand active participation in the main events scheduled in\nthe coming years. Among them, I wish to single out the\nhigh-level intergovernmental event on financing for\ndevelopment and the World Conference on Racism,\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\nIntolerance.\nIn the seventh place, in an increasingly\ninterdependent world, multilateral diplomacy has a\ncrucial role to play in the struggle against\nenvironmental degradation. As Guatemala is a party to\nthe main global environmental treaties, we reaffirm our\ncommitment to the maintenance of ecological balance.\nFinally, we feel the United Nations should\ncontinue to concern itself with what we have called the\ngreat unfinished task of the twentieth century:\neradicating world poverty. Together with the\nmultilateral financial institutions, our Organization\nshould play a crucial role in ensuring that the benefits\nof globalization are widely shared by all countries.\nThis calls for action at the level of each country, but\nalso at the international level.\nSimilarly, by way of general comment, we wish\nto reiterate, before this Assembly, that Guatemala, in\nits very flesh, has experienced fratricidal confrontation.\nThat is why Guatemala has the moral authority to\ninsist, before God and man, that peace reign among all\nthe peoples of the world, particularly between the\nseparated brothers of China and Taiwan. We therefore\nappeal for the continuation of talks in order to achieve\nan outcome that will fulfil the aspirations of the\nChinese people on both sides of the Strait, reached\nthrough peaceful, free and democratic means.\nLikewise, we trust that a prompt solution to the\nMiddle East conflict will be found and that situations\nof tension in the African continent and other parts of\nEurope will be overcome, as well as among any other\nfraternal people of the world who are victims of\nviolence and discord.\nI wish to conclude my statement by expressing a\npersonal conviction. I am persuaded that all human\nbeings are equal in the eyes of the Almighty, without\ndistinction as to race, language or creed. I trust that in\nthat same spirit we shall be able to beginning from this\nsession to give effect to the guidelines enshrined in the\nMillennium Declaration adopted last week."

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate you very warmly,\nSir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. The\nMoroccan delegation will spare no effort in giving you\nevery support to ensure the success of your work. I\nwould also like to thank your predecessor and to wish\nhim every success in his responsibilities.\nI also cannot fail to pay a very warm and special\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has led\nthe Organization with such conviction, tenacity and\ncompetence. I take this opportunity to congratulate him\non his efforts to ensure the success of the Millennium\nSummit.\nI also wish to convey my congratulations to the\nState of Tuvalu, which recently joined membership of\nthe United Nations.\nMultilateral relations have become the most\nrealistic approach to transnational problems in a world\nundergoing the process of globalization. It is quite\nclear that a collective response is more necessary now\nthan ever before in our approach to the serious\nproblems of today's world. It is obvious that no country\nor group of countries can claim to be able to take sole\ncharge of the numerous problems of besetting the\ncomity of nations. When we consider nuclear\nproliferation, weapons of mass destruction, the\ndeterioration of the environment, endemic poverty,\norganized transnational crime, the drug problem and\nother such problems, we are compelled to recognize the\nscope of the strenuous efforts that will have to be made\nby the international community to deal effectively with\nthem.\nDespite the tremendous progress that has been\nmade in recent years in all sectors of human activity,\nand despite the potential benefits heralded by the\nglobalization of economies and technological\nbreakthroughs, half of the world's population continues\nto live in a state of abject poverty. Morocco believes\nthat efforts to reduce poverty and to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment require international action in order to\nintegrate the developing countries in the global\neconomy and new reforms, undertaken by the countries\nconcerned, to meet the essential needs of their peoples\nwith respect to health care, education and employment.\nSimilarly, trade barriers must be reduced for those\ngoods that are of particular benefit to the exports of the\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\ncountries. Medium-income countries should be relieved\nof their debt burden so that they can devote the\nresources thus freed to investments in social and\neconomic infrastructures.\nIn this context, Morocco believes that the time\nhas come for international institutions, particularly the\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\nOrganization, to adopt a new approach to assisting the\ncountries of the South in their development efforts.\nThese institutions must adapt themselves to the new\ninternational context in order to redress the imbalances\nbetween the countries of the North and the South,\nwhich have grown considerably since the external-debt\ncrisis. The total statistical indices available and the\nlessons learned from the paradoxical trends that are\nintrinsic to the world economy reveal the need to seek\nnew sources for financing and sustainable\ndevelopment. That being so, Morocco places great\nhopes on the holding of a world conference in the year\n2001 on financing for development and hopes that at\nthat time bold initiatives will be taken in order to\nalleviate the intensity of poverty in the world.\n20\n\nMorocco is rooted profoundly in its Africanism\nand is therefore very much concerned about the\ngrowing number of hot spots in Africa and also the\nillicit traffic in small arms that feeds those conflicts. It\nis extremely regrettable that our continent holds the\nunhappy record for refugees throughout the world,\nvictims of wars, as well as for epidemics, for example\nAIDS, malaria and many others. Only a concerted\neffort on the part of the African countries, with the\nsupport of the international community, will be able to\nreverse the current trend. Africa, which has been torn\nby armed conflicts, presents the image of a continent\ndrifting aimlessly. Nevertheless, we Africans have\nalways been known for our wisdom and our natural gift\nfor negotiation and conciliation.\nWe would like here to make a pressing appeal to\nall those involved to renounce resorting to force as a\nmeans of solving disputes. Africa has wasted a great\ndeal of time in internal quarrels, thus passing up\nvaluable opportunities for developing and becoming an\nintegral part of the world economy. The financial and\nhuman resources the belligerent parties have wasted\nkilling each other could have been better utilized to\nserve social and economic development projects in\ntheir respective countries and could have helped them\nto overcome all the problems that they face. That is\nwhy we support all the initiatives that have been\nrecommended by the United Nations to set up a\nstrategy to prevent conflicts and to improve\nmechanisms for intervention in these cases. As always,\nMorocco supports all those initiatives that help to\nstrengthen peace and security in Africa. In this regard,\nMorocco has responded to the United Nations appeal to\nparticipate in the peace mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nThe marginalization of Africa is a serious\nobstacle to its integration in global development. Our\ncontinent receives only 2 per cent of international\ninvestments, whereas the population of our continent is\nin excess of 700 million. While it is true that\nresponsibility for development of the continent rests\nfirst and foremost on the shoulders of the Africans, it is\nequally true that the resources available to the Africans\ncannot meet the considerable needs of their populations\nin all fields.\nFor that reason, it is becoming more and more\nurgent to help Africa by displaying solidarity in order\nto ensure that it embarks on the road to progress,\nsecurity and peace, specifically by developing its\nhuman resources, and by educational policies that are\nadapted to the realities of the continent and are in\nharmony with the values of that continent and its\ncivilizations. We also have to consider the question of\nthe debt of African countries so that the treatment of\nthis problem can finally generate wealth rather than be\nan obstacle to development. The effort of African\ncountries should also be supported by opening the\nmarkets of the developed countries to their products\nand their exports.\nFor its part, Morocco intends to spare no effort to\nmake its contribution to improving the living\nconditions of African peoples \u2014 hence, the decision\nthat was announced by His Majesty King Mohammed\nVI at the African-European Summit in Cairo, a\ndecision to cancel the debt of the least-developed\nAfrican countries to the Kingdom of Morocco, and also\nto remove customs barriers to their exports. We hope\nthat other countries, particularly the rich and\nindustrialized ones, will make a similar gesture.\nMorocco believes that the peace that we all aspire\nto in the Middle East can only be brought about if\ninternational legal principles are respected, particularly\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973), the principles which emerged from the Madrid\nConference, particularly the principle of land for peace,\nas well as the commitments and the agreements that\nwere concluded between the parties concerned.\nPeace in this region to which Morocco is so\nattached can only take place when Israel withdraws\nfrom all occupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian\nGolan. The international community must assist the\nPalestinian people to recover its legitimate and\ninalienable rights, first and foremost its right to set up\nits own independent State on its territory with Al Qods\nAl-Sharif as its capital.\nMorocco, on the initiative of His late Majesty\nKing Hassan II, may God have mercy on his soul, and\nhis successor King Mohammed VI, will spare no effort\nto usher in the establishment of just and comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East.\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, as chairman of\nthe Al-Qods Committee, during the State visit to\nWashington in June 2000, made an appeal to the parties\nconcerned to start upon a fruitful dialogue between the\ncultures and civilizations and:\n21\n\n\u201cto all believers, people of the Book and in this\nfaith which have united the children of Abraham,\nto liberate this thrice holy city from hatred and\nresentment.\u201d\nThese same principles were reiterated by the\nCommittee on Al-Qods during its most recent meeting,\nwhich was held on 28 August under the presidency of\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI. Morocco would like to\njoin its voice with all peace and justice-loving\ncountries so that the current efforts may be crowned\nwith success, which will make it possible for all\npeoples in the region to live in peace, stability and\nsecurity.\nThe Moroccan people share the joy of our\nbrothers, the people of Lebanon, as a result of the\nIsraeli withdrawal from its territory, and we will\ncontinue to give our unflagging support to the people\nof Syria to reassume total sovereignty over the Golan\nHeights, which is occupied by Israel.\nWe are also following with some disquiet the\nburdensome conditions imposed upon the Iraqi people\nby the embargo which has deprived people, particularly\nchildren, of food and medicine and many other needs\nas well. Morocco, for its part, feels anxious at the\ndeterioration of the food and health situation in Iraq.\nWe support all international efforts to lift sanctions\nagainst that fraternal country. We consider furthermore\nthat safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq is a fundamental prerequisite for\nstability in the region.\nMorocco welcomes the suspension of the air\nembargo imposed on Libya. We also hope that the total\nembargo will be finally lifted as soon as possible.\nMorocco, aware as it is of its responsibilities, is\nsparing no effort to make the Maghreb an area of peace\nand peaceful coexistence among all peoples in the\nregion. The partners in the Arab Mahgreb Union must\nget beyond their current economic problems and accept\nthe fact that the only way to develop the region and\nensure its security and stability is to build this Union,\nin which our peoples have placed great hopes,\nparticularly at this time when the requirements of\nglobalization make the establishment of regional\ngroups yet more important.\nAmong the challenges faced by the Mahgreb,\nthere is the so-called problem of the Western Sahara. I\nwould like to take this opportunity first and foremost to\nconfirm that the Kingdom of Morocco, which initiated\nthe referendum, has cooperated completely in its\nimplementation and has indeed made a number of\nsacrifices to allow the population of that region to\nreassert its will.\nWe have been very patiently following the efforts\nundertaken by the Secretary-General to allow this\nprocess to reach a successful conclusion. We have\nsupported all the efforts that have been made, since we\nare convinced that, in the final analysis, the\nreferendum, while ensuring respect for self-\ndetermination, will eventually confirm the rights of our\ncountry to territorial integrity and its sovereignty over\nthe entire southern territory.\nAs everyone knows and as has been emphasized\nby the Secretary-General and by the Security Council\nin various reports, the referendum's implementation \u2014\nto which, in contrast to what some have claimed, we\nremain committed \u2014 has come up against a number of\nproblems that may, if not resolved, endanger and\ncompromise the entire process. What essentially needs\nto be done is to ensure, without any kind of partiality\nor leniency, that the entire Saharan population, as has\nalways been agreed, may express its wishes in\naccordance with the letter and spirit of the referendum\nplan.\nIf the referendum is to be democratic, free and\nequitable, it must be subject to a number of rules that\nno one can transgress by trying to accommodate one\nparticular party at the expense of the other.\nThe Secretary-General and his Special\nRepresentative are still actively involved in this task.\nWe will continue to give them our total cooperation so\nthat the various difficulties besetting the\nimplementation of this plan can be overcome.\nOur country has made its own contribution to the\nefforts by making a number of suggestions that should\nbe acted upon if we want to have a democratic,\nimpartial and equitable referendum. We would repeat\nthat, for our part, while we remain committed to the\ncontinuation of this process and respect the rules set up\nfor it, we will give our total support to any action that\nthe Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Mr.\nJames Baker, undertake to resolve this dispute once\nand for all. As His Majesty King Mohammed VI stated\non 30 June 2000, any settlement must be carried out in\nthe context of the sovereignty, legality and unanimity\nof the Moroccans.\n22\n\nThis being said, Morocco would like to draw the\ninternational community's attention to the situation of\nthe tens of thousands of refugees who have been\nforcefully displaced and who have been living under\ninhumane conditions, according to the reports of\ninternational humanitarian organizations, of diplomats\nwho have had access to the camps, and of the hundreds\nof escapees who have managed to return to the Sahara.\nThe international community can no longer tolerate the\nsuffering of these people because of delays and\nconsiderations they themselves are not responsible for.\nNo one can disregard the fact that the Kingdoms\nof Spain and Morocco are joined by the unbreakable\nties of their age-old history, their geographical and\ncultural closeness, and by their common destiny as part\nof the Euro-Mediterranean region. Because of our\ndesire to safeguard these excellent fraternal and\nneighbourly relations Morocco has constantly appealed\nto friendly Spain and to all political forces in Spain to\nfind a solution that will spare our children unnecessary\nsuffering from crises inherited from a painful past.\nSpain, which is a great friend and neighbour,\nmust understand that the occupation of the two\nMoroccan cities of Septa and Melilla and the\nneighbouring islands is not in accord either with\ninternational law nor with the sense of history. Based\non similar situations, we are convinced that it is\npossible to devise a settlement that will both safeguard\nthe sovereignty of Morocco and respect and protect the\neconomic, social and cultural interest of Spain in both\nof these cities.\nFor this reason, on a number of occasions the\nKingdom of Morocco has suggested \u2014 on the initiative\nof His late Majesty Hassan II, may God preserve his\nsoul \u2014 that a Moroccan-Spanish think tank be created\nin order to bring about a final resolution of the\nsituation regarding Septa and Melilla and the\nneighbouring islands.\nOur two countries are duty bound to spare our\npeoples and our region from all possible\nmisunderstanding and resentment. It is for this reason\nthat Morocco offers a hand of peace to Spain, inviting\nit to commit to a common dialogue so as to resolve\nonce and for all this territorial dispute inherited from\nthe remote past.\nMorocco, because of its geopolitical position,\nattaches particular importance to stability and to\nstrengthening cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.\nRelations between Morocco and the European\ncountries is of great strategic importance in view of the\nvarious historic, political, economic, cultural and\nhuman ties that unite us and in view of the values we\nshare. The mutual attraction between Morocco and\nEurope derives from history, geography and common\nstrategic needs, while a range of mutual interests have\nnaturally made the European Community Morocco's\nfirst partner in a number of areas relating to\ninternational cooperation. Relations with the European\nUnion have developed quite significantly this year with\nthe coming into force of the Association Agreement of\n1 March. This agreement marks a decisive stage in our\nrelations with the European region since it is built\nessentially on four fundamental pillars: political\ndialogue; economic, cultural, technical and social\ncooperation; enhanced financial cooperation; and the\nprogressive and responsible development of a free-\ntrade zone by the year 2012.\nMorocco is currently waiting for the European\nUnion to carry out the qualitative leap that will make it\npossible to redirect our association along new strategic\nand innovative lines \u2014 governed by agreed modalities,\nby shared responsibilities and by co-development in all\nsectors of common interest.\nIt is our hope that the flow of direct investments\ninto Morocco and to the other countries of North Africa\nas well will be encouraged in order to help create mass\nemployment, which is so essential to keep our youth\naway from social evils and to consolidate the bases of\nour progress in regional stability.\nIt is also our hope that the cultural interests and\nthe cultural identity of our Moroccan community in\nEurope will be safeguarded and that the dignity of our\nnationals will be constantly protected in accordance\nwith the democratic values that are the underpinning of\nthe European structure. In this context we can,\ntogether, conceive of a Mediterranean region where\nsecurity and peace prevail as well as a strengthened\nEuropean/Mediterranean partnership.\nIn disarmament matters, Morocco appreciates the\nconsiderable advances made by the Review Conference\nof the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),\nwhich took place in New York in May of this year.\nWe hope that Israel will respond positively to the\nConference's appeal to accede immediately to the NPT\nand place its nuclear installations under the safeguards\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are\n23\n\nconvinced that such a decision on the part of the Israeli\nauthorities will be a major contribution to ushering in a\nclimate of peace, trust and stability in the region.\nMorocco supports the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to organize an international conference that\nwould make it possible to find appropriate means to put\nan end to the nuclear threat.\nIt is Morocco's firm conviction that the United\nNations continues to be the most appropriate tool and\ninstrument for settling conflicts and for building peace.\nIt is therefore high time that the Organization set up\ncredible machinery and early warning mechanisms to\nreact in an appropriate way before conflicts break out\nas recommended in the report of the high-level expert\nPanel on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\nare now more necessary than ever to contain and\nresolve the problems of security and development.\nThe United Nations must continue to be the\ncornerstone of strong multilateral cooperation.\nThe complexity and interdependence of the\nproblems before us mean that we must increase\ninternational cooperation and consultation. For that\nreason, a new era in international relations necessitates\na reform of the Security Council by revising its\nfunctions and its membership. Such a reform will\nundoubtedly confer greater credibility on the Security\nCouncil and make it better adapted to perform its\nmandate in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. Despite difficulties, the main point is to\nensure the best possible representation in the Security\nCouncil of the various current components of the\nUnited, particularly the developing countries.\nThe end of the ideological rivalry between the\ntwo super Powers means that we can entertain new\nprospects that there will emerge an international order\nbased on justice, peace, international legality and\nhuman rights as well as democracy and development,\nan order that will make use of the Charter as a work of\nreference and that will take into account the growing\nuniversalization of the Organization and the fact that\nnew global social challenges are emerging and also that\nrecent socio-strategic changes have occurred.\nFinally, we are convinced that if the United\nNations directs its actions along these lines, it will\nfinally meet the ideals for which it was founded."

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly. Your experience and wisdom\nwill doubtless guide us in carrying out the important\nwork ahead.\nAs we all know, that work is to immediately and\nresolutely transform the high hopes of the Millennium\nSummit into a better reality for the peoples for whom\nthe United Nations was founded.\n(spoke in French)\nThis means assuming responsibility for our\nactions and our inaction. It also means that\nGovernments must be ready to assume their\nresponsibility for their citizens.\nLast week our leaders delivered here a message\nof hope and determination. Their words clearly showed\nthat we all need the United Nations. The United\nNations is the only organization that embodies\nuniversal values; that offers a global forum to address\ncommon problems; and that is on the front line around\nthe world fighting for people.\n(spoke in English)\nThere was another message from the Summit\nabout whether the United Nations is keeping up with\nthe times; about whether we, the Member States \u2014\ncustodians of the Organization and guardians of the\nCharter \u2014 have the political will to support renewal\nand modernization.\nWhen the lights turned off last Friday night here\nin New York, did other lights go on around the\nworld \u2014 in our Chancery offices, Parliamentary\nassemblies and Cabinet meeting rooms \u2014 to illuminate\nthe way forward? Are we all, each in our own way,\nasking how we can change our ways to better help the\nUnited Nations manage a new global agenda?\nClearly, globalization has brought unprecedented\nbenefits and possibilities. But it also clearly brings new\nrisks to people in all our countries. Many of those new\nrisks cross State lines, while most violent conflict now\noccurs within States' borders. In both cases, the impact\nis felt directly by ordinary people.\nYet the debate within the United Nations remains\ndriven \u2014 and too often circumscribed \u2014 by rigid\nnotions of sovereignty and narrow conceptions of\nnational interest. And action by the United Nations\nremains hampered by inflexible institutional structures\nthat have become increasingly inward-looking, driven\nby their own interests rather than by those they were\ndesigned to serve.\nThe Secretary-General has, with a courage rarely\nseen in public life, given us a vision of a way forward.\n2\n\nIt is a vision that serves the world's people, and one\nthat resonates with them, even though it may aggravate\nsome of their Governments. He has challenged us to\nfollow his lead, to adopt a people-centred approach to\ninternational relations, to move this Organization from\nthe sidelines to the forefront of change.\nThis is not a new agenda for Canada. Indeed, over\nthe past five years, promoting human security has been\nthe focus of our own approach to our changing world.\nAnd it has been encouraging to see the shift in attitude\ntoward a more realistic sense of what it means to be\nsecure in the world as an individual.\nOur leaders endorsed this new vision in their\nSummit Declaration. But if we have truly come to the\nunderstanding that security means more than protecting\nborders, we must now act to turn last week's good\nintentions into effective action. This means taking\nresponsibility to adapt our institutions, broaden\nparticipation in their functioning, and increase\ntransparency and accountability to make a tangible\ndifference for the people we represent.\nIt also means responsible, accountable global\nbehaviour, sharing and protecting the common space\nthat sustains life.\nAggressive pursuit of the global arms control and\ndisarmament agenda is the ultimate responsible act.\nOur generation built the nuclear arsenals that are\noutmoded and rotting; we produced the chemical\nweapons that poison people; and today we still make\nand distribute the small arms that are found\neverywhere: in the hands of children, the arsenals of\ndrug dealers and the garrisons of guerrilla fighters.\nBut we have also had a certain foresight to begin\nbuilding a system of international obligations and\nprinciples to contain such behaviour. We now have to\nvalidate and implement these instruments. Above all,\nwe must do nothing to damage them.\nCertainly, Governments must prepare for the\ndefence of their people. Responsible defence is an\nelement of responsible government. But surely, our\nresponsibility to defend our citizens begins not with the\ndevelopment of new weapons systems, but by\ndismantling old ones: by ratifying the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); by joining the 104\nStates parties to the Ottawa Treaty on landmines; by\nimplementing the international non-proliferation norms\nand disarmament obligations embodied in the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); by\ndeveloping comprehensive action plans to stop the\nproliferation of small arms and missile technology.\nThe collective action of States working for the\nlong-term security of their people is clearly the\npreferable path. But where States are unable, or\nunwilling, to protect their citizens, the United Nations,\nand in particular the Security Council, has a special\nresponsibility to act.\nToday, most wars are fought within failed States.\nIn these wars, it is the victimization of civilians that is\nthe motive, the means and the manifestation of a\nconflict.\nIf the Council is to acquit itself of its\nresponsibility to these people, their protection must be\nat the core of its work, not at its periphery.\nThis is the agenda that Canada has brought to the\nSecurity Council over the past two years. It has not\nbeen an easy task, but I would like to acknowledge that\nthe Security Council is meeting the new challenges. In\nrecent months, the Council's work has increasingly\nfocused on the protection of civilians, with action in\nthe areas of AIDS, physical protection, war-affected\nchildren and sanctions reform. The Council has\nrecognized that dealing with these issues is critical to\nbuilding effective peace-support operations, and has\nembodied this recognition in recent resolutions. Today,\nwe are providing members a checklist, a checklist of\nresponsible action in the Security Council.\n(spoke in French)\nThe Brahimi report also proposes a plan of\naction. It is a comprehensive strategy for strengthening\nthe United Nations capacity to help people. Canada\nsupports the panel's findings. We will be its strongest\nadvocate and can be counted upon to work tirelessly to\nbuild the political support required to implement both\nthe spirit and the letter of its recommendations.\n(spoke in English)\nBy far the most difficult challenge in protecting\ncivilians in armed conflict is in situations where abuse\nis most severe: genocide, war crimes, crimes against\nhumanity, massive and systematic violations of human\nrights and humanitarian law which cause widespread\nsuffering, loss of life and abuse.\nWe need a new form of deterrence against such\nforms of behaviour. The establishment of an\n3\n\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), which makes\nimpunity illegal and which holds individuals directly\naccountable for their actions, is that deterrent. And if\nits power to deter the abuse of people fails, the Statute\nprovides both a basis and a structure to take concrete\nlegal action to redress injustice.\nThe Court's Statute provides us with a unique\nopportunity to fix one of the worst failings in the\ninternational system. Today I appeal to every\nGovernment here that has not done so to sign the Rome\nStatute by December and to ratify it on an urgent basis,\nso that the world's people can finally have the justice\nthey deserve.\nCanada seeks to systematically put in place the\nbuilding blocks for a new type of international system,\none that is inspired and guided by the United Nations\nCharter, but that is also prepared to deal with the\nunderside and underworld of globalization.\nOf course, prevention is the best form of\nintervention. But when preventive measures fail; when\nthe quiet diplomatic efforts and the targeted sanctions\ndo not work; when the fact-finders find facts too\nhorrendous to imagine; then there must be recourse to\nmore robust action.\nThe question of intervention in these instances,\nincluding, as a last resort, the use of military force, is\nfraught with difficulty and controversy. Many would\nsweep it under the rug as too divisive, too difficult, too\ndamaging to the status quo. But Rwanda, Cambodia,\nSrebrenica and Kosovo remind us that it is important to\nfocus on this question. It would be easy to pretend that\nthe humanitarian tragedies associated with these places\nare a thing of the past. It would be easy, but it would be\nwrong. There is no certainty that similar atrocities will\nnot happen again. Indeed, the opposite is more likely.\nThe spiral into extremes of human suffering cannot\nalways be constrained.\nReading the editorial page of The New York Times\non Tuesday, 12 September, we realize that some would\nhave us believe that the United Nations Charter was\nwritten only to protect States and State interests:\n\u201cintervening in civil conflicts takes the United\nNations a step too far\u201d.\nI disagree. I say that in the face of egregious human\nsuffering it is a step in the right direction.\nNothing so threatens the United Nations very future as\nthis apparent contradiction between principle and\npower; between people's security and Governments'\ninterests; between, in short, humanitarian intervention\nand State sovereignty.\nLast fall I stood before this body and argued that\nthe United Nations Charter was written for people. Our\ncollective agenda here is not the nation States' agenda,\nor the ministers' agenda, or the diplomats' agenda. It is\nthe people's agenda. Indeed, \u201cWe the peoples\u201d are the\nopening words of the Charter. Those who would seek\nto hide behind that document to justify inaction need\nonly to read its preamble to reacquaint themselves with\nits original intent.\nSecretary-General Annan has challenged us to\nrethink what it means to be responsible, sovereign\nStates. Canada has responded by creating an\nindependent international commission on intervention\nand State sovereignty. Its purpose is to contribute to\nbuilding a broader understanding of the issue, and to\nfoster a global political consensus on how to move\nforward. The commission will be led by two co-\nchairpersons \u2014 one from the developing and one from\nthe developed world \u2014 with the participation of a wide\nrange of representatives of Governments and non-\ngovernmental organizations from all regions and under\nthe overall guidance of an advisory board composed of\nministers, former ministers and distinguished\npractitioners from the academic, humanitarian and\nlegal fields.\nThe commission will undertake its work during\nthis Millennium Assembly year, and will present its\nrecommendations in 12 months' time. I ask those\npresent here in the Assembly Hall to join in this\nenterprise, difficult as it may be, so that we can seek to\nreconcile these concepts to find the space that we can\nall share.\nIt is difficult, but it is not impossible. We have\ndone it before. Thirteen years ago, the Brundtland\nCommission's report, \u201cOur Common Future\u201d, took two\nseemingly contradictory ideas \u2014 economic\ndevelopment and the protection of the environment \u2014\nand out of that contradiction forged a synthesis called\nsustainable development. That new concept\nfundamentally changed the way in which the world\nthinks about those issues, and its work informs our\nthinking to this very day. It is Canada's hope that this\nnew commission can diffuse the anxiety that surrounds\n4\n\nthe issues of intervention and sovereignty by building a\nsimilar bridge between our current notions of these\nconcepts, and in so doing help to define the way ahead\nfor Governments and the United Nations to tackle the\nmost challenging international dilemma of the twenty-\nfirst century.\nHowever, the responsibility no longer stops just\nwith Governments. The private sector must also take its\nresponsibility for the communities on which it depends\nfor its business. Ethical business is good business. The\nmany companies that have joined the Secretary-\nGeneral's Global Compact with Business recognize\nthat profit made on the backs of exploited and abused\nchildren \u2014 by gun-running, drug dealing or conflict\ndiamonds \u2014 is no longer acceptable. In the globalized\neconomy, the world's people are the ultimate\nshareholders. If they do not profit, no one will. We\nmust therefore work on all of these fronts and with all\nof these new players to build a future where human\nsecurity is universally respected and protected. In the\nmeantime, there are steps that we can take to protect\nthe most vulnerable.\nTo build a world that values human security we\nmust start with concern and action for those who will\ninherit it. It is fitting, therefore, that in this year of\nfresh resolve the future of our children is a key element\nof the agenda, particularly through the special session\non children that is to be held next year. Nowhere is the\nsafety and well-being of children more at risk than in\nconflict situations. Children should have no part in war.\nYet today they are among its main victims, counting in\nthe millions.\n(spoke in French)\nFour years ago, Gra\u00e7a Machel brought attention\nto the horrific plight of war-affected children. Since\nthen, action has been taken too reduce their suffering,\nmost notably with the appointment of Olara Otunnu as\nthe Secretary-General's Special Representative for\nChildren and Armed Conflict and, more recently, with\nthe historic agreement last January on the Optional\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\non the involvement of children in armed conflict.\nThis week, with Gra\u00e7a Machel as honorary\nChairperson, Canada is hosting in Winnipeg the\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children.\nThis meeting, the first of its kind, brings together more\nthan 130 Governments, 60 non-governmental\norganizations and private sector groups, international\norganizations and young people from every region of\nthe world.\n(spoke in English)\nI am pleased that so many ministers and senior\nofficials from the Organization will join us in\nWinnipeg this weekend. I encourage those not already\nrepresented to attend.\nThe aim of the conference is twofold: to\nformulate a comprehensive, global action plan and to\nforge the necessary political will to implement it.\nTogether, we hope it will help children traumatized by\nwar, and ultimately eliminate their involvement and\nvictimization in conflict.\nEarlier this week in Winnipeg, as we opened the\nconference, a young Ugandan girl named Grace spoke\nto me, at a meeting of young people affected by war,\nabout her experience as a child soldier. Her story was\none of victimization and chilling brutality. Her belief\nthat the international community could help her and\nothers like her was touching and inspiring. Her plea for\nus to do so is the essence of the Organization's\nvocation. Indeed, it is one of our basic responsibilities.\nFor me, that young woman's simple appeal makes it\nclear that we have no option but to be ready, to be\nwilling, and to be able to forge a United Nations for the\ntwenty-first century.\nIn view of the daunting challenges ahead, any\nattempt to retreat, to shut out the world or to turn away\nfrom international engagement would be to follow a\ndangerous path that is neither practical nor desirable.\nThe truth is that we share a common humanity. The\nreality is that we are linked by the forces of history into\na common destiny. The fact is that the answers to our\nproblems lie in strengthening, not diminishing, global\ncooperation and global solutions.\nIn today's world, the security of States and the\nsecurity of people are indivisible. Providing for that\nsecurity is a necessary precondition for success in other\nimportant endeavours, such as advancing economic aid\nand trade development. In this new century, too many\npeople like Grace are still subject to the worst of the\npast century: to the scourge of war, to human rights\nabuses and to too few prospects for social progress and\na better standard of living. Yet the hopes contained in\nthe United Nations Charter still have meaning for them,\nand indeed relevance for all of us. Fulfilling its\naspirations is our enduring goal and fundamental\n5\n\nresponsibility. With human security as our guide, let us\nmake it our focus as we renew our commitment to the\npurposes of the United Nations and to a better future\nfor Grace and for all the people that we represent.\nThis goal is a responsibility that I have been\nhonoured to share with many of those present here over\nthe past five years. It is a goal that we must all\ncontinue to strive towards \u2014 whatever our position in\nlife, whatever our title \u2014 in order to ensure that this\nsystem we have built does not surrender to the cynics\nwho offer no alternatives, or to the game players who\nparalyse the transcendent purposes of the United\nNations for simple transitory diplomatic points.\nOnly in so doing will we truly live up to the\npromise contained in the Charter: to serve the majesty\nof the people and to make this Organization work for\nthem."

        "file_text": "I would like first\nof all to congratulate the President, on his assumption\nof the office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I wish him every\nsuccess in this difficult and inspiring task. I would also\nlike to express my sincere appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his exceptional\nleadership during the fifty-fourth session.\nAllow me to include in this tribute the SecretaryGeneral for his efforts and crucial role in maintaining\nand promoting the role of this Organization, and for his\ninspiration in strengthening its effectiveness and\ncredibility with respect to peace, security, justice and\ndevelopment in the world.\nI wish to add a few comments to the statement\nmade earlier by the representative of the Federated\nStates of Micronesia on behalf of the Pacific Islands\nForum countries.\nLet us pause for a moment to recognize the\ncontribution of the founding fathers and framers of the\nUnited Nations and its Charter. They produced a\ndocument which, in large measure, has contributed to\nan ever-increasing consciousness of the prerequisites\nnecessary for world peace. Today we should celebrate\nthe existence of the United Nations and its\naccomplishments, both of which offer us the\nopportunity to reflect on how collectively we can better\nchart our path and articulate our goals more clearly for\nthe next millennium. President Kessai Note's address\nto the Millennium Summit reaffirmed the adherence\nand commitment of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands to the principles enshrined in the Charter for\nthe collective good of all people.\nI take great pleasure in reiterating the Marshall\nIslands' warm welcome to the Government and peoples\nof Tuvalu, as the 189th Member of this Organization.\nIndeed, the admission of new Member States adds to\nthe legitimacy of the United Nations.\nOn the other hand, the denial of membership in\nthis Organization to the 23 million people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, who have made a\nsignificant and meaningful contribution to international\ndevelopment, is contrary not only to the true spirit of\nthe United Nations Charter, but also to its principle of\nuniversality and to the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. We must strengthen the vital role of the\nOrganization in achieving the goals of conflict\nprevention, maintenance of peace, regional stability,\npromotion of fundamental human rights and\ndevelopment of democracy and international progress,\nand in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples to selfdetermination and engagement, because the United\nNations is the only Organization that can bring that\nshining light to those 23 million people. Furthermore,\nthe United Nations is the only forum for Member\nStates to build mutual trust and to resolve issues\nthrough peaceful dialogue. The guiding principles of\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the right of\npeoples to self-determination must, in conformity with\nthe principles of justice and international law, continue\nto underpin our collective aspirations. This will require\nour concerted action in this new millennium.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands applauds\nand commends the unprecedented efforts made by the\nleaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea\nand the Republic of Korea, who have engaged in a\ndialogue that may help chart a course towards lasting\npeace in that peninsula. I wish to state also that the\nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands\nencourages the leaders of Israel and Palestine to seize\nthe historic opportunity that is within reach to\npeacefully conclude a framework agreement towards\nlasting peace in the Middle East. I wish to commend\nthe efforts of the United States of America in this\nregard.\nThe immutable law of change makes it necessary\nfor the United Nations to continue to critically examine\nits performance and structures in search of practical\nand timely solutions. This it must certainly do, because\n38\n\nthe current political landscape is vastly different from\nthe one that prevailed 50 years ago. It is characterized\nby a more than threefold increase in the number of\nnations with membership in the United Nations, and by\na heightened spirit of generosity and desire on the part\nof civil society and corporations to become more active\nplayers in the process of change. It is imperative,\ntherefore, that those elements and structures which are\nantiquated, those which have ceased to promote the\nwelfare of nations and those which no longer minister\nto the needs of a continually changing humanity be\nswept away and relegated to the pages of history.\nA more comprehensive review and restructuring\nof the Security Council, in line with the spirit of\nachieving a broader base for decision-making through\nconsensus and confidence-building, is clearly long\noverdue. Other critical issues in the reform process\ndeserve further examination, with a view to restoring\nthat body's dignity and legitimacy and strengthening\nthe confidence and trust of the international\ncommunity. Enlarging both the permanent and nonpermanent categories while ensuring an equitable\ngeographical distribution seems to be the way forward.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands remains\ncommitted to supporting the efforts by the SecretaryGeneral and others to reform and streamline the\nmandates and activities of the United Nations and its\nother organizations and agencies. While the\npeacekeeping and general fund scales seem to be\noutdated, the process of reform must take seriously into\naccount the limited responsibility and capacity of small\nisland developing States such as the Marshall Islands to\nsustain their obligation in both categories. Also, now\nthat this Organization stands at 189 Member States, 14\nof them from the Pacific Region, the reconfiguration of\nour electoral grouping should be an additional matter to\nbe placed on the table. It may be a complex one, but\nthrough our collective inspiration it can be an\nachievable goal, to be considered without further delay.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is keen to\nfurther develop its ongoing active role and cooperation\nwith the United Nations specialized agencies and\nprogrammes. In the view of the Marshall Islands, those\nbodies' efforts to make their operational activities more\neffective and responsive to the special needs of small\nisland developing States will undoubtedly play a key\nrole in the new millennium. The expansion of the\nResident Coordinator programme \u2014 which brings it\ncloser to home, where it belongs \u2014 is a case in point.\nWhile the human rights achievements recorded in\nthe 50 years since the proclamation of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights must be acknowledged,\nthere is a sense that much remains to be done before\nthe world can truly claim that the Declaration has\nbecome a common standard of achievement. The\nMillennium Summit is a significant acknowledgement\nof the need for all States to work together, in a spirit of\nunity and cooperation, to ensure that the fruits of\nglobal development are shared and made more\nequitable and just for the benefit of humanity at large.\nWithin the mandate of its Charter to promote\neconomic and social progress, peace and security, and\nsustainable development and prosperity, the United\nNations is the only fully representative Organization\ncapable of harmonizing our collective aspirations for a\npeaceful, stable and prosperous global village. The\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands endorses SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan's report, \u201cWe the peoples: the role\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d.\nAt the turn of the century, achievements have\nbeen realized, and this trend should be encouraged. Yet\nwe are living under many threats. Acts of terrorism do\nnot recognize national boundaries, and infectious\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\nare poised to spread quickly throughout the world. Our\ndecisive and collective response is therefore more than\never required. In many developing countries, poverty\nand the deprivation of basic human rights, especially as\nconcerns women and children, seem directly linked to,\nand escalate, crime.\nWe must also strive to eliminate weapons of mass\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons. The\nuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a major concern.\nTrafficking in drugs and small arms represents a\nconsiderable challenge and a major threat for small\nislands such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands,\nbecause of its geographic isolation and the fact that it\nlacks the required resources and capability to combat\nthese phenomena. Our collective effort towards the\ncreation of an effective global response to address all\nof these threats is urgently required.\nWe realize that global environmental degradation\nis of our own creation. The issue of global warming is\na real threat to all, particularly to the Marshall Islands\nand to all small island developing States. There is no\n39\n\ndoubt that the survival of populations and cultures is at\nstake.\nThe Marshall Islands has already lost metres of\nusable and habitable land due to climate change and\nsea-level rise, and the rate of loss is increasing. This is\na matter of life and death. Implementing the legally\nbinding commitments agreed in the Kyoto Protocol is\nthe only significant step forward on the path of\nensuring effective global action to combat climate\nchange. There will be a terrible tragedy unless there is\ninternational cooperation. How will displaced\npopulations \u2014 whatever the reasons for their being\ndisplaced \u2014 be able to enjoy and sustain their basic\nhuman rights for generations to come? Will their\ncultures and livelihoods be able to survive for the\nbenefit of future generations?\nEducation and health are of paramount\nimportance to every country in the world. Education is\nthe key to the progress of any nation. We must\ncollectively strive to ensure that an educated\npopulation makes up a healthy and prosperous society.\nI am pleased to report that the Government of the\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands has taken some bold\nsteps, by allocating the greatest amount of its limited\nresources towards the improvement of its education\nand health systems. I take this opportunity to appeal for\nthe interest and support of the international community\nin joining us in this endeavour. I am particularly\npleased to convey the deep appreciation of the\nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to\nthe Government of Italy for its generous support for\nour efforts to implement the Barbados Programme of\nAction. The first phase of the Marshall Islands solar\nenergy project would not have been implemented\nwithout its support, through the United Nations Trust\nFund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The\ninterest in and support of the international community\nfor the implementation of the other phases of the\nproject would be highly appreciated.\nThe Marshall Islands National Nutrition and\nChildren's Council has been very active since its\ninception. In addition to establishing task forces on\nfood and nutrition, suicide prevention, substance abuse,\nneglect and disability, it made another significant\ncontribution with the agriculture, food and nutrition\npolicy, as the Marshall Islands strives to meet its\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. Existing policies specifically aimed at the rights\nof the child are under review as we consider making\nthe Convention a part of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands legal system. A representative Commission on\nSustainable Development has been established with the\nmandate of ensuring that the Barbados Programme of\nAction is implemented in all its aspects. Other\nlegislation to curb illegal financial transactions will\nsoon be introduced in the Parliament's current session.\nThese are some of the efforts being made by the\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands as it strives to meet its\ntreaty obligations and enhance the life of every citizen\nof the country. We cannot do it alone, and we appeal\nonce again to the international community for support.\nLet us have a United Nations that will meet the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to\nstart by congratulating you, Mr. President, on being\nelected to preside over the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and wish you much success as you\ncarry out this important post. I would also like to take\nthis opportunity to thank your Namibian predecessor,\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the responsible work\nand efforts he invested in United Nations activities\nthroughout the year and, in particular, for the role he\nplayed in the preparation of the Millennium Summit.\nLet me also take this opportunity to welcome the\nadmission of Tuvalu to the United Nations, another\nexpression of the openness and universal character of\nthis Organization.\nThe Millennium Summit brought interesting,\nstimulating ideas embracing the huge potential posed\nby the experience of the population of the whole\nplanet, formulated in the words of the highest\nrepresentatives of Member States. The Summit, the\nmost representative gathering ever, gave us a unique\nopportunity to make a multifaceted review of\n5\n\nchallenges the world is facing at the threshold of the\nnew millennium. The unexpectedly positive Summit\nresults are generally being appreciated and approved.\nHowever, the implementation of those 32 United\nNations Millennium Declaration provisions, as well as\nof an unprecedented Security Council resolution 1318\n(2000), will not be easy, cheap or rapidly attainable.\nThe start of the 1990s was characterized by\nbuoyancy and great expectations in handling long-term\nproblems connected with the era of Communism in the\nworld, the onset of democracy and the stress on the\nimportance of observing universal human rights.\nBound up in this optimism were expectations that were\nsometimes unrealistic.\nThose expectations proved unfeasible in the\nsecond half of the decade. The intricate nature of the\nproblems, difficulties in finding lasting solutions, and\ninternal and external crises quite clearly exposed the\nbounds and the possibilities of the international\ncommunity, and the United Nations was no exception.\nDisillusionment and disenchantment sometimes led to\nthe assertion and the defence of utilitarian and other\nparticular interests, which led to feelings of belonging\nand solidarity being greatly undermined.\nThe inhabitants of the world, suffering from the\nravages of war, poverty, disasters and various forms of\noppression, expect actions of us today.\nCan we match these expectations? I hope, and\nfirmly believe, that we can. There is no longer time for\nfurther devaluation in the significance of the words\ndevelopment, security, cooperation and solidarity. We\ncan no longer abuse the trust and patience of so many\npeople. If reaching a compromise and consensus\ncontinues to be impossible for our diplomats, then it\nwill be all the more difficult to find it among States and\nentities in individual countries.\nThe United Nations is expected to be able to\nprove its ability to adapt quickly and carry out internal\nreform, primarily of the Security Council. The Security\nCouncil has to reflect the reality of today, not that of 50\nyears ago. Only a truly representative and effective\nSecurity Council will be able to overcome its current\nimpotence, sometimes veiled in high-sounding but\nempty phrases. If no remedy is found now, after the\nMillennium Summit, the United Nations risks loss of\ncredibility, and it will greatly reduce its influence on\nmany processes which are now shaping the world. Here\nI am thinking especially of those processes we include\nunder the term globalization.\nGlobalization does not stop at Forty-second\nStreet. It is rushing around the world with the force of\na typhoon, picking up speed as it is fed ever new\ndiscoveries in information and communication\ntechnology. But globalization is a much more\ncomprehensive phenomenon than the mere\nstandardization of traffic regulations, television\nsystems or bananas. Globalization entails development\nand human security, as well as poverty and human fear.\nBut it also encompasses human thinking. If it does not\nembrace solidarity and social justice, it will continue to\ndivide the world between winners and losers, as was\nmentioned here from this rostrum recently by the\nGerman Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. The United\nNations can help with this issue. If it fails, it will be\nguilty of loosing this crucial opportunity of making the\nUnited Nations again into a highly respected\nOrganization able to tackle the most important global\nproblems. We have to find the political will and the\nmeans to do so.\nI would like to dwell on the topic of\npeacekeeping a little. What I have said about huge\noptimism and subsequent disenchantment is just as\napplicable to this area. I am convinced that lasting\nsolutions to conflicts can only be found by peaceful\nmeans and by negotiations between all parties\ninvolved. Peacekeeping remains a key instrument\nwielded by the international community, as it\nestablishes peace and peaceful coexistence among the\nnations.\nWe welcome the priority given to peacekeeping\nlast week. The Millennium Summit meetings, together\nwith Mr. Brahimi's report, present a unique opportunity\nto strengthen the United Nations capacity for\npeacekeeping operations. Our pledges to enhance the\neffectiveness of the United Nations in addressing\nconflicts at all stages, from prevention to settlement to\npost-conflict peace-building, should bind the\ninternational community from the very moment it\napproved them last week.\nFar-reaching but realistic intentions announced\nfrom this rostrum by Minister Vedrine on behalf of the\nEuropean Union earlier this week thus meet our\nexpectations of how to bring into life the Millennium\nSummit recommendations, anchored in a firm belief in\nthe United Nations potential.\n6\n\nAny reform of the United Nations would not be\ncomplete without reforming its crucial body: the\nSecurity Council. Its role is irreplaceable. The\ndecision-making process should respond not only to a\nchange in the nature of today's crises, but also to the\nnecessary comprehensiveness of their solutions. An\nincrease in the effective capacity of the United Nations\nSecretariat to act via the reorganization of its\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, closer\ncooperation and coordination with regional structures\nis an integral part of the process. We must look for\nways to react quickly, promptly and effectively.\nThe Czech Republic's approach to the reform of\nthe United Nations Security Council has been voiced\nmany times, and we prove it through our active\nparticipation, notably in the open-ended working group\nof the General Assembly and in the so-called Group of\n10. Unfortunately, deliberations on Security Council\nreform are still short of bringing fruit, being effectively\nparalysed by the particular interests of several States.\nThe new millennium must soon see a new, enlarged and\nmore representative Security Council, preferably with\nfive additional permanent seats for both developed and\ndeveloping countries and a few more non-permanent\nseats. We all have to take to heart the appeal of the\nMillennium Declaration to further strengthen our\nefforts in this regard.\nWhether for programmes or for peacekeeping, in\nthe new millennium the United Nations needs a\nsustainable and equitable system of financing. In this\nregard, we are ready to cooperate actively in\ndiscussions about making adjustments for the scale of\nassessments for both the regular budget and the\npeacekeeping budget. We express our appreciation to\nthe countries that have announced their preparedness to\nassume additional financial responsibility by moving\nvoluntarily from group C to group B in the\npeacekeeping operations scale.\nThe Czech Republic has voluntarily committed\nitself to remain in group B, but that is not a solution to\nthe problem. A new scale is urgently needed. However,\nnegotiations about such a scale should not be trapped\nin endless debates over past unpaid debts. All arrears\nshould be settled before the adoption of a new, and\nhopefully fairer, scale of assessments.\nThe anniversary we mark this year of the tragic\nmassacre in Bosnian Srebrenica leads me to the issue\nof war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\nThe international community's objective is to achieve\npeace, but lasting peace requires justice. In this respect,\nthe International Criminal Tribunals set up by the\nSecurity Council are of prime importance. Besides\npunishing offenders, those International Tribunals have\nanother extremely important function: to prove\npersonal guilt in criminal cases and, thus, to reject the\nnotion of collective guilt. The Tribunals are also\nimportant as deterrents for those who may be thinking\nof easing their way to power over the bodies of the\ninnocent. The Czech Republic therefore highly\nappreciates the work done by the International\nCriminal Tribunals to investigate the crimes committed\nin the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and supports the\nestablishment of a similar body to punish crimes\ncommitted in Cambodia and Sierra Leone.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the\nFormer Yugoslavia increased its activities during the\nlast year, bringing to The Hague war criminals who had\ngreater responsibility for crimes committed. War\ncriminals have been prosecuted there, but their political\nand military leaders remain at large. Recent\ndevelopments, however, have shown that leaders\nthemselves are not immune from international\njurisdiction. That trend is best illustrated by the efforts\nof the international community to establish an\nInternational Criminal Court, which most Member\nStates of the United Nations voted for at Rome in 1998.\nThe creation of a functioning International\nCriminal Court, an institution that can play an\nimportant role in projecting the principle of justice into\ninternational relations and in building an increasingly\nefficient system for the protection of human rights, is\none of the priorities of Czech foreign policy in the field\nof international law. The Czech Republic is taking all\nthe necessary steps to ratify the Rome Statute as\nquickly as possible.\nDevelopments in international law are directly\nbound up with the issue of human rights. I believe that\nthe commitment of the United Nations to the right of\nevery human being to a dignified life in safety should\nbecome the focus of attention of all Member States of\nthe United Nations. The long and frequently painful\nprocess of making progress in international human\nrights, at the outset of which stood the terrible\nexperience of the Holocaust, has resulted in the\nconcept of universal human rights. The United Nations\nis playing a key role in implementing that concept.\n7\n\nHowever, I think it would be wrong to use our\ncontemporary understanding of human rights when we\nlook back at events long past. In the last decade, the\ninternational community demonstrated both its\ndetermination not to accept abuses of human rights and\nits willingness to defend the principle of the personal\nsafety of human beings, even to the detriment of the\nwell-established concept of national sovereignty.\nAccepting limits to absolute sovereignty for the sake of\nhuman rights is a matter of political principle and\nmorality that forms the basis of the values of the\nUnited Nations. As I said here last year, we would\nprefer, if any actions do infringe on the sovereignty of\nMember States, that those actions be made legitimate\nby a proper United Nations mandate. Human rights is\nnot a process that has been completed; it is still\nprogressing. However, we should not judge history by\nthe standards of today.\nThe protection of human rights is one of the\nfundamental principles of Czech foreign policy.\nCompared with other international compacts, those on\nhuman rights enjoy a privileged status in Czech law. I\nam pleased that the Czech Republic subscribed during\nthe Millennium Summit to the Optional Protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict. Due efforts\nto complete a protocol to the Convention against\nTorture should be made. The Czech Republic also\nmade an active contribution to the preparation of the\nDeclaration on human rights defenders. I believe that\nthe decision made this year by the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights on the appointment of a\nspecial rapporteur of the Secretary-General for human\nrights will help give rise to the mechanism we need for\nthe implementation of the Declaration.\nThe last of the more general issues I would like to\ndraw attention to is the issue of sanctions. By that I do\nnot mean weapons embargoes. The Czech Republic\nviews them as instruments capable of reducing the\nintensity of a conflict, supports them and observes\nthem without reservation. A problem, though, lies in\nthe efficiency and impact of blanket economic\nsanctions. The last 10 years have provided ample proof\nthat in Cuba, Iraq and Yugoslavia, to take just three\nexamples, blanket economic sanctions, whether\ndeclared unilaterally or multilaterally, have been\nunable to achieve their objective.\nPoorly nourished, isolated and sick people are\nhardly likely to rise up against a governing elite that\nwill never allow the consequences of sanctions to\naffect it or its faithful supporters. The result is that\nchanges in the conduct of the rulers are even less\nlikely.\nGrowing globalization and the economic and\ninformation interconnection of the whole world\ninfluence and change the conditions affecting the\nefficiency of sanctions. The Czech Republic would\ntherefore prefer the use of smart sanctions targeted\nagainst leading representatives of a State that refuses to\nobserve international law. In my opinion, such\nsanctions could include a ban on the issue of entry\nvisas and the freezing of assets abroad. I think it would\nbe particularly useful and expedient if the examination\nof the issue of peacekeeping also included the issue of\nsanctions. The Czech Republic believes that a similar\napproach  namely, the appointment of a panel of\nexperts on this issue and subsequent discussion of a\nreport drawn up by that panel  would be of immense\nbenefit in improving our collective efforts to achieve\npeace and security by punishing perpetrators and not\nvictims.\nAllow me to mention how the Czech Republic\nviews some of the most topical questions of\ninternational policy.\nWe believe that boosting defence capacities to\nprotect against potential attack is an absolutely\nlegitimate step by any government. In the case of\nNational Missile Defence, however, we are talking of a\nconcept about which there are many questions. In our\nopinion, security, as it is conceived of today, is\ncomprehensive and integral  something that cannot\nbe built up to the detriment of other partners.\nThe Czech Republic believes that the way to a\nsafer world lies primarily in the continuation of the\ndisarmament process and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, leading ultimately to a\nworld free of nuclear weapons. We support the view\nthat a more intense disarmament process will lead to\nsavings in the funds spent on arms. Employing such\nsavings for peaceful purposes would increase the\nability of the international community to tackle\npressing challenges such as the widening gap between\nrich and poor countries, and to deal with ethnic and\nreligious conflicts, environmental preservation and so\non. I would like to assure the Assembly that efforts to\nrenew the momentum of the disarmament process will\n8\n\ncontinue to have the unequivocal support of the Czech\nRepublic.\nThe Czech Republic therefore welcomes\nPresident Clinton's decision to leave the verdict on\nNational Missile Defence to the new President.\nThe Czech Republic is monitoring the situation in\nthe Middle East closely, as a traditional and active\nsupporter of the peace process established by Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\nprinciple of land for peace. The Czech Republic\nresolutely opposes the exploitation of the developments\nthat took place after the Camp David summit to attack\nthe peace process as a whole as well as the positive\nresults achieved so far in negotiations between Israel\nand the Palestine National Council (PNC). The Czech\nRepublic also emphatically rejects the misuse of this\nsituation to carry out acts of violence, which can only\nresult in unnecessary suffering and more victims. This\nis not the way to achieve the much-desired peace and\nstability in the Middle East. The Czech Republic\nsupports the establishment of an independent Palestine,\nbut it would prefer the emergence of such a state in an\natmosphere of general support enjoying the consensus\nof all those involved. That is why we believe that the\nPNC's postponement of this step by two months creates\na certain space for further deliberations. We wish them\nto be fruitful and successful in their outcome, although\nwe are fully aware that even with good political will on\nboth sides, the issues are thorny and laden with\nemotions and the burdens of history.\nLast year from this rostrum I said that Kosovo\nwould be the benchmark for the success of\ninternational institutions. I also said that Kosovo was\ngoing through a period when peace must be\ndefended  that is, a period in which it is vital to\nachieve political stability and democratization,\neconomic stabilization and the gradual development of\nthe region.\nWe can be proud of what the Kosovo Force\n(KFOR) and United Nations Interim Administration in\nKosovo (UNMIK) have done to assist the return of\nethnic Albanians who were chased out of their homes\nby Serbian forces.\nRegardless of these tremendous efforts, however,\nwe cannot be quite satisfied with the developments in\nKosovo. In fact, some of the objectives of the relevant\nresolution have not been achieved. The positive\ndevelopments we have seen so far in Kosovo concern\nmostly one ethnic group; the other still lives under a\nsecurity threat. There is still a very long way to go\nbefore a multi-ethnic, multicultural and democratic\nway of life prevails in the area.\nIn keeping with Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999), the possibility, on a permanent basis, of the\nreturn of non-Albanian ethnic groups and the building\nof a multi-ethnic, pluralistic and democratic society\nmust remain our objectives, no matter how unattainable\nthis aim may seem today. To give up on this objective\nwould be tantamount to an admission of defeat on the\npart of the international community.\nCertain negative features of the developments in\nKosovo also hinder the chances for the democratization\nof Serbia. They play into the hands of those forces in\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia which\nbuild their election campaigns on xenophobia, on the\ncontinuation of the political isolation of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and Serbia, and on the\ncontinuation of sanctions.\nIn our view, the time has come seriously to\nconsider taking further steps in Kosovo, including at\nthe level of the Security Council. The Council has\nalready taken the first steps in this direction, but it is\nimperative for it to return to the Kosovo issue soon.\nObviously, many things will depend on the results of\nthe forthcoming elections in the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia.\nThe world beyond the doors of this Hall is\nchanging rapidly. Our children will live and work in an\nenvironment that we can only guess at. It is our\ncollective responsibility to do all we can to ensure that\nit is a world of peace, prosperity, solidarity and\ntolerance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The\nRepublic of Haiti wishes to add its voice to all those\nwho have already congratulated Mr. Harri Holkeri of\nFinland on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. We take this\nopportunity also to pay tribute to Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab for the success with which he guided the work\nof the fifty-fourth session.\nI convey warm regards to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has made a remarkable\ncontribution to enhancing the confidence placed in the\nOrganization.\nThe Republic of Haiti welcomes the admission of\nTuvalu to membership of the United Nations.\nThere is no question but that this session should\nfocus on how to implement the decisions taken by our\nheads of State or Government during the Millennium\nSummit with a view to forging a policy of effective\nglobal cooperation for the twenty-first century. Despite\nall the criticism one could legitimately level at the\nOrganization after 55 years, the United Nations system\nremains the sole worldwide structure that can provide\ncollective solutions to the problems facing us in the\nspheres of international security, the environment and\neconomic and social development.\nThe Organization is often found lacking in terms\nof solutions to problems. But we know very well that\nthis lack of effectiveness is the result of several factors,\nincluding a lack of resources and poor management of\nthose that are available, and overlap in the functions of\nUnited Nations institutions and agencies. We think it is\nimportant to continue to rationalize the functioning of\nthe Organization in order to secure the best results\nfrom existing resources. We must remember that\nentrusting the United Nations with a mandate without\nproviding it with the proper means for fulfilling it has\nthe inevitable and negative consequence of\nundermining the Organization's credibility.\nLast June in Geneva, we took stock of the\noutcome of the Copenhagen World Summit for Social\nDevelopment. The assessment was very mixed, not to\nsay negative. The fact is that the Copenhagen\nDeclaration on Social Development and Programme of\nAction were formulated in response to a world socio-\nhistorical situation marked both by a widening gap\nbetween North and South and by a distinct incongruity\nbetween the positive economic aspects and the negative\nsocial aspects of globalization. Social development\ntherefore gains in urgency as the process of\nglobalization accelerates.\nIn spite of all the political and economic\ndifficulties facing the Republic of Haiti, it has made\nconstant efforts to attain the goals of the Copenhagen\nSummit, as witnessed by the seemingly minor but\nactually important fact that between 1997 and 2000\nHaiti's ranking in the United Nations Development\nProgramme human development index rose from 156\nto 150. But we know that we are far from reaching\nacceptable levels of social development. That is why\nthe Haitian Government continues to devote special\nattention to implementing the Programme of Action for\nthe Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries will be held at Brussels in\nMay 2001. It will, inter alia, assess what has been done\nto strengthen the human and institutional capacities of\nthe least developed countries. Unless these are\nstrengthened, it will be extremely difficult for least\ndeveloped countries fully to attain goals of the\nCopenhagen Programme of Action.\nBeyond its social aspects, the question of\ndevelopment will be decisive for the peaceful future of\ninternational relations. Statistics remind us daily that\nthe countries of the North and the countries of the\nSouth are moving further apart as the changes brought\nabout by globalization continue swiftly. This situation\nis politically, economically and ecologically dangerous\n20\n\nfor the stability of the international system; this could\nlead in the long term to the spread of areas bereft of\nlaw, to sudden migratory flows and to the continued\nuse of armed conflicts and violence as a way of\nconducting relations between and within nations.\nHaiti therefore welcomes the fact that a central\ntheme of next year's second high-level dialogue on\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\ndevelopment through partnership will be the\nidentification of ways to integrate developing countries\ninto the world economy in the twenty-first century.\nThe economy of the twenty-first century will\nincreasingly be based on new information technologies\nand this will be an enormous challenge for the\ndeveloping countries. Because of this, maximizing\ncultural resources and local genetic resources for\ndevelopment and for preserving traditional knowledge\nwill become essential for sustainable development,\nsince it offers an appropriate legal framework to enable\ncountries of the South to preserve their intellectual\nproperty rights to their genetic resources.\nImplementation of a global policy for economic\ndevelopment will have no really significant effect on\nreal development of the human being if the question of\npeace is neglected. Peace and development are\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. The United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization's constitution states explicitly that \u201csince\nwars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of\nmen that the defences of peace must be constructed\u201d. It\nis therefore essential that the concept and the practice\nof peace become a real culture so as to enable societies\nand individuals to develop and enrich themselves\nthrough their cultural diversity. We welcome the\nproclamation of 2001 as the \u201cYear of Dialogue among\nCivilizations\u201d.\nSocial development and the worldwide\ndissemination of a culture of peace are definitely basic\nelements here. However, we think that it is important to\nwelcome the idea of integrating them into a wider\nconceptual and operational dimension \u2014 the dimension\nof human security which places the human being at the\nvery heart of international priorities. Far from harming\nthe interests of the nation-State, human security fully\nmeets its concerns. In fact, human security goes\nbeyond, formally speaking, the natural sphere of action\nof nation-States to deal with transnational phenomena\nsuch as the degradation of the environment, natural\ndisasters and international crime in all of its many\naspects which pose serious threats to the control over,\nand managing of, national affairs. The great challenge\ntoday is to work out and implement a programme for\nhuman security that establishes, as a yardstick for its\nsuccess, its ability to release men and women in our\nworld from the slavery of poverty.\nIn our search for solutions to current problems,\nwe need to envisage the reform of our Organization\nand, in particular, the reform of the Security Council\nand the Economic and Social Council.\nQuestions of development are linked to questions\nof international security and therefore neither of these\nreforms should be neglected. After years of negotiation\nand debate, it is time now for the international\ncommunity to reach a consensus on the\ndemocratization of the Security Council to make it\nbetter adapted to the new international realities. It\nwould also be an ideal time to give thought to a\nthorough reassessment of the veto, which is no longer\nin keeping with the current state of international\nrelations.\nThe attainment of these goals will make it\npossible for our Organization to discharge its twofold\nmission: guaranteeing peace among nations and\nassisting the peoples of the earth to develop their\npotential.\nLikewise, the reform of the Economic and Social\nCouncil is essential if we want to give the United\nNations the tools it needs to confront the challenges of\nthe twenty-first century. This reform should seek to\navoid or eliminate the functional overlapping of\nprogrammes of action of the agencies of the United\nNations system, while developing a policy of\npartnership for development. Accordingly, it is\nessential to strengthen the functions of the Economic\nand Social Council that relate to the coordination of\nfunds and programmes. The strengthening of the role\nof, and the functioning of, the Economic and Social\nCouncil is particularly crucial in this era of\nglobalization. Only the definition and implementation\nat the multilateral level of coordinated plans of action\nwill make it possible to help, in a meaningful way, the\nefforts of States to eradicate poverty and to establish a\nsolid basis for comprehensive sustainable development.\nOur Organization is rightly called a universal\nOrganization. This is why the Republic of Haiti\nwelcomed enthusiastically our unanimous decision to\n21\n\nadmit Tuvalu as the 189th Member. It is only right that\nthe 9,000 inhabitants of that country be properly\nrepresented in our world Organization.\nTherefore the situation of the 23 million Chinese\nof Taiwan is a matter of concern to us. We welcome the\nfact that the dialogue-based approach continues to\nprevail on both sides of the Straits of Taiwan. While we\nwait for the dialogue to produce satisfactory results for\nboth sides, we think that the question of the\nrepresentation of these 23 million people deserves the\nattention of the United Nations.\nAllow me to conclude by referring to a few\nfigures. According to the latest report on development,\nproduced by the World Bank, one fifth of the world's\npopulation, no less than 1.2 billion people, are living\non less than one dollar a day. One out of five children\ndie before reaching the age of five. The World Bank\ntells us also that the 20 richest countries have an\naverage income which is 37 times higher than that of\nthe 20 poorest countries and this gap is twice what it\nwas 40 years ago.\nAnd yet, these last 40 years were all decades\ndevoted to development by the international\ncommunity. There is, therefore, a problem here that I\nwould call the paradox of the twentieth century. Never\nhas humanity attained such a capacity to produce all\nkinds of goods and riches, and yet never have there\nbeen so many people unjustifiably going hungry.\nThe essential challenge today is for the twenty-\nfirst century not to resemble the twentieth in this\nrespect. To make this happen, the mind-boggling\nconstant increase in scientific knowledge must be\nproperly harnessed to the fight against poverty in all of\nits various manifestations.\nThe United Nations cannot spend another 55\nyears talking about development: it is time now, it is\nhigh time to make development a reality. The entire\ncredibility of the Organization hinges on this issue\nbecause, basically, development is another name for\npeace.\nDespite the many obstacles we face, Haiti hopes\nthat the community of States will manage to build in\nthis century and in this millennium a world where basic\nneeds will be met, where nature will be protected,\nwhere the scourge of drugs and organized crime will be\ncontrolled, with opportunities for all, with hopes for a\nmore promising future, in particular for young people\nand for the disadvantaged.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania, I should like to congratulate Mr. Harri\nHolkeri on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly. We are\nconfident that his personal qualities and his extensive\npolitical and diplomatic experience are an excellent\n36\n\nguarantee of the success of this session. I should like to\nassure him of the full cooperation of our delegation in\nthis lofty task.\nI should like also to seize this opportunity to\nexpress our sincere thanks to his predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the outstanding way in\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I pay\ntribute also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nWe deeply appreciate his efforts to reform and\nrestructure the Organization as well as to develop its\nmethods of work and rationalize its role in all domains\nso that it meet the needs and challenges of today.\nIn this respect, we listened closely to the\nSecretary-General?s presentation of his report on the\nwork of the Organization. It is also my pleasure to\nwelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the Organization.\nWe are prepared to cooperate fully with it in order to\nachieve the objectives of our Organization.\nThe reform and restructuring process of the\nUnited Nations bodies has become a necessity for the\ncommon interest. The conditions in which the United\nNations was founded more than 50 years ago have\nchanged, and major developments have taken place in\nall fields and at all levels, making it essential to review\nthe methods of work and structure of the Organization.\nFor that reason, we support the expansion of the\nSecurity Council, in keeping with the principles of\ntransparency and justice, so as to achieve equitable\ngeographic representation and to reflect the\nuniversality of the Organization, in accordance with\nArticle 24 of the Charter.\nThis session is being held at the dawn of the third\nmillennium, at a time when the majority of humanity is\nliving in conditions that prevent them from realizing\ntheir aspirations. Despite some encouraging indicators\nin some of the third-world countries, the general trend\nis towards a wider gap between the industrialized\nworld and the developing one, which is facing major\nobstacles such as external debt, low prices for their\ncommodities, and the difficulty of accessing world\nmarkets.\nOur Organization should exert all possible efforts\nto alleviate the economic and social difficulties\nconfronting the developing countries. It must help them\naccelerate their development in an effective manner by\nincreasing official development assistance and by\nallowing more direct foreign investments into these\ncountries and the opening of the markets of the\ndeveloped countries to the products of developing\nones, all of which will contribute to the establishment\nof a new world order based on consensus, cooperation\nand solidarity among all States.\nThe problem of debt must also benefit from the\nattention and the interest of the international\ncommunity, because it is an obstacle to the economies\nof the developing countries. In this respect, my country\nhopes that the initiative undertaken to alleviate the debt\nof highly indebted and poor countries will contribute to\nthe solution of this problem.\nThe world today is facing numerous problems\nand challenges, the effects of which are not contained\nby national boundaries. They jeopardize international\nsecurity and undermine the achievements registered in\nall fields. Thus it is our duty to work relentlessly to\nresolve these problems. They include, to give but a few\nexamples, terrorism, poverty and violations of human\nrights.\nIn this respect, my country wishes to reaffirm its\ncondemnation of the phenomenon of terrorism, in\nwhatever form and whatever its origin. We call for the\nreinforcement of cooperation and consultation at the\ninternational level in order to face this phenomenon\nwith determination.\nThere is also a need to put in place policies and\nadopt measures to combat poverty, in order to ensure\nsustainable development. My country has created a\ncommission entrusted with combating poverty and with\nimplementing concrete programmes aimed at preparing\nour citizens to play a role in development. This\ncommission is also responsible for guaranteeing the\npromotion of individual and collective rights.\nIn this context, I would like to recall the special\nsession of the General Assembly on social\ndevelopment, held in Geneva last June, which\nreaffirmed and stressed once again the Programme of\nAction adopted at the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in 1995.\nWe hope that the outcome of that special session\nwill contribute to an improvement in the living\nconditions of all people and to the attainment of\nsustainable development by strengthening the links\nbetween social issues and development.\nWe express our satisfaction at the outcome of last\nJune?s special session of the General Assembly,\n37\n\n?Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace\nfor the twenty-first century?, and we hope it will\nenhance the role played by women in all spheres.\nThe foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania is founded on good-neighbourly relations,\npeaceful coexistence and strengthening regional and\ninternational cooperation. In line with those principles,\nmy country attaches great importance to consolidating\nstability and eliminating the causes of conflict and\ntension that can threaten international peace and\nsecurity and hamper development in many regions of\nthe world.\nTurning to the Middle East, my country, while\nreaffirming its support for the peace process, considers\nthat a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the\nregion can come about only on the basis of the Madrid\nagreements, the principle of land for peace, and the full\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973) to ensure complete Israeli\nwithdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories\nand from the Syrian Golan and the restoration to the\nPalestinian people of their legitimate national rights,\nforemost among them the right of self-determination\nand the right to the establishment of an independent\nState with the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital. This requires us to intensify our efforts to\novercome the obstacles to peace in the region, a region\nthat so sorely needs a chance to realize its potential and\nto turn a new page in the history of its peoples. In that\ncontext, we note with satisfaction the Israeli\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon.\nWe hope that efforts to bring stability and\nunderstanding to the Gulf region will be successful. My\ncountry reaffirms its respect for and adherence to\ninternational legitimacy, and reiterates its rejection of\nanything that could impinge on the independence or\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait, as well as its rejection of\nany measure that would threaten the unity or territorial\nintegrity of Iraq. We call for an end to the embargo\nimposed against the Iraqi people, who have suffered\nimmensely from that embargo; it is children, women\nand the elderly who have suffered most.\nOn the question of the Arab Maghreb, my country\nis working staunchly and resolutely in cooperation with\nour sister countries in the Arab Maghreb Union to\nstrengthen cooperation and consultation to realize the\naspirations of the people of that region.\nOn Western Sahara, my country reaffirms its\nreadiness to make every effort to promote the\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan\nfor that conflict.\nTurning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis,\nwe wish to express our satisfaction at the progress\ntowards a comprehensive settlement, including the\nsuspension of the embargo imposed on Libya. We\nwelcome the success of the diplomatic approach, and\nwe hope that this problem will be resolved once and for\nall.\nWe are concerned about the ongoing conflict in\nSomalia, and we hope that our Somali brothers will\nagree to engage in constructive dialogue in a spirit of\nresponsibility and patriotism with a view to a peaceful\nsettlement and to restoring unity and national\nsovereignty to the country so that it can once more\nenjoy stability and a climate of conciliation.\nWe regret the continuing tension in Sierra Leone,\nand hope that ongoing efforts will bear fruit, so that\nthat country, which for nine years has been suffering in\na destructive war, can once again enjoy stability and a\nclimate of conciliation.\nOn the situation in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, we reaffirm our support for the Lusaka\nCeasefire Agreement, which in our view is the only\nacceptable framework for a peaceful, comprehensive\nand lasting solution.\nWith respect to Angola, my delegation reaffirms\nits full support for Security Council resolutions 864\n(1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173 (1998), and calls upon\nUNITA to fulfil its commitments under the Lusaka\nProtocol so that peace and security may return to that\ncountry.\nTurning to the conflict between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, we express our satisfaction at the ceasefire\nachieved thanks to the efforts of President Abelaziz\nBouteflika of our sister country the People?s\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria. We hope that the\nnegotiations between the parties will result in a final\nsolution to that conflict.\nOn Kosovo, my country expresses its satisfaction\nat the positive developments towards ending the\nviolence, restoring confidence and rebuilding the\ncountry after many years of war.\n38\n\nThe United Nations was established to attain the\ncommon purposes of all mankind, notably international\npeace, security and stability. The text of the Charter\ncontains the provisions necessary to ensure a balance\nbetween the rights and the duties of all those wishing\nto serve the common interests of international society.\nThat is why, at the dawn of the third millennium, we\nmust spare no effort to ensure the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security."

        "file_text": "I wish\nsincerely to congratulate the President on his election\nto preside over the work of the Millennium Assembly. I\nwould also like to express my appreciation for the work\nof his predecessor, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nwhich culminated in the recent Millennium Summit.\nI also welcome Tuvalu as a new Member State of\nthe United Nations. I am sure that it will make a useful\nand enriching contribution to the work of the\nOrganization.\nWhat kind of United Nations do we want? Why,\nand to what purpose, do we need the United Nations in\nthis new millennium? The Millennium Summit was\nconvened to answer those questions. The task of the\nGeneral Assembly is to devise and implement the\nguidelines that the Summit proposed. Spain would like\nto suggest some ideas for progress in three of the\nOrganization's basic spheres of action: managing\nglobalization, combating poverty and peace-making.\nThe United Nations that we want must be our\nmain instrument for meeting the many challenges of\nglobalization. Its universal nature places our\nOrganization in an ideal position for that purpose. It\nwould be unforgivable if it were not capable of rising\nto that task, which has to be undertaken in very\ndifferent fields. One such area is human rights. The\nprocess of the universalization of human rights\nconstitutes one of the United Nations most valuable\ncontributions to international relations since the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, in 1948. If the twentieth century has been one\nof formulating and structuring human rights on the\ninternational level, the next century must be that of\nensuring that their effective implementation is\nuniversal.\nThe practices in most urgent need of elimination\nare racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nintolerance. The 2001 World Conference against\nRacism must be an effective instrument to that end. We\nmust also strive to abolish the death penalty, which we\nconsider a punishment contrary to the dignity of the\nhuman being. The adoption of moratoriums against\ncarrying it out could be a first step towards its total\nban.\nOur Organization must also enable us to provide\nsolutions, in a spirit of solidarity, to humanitarian\nproblems that until recently have simply not been\naddressed. The consequences have been borne by\ndefenceless civilian populations. I refer to the situation\nof refugees and persons displaced within their own\ncountries, civilian victims of armed conflicts and\ninternational aid workers who are subject to threats or\ncoercion. It is essential to broaden the scope of our\naction in this area and to pay special attention to the\nmost vulnerable sectors of the population.\nLast week, in this very city, the President of the\nSpanish Government signed the two Optional Protocols\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child, relative\nto children in armed conflict and on the sale of\nchildren, child prostitution and child pornography. In\nthat same vein, the General Assembly this year adopted\na resolution (54/262) agreeing to the holding in Spain\nin 2002 of the Second World Assembly on Ageing. We\nshall do everything possible to ensure the success of\nsuch an important event.\nIn this overall context, we must mention the issue\nof so-called humanitarian intervention, aptly proposed\non more than one occasion by the Secretary-General.\nThe United Nations that we want cannot be an\nOrganization that remains paralysed in the face of\nmassive violations of human rights, wherever they may\ntake place. When that has occurred, its prestige has\nbeen seriously affected, and it has been left out of basic\ndecision-making in times of crisis. The disgust\nprovoked by a passive stance in the face of those\natrocities and the need to strengthen the role of the\n37\n\nOrganization in crisis situations are merely two sides of\nthe same coin. It is essential that we be capable of\nbuilding consensus on at least two fundamental issues.\nThe first is actions regarding which the\ninternational community cannot remain idle, such as\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,\nwhich are offences referred to in the Rome Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court. Consensus should\nalso be reached among the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council over the cases in which they should\nrefrain from exercising their veto to block Council\nresolutions aimed at putting an end to massive\nviolations of human rights. The principle of State\nsovereignty continues to be essential in contemporary\ninternational society, but it must not be used as a\nprotective shield to trample upon human rights with\nimpunity.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt signals the direction in which the international\ncommunity is moving in that area. The creation of an\ninternational system of criminal justice constitutes the\nmost important change in international law since the\nadoption of the San Francisco Charter. I am pleased to\ninform the Assembly that my country's process of\nratification of the Rome Statute concluded yesterday. I\nhope that the International Criminal Court will become\na reality in the not-too-distant future. I trust therefore\nthat the Rome Statute will be signed and ratified by the\nlargest possible number of States, without directly or\nindirectly affecting its integrity and effectiveness.\nIf there is one issue that makes us realize that\nthere are global interests demanding our collective\nmanagement it is that of environmental protection. It is\nimperative that the Kyoto Protocol for combating the\ngreenhouse effect should come into force in 2002, at\nthe latest. Spain is a signatory of the Protocol, as well\nas of the agreements on the ozone layer, bio-diversity,\nbio-security and desertification \u2014 the latter problem\nbeing one which especially affects my country.\nUnfortunately, globalization has also generated\nfresh opportunities for the development of universal\nplagues such as terrorism and transnational organized\ncrime. However, globalization also provides us with\nnew instruments to combat them, provided we agree on\nhow to use them. Spain supports the drafting of a\ngeneral convention against international terrorism, and\nis grateful to India for its initiative in that respect. The\nwork aimed at the adoption of a convention against\ntransnational organized crime must also be concluded.\nOne of the United Nations top priorities is the\nfight against poverty. The Millennium Summit gave\nspecial attention to measures aimed at eradicating\npoverty. The specific implementation of those\nmeasures must be a basic aspect of the work of the\nGeneral Assembly. The United Nations that we want\nmust make it possible for developed and developing\ncountries to conclude agreements regarding the role\nthey must play in that task.\nThe high-level meetings that will be held in 2001\non financing for development and on the least\ndeveloped countries must not be wasted. Spain will\ncertainly do everything within its power to contribute\nto their success. My country follows the guidelines\nproduced by the World Summit for Social Development\nsuggesting that at least 20 per cent of cooperation\nresources be devoted to basic social sectors such as\nhealth, education, housing and employment, which\nhave the greatest impact on the most disadvantaged\nsectors of the population and, as a result, on the\neradication of poverty. Spain has prepared an ambitious\nmicrocredit programme aimed at meeting the needs of\nthe least favoured sectors of the population of\ndeveloping countries.\nLikewise, Spain has begun debt relief\nprogrammes in several countries, including\nMozambique and the Central American countries most\naffected by hurricane Mitch. We resolutely support the\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Medium-\nincome countries with serious external debt problems\nshould not be excluded from debt relief plans, as long\nas they implement meaningful domestic programmes to\neradicate poverty.\nIn the health sector there have been severe\nsetbacks in recent years in the fight against infectious\ndiseases, especially in Africa. Spain actively backs the\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\n(UNAIDS) and the efforts under way to facilitate\naccess to drugs against AIDS for patients in developing\ncountries. It also supports the holding of a special\nsession of the General Assembly on that illness.\nMoreover, Spain has a special interest in examining\npossible action against other infectious and parasitic\ndiseases, particularly in Africa.\nThe first sentence of the Charter states the resolve\nof the United Nations to save succeeding generations\n38\n\nfrom the scourge of war. We must not resign ourselves\nto the indefinite prolongation of some regional\nconflicts. In Africa a solution has not yet been found\nfor the situation in the Congo, which for years has\nravaged one of the richest and most influential\ncountries of the continent. Angola and Sierra Leone\ncontinue to be the backdrop for civilian conflicts that\nare often financed by the illegal sale of diamonds and\nother precious resources.\nPolitical and practical support for the United\nNations and the mission deployed on the ground has\nbeen a constant feature of Spain's policy concerning\nthe dispute over Western Sahara. Therefore, my\ncountry will maintain its commitment to a definitive\nsettlement of that dispute during this decisive time and\nwill support the efforts that the Secretary-General and\nhis Personal Envoy are making in compliance with\nSecurity Council resolution 1309 (2000).\nNew prospects for peace have opened up in the\nMiddle East following the Camp David summit. It is\nvital to consolidate the important progress made there\nand take advantage of this historic opportunity to\nconclude an agreement on all outstanding issues. Spain\nconsiders that, pursuant to the Declaration of Berlin,\nthe Palestinian people are entitled to establish their\nown state. The evolution of the peace process must be\nreflected in the resolutions to be adopted this year by\nthe General Assembly, which must not be a mechanical\nrepetition of the wording used in previous years.\nThe situation in Iraq is nevertheless proving to be\nfrustrating. The interruption of weapons inspections,\nthe absence of any foreseeable date for the lifting of\nthe sanctions, the continuation of armed action and the\ndifficult humanitarian situation in the country all\ncombine to produce a situation that is far from\nencouraging. It is imperative that consensus within the\nSecurity Council on this matter be strengthened and\nthat Iraq collaborate with the United Nations with a\nview to the full implementation of resolution 1284\n(1999) and other relevant resolutions.\nTurning to Latin America, it is vital that the\ninternational community send a clear message of\nsupport for the peace process in Colombia. The efforts\nby President Pastrana to reach an agreement that will\nput an end to decades of violence and lack of security\ndeserve the support of us all.\nThe difficulties faced by the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo in the\naccomplishment of its tasks should not overshadow its\nachievements to date in what is probably the\npeacekeeping operation with the widest-ranging\nobjectives ever undertaken by the United Nations.\nThose objectives are to pacify the territory, to reconcile\nits population, to rebuild its economy, and to enable\nKosovo, as stated in resolution 1244 (1999), to enjoy\nsubstantial autonomy and an administration that is truly\nits own, while respecting the principle of territorial\nsovereignty and integrity of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia.\nMany of these conflicts could perhaps have been\navoided. Spain unreservedly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral's efforts to direct the Organization's conflict-\nprevention. His report on Africa provides an innovative\napproach, proposing a wide-ranging package of\nmeasures to address the conflicts on the African\ncontinent.\nAn important element in this arsenal of\npreventive diplomatic measures is a sound sanctions\npolicy. Sanctions regimes must be carefully graduated\nin order to fulfil their goal: to penalize a particular\ngovernment whose policies constitute a threat to peace,\nwithout harming the civilian population of that country,\nwhich in many cases is totally powerless to influence\nthe decisions of its Government, or third parties.\nSanctions must be applied in a flexible way and be\nsubject to periodic review, enabling them to be adapted\nto changing circumstances.\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are another\ntwo essential elements of conflict prevention. It is vital\nto overcome the setbacks suffered in recent months by\nthe nuclear non-proliferation process and to promote\nthe signing and ratification of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test- Ban Treaty, with a view to its early entry\nin force. It is likewise a matter of concern that it has\nnot yet been possible to start negotiations on a protocol\non fissile material; it is urgent to achieve the necessary\nconsensus to that end.\nThe conclusion of the negotiations on the\nVerification Protocol to the Convention on Biological\nWeapons represents an achievement in this field that is\nas important as the entry into force of the Convention\non Chemical Weapons. In the same way, the 2001\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects must\nconstitute a milestone comparable to the Ottawa\nConvention banning anti-personnel mines.\n39\n\nAnother of the United Nations goals must be to\nconclude the decolonization process worldwide by\ndoing away with the last vestiges of colonialism. One\nof them persists, as a painful anachronism, in Spanish\nterritory. I am, of course, referring to Gibraltar, where,\nnearly three centuries after its population was expelled\nand the Rock occupied by British troops, a colonial\nsituation still lingers. This is an infringement of my\ncountry's territorial integrity and contravenes the\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 2353\n(XXII). Regaining sovereignty over this part of our\nterritory is a longstanding goal for Spain, which is fully\nin favour of a meaningful dialogue. It is regrettable that\nthe United Kingdom has not yet shown a genuine\npolitical will to resolve this problem. Because of this,\n15 years after the start of bilateral talks in the\nframework of the Brussels process and despite the\ndecisions of the General Assembly, we have not\nregistered any progress at all on this matter, in spite of\nseveral concrete proposals put forward by our side.\nWe want a United Nations that is capable of\ncarrying out the tasks that have been entrusted to it. To\nachieve this, it must complete its process of reform.\nFor instance, the role of the General Assembly \u2014 the\nonly body in which all the Member States are\nrepresented \u2014 must be enhanced, as it is the United\nNations driving force for debate and political impetus.\nCivil society should be incorporated to a greater extent\ninto the Organization's work. This would contribute to\nbringing people closer to the United Nations and to\nsecuring a greater commitment from them with regard\nto its work.\nIt is also vital to reform the Security Council in\norder to enable it to fully perform its duties in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\nSpanish Government believes that this reform must\ndraw its inspiration from the following principles.\nFirst, it must be conducted on the basis of a broad\nand solid consensus, in order to avoid dangerous\ndivisions among Member States and to provide the\nenlarged Council with the greater legitimacy it needs to\ncarry out its work effectively.\nIn the context of democratization, it must allow\nfor an increase in the number of non-permanent\nmembers from all regional groups, and especially from\nthe developing world. Spain considers that an\nenlargement of this category of non-permanent\nmembers would best reflect the trend towards the\ndemocratization of international society at the dawn of\nthe third millennium.\nTo enhance the Council's effectiveness, steps\nmust be taken to prevent exercise of the veto power\nfrom blocking the Council in certain crisis situations.\nFinally, there must be greater transparency. The\nCouncil's working methods must be improved by\nincreasing the number and quality of the consultations\namong its members and with other Member States, so\nthat the latter will not be left out of the decision-\nmaking process.\nThe Organization that we need must also be able\nto act firmly and effectively on the ground in order to\nmaintain the peace. The first step in this direction is to\nreflect on past mistakes. Therein lies the importance of\nthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations,\nwhich \u2014 in the same way as former reports on Rwanda\nand Srebrenica \u2014 hit a nerve when it acknowledged\nour faults and proposed solutions for overcoming them.\nThe Organization's shortcomings in this field\nhave at times been very serious, and have cost human\nlives and brought great suffering to the peoples directly\naffected. They have also seriously discredited the\nUnited Nations in the eyes of our peoples.\nSpain has a direct interest in ensuring that\npeacekeeping operations are well organized and\nmanaged, because at this time hundreds of Spaniards\nare participating in them in such faraway places as East\nTimor, Kosovo, Ethiopia and Guatemala. Moreover,\nlast year Spain signed an agreement with the\nSecretariat on the Stand-by Forces \u2014 an agreement in\nwhich some of the recommendations contained in the\nBrahimi report already appear.\nSpain steadfastly supports these recommendations\nand hopes that they will be rapidly implemented. At the\nsame time, we must be aware that all of this will\nrequire a much greater political and financial\ncommitment on the part of all with respect to\npeacekeeping operations. It will require faster\ndeployment of the necessary military and civilian units\nand larger-scale measures in order to consolidate peace\nonce conflicts come to an end. Above all, if United\nNations troops are compelled to take greater risks in\norder to guarantee the implementation of Security\nCouncil mandates, such mandates must be clear,\nrealistic and have the unequivocal backing of the\nCouncil. All this will require a serious effort to find\n40\n\ncommon positions and to achieve consensus within the\nCouncil in the elaboration of the resolutions containing\nsuch mandates, eliminating any ambiguities that could\nhamper their effective application. It means more\nresolute and unwavering action against specific States\nor groups which may attempt to disrupt such action,\nincluding the possible application of sanctions. Only\nthen will we be able to send our troops to situations in\nwhich they will have to risk their lives in order to\nensure that such mandates are upheld.\nImproving peacekeeping operations will\nundoubtedly be costly. Neither this nor any of the other\ntasks facing the Organization will be possible if it does\nnot resolve its financial crisis. Spain is the eighth-\nlargest contributor to its regular budget and pays its\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions.\nTherefore we have a direct interest in seeing the\nOrganization's financial crisis resolved once and for\nall, as soon as possible. The principle of capacity to\npay must continue to be the basic criterion for deciding\nthe assessed contributions. European Union countries\nalready are contributing much more than they should to\nthe United Nations budget in accordance with this\nprinciple. Spain's stance will be a constructive one in\nthe negotiations to review the scale of assessments later\nthis fall.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, there is\nno alternative to multilateral cooperation. The United\nNations must rise to the occasion in order to fulfil the\nexpectations of the peoples who founded it. The\ncountries represented here must face up to that\nresponsibility by building an Organization capable of\nmeeting the challenges posed by globalization in the\nnew millennium. The United Nations that we want is\npossible. It is within our reach to achieve it."

On this auspicious\noccasion, I would like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\nelection to this eminent position. Taking into account\nyour Excellency's wide experience in international\naffairs, I am confident that you will successfully\ncontribute to the work and deliberations before this\nAssembly.\nPermit me also, Mr. President, to pay special\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nRepublic of Namibia, who conducted the affairs of the\nAssembly in a most successful manner during his term\nof office.\nOur profound gratitude also goes to our able and\ndynamic Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, who has shown exemplary leadership and\ndemonstrated efficiency in managing the activities of\nour Organization. Indeed, he has played a pivotal role\nin the enhancement of the Organization's aims and\nobjectives, and in furthering peace, stability and\ninternational cooperation the world over.\nI am highly honoured to address this Assembly\ntoday in the presence of my colleague and brother, His\nExcellency Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the\nRepublic of Djibouti. In this regard, I would like to pay\nspecial tribute for the exceptional role played by His\nExcellency, his Government and the people of Djibouti\nin our recently concluded national reconciliation\nconference, held in Arta, a resort town near Djibouti.\nIn contrast to the previous 12 Somali\nreconciliation conferences, held in the past 10 years in\nvarious capitals, the Arta reconciliation conference was\nunique and more focused. While the previous\nreconciliation conferences were based on attempts to\nreconcile the personal differences and rivalries between\npower-seeking faction leaders, the Arta conference, on\nthe other hand, concentrated essentially on the\nconstructive engagement and the interaction of the\nvarious components of Somali society, such as\ntraditional clan elders and sultans, religious leaders,\nintellectuals, politicians and representatives of the\nvarious sectors of Somali civil society. More than\n2,000 delegates from inside and outside the country\nattended the conference, the deliberations of which\ncontinued for more than five months.\nIt was in the context of this transparent process\nthat a consensus was reached on the agenda and criteria\nfor participation in the conference, based on the\nbalanced and equitable representation of the various\nclans in the country. In pursuance of this innovative\napproach, the conference conducted its business. This\nled to the general agreement on the adoption of a\nTransitional Charter. The Charter, inter alia, provided\nfor the establishment of the basic constitutional organs\nof the Third Republic of the Somali State: the National\n22\n\nAssembly, the President, the Council of Ministers and\nan independent judiciary. In accordance with these\ntransitional measures, the first organ the conference\nestablished was the National Assembly. In turn, the\nNational Assembly elected the President in a fair and\nfree manner in the presence of observers and\nrepresentatives of the international community.\nThe outcome of the Arta reconciliation\nconference received an overwhelming endorsement of\nthe Somali people within the country and in the\ndiaspora. Strong messages of support and pledges\npoured into Arta from all regions of the country and\nfrom Somali communities abroad.\nIn contrast to anarchy and civil war, which\nprevailed in Somalia for the past 10 years, the creation\nof the National Assembly and the election of a\nPresident ushered in a new era for peace and stability\nand constituted the first step of restoring order and\ncentral authority to the country. This was indeed\ntranslated into reality during my recent visit to\nMogadishu and Baidoa. The spontaneous reaction of\nthe hundreds of thousands of people who welcomed us\nin both cities demonstrated vividly that they wanted to\nleave years of civil war behind and open a new era of\npeace, tranquillity, good governance, restoration of the\nrule of law and national unity.\nIn this connection, let me emphasize the fact that\nthe majority of the Somali people in the regions that we\nwere not able to visit, including the regions in the\nnorthwest and northeast of the country, uphold a shared\ncommitment and optimism for the unity and future\nprogress of the country.\nWith regard to the warlords and individuals who\nstill remain outside the reconciliation process, we\nexpress our full preparedness to engage with them in\npeaceful dialogue, and we call upon them to review\ntheir positions, hear the voice of reason, and respect the\nlegitimate aspirations of the Somali people to achieve\nnational unity, social and economic development and\ndurable peace throughout the country.\nThe challenges that the Somali Republic faces\ntoday are monumental. My Government is prepared to\nmeet those challenges with a realistic approach. We\nunderstand that our country stands today in the midst\nof a crisis of serious proportions. We shall exercise\ncare, compassion and objectivity to manage that crisis\nand overcome it in the end.\nThere has been large-scale destruction of the\nphysical infrastructure and resources in both urban and\nrural areas. Generations of children have not gone to\nschool for almost two decades. A good number of high-\nlevel managerial staff and skilled technicians have left\nthe country. The role of the international community in\nassisting us in peace-building, rehabilitation and\nreconstruction is therefore of pivotal importance for us.\nThere should be no relaxation by the international\ncommunity in the overall effort to provide\nhumanitarian and developmental assistance to the\nSomali Republic.\nWe will engage Somali professionals and\ntechnical experts inside and outside the country to be\nactively involved in all reconstruction programmes and\nprojects. We will also give indigenous and international\nnon-governmental organizations and relevant United\nNations agencies all the necessary assistance to be able\nto contribute effectively to the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of the country.\nI would like to emphasize that my Government\nwill place particular emphasis in the immediate future\non the following priority areas: first, restoration of\npeace, stability and national unity, and the formation of\nan effective security force to consolidate them;\nsecondly, disarmament of the militias and their\nencampment, subsequent rehabilitation and training in\nall the regions of the country; and, thirdly, maintenance\nof law and order through the creation of effective law\nenforcement agencies and professional courts of law.\nWithin the framework of that policy, my Government\nwill promote and consolidate peace, security and unity\nin the country at large.\nAt the international level, we reaffirm our\nunqualified support for the principles and objectives of\nthe United Nations and pledge to cooperate with\nrelevant regional and subregional organizations,\nnamely, the Organization of African Unity, the League\nof Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic\nConference and the Inter-Governmental Authority on\nDevelopment. We shall also maintain and strengthen\nour relations with the European Union. We would like\nto open up new vistas of cooperation and economic ties\nwith other organizations, such as the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil and the Association of South-East Asian\nNations.\nMy Government will promote strong links of\ncooperation with the countries of the Horn of Africa\n23\n\nand the Red Sea based on the principles of mutual\nrespect, sovereign equality of States and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, as\nprovided in the Charter of the United Nations. We will\npromote economic partnership, open borders and\ncommon port services among the countries of the Horn\nof Africa.\nIn conclusion, my delegation requests the\nAssembly to facilitate the adoption of a resolution\nunder the title \u201cAssistance to the Somali Republic\u201d\nrelating to the following areas of need: first, urgent\nassistance from Member States for the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of Somalia; secondly, resumption of\nsustained economic cooperation with the international\ncommunity in general and with Member States of the\nUnited Nations in particular; and, thirdly, a call on\nrelevant United Nations agencies and organizations to\nredouble their efforts in providing financial and\nmaterial assistance to the people of Somalia.\nFinally, I extend my profound appreciation to the\nUnited Nations for the commendable role it has played\nin the efforts to alleviate the plight of the Somali\npeople during the last 10 years. We also wish to\nexpress our appreciation for the efforts of the world\nbody in its continued search for a solution to our\npolitical crisis throughout the decade, and for its\ncontinued humanitarian support and assistance to the\nSomali people. I am confident that the United Nations\nwill continue to provide support for the realization of\nthe aspirations of the Somali people to stability, peace\nand development.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Permit\nme, at the outset, to extend to you, Mr. President, my\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Let me\nalso pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, who guided the work of the previous session\nof the General Assembly most successfully.\nThis session acquires special importance, not\nonly because it is the first of the new millennium, but\nalso because it coincides with the convening of the\nMillennium Summit, which gathered together, for the\nfirst time, a majority of the world's leaders. Therefore,\nthe historic instruments that emerged from the Summit\nwere a culmination of that momentous occasion.\nThe Republic of Yemen, as President Ali\nAbdullah Saleh emphasized in his statement at the\nMillennium Summit, is committed to achieving those\nideals and objectives, supporting the leadership role of\nthe United Nations and promoting the purposes of its\nCharter, with a view to upholding the principles of\nfreedom, equality and justice, so that every society can\nassume its national responsibilities for comprehensive\nand sustainable development, including poverty\neradication, the provision of food, shelter, health care\nand education, ensuring fundamental freedoms, human\nrights and democracy and enabling women to play their\nrole in society.\nAccordingly, the Republic of Yemen supports\nefforts by the Secretary-General to develop the role,\nmechanisms and organs of the international\nOrganization to meet the challenges of twenty-first\ncentury. It also supports moves towards the renewal\nand development of inter-State relations and towards\nbringing them into line with new global phenomena\nthat call for democracy, respect for human rights and\nthe transformation of globalization into a positive force\nthat will benefit all inhabitants of the world. In this\nconnection, the Republic of Yemen reaffirms its\ninvitation to host the Fifth International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies, to be held in 2003.\nOur world has become a single village where\nevents interact globally with no room for isolationism.\nThe merging of States' economies is the most\nprominent feature of mutual dependency and,\nconsequently, of shared responsibility aimed at creating\nan environment at the national and global levels\nconducive to development and poverty eradication.\nGood governance, as stated in the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration, must exist not only within\neach country but at the international level and be based\non laws and transparency in financial, monetary and\ntrading systems.\n2\n\nIn our view, this requires that the developed\nindustrialized countries fulfil their commitments to\nprovide official development assistance to developing\ncountries, address the special needs of the least\ndeveloped countries, provide debt relief to poor\ncountries and agree to cancel all official bilateral debts.\nWithin this context we would also include the removal\nof all barriers against the exports of developing\ncountries seeking access to world markets.\nThis year our people celebrated the tenth\nanniversary of the restoration of blessed Yemeni unity.\nThe Republic of Yemen has been able to achieve\nsuccesses in the democratic process, freedom, justice,\nrespect for human rights and the enablement of women\nto play their role in society. While our people proceed\nto incorporate new concepts, with the aim of adapting\nto new world developments, they suffer from the\nfinancial burdens and the assumption of tasks inherent\nin comprehensive economic and social reform. In\naddition, the processes relating to economic\nliberalization \u2014 lifting subsidies on various foods and\nfuel and reducing public services, as prescribed by\ninternational financing institutions \u2014 have created\nsocial tensions. We therefore call upon the advanced\nindustrialized countries to understand this underlying\nreality of shared responsibility in the context of\ncomprehensive and sustainable development in the\ndeveloping countries as a guarantee for international\ndevelopment, security and stability.\nThe Republic of Yemen has persevered in\nadvocating attainment of peace and stability at the\nregional and the international levels by the surest ways,\nnamely by resolving all disputes peacefully and\nthrough the use of mechanisms for the resolution of\ndisputes, which embodies faith in the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We in\nthe Republic of Yemen are proud to have placed\npractical reliance on those principles in resolving\nborder issues with three neighbouring States: the\nSultanate of Oman, Eritrea and, recently, the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia.\nA new era of brotherhood, cooperation and\nmutual interests between the Republic of Yemen and\nthe fraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was inaugurated\non 12 June 2000, following the signature of a treaty\nbetween the two countries on international territorial\nand maritime boundaries. We deem it an historic\nachievement by all criteria, since it ends a long period\nof tension and instability. The frontiers between the\ncountries have become bridges of love, brotherhood\nand cooperation. This will, unquestionably, contribute\nto general stability in the region.\nWithin this framework one may understand\nYemen's strong desire and long-term efforts to\ncontribute to a resolution of the problems that have\nplagued Somalia. Now that the Arta conference has\nbeen held, the Transitional National Assembly has been\nconstituted and the country's President has been\nelected, we support the implementation of the\nresolutions that emerged from the conference. We hope\nthat the consensus between the representatives of the\nvarious Somali factions present at the conference will\nlead to stability and prepare the way for the\ncommencement of a process of comprehensive and\nsustainable development in an atmosphere of national\nreconciliation. In this regard, we must commend the\ngreat efforts made by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of\nthe Republic of Djibouti to ensure the success of the\nArta conference.\nThe return to normalcy in Somalia will\nunquestionably promote security and stability in the\nHorn of Africa, which has suffered the scourge of war\nand its effects. That suffering can be seen in the cross-\nborder flows of refugees. In the case of Yemen,\nhundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia and\nother States of the region have infiltrated the country\nvia our coasts. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to extend assistance to resolve the problem\nof refugees and ensure their return to their homelands\nfor the sake of stability and reconstruction in the\nregion.\nThe Republic of Yemen believes that the peace\nthat people seek is a peace based on justice, equality\nand respect for human rights. Accordingly, peace in the\nMiddle East should be based primarily on the\nrestoration of all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople. Foremost among those rights is the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on\nPalestinian soil with Jerusalem as its capital. Israel\nmust also withdraw from all occupied Arab territories\nin the Syrian Golan.\nWe would also like to convey our esteem and\ncongratulations to fraternal Lebanon and its people on\nthe unconditional liberation of its southern part.\nThe world is still amassing large quantities of\nweapons of mass destruction. Those weapons endanger\ninternational security and stability and hinder any steps\n3\n\ntowards finding solutions to development problems. In\naccordance with relevant resolutions of the General\nAssembly, we in the Republic of Yemen stress the\nimportance of making the Middle East region an area\nfree from nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass\ndestruction. We also endorse the international\ncommunity's call to exert pressure on Israel to adhere\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to place all its\nnuclear installations under international supervision.\nIraq is experiencing a human tragedy as a result\nof the embargo that has been imposed on it for 10\nyears. While calling for the implementation of United\nNations resolutions concerning Iraq, we stress from\nthis rostrum the need to end that tragic situation by\nlifting the embargo. It has lasted too long and has\ncaused very extensive damage to the entire Iraqi\npopulation, especially women, children and elderly\npersons. In the same vein, we call for a complete lifting\nof the embargoes imposed on the Sudan and Libya.\nWith regard to the dispute over the three Arabian\nGulf islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates,\nYemen hopes that an amicable and peaceful solution to\nthat issue will be decided along the lines followed by\nthe Republic of Yemen in the resolution of its border\ndisputes with its neighbours.\nLastly, we welcome all the resolutions calling for\nthe reform of the United Nations and its structure so as\nto make it more transparent and democratic, including\nresolutions concerning the expansion of the\nmembership of the Security Council and enhancing and\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nIt is our hope that resolutions will be adopted at\nthis important session to contribute to the reform and\nrestructuring of the United Nations and its organs in\norder that it may meet the requirements of the new\ncentury, with its increasing problems and ever more\ncomplex inter-State relations.\nIt is our responsibility to make this session an\noccasion to review our work and to examine the\nresolutions adopted by our leaders at the Millennium\nSummit so that we can transform them into tangible\nreality. Doing so will further our progress towards\nachieving security, stability, development and\nprosperity for our countries and peoples. I am\nconfident that our united stance and sincere endeavours\nwill guarantee the success of this session and the\nachievement of the desired results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I offer you\nJamaica's warmest congratulations as you assume the\nhigh honour of the presidency of the Millennium\nAssembly of the United Nations.\nAt the same time, I wish to express our\nappreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, who, by his\nastute and judicious leadership, brought to a successful\nconclusion the work of the fifty-fourth session.\nI also take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu, a\nfellow small island State, to the United Nations family.\nWe meet in the wake of the historic gathering of\nworld leaders last week, when the international\ncommunity sought to redefine and articulate a common\nvision for the future of all its citizens. We now have the\nopportunity \u2014 indeed, the responsibility \u2014 to evaluate\njust how far we have come in the mission we set for\nourselves through this Organization; to address\nhonestly our shortcomings in commitment and action;\nand to examine practical, realistic strategies that will\nresult in measurable progress in areas identified for\nurgent action.\nThe Secretary-General, whom we commend for\nhis stewardship during the past year, has urged us to\nconsider a world in the future free from poverty.\nIndeed, promoting development that ensures the well-\nbeing of all peoples is one of the fundamental goals of\nthis Organization. However, a review of our efforts to\nachieve this ideal shows uneven progress through an\nincreasingly diffused institutional structure.\nOver the past decade, we have sought to refocus\nand articulate the development agenda by addressing\nkey issues in a series of special global conferences.\nThrough the respective political commitments and\nplans of action which we agreed to implement, we have\nsought to devise a network of policies and programmes\nto promote people-centred, sustainable development.\nYet economic strategies embracing these goals\nhave brought little tangible benefit to the majority of\ncitizens of the international community. Nearly half of\nthe world's people languish in extreme poverty, and\nstill more remain on the fringes of the global economy.\nDevelopment efforts have been frustrated by the\nchallenges posed by globalization and trade\nliberalization. Sustainable development ultimately\ninvolves an enhanced capacity for income and\nemployment generation, as well as the provision of\nequitable health, education and other social benefits.\nBut this cannot be achieved without economic growth\nand expansion. It is this opportunity that globalization,\nwhich indeed carries the potential, has so far failed to\ndeliver to the majority of developing countries.\nFor small island States like Jamaica, there is\nanother dimension to the development challenge. This\nis because of the well-known economic limitations of\nsize, market and resource base, a fragile ecosystem and\nsusceptibility to natural disasters. Decades of\ninvestment in infrastructure and industry can be wiped\nout during a single hurricane, destroying the economy\nand diverting resources to reconstruction and\nrehabilitation for a number of years.\nSmall economies attempting to compete\neffectively in the international trading system are just\nas vulnerable. There is a need for an urgent review of\nthe inequities in the global trading system whereby\nselective application of the regulations permits\ndeveloped countries to maintain protectionist policies\nand subsidies that work against developing country\nexports, while stripping the more vulnerable of\npreferential market access. We are deeply concerned\nthat a mechanism established to promote free trade for\ngrowth and development could be so manipulated that\nit exposes the smallest and weakest to a hostile trading\nenvironment while removing their means of survival.\n6\n\nSpecial and differential treatment provisions have not\nbeen implemented, and the request for duty-free, quota-\nfree treatment for the least developed countries has not\nbeen agreed to.\nWe are particularly disappointed that, in ongoing\nnegotiations to reach agreement on a marketing regime\nfor bananas that is compatible with the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), we have found little flexibility,\nno empathy and an unwillingness to compromise on the\npart of those challenging the regime. Meanwhile,\nimplementation of the WTO panel ruling has resulted\nin a dramatic loss of export markets in some Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) States, spiralling\nunemployment, increasing poverty and many other\nsocial ills. For there can be no development without\ngrowth, and no growth without trade.\nDeteriorating terms of trade adversely affect the\nbalance of payments, exacerbating external debt. Many\ndeveloping countries continue to experience severe\ndebt burdens, and, in some cases, the debt problem has\nworsened over the past decade, trapping those\ncountries in a vicious circle of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. We must address the debilitating\neffect of debt servicing, which undermines growth\nprospects and compromises governments' capacity to\nfinance basic social programmes. The international\ncommunity should implement the debt-relief schemes\nalready agreed to and design new mechanisms\nappropriate to different countries' circumstances.\nThe globalization of trade, finance and swiftly\nadvancing information technology will present\nunprecedented opportunities well into the twenty-first\ncentury. For developing countries, however, the\nchallenges of the trading system, limited access to\ninternational financial flows, a crippling debt burden\nand a low capacity to assimilate information\ntechnology will prevent meaningful participation in the\ninternational marketplace. Hence, the widening gap\nbetween rich and poor nations in the face of unlimited\nopportunity is the disturbing irony that we now\ncontemplate.\nIf we are now to lay the foundation for a world\nfree from poverty, then a new ethos in global\ngovernance must prevail: one that gives more than lip\nservice to the development aspirations of developing\ncountries; one that addresses responsibly the need for\neconomic adjustment, reform and closer monitoring of\nthe international financial infrastructure; and one that\npromotes greater coordination and cooperation between\nthe major institutions and intergovernmental\norganizations responsible for international trade,\nfinance and development.\nThat such cooperation is already being explored\nis indeed encouraging. But we will need serious\ncommitment. Until now, there have been no parallel\ndiscussions on reforming the international financial\narchitecture and the international trading system. The\nwork of the Preparatory Committee for the High-level\nInternational Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\nDevelopment, including consultations with the Bretton\nWoods institutions, has progressed uneasily, leaving\nuncertainty regarding the outcome and likely success of\nthat landmark meeting. We will wait to see whether\nmeaningful World Trade Organization (WTO)\nparticipation will take place, as we consider it\nimportant to successful deliberations.\nOf course, we applaud the evolving relationship\nbetween the Bretton Woods institutions and the\nEconomic and Social Council. Each brings to the\npartnership its unique characteristics and strengths,\nwhich should make for successful collaboration.\nPerhaps similar relationships might also be established\nwith the World Trade Organization. That cooperation,\nlong overdue, reinforces the integral role that we\nbelieve the United Nations should play in key\ninternational decision-making on all issues which\naffect sustainable human development. We look\nforward to the extension of this cooperation beyond the\nco-financing of development projects, towards the\nharmonization of mechanisms and policies.\nThe importance of South-South cooperation as an\neffective instrument for the promotion of development\namong developing countries cannot be\noveremphasized. The historic meeting of the leaders of\nthe South, held at Havana this year, strengthened our\ncommitment to forge a common strategy for our future,\nsharing resources, expertise and best practices in\npartnership with one another. We strongly urge the\ncontinued strengthening of mechanisms that advance\nSouth-South relations and promote self-reliance.\nIncreasingly, we must look to each other for our\nsurvival in the existing global environment.\nWe continue to look to the organs and agencies of\nthe United Nations system to play a central role in\nsupporting and advancing the development efforts of\nMember States. We are deeply concerned at the decline\n7\n\nin contributions to core resources for operational\nactivities, and at the effect this has had in the\nnarrowing and re-ordering of priorities in programme\ndelivery. It is impossible to reconcile the contraction in\ncore contributions with the donor community's\nexpressed commitment to multilateral development\nassistance. The capacity of United Nations funds and\nprogrammes to maintain current levels of programme\ndelivery is a matter deserving the urgent attention of\nMember States. We take this opportunity to place on\nrecord our appreciation for the valuable work of United\nNations operational agencies in Jamaica.\nNext year's special session of the General\nAssembly on children will give the international\ncommunity an opportunity to renew its commitment\nand to consider further action to improve the quality of\nlife for the world's children in the next decade.\nThe role of the United Nations as defender of\ninternational peace and security has undergone major\ntransformation in the past decade. As inter-State\ntensions dissolved with the end of the cold war, civil\nconflicts developed in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe\nto take their place. The Security Council is now\nsearching to adjust and redefine an effective strategy to\ndeal with the new imperatives of peacekeeping and\npeace-building. This has meant seeking a delicate\nbalance between respect for sovereignty and the urgent\nneed for humanitarian intervention.\nIn too many cases the resolution of conflict has\nremained elusive owing to political ambitions or to\nracial or ethnic intolerance. Furthermore, the brutality\nand violence of conflict have often taken their toll on\ninnocent civilians and children, creating still more new\nchallenges with an increasing number of refugees and\ninternally displaced persons. Humanitarian intervention\nin such cases is imperative.\nThe effectiveness of peacekeeping missions is\nunder scrutiny in the face of sharply escalating\npeacekeeping budgets. Rather than waiting until\nconflicts spiral out of control, we need to place more\nemphasis on conflict prevention. Jamaica therefore\nstrongly supports the formulation of a comprehensive\nUnited Nations strategy to address the root causes of\nconflict.\nIt is time that we acknowledged that economic\ndeprivation and social injustice lead to political and\neconomic instability. Therefore, effective conflict\nprevention, peacekeeping and peace building must\nincorporate a development component, and provide for\nthe strengthening of civil institutions, particularly in\npost-conflict reconstruction.\nAnd we must not forget the importance of\nadequately equipping the United Nations machinery to\nensure robust intervention at every stage of the\npeacekeeping process, particularly for rapid\ndeployment when necessary. This should also include\nresources adequate to ensure the safety of our troops\ndeployed in missions across the world. It is the very\nleast that we owe them. Jamaica pays tribute today to\nthose who have paid the ultimate price in the service of\npeace.\nThe deadly flow of illegal small arms around the\nworld continues unabated, sustained by greed and\nlawlessness. This illicit arms trade contributes\nsignificantly to the escalation and perpetuation of\nviolence in conflict and post-conflict areas,\nundermining peacekeeping operations and frustrating\nefforts at disarmament, demobilization and the\nrestoration of civil order. But this phenomenon is not\nunique to countries in a state of war. The illegal traffic\nin weapons is also linked to the illicit trade in\nnarcotics, and this undermines stable democracies like\nJamaica, destroying the social fabric of our\ncommunities.\nThis situation simply cannot stand. Urgent action\nis needed. Global interdependence warrants collective\naction to stem the flow of these guns from producer to\nreceiving States. The responsibility to curb this illicit\ntraffic cannot rest with the receiving States alone.\nJamaica looks with anticipation to the convening\nof the first International Conference on the Illicit Trade\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects\nnext year. It is our hope that this meeting will address\ncomprehensively and decisively national, regional and\ninternational measures to regulate and control the legal\nmanufacture, acquisition and transfer of small arms;\nmeasures related to the marking, registration and\ntracing of these weapons; and mechanisms for the\nsystematic exchange of information.\nThe transhipment of nuclear and other hazardous\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea poses yet another\nkind of danger to the security of small island States of\nthe subregion. The Caribbean Community has\nrepeatedly expressed concern at the threat to the fragile\nmarine and coastal environment of the Caribbean posed\nby this continued practice. A single nuclear accident in\n8\n\nthis semi-enclosed sea would have consequences we\ndare not even contemplate.\nThis concern was again brought to the attention\nof the international community during the 2000 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation, held earlier this year. We look\nforward to cooperating with like-minded States, and we\npropose to work towards ensuring that a regime is\nestablished for liability and compensation to our\ncountries in the event of an accident.\nOn Friday, 8 September, Jamaica signed the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We\nnow look forward to the contribution that the Court\nwill ultimately make to the strengthening of\ninternational jurisprudence, by addressing the serious\ncrimes of global concern committed by individuals\nwho hitherto escaped the reach of the law.\nWe are also very pleased to report that the\nInternational Seabed Authority has completed its\ndrafting of the Mining Code. This marks an important\nfirst step in the process toward the full establishment of\noperations of the Authority that will ultimately enable\nall nations to share in exploitation of the resources of\nthe seabed. Jamaica encourages wider participation in\nthe work of the International Seabed Authority and\nurges Member States to act to ensure its continued\nfinancial viability.\nWhile the United Nations is by no means perfect,\nwe still meet here because we hold an enduring faith in\nthe principles and ideals that it represents. We are\nconvinced that it remains the best forum for dialogue\nand resolution of disputes. Let us now face the future\ntogether responsibly, with full respect for the needs,\naspirations and rights of our fellow man. This may well\nbe difficult to achieve, but shared objectives, shared\ncommitment and shared responsibilities will ensure a\nbetter world for all humankind.\nAs we contemplate the challenges for the future,\nlet us resolve to begin a new dialogue within the\nUnited Nations system to forge a global partnership for\npeace, democracy and economic progress."

        "file_text": "It is my\npleasure to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on his\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session\nof the General Assembly, and I should like to convey to\nhim our best wishes for a successful accomplishment of\nhis tasks. I should also like to express our high esteem\nto his predecessor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, who conducted the work of the previous\nsession with notable skill.\nThe Millennium Summit came to an end just a\nfew days ago. From a certain point of view, it was an\noccasion for reviewing the state of international\nrelations following the collapse of the bipolar\ninternational order. We have taken note of the\nincreasing number of States complaining of the\nunipolar control over international affairs and the\nextent of the current and future dangers that this\nsituation can give rise to.\nMore than 10 years ago, Iraq drew attention to the\nfirst signs of many dangers and basic problems that\nhave since grown worse and become the focus of a\nsignificant part of the discussions of the Millennium\nSummit. In February 1990, President Saddam Hussein\nwarned against the grave dangers resulting from the\nunilateral control assumed by the United States of\nAmerica and its headlong rush to impose its hegemony\non the world in general and on the Arab Gulf region\nand other Arab countries in particular. He also warned\nagainst the dangers posed by that State's recourse to\nillegitimate and immoral ways and means of achieving\nthat goal, including the use of brute force; the exercise\nof pressure; political and economic blackmail;\ninterference in the internal affairs of States; the\nfomenting of racial, religious and sectarian conflicts;\nand the use of international institutions to serve the\ninterests of American policy.\nIraq also drew attention to the following\nsituations at an early stage.\nThe first was the exploitation by the\nindustrialized countries, the United States in particular,\nof scientific and technological progress for political\npurposes, with a view to engulfing all other countries\n8\nof the world in a wave of capitalistic globalization,\nclaiming that globalization is an inevitable fate to\nwhich all must submit, regardless of the negative\nconsequences and dangers it entails for the lives of the\nvast majority of humankind.\nSecondly, it drew attention to the adoption of a\ndouble standard as far as political positions are\nconcerned, and it noted an indifference to the legal and\npolitical standards imposed by internationally binding\nagreements, where a balance is struck between rights\nand obligations in the process of the coexistence of\ninterests among various countries, without any\ndistinction or discrimination.\nThirdly, it noted the prevalence of the logic of\n\u201cpower and opportunity\u201d in the exploitation of United\nNations mechanisms to ensure the adoption of\nresolutions supporting the selfish political aims of one\ncountry or a few countries at the expense of common\nprinciples in international relations, without first giving\nconsideration to obligations undertaken under the\nCharter of the United Nations and the principles of\njustice and equity \u2014 hence the recourse to mandatory\nembargoes and comprehensive economic sanctions as a\ngoal in and of itself, as well as the continuation of the\npolicies of starvation and destruction of the economies\nof various countries and societies.\nFourthly, it drew attention to the imposition on\nthe international community of unilateral policies\nthrough mechanisms and arrangements outside the\ninternational system, and to the fact that such\narrangements were treated as substitutes for the United\nNations in those cases where the hegemonic Powers,\nheaded by the United States, expected to meet with\nstrong opposition by the United Nations to those\nunilaterally determined policies, as we saw in the case\nof the aggression launched by the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) against the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia.\nFifthly, it noted the phenomenon of the forcible\nadjustment and adaptation of established rules of\ninternational law to serve the unilateral policies of the\nhegemonic Powers, headed by the United States of\nAmerica, through the imposition of strange and bizarre\ninterpretations of the contents of such rules, or even\ntotal disregard for them when said Powers were unable\nto impose their strange interpretations thereon. An\nexample of this dangerous phenomenon can be found\nin the feverish attempts to minimize the importance of\nthe principles of State sovereignty, national\nindependence and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of States.\nSixthly, it noted the phenomenon of evading\nresponsibility in cases where the assumption of\nresponsibility would not be profitable from an\neconomic point of view, as is the case in questions\nrelated to environmental pollution, the expansion of the\nsphere of poverty in the world and the obstruction of\nthe development of the States of the South, all of which\nare cases where the responsibility of the advanced\nindustrialized countries is quite obvious.\nThe dangers, challenges and negative phenomena\nto which I have referred, as have many other speakers\nin the course of this general debate, have led to broad\nreflection on the solutions needed to overcome those\ndifficulties and problematic issues. Iraq is of the view\nthat the starting point is for United Nations actions to\nbe a true expression of the will of all peoples and\nnations. That is how the Charter of the United Nations\nwas drawn up, in order to establish a system of\ncollective security based on common collective\ninterests. The stability and effectiveness of the system\nof collective security is based on cooperation among\npartners and on the basis of specific obligations, not\nunilateral action and domination, as is the case today.\nThe right of nations and peoples to live in peace and\nstability is the essential requirement for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\nright can be guaranteed only if it is firmly linked to the\nright to economic and social development and to\nfreedom from any kind of pressure or interference.\nThis noble collective goal can be achieved only\nby upholding the United Nations system and by\nreforming and developing that system in order to invest\nit with the ability and competence to achieve that goal.\nReform is particularly called for in the case of the\nSecurity Council, which must respect its obligations\ntowards the community of States and must comply with\nthe correct interpretation of the purposes and principles\nof the Charter in the performance of its functions and\nthe use of its powers. It is also necessary to restore the\nrole of the General Assembly in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, so as to ensure the\nnecessary balance if the Security Council fails to\nassume its basic responsibilities under the Charter\nbecause of the unilateral and abusive exercise of its\npowers.\n9\nThe wave of capitalistic globalization sweeping\nover today's world continues to widen the gap between\nthe rich and the poor in the world. This dangerous\nphenomenon requires a forceful call to lay the\nfoundations of a true international partnership in order\nto re-establish economic and social justice at both the\ninternational and national levels, upholding the\nprinciple of equitable sharing by all of the fruits of\nscientific and technological progress, and stopping rich\ncountries from using science and technology as tools\nfor imposing their policies of exploitation on the\ncountries and peoples of the world. A dynamic\npartnership between the countries of the North and the\ncountries of the South is fundamentally opposed to the\nlogic of domination and unilateral power and to the\ntransformation of science and technology into political\ntools for the subjugation of others. On the other hand,\nthe call for democratization within countries will\nremain spurious unless its advocates adhere to a\ndemocratic course at the level of dealings with other\nStates and with international organizations.\nFurthermore, the call for respect for international law\nand its primacy at the national level will remain devoid\nof credibility unless it is associated with the kind of\nconduct that calls for respect for the letter and spirit of\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rules of\ninternational law, and with the possibility of recourse\nto international judiciary bodies, with regard to the\ninterpretation and application of legal provisions to\nensure a delicate balance between powers and\nresponsibilities, rights and obligations. Any affirmation\nof respect for human rights should not overlook the\nfact that civil, political, economic, social and cultural\nrights should, as a matter of equal importance and\nurgency, enjoy the same respect. Nor should such an\naffirmation overlook the fact that the world is\ncharacterized by cultural and civilizational diversity,\nand that the cultural and social assumptions tacitly\naccepted by a given culture cannot be imposed on other\nnations and peoples.\nWhat I have just stated does not belong to the\nrealm of theory. We in Iraq continue to suffer from the\ndomination and abusive actions of the hegemonic\npowers headed by the United States of America. Our\ndeep faith in the righteousness of our position explains\nthe steadfastness shown by our country and our people\nin the face of the might of the unipolar Power.\nThe comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq\nhave entered their eleventh year. By all standards, these\nsanctions amount to genocide and involve a brutal\napplication of collective punishment and revenge\nagainst an entire people. There is no longer any doubt\nthat these sanctions constitute a continued, flagrant\nviolation of the United Nations Charter, of\ninternational law and of international humanitarian law.\nThis matter has been confirmed by the reports of\nUnited Nations agencies and humanitarian and human\nrights organizations. The most recent testimony to that\neffect is to be found in the working paper adopted by\nthe Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection\nof Human Rights at its fifty-second session, held in\nGeneva from 31 July to 25 August 2000. The paper\naffirmed that the comprehensive sanctions against Iraq\nare unequivocally illegal under existing international\nhumanitarian law and human rights laws.\nIt is well known that both the United States and\nGreat Britain claim that the oil-for-food programme,\nagreed to between the United Nations and Iraq,\nalleviates the impact of the unjust sanctions imposed\nagainst Iraq. Such a claim, however, is quickly proved\nto have no basis when set against the figures published\nby the United Nations itself. More than three and a half\nyears have now passed since the inception of the\nprogramme, during which Iraq has exported $31.6\nbillion worth of oil. Of this total, $9.5 billion has been\nallocated to the Compensation Fund in Geneva and $1\nbillion allocated for operational administrative\nexpenses of the United Nations while, in the course of\nthree and a half years, only $8.3 billion has been\ndisbursed for purchases to cover the needs of the Iraqi\npeople.\nThere are also floating and semi-frozen\nallocations for certain needs of Iraq amounting to $10\nbillion that have not been disbursed owing to\nobstructions placed by the Americans and the British.\nSuch egregious obstructions include the suspension of\n1173 contracts, valued at more than $2 billion, relating\nto construction materials and humanitarian needs.\nDespite increasing pressure on the international\ncommunity to put an end to this ongoing genocide, two\npermanent members of the Security Council \u2014 the\nUnited States of America and Britain \u2014 insist on\nperpetuating this crime to further their plans to\ndestabilize the Arabian Gulf region and preserve its\nhotbeds of tension with a view to prolonging their\nhegemony over and military occupation of the region\nand to plundering its wealth.\n10\n\nThe United States openly declares that it is\nprepared to use the veto against any attempt to lift the\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. It is indeed shameful for the\nUnited States that its Secretary of State, Madeleine\nAlbright, has declared on television that the\ncontinuation of sanctions is worth the death of 500,000\nIraqi children.\nJust to clarify the matter, although the States\nMembers of the United Nations have authorized the\nSecurity Council to act on their behalf provided that it\ndo so in accordance with the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations, pursuant to Article 24 of the\nCharter, the Security Council has, in the case of the\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq, gone so far\nbeyond the purposes and principles of the Charter as to\nturn itself into a cover for perpetrating a policy of\ngenocide against an entire people. Therefore, it\nbehoves the States Members of the United Nations to\nvoice their opinion as to the extent of the Security\nCouncil's faithful compliance with such authorization.\nIn this connection, it is worth mentioning that, under\nArticle 25 of the Charter, Members of the United\nNations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of\nthe Security Council in accordance with the Charter.\nThis means that implementation of the comprehensive\nsanctions imposed on Iraq, which have become illegal\nunder international humanitarian law and human rights\nlaw, is no longer binding on States Members of the\nUnited Nations.\nI must also point out that my country is being\nsubjected to ongoing daily aggression by American and\nBritish aircraft in the no-fly zone imposed on northern\nand southern Iraq by unilateral decision of the\nWashington and London Governments. The aircraft\nlaunching the aggression take off from their bases in\nSaudi, Kuwaiti and Turkish territory. This continuous\nmilitary action, which violates the integrity and\nsovereignty of Iraq's airspace, has no basis in law or in\nany binding resolution adopted by any competent organ\nof the United Nations. It constitutes instead an\nillegitimate unilateral action undertaken by the United\nStates of America and the United Kingdom.\nThese belligerent acts constitute both interference\nin the internal affairs of Iraq and ongoing military\naggression against Iraq through the imposition of the\ntwo no-fly zones. The illegal character of the\nimposition of those two no-fly zones has been\nconfirmed by official statements issued by the Russian\nFederation, France and China, which have from the\nvery outset declared their position that the imposition\nof those zones has no basis in law. This position is also\nsupported by a former Secretary-General of the United\nNations who, in his book entitled Unvanquished: a\nU.S.-U.N. Saga, makes it clear that the American claim\nthat Security Council resolution 688 (1991) authorizes\nthe launching of attacks against Iraq in order to enforce\nthe no-fly zone is baseless and that the enforcement of\nthe no-fly zones, far from having been endorsed by the\nSecurity Council, is no more than a unilateral act by\nthe Governments of Washington and London.\nThe American and British acts of aggression have\ninflicted enormous material and moral losses on Iraq\nand gravely damaged its civilian infrastructure. The\nloss of human life to date has amounted to more than\n300 martyrs, while more than 900 civilians have been\nwounded. The United States of America and Britain\nbear responsibility for these acts of aggression and for\nall their consequences, in accordance with the rules of\nstate responsibility under international law. By the\nsame rules, that responsibility is shared by Saudi\nArabia, Kuwait and Turkey by virtue of their\nparticipation, support and assistance in carrying out\nthese acts of aggression. The Saudi Government\nprovides American and British aggressors with military\nfacilities and the bases of Rafha, Dhahran, Khamis\nMushait, Al-Jauf and Tabuk, from which scores of\nAmerican and British planes take off to attack Iraq. In\nKuwait, the rulers provide services, facilities and\nfinancing to the American and British aggressors at the\nair bases of Ali Al Salim and Ahmed Al Jaber.\nIraq has discharged its obligations under relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. Consequently, the logical\nresult would be for the embargo imposed on Iraq to be\nlifted. Moreover, the Charter requires that the\nAmerican-British aggression against Iraq be\ncondemned and that its perpetrators and those who\nparticipate in it \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey \u2014\nbear the international responsibility, with all its legal\nimplications.\nWe cannot, under any circumstances, deal with an\nunjust position that ignores the record of our fulfilment\nof our obligations and that denies us our legitimate\nright to have the embargo lifted, as required by the\nCharter and the correct interpretation of relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. A flagrant example of\nhow the record of the fulfilment of our obligations has\nbeen flouted and how our right to have the embargo\nlifted has been denied is to be found in the\n\n\nunderhanded way by which the United States of\nAmerica and Britain have made Security Council\nresolution 1284 (1999) a vehicle for defrauding Iraq of\nits rights and for misrepresenting its full discharge of\nits obligations under relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including in particular resolution 687\n(1991). Resolution 1284 (1999) does not represent a\nsolution at all, nor is it, in essence, anything other than\na deliberate ploy to further American anti-Iraq policy,\nas embodied in the indefinite perpetuation of the\nembargo. We have therefore clearly declared that we\nshall have nothing to do with that resolution.\nThe Middle East region is suffering from a grave\nsituation caused by the fact that the Zionist entity that\noccupies the Arab Palestinian territories possesses a\nhuge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction of all\nkinds \u2014 nuclear, chemical and biological \u2014 and longrange ballistic missiles. The Zionist entity occupying\nArab Palestine refuses to accede to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and refuses to\nplace all its nuclear installations under the\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nBesides being a threat to peace and security in the\nMiddle East region and the world, such a position\nexposes the double standard applied by the United\nStates, which at once arms the Zionist entity and gives\nit unlimited support and deliberately ignores the\nprovisions of paragraph 14 of Security Council\nresolution 687 (1991). This paragraph specifies that the\nmeasures imposed on Iraq should be applied to other\ncountries in the region in order to make the Middle\nEast a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and of\nall systems of delivery of such weapons, as well as to\npursue the goal of imposing international prohibitions\nagainst chemical weapons. The Security Council has\ntaken no action in this regard, despite the fact that Iraq\nhas implemented all the required measures.\nConsequently, the way in which the Security Council\nhas acted under American pressure in this context is a\nflagrant example of a double-standard policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to join the other\ndelegations here in congratulating you, Mr. President,\non your election as President of the General Assembly.\nMay I also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab who, through his experience and\ndiplomatic skills, guided the fifty-fourth session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. I wish to express our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, under whose\nguidance and with whose expertise the Organization\nhas been moving ahead in the attainment of its goals.\nMay I also extend a warm welcome to Tuvalu, the\nnewest Member of the United Nations. For many years\nMalta and Tuvalu have cooperated as joint members of\nthe Commonwealth.\nThis is an auspicious occasion, not merely\nbecause the General Assembly is the most widely\nrepresentative group of the world's peoples, but also\nsince it comes at a time when we are poised on the\nedge of a new dawn, a new beginning. Only last week\nwe saw and heard the heads of State or Government of\ncountries the world over reaffirm their faith in the\nOrganization and its Charter as indispensable\nfoundations of a more peaceful, prosperous and just\nworld. It was a renewed commitment to make the\nUnited Nations a more effective instrument in the\nhands of the world's people. This is a weighty\nundertaking, and one which may well benefit from a re-\nexamination of the experience acquired during the past\n55 years of the United Nations existence.\nAs we are all no doubt aware, the United Nations\nhas been instrumental in fostering a culture of\npartnership among States. Indeed, we meet here today\nin the understanding that this culture of partnership\nmust continue to constitute the basis for humanity's\nprogress. This is more than just a vision for the future;\nit is the road map for the way forward based on a\nprogramme of action that has weathered the\nvicissitudes of time and withstood test after test ever\nsince its adoption in San Francisco over half a century\nago. It is a noble endeavour that has survived in the\nface of adversity, that has experienced occasional\nsetbacks, but that has also registered more than a fair\nshare of success.\nAided by its long-standing commitment to\ndialogue, the United Nations has positively contributed\nto the process of decolonization that has so decisively\ntransformed the political map of the world. It has\npromoted a culture of dialogue and cooperation in the\nmost diverse fields of human existence and endeavour,\n28\n\nranging from health care to food supplies, from literacy\nto urban development, from historical heritage to the\nnatural environment, and, more recently, improving the\nstatus of women.\nNevertheless, in the crucial area of the\nmaintenance of peace and security \u2014 the very raison\nd'\u00eatre for the creation of the United Nations \u2014 the\nOrganization, for various reasons, has at times been\nunable to fulfil this mandate. This is reflected in the\npainfully honest reports of the Organization's failings\nin Rwanda and Srebrenica. These negative experiences\nprovided the backdrop to the recently published\nBrahimi report.\nThe Government of Malta shares the concerns\nexpressed in this report, which cautions in particular\nagainst entrusting the United Nations Secretariat with\nunrealistic mandates while not providing it with\ncommensurate resources. We look forward to early\nconsultations on the manner in which the\nrecommendations of the report may be pursued.\nWe have given serious consideration to\naddressing these concerns and have decided to match\nthem with a specific commitment. It was in this\nconnection that my Prime Minister last week, in his\naddress to the Millennium Summit, signalled Malta's\nintention to significantly increase its peacekeeping\ncontribution through a voluntary move from group C to\ngroup B.\nIt will be recalled that over the years Malta has\nmade other contributions towards promoting the global\nobjectives of the United Nations. These have included\na number of initiatives not designed in the narrow\nnational interest but in the interest of the international\ncommunity as a whole.\nMay I recall in this connection Malta's proposals\nto the General Assembly relating to the seabed and the\nocean floor, which led to the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, to the question of\nthe ageing and to the initiative relating to climate\nchange. These initiatives alerted the United Nations to\nexamine the far-reaching, serious implications of those\nissues and thereby enabled it to adopt timely measures,\nwhich, as can be appreciated, have helped defuse, and\ncontinue to defuse, potential political tensions,\nenvironmental dangers and social complications.\nThe progress recorded in the United Nations over\nthe years is impressive and a source of great\nsatisfaction to my Government. The goals achieved,\nwhile relevant the world over, lie extremely close to\nthe heart of the area of which Malta forms part. The\nMediterranean can be seen as a microcosm of the larger\nworld stage. We have faced, and continue to face,\nintermittent conflicts and wide gaps in development\nlevels. The shortage of freshwater resources in some\nareas is potentially another serious challenge. Despite\nbeing a sea of promise and great opportunity, the\nMediterranean continues to challenge our political will\nto nurture long-lasting stability. Security in the\nMediterranean requires committed and quiet\ndetermination to identify both the problems and, more\nimportantly, the solutions. The element of dialogue that\nhas so often underscored the work of the United\nNations has brought much to the enhancement of\nrelations between the States of that part of the world.\nMalta indeed not only shares the aspirations of the\nUnited Nations in this regard, but has striven\nthroughout the years to ensure that they become an\nintegral part of all dealings in the Mediterranean.\nTogether with the rest of the world community,\nMalta welcomes the progress made in the Middle East\npeace process. We hope that the same determination as\nhelped overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles\nin the past will continue to inspire the protagonists to\nwork for the goal of a just and permanent peace and\nsecurity for our Middle Eastern neighbours.\nThe Balkans are another part of the\nMediterranean area that also continues to challenge the\nwill of the international community in its quest for\nstability and its determination to ensure that full\nrespect for human rights becomes the common heritage\nof all peoples who live there. In this respect, every\npositive development is of the utmost importance.\nFor over 25 years the situation in Cyprus has\nremained a cause of concern. We therefore earnestly\nhope that an early settlement of the Cyprus question\nwill be found. In this connection, the Maltese\nGovernment reiterates its full support for the Secretary-\nGeneral's efforts to find a solution on the basis of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe Mediterranean has also been witness to the\ncruel and merciless trafficking in human beings, a\ntragic and criminal exploitation of the misery of others.\nWe welcome the initiatives taken by the Italian\nGovernment at the Conference for Development and\nSecurity in the Adriatic and the Ionian held in Ancona\n29\n\nlast May. The broad parameters established in that\nConference can indeed serve as a prototype for similar\nagreements elsewhere.\nMalta has always been acutely aware of the role it\ncan play in bridging the divides of this complex area.\nSuccessive Maltese Governments have consistently\npromoted efforts to develop and consolidate\ncooperation between the littoral States of the\nMediterranean at both a bilateral and multilateral level.\nIn the mid-1970s we hosted the preparatory\nmeeting that led to the Barcelona Convention that\nlaunched the Mediterranean Action Plan. In 1995 we\nargued in favour of a Mediterranean stability pact for\nthe region, a proposal which is now taking shape in the\nform of a Euro-Mediterranean charter for peace and\nstability. In 1997, at a time of difficult political\ncircumstances for the area, Malta hosted the second\nEuro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, following\nthat of Barcelona in 1995. More recently, Malta was\none of the prime movers behind a recommendation\nwithin the Conference on Security Co-operation in the\nMediterranean process of the Inter-Parliamentary\nUnion for the establishment of a Parliamentary\nAssembly of Mediterranean States. These initiatives\nserve to underscore our commitment to the\nachievement of peace, prosperity and a just solution to\nthe demands of the Mediterranean people.\nWe believe, however, that on our own we can\nonly do so much, and that therefore the principle of\nmultilateralism, as enshrined in last week's\nDeclaration, must be fully respected and observed. As\nwas stated in the final Declaration of the Millennium\nSummit, the management of economic and social\ndevelopment, as well as the risks and threats to\ninternational peace and security, must be a shared\nresponsibility. Freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance\nand respect for the natural environment are goals\ntowards which our combined energies and efforts\nshould be channelled.\nIt is for these reasons that we have chosen to\npursue the path of membership of the European Union.\nIt is the common values and principles that inspired the\nbirth of what is today the European Union that inspire\nus in our quest. This is because it is through\nmembership that we feel we can best play our part on\nthe international stage, and contribute more effectively\ntowards the promotion of peace and progress in the\nMediterranean. We feel that our capabilities to play a\nuseful role may be greatly enhanced from within the\nEuropean Union. This is not solely for our own local\nbenefit. We believe that our membership will give the\nEuropean Union an added dimension that will serve to\nbenefit both the northern and southern shores of the\nMediterranean littoral.\nGood governance is what we, the peoples of the\nUnited Nations, seek at a national, regional and\ninternational level. Yet good governance is exactly\nwhat is threatened by a number of phenomena that\nplague our contemporary society. Ranging from the\ntrafficking of drugs to that of armaments and human\nbeings, international organized crime threatens the very\ntexture of law and order through abuse, corruption and\nviolence. The growth of related crimes also alerts us to\nthe need for ever closer international cooperation.\nAs much as the socio-political environment\nrequires constant vigilance, so too does the physical\nenvironment. Global warming remains a constant\nconcern, and we urge that the undertakings to ward off\nthe further degradation of the ozone layer be fully\nadhered to.\nQuestions of disarmament, extreme poverty, the\nstriking proportions of HIV and AIDS and the\nvulnerability of the disabled, infirm and those\ndiscriminated against on the basis of race or religion\nremain ever present on the world agenda. At no time\nmust we lose sight of these very real issues faced by a\nhuge proportion of the world's people. We must, in\npursuit of a more caring and equitable society, seek to\nunderstand and subsequently meet the needs of these\nvulnerable members of society. It is not sufficient to\npromote global e-commerce and ever new economic\nworld orders if we do not also tackle the root causes of\nmany of the problems in the developing world. We\nneed to convert these enormous challenges into\nmoments of opportunity. We need to harness the\npositive forces of globalization, the new knowledge-\nbased economy and the opportunities of trade to bridge\nthe divides that persist throughout each and every\ncontinent.\nThe United Nations has taken a leading role in\npromoting international understanding and agreement\nin relation to these varied and diverse areas. Indeed, a\nwide spectrum of activities, international agreements\nand agencies of the United Nations have been put to\ngood use in the creation of the impetus necessary for\nchange. We must continue in our endeavours to bring\n30\n\npeople to a common understanding of how this can best\nbe consolidated, not solely through dialogue, but\nthrough concrete actions that must necessarily follow.\nThe number and variety of tasks that face the\nUnited Nations are by no means small. Malta is,\nhowever, convinced that the United Nations is the\nforum best positioned to provide workable options and\nlong-term solutions to the problems that plague the\nworld and man's relations with it. Last week's\nMillennium Summit clearly demonstrated the\ninternational community's renewed commitment to this\nunique and indispensable Organization and its vital role\nin the maintenance of peace and stability, the\neradication of poverty, ignorance and disease and the\nprotection of the global environment.\nIf the Millennium Summit charted our course\ntowards making the United Nations a more effective\ninstrument in the hands of the world's peoples, then the\nMillennium Assembly must come to be remembered as\nthe point in time when the first major decisions were\ntaken to place the Organization firmly on this chosen\npath. I hope that these will not be merely empty\ndeclarations of intent, but that each Government and\neach of us here present today will endeavour to better\nour corner of the globe as best we can. My Government\nremains determined to play its part."

Let us\npay him the tribute he richly deserves for the success of\nthe Millennium Summit, which proved to the world\nthat Mr. Kofi Annan has achieved what he set out to\ndo, i.e. to restore the dignity and prestige of the\nOrganization as the indispensable forum for\nconcertation and concord, and as a peacemaker and\npromoter of progress for all.\nI would also like, finally, to welcome the\ndelegation of Tuvalu, which has become the 189th\nMember State.\nHistory will recall that, in the framework of the\nMillennium Assembly, the Millennium Summit\ngathered in this venerable Hall our illustrious heads of\nState and Government, who examined the role our\nOrganization is being called upon to play in the twenty-\nfirst century. These eminent dignitaries thereby gave us\na new vision of how to take up the great challenge\nposed by globalization  by promoting a new human\ninternational order.\nThe first half of the year 2000 was also an intense\ntime for the United Nations and the international\ncommunity, what with the holding in June of two major\nspecial sessions of the General Assembly. These two\nspecial sessions  following up on and reviewing the\nFourth World Conference on Women, which was held\nin Beijing, and the World Summit on Social\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen  produced\nencouraging results. My delegation cherishes the hope\nthat these sessions will contribute to strengthening the\nstatus and role of women in our respective societies by\npromoting gender equality, the eradication both of\npoverty and of its feminization, and the promotion of\nproductive employment and social integration. If we do\nnot fully respect women and recognize their essential\ncontribution to the progress of our societies, our world\nis going continue walking on one leg, when obviously\nthere are two.\nDespite these new perspectives and their\nhistorical importance, this session is not without causes\nfor grave concern and even despair. Despite our\nongoing efforts, a number of conflicts are persisting\nand deepening. From Sierra Leone to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, from Angola to the border\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, from Burundi to\nSomalia, from Kosovo to East Timor we hear the\nechoes and see the images and the horror of conflict\nzones.\nSenegal would like to here voice its great concern\nat what is occurring between Guinea and Liberia. Our\ncountry calls upon these two countries to carry out a\nbrotherly, peaceful dialogue in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We make the\nsame urgent request of the political leaders of C\u00d9te\nd'Ivoire, urging them to find a political compromise\nthat will enable the great country, C\u00d9te d'Ivoire, which\nwe love so well, to live in peace, stability and unity.\nIt is in view of such situations that regional\norganizations, aware of the fact that Africa is paying a\nhigh price for all these conflicts, have resolutely\nundertaken to seek political solutions, with the help of\nthe international community. This is what occurred in\n9\n\nSierra Leone, where the Lom\u00c8 Agreement, reached\nunder the aegis of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, allowed us to nourish hopes for a\nlasting solution. The same can be said for Angola and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the two\nLusaka agreements of 1994 and 1999, respectively.\nUnfortunately, these praiseworthy efforts often run up\nagainst a lack of commitment on the part of rebel\nmovements or armed factions to the very agreements\nthat they themselves have signed.\nHowever, in spite of this bleak situation, we\nshould not give in to discouragement. As the\nconstitution of the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization says,\n`since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\nconstructed'.\nWe have a moral obligation to continue to act with\ndetermination and perseverance, bringing the\nprotagonists of these conflicts to recognize and\nembrace a culture of peace that will allow people to\nprogress, committing themselves to forgiveness and\nreconciliation.\nIt is in this context that my delegation\ncongratulates the members of the Panel on United\nNations Peace Operations for its recent report. The\nsubtlety of the analyses and the relevance of the\nrecommendations contained therein open new\nperspectives for the United Nations in terms of\nreducing tensions and wisely managing conflicts.\nSenegal attaches great importance to the consideration\nof the Panel's recommendations, so that a new\npeacekeeping doctrine can be established.\nExperience has shown us that the language of\nweapons, as well as feeding conflicts by illicitly\nexploiting natural resources, cannot produce humanly\nacceptable solutions. The only possible solution is one\nthat allows peoples to fully enjoy conditions of peace\nand economic and social security.\nIt is in this context that the Constitutive Act of\nthe African Union was signed on 12 July at Lom\u00c8, at\nthe thirty-sixth session of the Assembly of Heads of\nState and Government of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), committing Africa to resolutely engage\nin a spirit of unity in finding African solutions to its\nmany challenges. This is why the President of the\nRepublic, Ma\u00d3tre Abdoulaye Wade, a convinced Pan-\nAfricanist, led to its completion the procedure making\nSenegal the second African country to ratify this\nhistoric Act.\nBefore Lom\u00c8, Africa had already taken another\nmeaningful decision, at the Algiers summit, by\nproclaiming 2000 the year of peace and concord on the\ncontinent.\nThe advent of democracy in Guinea-Bissau and\nthe efforts to bring about a gradual return to normality\nin the life of its citizens and institutions are part of the\nresponse to the demand for democracy. Is not the\nrecent peaceful political transition in my country,\nwhich brought Ma\u00d3tre Abdoulaye Wade to the highest\nexecutive position, further proof that our peoples can\nchoose their leaders in a sovereign and democratic\nfashion?\nI now turn to the Middle East, where my country\nhas noted the major breakthroughs this year in the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, at the heart of which is the\nquestion of Palestine. The evacuation of Lebanese\nterritory by the Israeli occupation troops and the long\nand delicate negotiations at Camp David between\nPalestinians and Israelis give rise to hope, despite the\ntalks' relative failure. Our hopes include that of seeing\nthe creation of a space of lasting cohabitation between\nIsraelis and Palestinians, as well as between Israel and\nits Arab neighbours, with respect for the dignity and\nrights of the peoples and States of the region.\nIt is only right to pay tribute to all the participants\nin this positive development, in particular the\nPalestinian and Israeli leadership, who, thanks to their\npolitical courage and sense of history have opened this\navenue towards a new dawn of peace in the Middle\nEast. Senegal reiterates its constant support for\nPresident Yasser Arafat and its admiration for his\ncourage and political lucidity. He has never dropped\nthe olive branch to which he referred here in 1974. Our\ncongratulations also go to President Clinton. We\nexpress our support for the Prime Minister of Israel,\nMr. Barak, as well as the other actors in the peace\nprocess, whom we commend for their determined\nefforts in search of peace and reconciliation between\nall the peoples of the region. We hope that their efforts\nwill soon be crowned with positive results.\nThe year 2000 was also marked by a relaxation of\nmajor importance in relations between the two Koreas.\nThis highly significant political development will\ncontribute to consolidating peace and security on the\n10\n\nKorean peninsula and in the entire subregion of South-\nEast Asia. The United Nations, universal symbol of the\npeoples' aspirations to peace and security, should make\na significant contribution to protecting the ongoing\nprocess between the two Koreas.\nIt is in the name of rapprochement between\npeoples and the principle of universality that my\ncountry supports the request of the Republic of China\non Taiwan to rejoin the concert of free nations within\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies, and\nthus to participate in the consolidation of international\npeace and security.\nWith the completion last June of the definition of\nwhat constitutes crimes, and of the rules of procedure\nand testimony, the Preparatory Committee for the\nInternational Criminal Court passed a significant\nmilestone in the establishment of this important legal\ninstitution. This progress and the new ratifications of\nthe Rome Statute, are encouraging signs of the\ninternational community's rejection of criminal faits\naccomplis, injustice and impunity. I repeat Senegal's\nsupport for the process, which should bring about a\ncredible, independent and efficient International\nCriminal Court.\nBuilding and consolidating peace also, and above\nall, means to meeting the chronic challenge of\nunderdevelopment, for, as we know, development is\nanother name for peace. Twenty years ago the North-\nSouth Commission on development problems strongly\nemphasized that where hunger reigns there cannot be\npeace, and that whoever wants to banish war must also\nbanish poverty. Yet today, despite that warning, poverty\npersists and grows, although we have the means to\nfight it.\nWe dare to hope that next year's high-level\nmeeting on financing development will be a unique\nopportunity to examine in depth the causes of the\ndecline in official development assistance and will find\nways and means to redress this worrying situation: the\nurgent need to deal with the debt crisis, rebalance\ninternational trade and deal with the risks of\nmarginalization resulting from globalization.\nI recall President Wade's appeal, warmly received\nby his peers, for an in-depth analysis of the African\ndebt and for a world summit on globalization to correct\nits injustices and contradictions.\nI would also like to reiterate Senegal's support for\ncooperation frameworks such as the EU-ACP\nagreements and the Tokyo International Conference on\nAfrican Development (TICAD). We hope that recent\ndecisions made at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa, as well\nas the American initiative, `African Growth and\nOpportunity Act', will be the starting point of a new\npartnership based on solidarity and mutual benefits.\nDevelopment is inseparable from the promotion\nand protection of human rights, the rule of law and\nsound governance, principles to which my country\nremains firmly attached. By creating a human rights\nunit attached to the presidency of the Republic, the\nHead of State has shown his personal commitment to\nthe protection and promoting of citizens' fundamental\nrights and freedoms by the Administration and at every\nlevel of public life. Senegal will continue to make\nevery effort to consolidate the foundations of the rule\nof law, to protect human rights defenders and to honour\nthe obligations it assumes by its adherence to\ninternational legal instruments on human rights.\nWith the momentum created by the success in\nSenegal of the peaceful change-over of political power\nand a peaceful transition, my country feels equipped to\ncontinue to defend the image of a serene Africa, a\nmature Africa, a tolerant and democratic Africa.\nToday, more than ever, our people wonder about\nthe political will and capacity of our States to take\nadvantage of the current international climate, which\nseems propitious for a dynamic of peace and for taking\ninto account the human dimension in technological\ninnovations.\nIn Africa our thoughts often turn to the anguish\ncaused by the ravages of HIV/AIDS, although with a\nl.6 per cent rate, Senegal strengthens the hope that this\nscourge will be defeated.\nFifty years ago, at the end of the planetary\nnightmare of the Second World War, a hope and\nconviction were born: that men and women throughout\nthe world would do everything possible to prevent new\nwars from breaking out and would work together to\nensure respect for the right of each individual to\nfreedom, justice and progress. Today the intellectual\nand material resources available to humanity should\nlogically be increasingly dedicated to building a future\nof peace, progress and shared happiness. But it must be\nsaid that for the great majority of peoples and nations\n\n\nthe international situation does not meet their\naspirations to peace and progress.\nIn the final analysis, to build a pan-human society\nwhich is at peace with itself we must unite all our\nenergies to create the basis for more human\ndevelopment with greater solidarity, bringing new hope\nto future generations. This is the importance and\nmeaning of the Millennium Summit, in urging us to\nmake a collective contribution to strengthening our\nOrganization for the salvation of humanity.\nAs it has become a tradition in my country, I will\nleave the last word of my statement to the inimitable\nSenegal-Cameroon poet of love and hope, David\nMandesijop, who said:\n`Hope lived in us as in a citadel.'\nI hope the aspiration to a more just and happy\nworld will live within us all as an impregnable citadel\nso, as Mandesijop said, that spring will grow beneath\nour footsteps."

        "file_text": "I\nwish to extend my congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri\nand his country, Finland, on his election to the high\noffice of President of the fifty-fifth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. His experience and\nthe respect accorded him by the international\ncommunity will certainly ensure that the matters of this\nAssembly are conducted with efficiency and urgency.\nI should also like to express my delegation's\nappreciation for the very competent manner in which\nhis predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, presided over\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nThe recently concluded Millennium Assembly\nwas exceptional for the number of world leaders who\nattended that historic event. The Declaration adopted at\nits conclusion sets forth laudable values and principles\nfor the guidance of the international community.\nFurther, it documents the goals that must be achieved\nand the challenges that must be met if we are to\nsucceed in creating a better world for all citizens of our\nglobal village.\nBut the Declaration is also a strikingly sad\nchronicle of the deplorable and degrading conditions\nthat affect the lives of most of the world's population:\ndebilitating and abject poverty, economic deprivation,\noppression and injustice, inadequate or non-existent\nhealth care in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,\nvictimization on the basis of ethnicity, children without\neducational opportunities but with daily experiences of\nhunger, lack of fresh and clean water and uncertain\nprospects of ever escaping depressing and unhealthy\nsurroundings.\nThese conditions were not newly discovered\nimmediately prior to the Millennium Assembly. Indeed,\nthey have been the subjects of United Nations\nresolutions at successive sessions of the General\nAssembly in the past. While there has been some\namelioration in some areas, largely through the efforts\nof the United Nations and its agencies, there has been\nnoticeable deterioration in others. The challenge that\nfaces the United Nations, and the international\ncommunity in particular, is to go beyond the concerns\nexpressed, the affirmations and resolutions and\ndemonstrate in tangible and effective ways a\ncommitment to serious engagement in a concerted\neffort to bring about meaningful change in the lives of\nthe many poor people among us.\nAs the Commonwealth of Dominica and other\nsmall States embark on the difficult road of raising the\nliving standards of their citizens, we find the task made\nmuch more difficult by the negative impact of the twin\nforces of liberalization and globalization. Globalization\nand trade liberalization operate to the advantage of the\nrich and developed countries, which have the requisite\ninstitutional and human resource capability and are\nwell placed to reap the benefits and rewards that accrue\nfrom these processes. For small countries like my own,\nwith very limited ability to carry out proper\nexploitation and to deal with current economic forces,\nglobalization has resulted in greater inequality and\nmarginalization and a widening gap between rich and\npoor nations.\nThat is the unavoidable result, since the\nproverbial levelling of the playing field is in reality\nnon-existent. And the countries benefiting from the\nprocess seem to have no interest in making sure that all\nnations, rich and poor, have an equal opportunity to be\nengaged in harnessing the opportunities presented by\neconomic and scientific innovations and by the\nrevolution in telecommunications and information\ntechnology.\nCompounding this problem is the disturbing and\nalarming tendency of the rich and powerful to fashion\ninternational trade rules and organizations with the\npurported intention of liberalizing trade but which in\nreality have resulted in creating a decisive edge in\ninternational commerce for themselves. Those who\nadvance the concept of free trade as the most efficient\nvehicle for income enhancement in developing\ncountries continue to cling to protectionist policies for\nselected items of trade while simultaneously engaged\nin a determined effort to deny market access that\n30\n\nprovides some small measure of special or differential\ntreatment for our exports.\nA clear case in point is the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) and what it represents for the\nCommonwealth of Dominica and other small banana-\nproducing countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\nWe have traditionally, over a period of 50 years,\nexported our bananas to the European market, under\nspecial rules that made allowances for the particular\ncircumstances of small State size, or difficult terrain\nand high cost of production. In the interpretation and\napplication of its rules, the WTO is not minded to craft\ndecisions that promote equity and fairness among\nparties of unequal standing. But that is the logical\nexpectation for an organization that was evidently\nestablished to decide disputes among equals and on\nwhose dispute panels, particularly at the appellate\nlevels, the advanced countries are predominantly\nrepresented.\nThe ruling of the WTO in the dispute with respect\nto the European Union's banana import regime has\nresulted in economic uncertainty in the Windward\nIslands, a situation made all the more damaging by the\ncontinuing inability of the parties to agree on a formula\nfor making the regime compatible with WTO rules. My\ncountry holds firmly to the view that adopting either of\nthe current proposals being considered to resolve the\nbanana dispute would result in economic stagnation\nand dislocation for the banana-exporting countries in\nthe Caribbean, particularly of course in the Eastern\nCaribbean, as well as Jamaica, Belize and Suriname.\nWe therefore urge the parties concerned to\nexplore a compromise solution that would allow\nDominica and other banana-producing countries to\ncontinue to export bananas to the European Union at\nprices that are fair and reasonable. Equal trade and fair\nprices are what we ask for, not handouts. Our suffering\nfarmers ask for no more. Meanwhile, our\ndiversification efforts are being accelerated while we\nstand square and firm in support of our farmers. My\ndelegation calls for a speedy resolution to this impasse,\nas we view the application by the United States of trade\nsanctions against some members of the European\nUnion as counterproductive and not conducive to\nreaching a fair and negotiated settlement. The\nthreatened carousel approach to imposing those\nsanctions is punitive and a pressure device, unfair to\nthose European countries.\nAt a time when there is a real prospect of our\nlosing our market in bananas and as we explore avenue\nof economic diversification, our fledgling financial\nservices sector has been subjected, since June last year,\nto a potentially serious attack from the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The\nOECD alleged that several Caribbean countries,\nincluding my own, are guilty of establishing and\nmaintaining tax havens. These countries were also\ncondemned for having competitive tax regimes and for\ntheir unwillingness to undertake to eliminate policies\nthat the OECD unilaterally determined to be harmful to\nits members. The Commonwealth of Dominica believes\nthat the unilateral formulations contained in the OECD\nreport are inconsistent with international practice and\nare designed to impede the development of the\ncompetitive capacity of the Caribbean jurisdictions in\nthe provision of offshore financial services. We believe\nthat international rules and practices must evolve from\ngenuine consultative practices and must be\ndemocratically applied on the basis of accepted\nprinciples and norms in the international community.\nWe take the view that the report is simply one more\nexample of small developing States being coerced into\ncomplying with rules, standards and practices\npromulgated by advanced States to advance the\nprotection of their economies while ours continue to\ndeteriorate.\nWe are committed to the establishment of\nadequate legislative and regulatory frameworks\nnecessary to insulate the sector from illegal activities.\nWe are also ready to work with the Financial Action\nTask Force to address any legitimate concerns they\nmay have. However, we do not intend to surrender our\nsovereign right to act in the best economic interests of\nour citizens, nor will we be deterred from doing so by\nthreats of any kind from any quarter.\nWhile our efforts at improving our export\nearnings are being undermined and our financial\nservices sector comes under serious scrutiny, the\ndevelopment programmes and strategies of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica continue to be affected by\nthe continuing decline in official development\nassistance (ODA). The expectation that foreign direct\ninvestment would bridge the gap has not materialized,\nnotwithstanding the strides we have made in providing\na climate of good governance, openness and stable,\ndemocratic practice, which, we were told, were the\nprerequisites for investment development.\n31\n\nThe simple truth is that the more advanced\ndeveloping countries have benefited disproportionately\nfrom the tremendous increase in foreign direct\ninvestment over the last decade, with the small and less\ndeveloped States receiving little or nothing at all. There\nmust be an understanding that if small developing\nStates are to embark successfully on the road to\nsustainable economic development without the benefit\nof foreign direct investment, official development\nassistance is indispensable to that process and the\ndeclining trend in the provision of official development\nassistance must perforce and necessarily be reversed.\nThe most deadly threat to our human resource\nbase and to our population at large is the contagion of\nHIV/AIDS. This disease takes a heavy toll not only in\nlives but also in social and economic terms, and the\ncountries most affected are the least able to deal with\nthe consequences. Statistics from the recent world\nconference on HIV/AIDS indicate that sub-Saharan\nAfrica has the highest rate of infection in the world,\nwith the Caribbean coming a close second.\nThis is not an African or Caribbean problem,\nhowever. Global in scope and impact, the HIV/AIDS\npandemic warrants global attention and action. The\nCommonwealth of Dominica believes that as a first\nimmediate step there must come into being a\npartnership between the pharmaceutical manufacturers\nand the stakeholders in the international community,\nwith the express purpose of ensuring that less costly\nHIV/AIDS medication is readily available to those\nmost in need. Simultaneously, there must be increased\nefforts at raising awareness and consciousness of the\ncrisis and the preventive measures available, while a\ndedicated commitment to the development of an AIDS\nvaccine must be matched by increasing funding for\nresearch.\nIn 1994, the Commonwealth of Dominica\nparticipated in the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and there reaffirmed our commitment to\nsustainable development programmes that enhance the\nquality of the lives of peoples, including their health,\nwell-being and safety.\nThe task ahead of us is to ensure that the\nmeasures and the resources of small island developing\nStates \u2014 the oceans, coastal environments,\nbiodiversity and human resources \u2014 are utilized in a\nsustainable manner that will be to the advantage of\npresent and future generations, as it is our\nresponsibility to preserve them. My country shares\nwith small island developing States the problem of the\nsafe disposal of solid and liquid waste. It has been\nrecognized that this lack of capacity results in marine\npollution and coastal degradation. Our position is\nconsistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment\nand Development that small island developing States\nwill be constrained in meeting the challenges that face\nthem if they do not have the cooperation and assistance\nof the international community.\nAs the United Nations meets for the first General\nAssembly of the new century, the delegation of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica wishes to address once\nagain the issue of democratic representation in the\nUnited Nations for the people of the Republic of China.\nIt is a concern to my delegation that the Republic of\nChina, with a democratically elected Government and a\npopulation of 23 million, is unable to participate in our\ndeliberations.\nThe Republic of China is a model of democracy\nin Asia and is more than able to carry out the\nobligations of our Charter. Over the past few decades,\nthe Republic of China has proved itself to be a good\nworld citizen, using its own economic development to\ngenerously assist in alleviating debilitating poverty\nthrough economic assistance programmes in many\nneedy developing countries. The situation of the\nRepublic of China should be addressed to ensure\nparticipation in the work and activities of our\norganization and its agencies as a valued member of\nthe international community.\nMy delegation calls for this fifty-fifth General\nAssembly to be a new beginning for the United\nNations. Rejuvenated by the unprecedented sharing of\nvision that we witnessed during the Millennium\nSummit, let us utilize those ideas, proposals,\nsuggestions and criticisms to chart a way forward for\nthe United Nations that will allow it to meet the needs\nand challenges of this new century.\nLet us look towards a new vision for a future that\nwill incorporate the weak and strong, the rich and poor\nand the developed and developing world, so that none\nwill be marginalized. Let us collaborate in achieving\nthe objectives of the Secretary-General's millennium\nreport of freedom from fear and freedom from want.\nLet us include all Members \u2014 developed, developing\nand least developed \u2014 in the decision-making process\n32\n\nso that all can share a future based on the premises laid\ndown by our forebears in the Charter of the United\nNations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me to share\nwith Mr. Holkeri the joy of his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. He can rest assured of Nigeria's support and\ncooperation. May I also express the same sentiment on\nbehalf of the Group of 77. To his predecessor and my\ncolleague, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of\nNamibia, Nigeria and the Group of 77 wish to express\nour pride in and appreciation of the most distinguished\nmanner in which he discharged his duties as the\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session. We are indeed\nvery proud of him.\nMay I also commend the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, for the manner in which he has piloted\n20\n\nand continues to manage the affairs of the United\nNations. I would also like to thank him for his\nmillennium report, which has identified some of the\npressing problems and challenges facing mankind.\nIn the past few weeks here at the United Nations\na lot of reflection and deep thinking have taken place\namong world leaders, all in an attempt to more\ncoherently define the future. The end of one\nmillennium and the beginning of another warrant all\nthese efforts to find such a purposeful definition. Fifty-\nfive years ago the United Nations was formed as a\nglobal bulwark against armed conflict on a world scale,\nsuch as the Second World War. Over the years its\nmandate of preserving international security has\nbroadened from strictly preventing such armed conflict\nto cover also fundamental issues of socio-economic\nsecurity for humanity. For example, in many of the\ndeveloping countries the United Nations manifests its\npotential more through the United Nations Children's\nFund, the World Health Organization, the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization and other agencies than in Security\nCouncil resolutions, comparatively speaking. It is also\nfrom the activities of these United Nations agencies\nthat the underprivileged sectors of poor countries\nbenefit directly, activities from which these same\ncountries, including those in Africa, have come to\nimbibe the idealism regarding the United Nations\nability to harmonize the totality of progress to the\nbenefit of all human stakeholders.\nTo a great extent this idealism has not been\nmisplaced. In fact, at no other time has the possibility\nof a global family been more real than now. This\nprospect must, I am sure, have been very exciting to so\nmany of us and must have been the basis for hailing the\nUnited Nations system for its own role in and\ncontribution to these achievements. But as my\nPresident, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, aptly observed\nhere less than two weeks ago,\n\u201cAlthough the world has generally become a\nsafer place to live in, thanks to the contributions\nof the United Nations, we must all feel deeply\nworried that the message of hope which the\nOrganization has been spreading is yet to reach\nthe millions of humankind for whom it is\nintended. For the vast majority of our peoples,\ngrinding poverty has remained a fact of their\neveryday existence.\u201d (A/55/PV.7)\nThis reality of grinding poverty has raised\nconsiderable apprehension in some United Nations\nMember States about their fate in the new millennium.\nThere is a clear basis for this apprehension, given that\nthe past millennium was, for most of these countries,\ncharacterized by extreme poverty, heavy indebtedness,\nwars of attrition and the resultant mass ordeal and\nanguish for both their immediate and distant victims,\nabsolute vulnerability to epidemics such as cholera,\nmalaria and typhoid, the rage of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, the scourge of natural disasters, serious\ntechnological backwardness and a digital divide\nbetween them and the others, and by profound\neconomic decline and infrastructural decay. In the last\ndecade in particular, whatever hopes were raised by\nsome initiatives aimed at mitigating African and third\nworld underdevelopment have dwindled to nothing as\nthe world emerged from the cold war into a more\nproblematic concept called globalization.\nThe globe, which is the symbol or logo of the\nUnited Nations, depicts humanity. From the word\n\u201cglobe\u201d has been derived a phenomenon called\nglobalization, which explicitly connotes a world\nwithout national borders, with particular reference to\ncommerce, in which humanity is one huge market.\nApart from thus unfortunately associating the noble\nand emotive word \u201chumanity\u201d with the materialism of\ncommerce and the market, globalization automatically\nraises other questions for three quarters of humanity\noutside the orbit of industrial competence.\nIn a global economy all the actors in that\neconomy should also be stakeholders. But what stake\ndoes Africa have in a global economy? Economically,\nit is heavily indebted, some of its countries committing\nup to 55 per cent of gross earnings to debt servicing\nand payment. What can the little that is left do for the\ndomestic economy? What does an economy that\nproduces virtually nothing in industrial terms have to\noffer, and, moreover, how can it compete in a global\neconomy? What is the income level of the average\nAfrican, relative to that of his or her counterparts in\nmany countries of the West, vis-\u00e0-vis the capacity to\npatronize the goods and services which globalization\noffers? How does globalization facilitate democratic\nconsolidation? How can the core values of liberal\ndemocracy, such as the rule of law, the preservation of\nhuman rights and good governance, be sustained by a\nGovernment that lacks the resources to competently\nprovide a minimum of social service delivery and thus\n21\n\nsustain legitimacy and regime credibility? In what\nways would a typical regime in Africa be able to\ncontribute its quota to democratic consolidation with\nthe debt overhang, the exchange and interest rate\npractices in the international financial architecture, the\nprices offered for raw materials relative to the prices of\nindustrial goods and services, the limited trade access\nand the conditionalities tied to loans and aid?\nAs a responsible member of the international\ncommunity and as the chair of the G-77, Nigeria is\nobliged to draw attention to the context of our present\nsituation. What is clear to me now is that the dream of\na global family cannot be attained if the present world\narchitecture of power and the reward system continues.\nThe dialogue of the Organization of African Unity, the\nNon-Aligned Movement and the G-77 with the G-8\ncountries has so far shown that a great deal can be\nachieved from that approach to the issues in question.\nAs President Obasanjo again said in a separate speech,\nit is imperative for the world to seize this moment to\nbegin to get the future right, since such a solemn\nmoment in the history of mankind as the recent\nMillennium Summit, may not always present itself. We\nare talking of dialogue that takes the issues on board in\na holistic manner, as opposed to the current practice of\nabstracting merely one or other manifestation of the\nsystem \u2014 for example, in the case of wars of attrition\nand the idea of international humanitarian intervention.\nThe debate so far has brought to the fore the\nproblem of the contradiction between sovereignty and\nintervention. Of course, nation States, even those on\nthe verge of evaporation, would be sensitive to the\nword \u201cintervention\u201d. But, more than that, discussion of\nthe issue has brought out the one-dimensional nature of\nthe treatment of some issues or problems in terms of\nwhat we include in or exclude from the definition. In\nthis particular case, the debate so far has concentrated\non war situations or armed conflicts featuring massive\nloss of life.\nWhat of other situations where loss of life is also\nof a serious magnitude but not as a result of war or\narmed conflict? What of the silent genocide occasioned\nby the HIV/AIDS pandemic, epidemics and natural\ndisasters such as famine, drought, flood, etc.? What\nabout the situation that arises when sanctions lead to\ndeaths on a serious scale? All these should find a place\nin a proper and systematic discussion of humanitarian\nintervention aimed at giving succour to those who may\nbe trapped in tragedies other than wars.\nSimilarly, is there no other way by which the\nworld can arrest the proliferation of small arms and\nlight weapons in Africa and other parts of the South?\nCertainly the world knows about the nature and types\nof weapons used in the prosecution of these wars,\nwhere they are manufactured and by whom, the\nprocesses by which they are traded and acquired and\nthe key facilitators of these processes, including\nnational governments and arms merchants. What if the\nsearch for solutions focused on these areas?\nThese and many other weighty global issues were\ndiscussed at the first ever South Summit held in\nHavana last April. That Summit was a defining\nmoment for the Group of 77 countries which pondered\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. In Havana\nthe South resolved to forge a new and meaningful\npartnership with the industrialized nations. We\ndemanded equal partnership in decision-making that\naffects the whole of humanity. That was the message\nthe leaders of the South took to the G8 Summit in\nOkinawa. The outcome of that consultation vividly\ndemonstrates that meaningful partnership is a must for\nthe new century. Certainly the interests of mankind\ncompel a more inclusive participation of all segments\nof our global community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "This is neither the place\nnor the time for me to repeat what my head of State\nand I have said in speeches regarding most of the\ncritical national, regional and international issues. On\nthose issues Namibia's position is unchanged, and my\nviews remain valid. There are, however, some specific\nmatters that I feel require reiteration. That is what I am\ngoing to do today.\nNot too long ago in these corridors, an\nunprecedented 150 heads of State and Government\nparticipated in the historic Millennium Summit, which\nwas appropriately dubbed \u201cWe the peoples: the role of\nthe United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d. The\nMillennium Declaration, which was the result of that\nconcerted effort to meet the daunting challenges of this\ncentury with boldness and courage and in a truly global\nunited front, is destined take its place alongside the\n7\n\nCharter of the United Nations as one of the most\nseminal documents of all time. In responding to the\npeoples' fervent clarion call to redefine and vigorously\nsupport the United Nations mandates and programmes,\nand to meet the challenges of HIV/AIDS, malaria and\nother diseases that threaten to decimate our populations\nwhile leaving millions of others too weak to derive\nvalue from life, the world leaders undertook before the\nwhole world to save humanity from the scourge of war,\nfear and want.\nThe citizens of the world paid witness to the\nsober promises of the Millennium Summit. They wait\nin earnest for Member States to make good on the\npledges made in the Millennium Declaration. They, the\npeoples, as our ultimate constituencies, are indeed the\nones we must serve. However, they are sceptical\nbecause of failures to make good on previous pledges.\nYet they expect us to implement the undertakings we\nmade at the Summit, committing whatever resources of\nmaterial or of the heart are called for. For our part,\ntherefore, we must find the collective political will to\nmobilize the necessary resources to implement the\ncommitments. We must also reconnect with the passion\nthat drove the leaders of the world, determined to spare\nhumanity the devastation of war and deprivation, to\nfound the United Nations.\nIn responding to this clarion call, Member States\nmust forge a new global partnership between the\nwealthy and powerful nations and those whose present\ncircumstances leave them mired in the seemingly\nintractable maze of a merry-go-round type of\ndevelopment. The North must be gracious and\ngenerous, and give enough of what has been acquired\nfrom global resources to assist poor and weak countries\nto help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and\nirreversible social and economic growth.\nFor its part, the South must not only take sober\nstock of our present challenges, but also devote energy\nand creativity to genuinely engage all our countries in a\ncommon effort at social development and human\nsecurity. To do so, we must rise above the temptation to\nsettle scores through armed conflict; place the will and\ngenius of our peoples at the helm of national\nreconstruction; and give prominence to the credo\nwritten in stone on the wall which adorns the courtyard\nadjacent to the General Assembly, to turn our swords\ninto ploughshares. It is the marriage of this dual\ncommitment of the wealthy and strong, and the\npresently poor and weak nations, which carries in its\nwomb the child of a new world, aglow in global peace,\ndevelopment and prosperity.\nAlongside the Millennium Summit were other\nmajor activities of great importance at the United\nNations and elsewhere in New York. The Security\nCouncil conducted its own high-level consultations,\nculminating in a categorical commitment, especially to\nAfrica, towards development, peace and security on the\ncontinent. The conference of presiding officers of the\nworld's parliaments resolved to work closely with the\nUnited Nations in pursuit of people-centred goals. The\nWorld Peace Summit, which brought together religious\nleaders from practically all faiths, in its declaration on\na commitment to global peace, in addition to\nrecognizing gender equality, declared all religions to be\nequal and condemned any violence perpetrated in the\nname of religion. The non-governmental organizations,\nwhich in their summit earlier in May had called for a\nglobal solidarity in which corporations would\ndemonstrate a greater sense of social responsibility,\nespecially in the pursuit of the benefits of\nglobalization, reaffirmed their advocacy for social\nchange in their Department of Public Information/Non-\nGovernmental Organization Forum in August.\nTogether, participants in all these gatherings sought to\nhelp redefine the pivotal role of the United Nations and\nall other world organizations in the new millennium in\nuplifting the peoples of the world.\nThe active role of grass-roots organizations, both\nin their own conference and in their interaction with all\nthe other conferences, is a clear sign that \u201cWe the\nPeoples\u201d are actually now firmly reclaiming our\nlegitimate right to be heard wherever States are\ndiscussing a new beginning in human relations and the\nfuture of the United Nations \u2014 our common House.\nBearing this in mind, the world's leaders made a\nspecial commitment to Africa to implement special\nmeasures to address the challenges of poverty\neradication and sustainable development through such\nactions as debt cancellation, increased investment and\ngreater access to markets and technology. All human\nfootprints start with the first lonely step.\nWe had witnessed a robust and generous spirit of\nteamwork on the part of Member States in preparing\nfor the General Assembly's Millennium Summit and\ngalvanizing a partnership for a successful outcome. In\nthe fullness of time, it all came together, and we got it\nright, to the satisfaction of all. It was collaboration\n8\n\nrather than competition. Thorns and all, what a\nbeautiful rose it turned out to be.\nIn Africa, we say that no one man can put his\nhands around a baobab tree. It requires many hands\njoined together to form a circle around that proverbial\ntree. I thank all my collaborators. We are all winners,\nand the integrity of the United Nations does not just\nremain intact, but is enhanced. I remember, though,\nwhat my President and Co-Chairperson of the\nMillennium Summit, Mr. Sam Nujoma, stressed in his\nclosing statement:\n\u201c[W]e have adopted a historic Declaration with a\nvision for the future ... The Declaration in itself\nwill not put bread on [the] tables [of the peoples\nof the world], stop the wars, erase poverty ... We\ncannot, therefore, afford to go back home from\nhere and continue business as usual.\u201d (A/55/PV.8)\nThat is the question and, indeed, the challenge for the\nUnited Nations and the global community. His\ncounterpart, the President of Finland, Ms. Tarja\nHalonen, echoed those sentiments in her own closing\nspeech.\nSir, against the backdrop of those profound\ncircumstances and events relating to the Millennium\nSummit, we welcome a fortunate coincidence which\nhas set the stage for your unanimous election as\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly, together with the eminent members of your\nBureau. I congratulate you all warmly and assure you\nof Namibia's steadfast cooperation.\nIn my acceptance speech of 14 September 1999, I\ncomplained about a creeping but steady derogation of\nthe General Assembly's functions and powers, contrary\nto the letter and spirit of the relevant provisions of the\nCharter of the United Nations. This situation has hardly\nchanged for the better during the past year. If anything,\nthe encroachment has intensified. I have therefore\ndecided to speak up, so that we no longer take things\nfor granted in the ensuing months.\nI found the Office of the President of the General\nAssembly to be the main target of this unacceptable\ndenigration. In the animal kingdom, the predator goes\nfor the head or the jugular to incapacitate its prey.\nWell, that seems to be the case here as well. For some\ntime now \u2014 prior to my tenure of office \u2014 we had\nbeen discussing practical ways and means of\nstrengthening the Office of the President to ensure its\ncapacity and effectiveness.\nIn light of this, I would suggest \u2013 subject, of\ncourse, to the President's disposition \u2013 an early\nplanning meeting involving the President, the\nChairman of the Fifth Committee and the Chairman of\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and\nBudgetary Questions to review this situation and to act\nupon what has already been agreed, including adequate\nresources for the Office of the President. No President\nof the General Assembly should be subjected to the\nwhims of faceless bureaucrats as if he or she were\nasking for personal favours.\nIn this context, two key paragraphs in the\nMillennium Declaration are apropos. First, paragraph\n30 underscores the commitment to\n\u201creaffirm the central position of the General\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\nmaking and representative organ of the United\nNations, and to enable it to play that role\neffectively\u201d. (resolution 55/2, para. 30)\nThis is a clear and categorical reaffirmation of the\ncentrality of the Assembly, notwithstanding the\nexisting and desirable division of labour or\ncomplementary functions among the principal organs.\nSecondly, in paragraph 31, the heads of State and\nGovernment collectively state:\n\u201cWe request the General Assembly to\nreview on a regular basis the progress made in\nimplementing the provisions of this Declaration,\nand ask the Secretary-General to issue periodic\nreports for consideration by the General\nAssembly and as a basis for further action.\u201d\n(ibid., para. 31)\nI would make another suggestion. Under the\nPresident's authority, the Bureau should act as an\nexecutive arm of the Office of the President,\nsuperintending the work of the Assembly and\ninteracting vertically with the heads of the other United\nNations bodies. We always have a solid team in the\nBureau consisting of the President, 21 Vice-Presidents\nand the Chairpersons of the six Main Committees for\nthis crucial task. I was privileged to have a team of\nable ambassadors and, at times, even higher\npersonalities assisting me, to all of whom I remain\ngrateful. The Bureau should be formalized as a\npolitical mechanism. What we should be striving for is\n9\n\na formalized system of regular consultations and better\ncoordination of mandates and action in which the right\nhand knows what the left hand is doing at all times.\nWhile I will leave these hallowed halls soon and\nreturn to my duties as Namibia's Minister of Foreign\nAffairs, Information and Broadcasting, my heart and\nsoul will always be walking the routines of the General\nAssembly. Namibia's celebrated case for self-\ndetermination, freedom and achievement of\nindependence and the greater part of my own personal\nstory \u2014 perhaps a bit unlike that of any of my\npredecessors as Assembly Presidents \u2014 are written on\nthese majestic walls. Indeed, it is actually here and\nnowhere else that one can appreciate the roots and the\nsystemic evolution of the United Nations itself.\nNow I want to express some views of my own\nabout the latest buzzword: globalization. In the\nprocess, I will also respond to what some say \u2013 that the\npeoples of the third world should not run away in fright\nfrom globalization. Frankly speaking, globalization is\nmerely a new name for an old, cruel and unjust system\nwhich was imposed willy-nilly upon the peoples of the\nthird world in the past. Globalization is at least 500\nyears old in the case of Africa. As someone bluntly put\nit, \u201cglobalization is the reformation of what we used to\ncall capitalist imperialism\u201d. That is what he said; I\nthink he has a point.\nThat globalization forcibly introduced the\niniquities of the slave trade, colonial oppression, the\ndispossession of land, racial bigotry and the destruction\nof our precious lives and cultures is a matter of\nhistorical record. We cannot be blamed for harbouring\npainful memories of the marauding usurpers from\nEurope peddling the virtues of a civilizing mission.\nThose uninvited intruders anchored their merchant\nships along the coast and put up their foreign flags.\nNext, millions of people ended up dead, others were\nshipped off to the diaspora, while the rest became\nvictims of a brutal system of colonialism. That, too, is\na matter of record.\nThe more the benefits of globalization are\nadvertised, the more all of it sounds hypocritical and\nself-serving. Nobody is suggesting that we must run\naway from globalization. At the same time, we will\nkeep reminding ourselves of the lessons of history lest\nwe forget the ultimate truth that the lion will not lie\ndown with the lamb. Mind you, industrialization was\nnot bloodless or painless either.\nIf perchance globalization is to have genuine\nefficacy, then we in the third world, who constitute by\nfar the majority of the globe, must infuse it with our\nown vision, our wisdom, our sense of equity and fair\nplay, the essence of the hard lessons we have learned\nfrom our history and experience. In such an\neventuality, we will have to redesign the basic\nparadigm of globalization.\nOn the one hand, it is said that many African\nStates are at risk of missing out on the opportunities\noffered by globalization; on the other hand, Africans\nare repeatedly being told to find answers themselves to\nAfrican problems. Well, which is it? This was never\nactually said about any other continent or peoples at\ntheir worst hour of imminent disaster. I must confess\nthat I do not know how Europe survived the black\nplague, which decimated its population, killing many\nhundreds of thousands. But I know, at least, something\nabout contemporary European history of the past 50\nyears. I think of the devastation and misery in that\ncontinent after the Second World War. Concerted\npolitical will, massive resources and a gigantic plan of\naction were put in place to save Europe. It was the\nfamous Marshall Plan that we Africans were forced to\nread about in schools that did it. Europe was pulled\nback from a precipice because of that comprehensive\nand coordinated action of solidarity and today is\nbuilding a strong Union together. It is clear that there\nwas no idea of abandoning Europe to its own fate. But\nit was not only that.\nThere is another instructive example, that of the\nremarkable Alliance for Progress. That laudable\ninitiative helped Latin America to emerge from an\neconomic and social morass and restored in the people\nan empowering confidence for the future. Today, we\nsee the great Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) and other important regional economic\nand trade groupings fostering economic growth, full\nemployment and the generation of wealth for the\nbenefit all in that vital part of the world. For me, that\nrepresents the true meaning of human brotherhood and\n\u201cprosper thy neighbour\u201d. Africa's key Western\ncooperating partners should not hold the view that\nthose two examples are unique circumstances from the\nremote past or that they are far removed from the\nhardships and misery that Africa and its peoples are\nfacing today.\nOnly when pledges made by world leaders are\ntranslated into concrete programmes and substantial\n10\n\nresources are made available to achieve the time-bound\ntargets set by the Millennium Summit can we in Africa\ntake comfort in and draw strength from the recent\ninspiring commitments. Alhough nobility of mind is a\nnecessary prelude to magnanimity, performance is the\nonly vindication of its efficacy. This is because human\nbeings are not known for mental quantum leaps,\ndisregarding embedded social consciousness. Humans\ntend to hold on to painful memories and to keep\nreminding their tormentors of their obligation. Hence,\nthe persistent demands in Africa, in Europe, in Asia\nand in other places for atonement, reparations and\ncompensation and insistence on the return of all stolen\ncultural artworks, precious relics and sacred icons from\nabroad to their place of origin \u2014 lock, stock and barrel.\nAfricans, who were wronged more than, or at\nleast as much as, any other group of people, are\nlegitimately entitled to justice on political, legal, and\nhumanitarian grounds. Now is the time to settle that\nunfinished business and moral deficit.\nMy good friend said the other day that the best\nform of diplomacy is to tell the truth. I have some\ntruthful things I want to direct to my own camp \u2014 the\nthird world. My remarks will be of a general nature and\nwill likely annoy some of my friends. But in Africa,\ncandour, no matter how distressing it can sometimes\nbe, is not only a form of democracy, but also a\nlanguage for protecting and strengthening the family.\nSo I am sure that they, too, will understand, because all\nof it comes from my heart.\nI believe we urgently need to review our priorities\nand map out a new strategy in order to effectively, and\nin unity, deal with the battles ahead. Once again, we\nmust stand up for our legitimate and just rights. My\nbrother Foreign Minister from a small Caribbean State\nhas pointed out that \u201cthere are new forms of war\ncurrently being waged on the small, the weak and the\nvulnerable\u201d in the countries of the South. While this is\na confirmation of the obvious, the situation is quite\nserious.\nIronically, in the South we are waging\nunconscionable and destructive wars against one\nanother, militarily invading and occupying\nneighbouring States under the pretext of security or\nalleged historical reasons. In the process, we create, by\nomission or by commission, convenient troubled\nwaters for outsiders to fish in. Nations are burning, and\npeoples are dying from bullets, hunger and infectious\ndiseases at the same time. We are destroying ourselves.\nThis must stop. We really have nobody to blame but\nourselves. Rationalizations and excuses made after a\nfait accompli stink to high heaven. We must regroup\nand concentrate on development, poverty eradication,\nregional cooperation and integration. We have agreed\nto promote a culture of peace, to practise tolerance and\nto enlarge opportunities for peaceful coexistence. The\nHavana South Summit and its plan of action gave us an\nimpetus to push ahead in unity and solidarity for our\ncommon survival. The people are tired of war; they\nwant food security and life-saving human progress.\nThey want creative leisure and the right to a coherent\nand planned future for their families and themselves,\ndevoid of fear and heart-rending traumas of violence.\nWe have before us the current report of the\nWorking Group \u2014 the full title is unduly\ncumbersome \u2014 which, for more than six years now,\nhas been dealing with the reform and increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council. When the report\nis debated, Namibia will give its specific views on its\ncontent. Suffice it for me to take this opportunity to\nheartily commend and congratulate Ambassadors John\nde Saram of Sri Lanka and Hans Dahlgren of Sweden,\nwho served as Vice-Chairmen under my leadership, for\ntheir total devotion and hard work that produced that\nthoughtful report.\nI strongly urge Member States to read the report\ncarefully and reflect on the constructive proposals that\nare offered in it. While the negotiations on reform must\ncontinue, and given the fact that we now have a much\nclearer picture in respect of the specific open questions,\nwe should revisit the earlier \u2014 all or nothing \u2014\n\u201cpackage deal\u201d approach. The reform process cannot\njust continue ad infinitum.\nIt was by no means meant to become an end in\nitself. We ought to take a cue from the urgings of the\nworld leaders to move on and show concrete progress\nas soon as possible. The emphasis on the role of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century necessarily\nmeans that we complete the overall reform without\nfurther delay, so that the United Nations can perform\nthat role effectively. For the developing countries, the\nhour is already too late. We have nothing to gain by\ndragging our feet.\nI would like also, in just a few words, to express\nmy astonishment about the contradictory comments\nthat I heard recently about the question of good\n\n\ngovernance. Domestically, in the developing countries,\ngood governance has been turned into a sort of a rigid\ndogma by foreign Powers. But when we call for rapid\ndemocratization of and transparency in international\nrelations, open trade and financial rules and good\ngovernance, they simply ignore our views willy-nilly.\nWhat do we make of this paradox?\nAt least we have now agreed that there is no\ncommonly accepted definition and practice of good\ngovernance anywhere. This was established during the\nconsultations for the Millennium Summit's\npreparations. It is therefore better for us from now on\nto put more emphasis on transparent and accountable\ngovernance, based on the rule of law, while we\ncontinue debating its essential properties that are\nacceptable to all.\nAt this stage, I will touch on some issues that\nrequire reiterating for clarity's sake. To begin with,\nSouth-North dialogue encompasses a broad field, from\npolitical and diplomatic exchanges through trade,\npoverty eradication, investment, technology,\nindustrialization, capacity-building and financing for\ndevelopment to the empowering of people.\nA recent cover story in Time magazine featured\nour esteemed Secretary-General. It called him a\ndreamer. But, to my mind, in today's world of doomed\npragmatists and cynics who try to defy any belief in the\npossibility of a better world for all of us, how\nrefreshing it is that the United Nations is led by an\nAfrican who is not afraid to dream! In a variation on\nthe lyrics of a popular song, what the world needs now\nare bold dreamers whose knowledge of the challenges\nto humanity cannot be questioned, but who believe in\nthe capacity of men and women to rise above their best,\nto move even farther beyond the horizons of human\ncapability.\nThat said, questions relating to development,\npolitics, economics, finance and security unavoidably\noverlap. So also do the challenges of world peace,\nhuman rights, human development and human security,\nsocial change and prosperity. We cannot, therefore,\navoid stressing inclusive and interdependent global\ngovernance that militates against war, fear and want.\nOnly in this way will all of us be able to partake\ntogether in a culture of peace, dialogue, sharing and the\ncommon advancement of humanity.\nIn such a kinder and inclusive world that we wish\nto live in, a dreadful notion of humanitarian\nintervention, by whatever name, does not fit in. Many\nof us expressed strong reactions against it as a\ndangerous idea when it surfaced last year. Namibia\nremains unconvinced and will continue to oppose any\nform of unilateral humanitarian intervention outside the\nCharter. Whether we like it or not, this is still a world\nof diktat by the rich and the powerful against the poor,\nthe weak and the vulnerable. The South is incapable of\ninitiating any humanitarian intervention in the North.\nBut the reverse is not only possible; it can be an\nominous certainty. Can Kuwait, Cyprus, Saint Lucia or\nNamibia really dare launch any humanitarian\nintervention anywhere in the world? They just cannot.\nQuite simply, in a world of lopsided military might,\nhumanitarian intervention is yet another code-name for\ncolonization. This issue is on the agenda and will no\ndoubt be debated again in the Assembly. Namibia will\nair its strong views when we come to that.\nThe Charter shows the best way forward to ensure\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nWhat we, the Member States, should concentrate on,\ntherefore, is to speed up the tardy process of reforming,\nrestructuring and democratizing our Organization the\nbetter to pursue its lofty goals and to implement the\nresolutions and decisions that enjoy overwhelming\nconsensus.\nThis, in a way, brings up the excellent and timely\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) on United Nations peace\noperations. The report constitutes a major building\nblock which can provide a basis for discussing and\nresolving all relevant issues and ideas for concerted\nefforts in the field of preventive diplomacy, conflict\nresolution and all other challenges and problems of\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\nThe next subject I want to deal with is the\nrecently signed United Nations Global Compact with\ntransnational corporations, this time initiated by the\nUnited Nations. We in Namibia, a country which\nactively promotes smart partnerships and win-win\noutcomes for government and business, labour and\nother key players in civil society, see this move as a\nwelcome beginning. However, as is said, trust but\nverify.\nNot too long ago the United Nations used to\nmaintain at Headquarters a watchdog centre for\ntransnational corporations to monitor their nefarious\nglobal activities and sinister dirty tricks against the\n12\n\ninterests of the people. It was closed down for reasons\nnot yet known.\nMany of us from the developing countries ought\nto remember the call by our leaders in the 1970s for a\nnew international economic order and what became of\nit. The United Nations Centre on Transnational\nCorporations was a sincere undertaking to establish a\ndata bank and provide Member States with relevant\ninformation for follow-up and decision-making. The\ncall for a new international economic order was the\nSouth's version of globalization. Yet our leaders were\ndiscredited and the initiative itself was\nunceremoniously killed. Its replacement is already\nwreaking havoc on our slender prospects for\nmeaningful economic autonomy.\nToday, out there in the real world, many armies of\ngrassroots organizations and progressive trade unions\nare back again on the streets demanding the\ndemocratization of international economic and trade\nrelations, transparency, accountability, justice and fair\nplay for the poor, the weak and the vulnerable. This is\nnot a passing wave, but a telling sign of things yet to\ncome.\nThe United Nations should, therefore, avoid\nbeing caught in the middle of the crossfire. The\nsituation requires vigilance and leadership to ensure\nthat the corporations do not entangle the Organization\nin their unsavoury dealings, as some of them are\nalready being accused of doing. I am aware of the\nwritten commitments, agreed rules and broad principles\nin the Compact. But that is one thing. That aside, this is\nonly the beginning, and things will perhaps go wrong\ndown the road. I myself encouraged constructive\npartnership between the United Nations and the private\nsector. That does not mean, however, that all that\nglitters is gold.\nOne more matter of deep interest to my country,\nand indeed to Africa, is information and\ncommunication technology \u2014 ICT. The information\nand communication technology revolution is the most\nsignificant social, political and economic phenomenon\nsince the Industrial Revolution. Its ability to transform\nsocieties is commonly acknowledged. Several weeks\nago the Economic and Social Council summit, held\nhere at United Nations Headquarters, focused totally on\nit.\nYet, ironically, and to some extent in an uncanny\nway, this economic panacea has been presented to\nAfrica not as a tool for self-development and jump-\nstarting global competitiveness, but as yet another\n\u201ccrime of incapacity\u201d used to further overburden an\nalready embattled people.\nOur challenge, the challenge to all of us here, and\nto all those who have had a head start in mobilizing\nthis new capacity for the creation of wealth and a better\nworld, is: what can we do, what must we do, to enable\nAfrica and other developing countries to gain access to\nthe tools of information and communication\ntechnology, so that we can take ownership of our own\nsocial development and achieve full employment and\nprosperity?\nThose who control this powerhouse must act\nquickly and generously to share the benefits of this\nmagic wand, especially since the sons and daughters of\nAfrica and of the developing world are in fact among\nthe major players in creating this new knowledge. To\nthose who may begrudge Africa's access to information\nand communication technology, I say, \u201cJust think: if\ninformation and communication technology enables\nAfrica to create wealth rather than manage poverty,\nthen in a few years Africa will be so developed that\nyou will no longer have to endure the guilt of turning\nus away from your front steps.\u201d\nIn thanking the Secretary-General and his loyal\nDeputy, Ms. Louise Frechette, for their unstinting\nsupport and encouragement, I would be remiss if I did\nnot also mention the General Assembly's chief\nstewards and staff members for their expertise and hard\nwork. I extend the same sentiments to the security and\nprotocol officers for rendering such outstanding\nprofessional services. My heartfelt gratitude goes to\none and all.\nIn conclusion, for Namibia the year 2000 brought\nrededication to service, celebration and thanksgiving. It\nmeant awesome responsibilities in the General\nAssembly, including during the Millennium Summit; in\nthe Security Council; in the World Health Assembly;\nand lately in the chairmanship of the Southern Africa\nDevelopment Community (SADC), our subregional\nbody. One needs allies, friends and partners for all this\nto happen, and we are lucky to have many of them\nthroughout the world. We sincerely express our\nimmense indebtedness to all of them.\nI know that I have been long-winded. I had a few\nthings to say.\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My thanks and gratitude also go\nto our Secretary-General for his tireless and\nconstructive endeavours on behalf of the Organization.\nThe world is currently undergoing the most\nradical changes ever experienced by mankind.

The\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit provided a\nunique opportunity for global leaders to draw up a\ncollective agenda for addressing this historic challenge.\nAs the sole universal body, the United Nations is\nuniquely positioned to be the instrument of democratic\nglobal change. It can help to ensure that the process of\nchange and transformation in the global system is\nparticipatory and fair. The focus of our attention at the\nglobal level over the past 55 years has been on the\npreservation of international peace, security and\nstability. Despite the tremendous economic and\ntechnological progress that has been achieved, justice\n29\n\nand universal participation in decision-making and in\nthe benefits of peace and progress have attracted less\nglobal attention and fewer resources.\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his\nmillennium report, the benefits and costs of\nglobalization have not been evenly distributed. While\nworld trade has increased more than ten-fold since\n1950, over half of the world population continues to\nlive on less than $2 a day and three quarters of the\nworld population earn less than 20 per cent of total\nglobal income. The common destiny of humanity in the\nage of globalization requires us to reject the illusion of\nbuilding islands of affluence, prosperity and stability in\na turbulent sea of war, poverty, disease, ignorance and\ninsecurity.\nGlobalization is an economic, social and cultural\nreality. It should not just be allowed to happen \u2014 it is a\nreality that we can and should collectively manage.\nOne key task is to ensure that the benefits of\nglobalization are more evenly distributed. The\nmillennium report of the Secretary-General sets out a\nnumber of realistic and quantifiable targets. Necessary\nresources need to be committed and those who have\nbeen mostly on the receiving end of the benefits of\nglobalization have an added responsibility. The United\nNations machinery should direct and coordinate\nbilateral and multilateral efforts in this regard.\nGlobalization has also further complicated the\nglobal menaces of terrorism, organized crime and drug\ntrafficking, necessitating the adoption of common and\nrule-based strategies to fight and eradicate them.\nTerrorism afflicts the entire international community\nand must thus be combated in its entirety, regardless of\nwho its victims or perpetrators may be. In a globalized\nworld, nothing can justify harbouring or providing safe\nhaven to terrorists or condoning their activities. No\nnation can fight terrorism unilaterally. We need\nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive\nmechanisms to fight terrorism wherever it occurs and\nto deprive terrorists of their means of recruitment,\noperation and funding.\nThe role of the United Nations in this regard is\nindispensable. In this context, particular attention\nneeds to be focused on cooperation in the field of\ntransnational organized crime and drug trafficking,\nwhich, in addition to inflicting their own banes on\nhumanity, increasingly provide income to terrorist\norganizations. We are prepared to participate actively\nin any endeavour to combat this scourge.\nThe menace of drug abuse and trafficking\ncontinues to take a heavy social, economic and\npolitical toll. It particularly afflicts young people, who\nembody the future. Combating drug trafficking is a\ncostly exercise and requires international political will\nand serious burden-sharing. The provision of\nmeaningful financial resources and modern equipment\nby target countries can enable transit countries, such as\nours, to combat the problem at a fraction of the cost.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has done more than\nits fair share in preventing transit, seizing more than 70\nper cent of all narcotics confiscated worldwide. The\nfinancial burden and, more importantly, the human\nsacrifice are unsustainable. More than 2,900 Iranian\ndrug enforcement personnel have been martyred in the\nfight against drug traffickers. We appreciate the\ncooperation and support extended to Iran by the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme in this\nregard, although its limited resources cannot cover the\nprogrammes it wants and needs to implement. It is\nimportant to stress that, in the absence of meaningful\nbilateral and multilateral assistance, the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran will have to allocate most resources to\ncombating domestic consumption and will not be able\nto sustain its fight against drug trafficking with the\nsame vigour and energy.\nAs underlined by President Khatami here last\nweek, the emergence of a world culture is another\nreality. But such a culture should not overlook native\nlocal cultures with the aim of imposing itself upon\nthem. National cultures have gradually evolved in a\nprocess ensuring coherence in spite of the plurality and\ndiversity that is found in many of them. This process\ncreates a sense of belonging.\nWe need the same harmony and sense of\nbelonging for the emerging world culture. The answer\nis participation and not assimilation and imposition.\nLast year, I proposed recognition of the right of nations\nand peoples to preserve and nourish their culture and\ncultural identity. The General Assembly adopted\nresolution 54/160 in this regard. We continue to believe\nthat in the process of globalization, it is essential to\nrecognize and respect cultural rights of individuals and\ncommunities.\nWe should transform globalization, particularly in\nthe area of culture, into a democratic, participatory and\n30\n\nnatural process of globality. The United Nations can\nfacilitate this process by promoting dialogue for the\nexchange of knowledge, experience and understanding\nin diverse areas of culture and civilization. The\npromotion of global participation in the process will\nprevent a sense of alienation and \u201ccultural\nhomelessness\u201d in major parts of the world.\nThe designation of the year 2001 as the United\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations is the\nfirst step in this direction. The unprecedented\nworldwide reception of this proposal indicates first and\nforemost a general need for dialogue. The round table\non dialogue among civilizations, which was held here\nin New York on the eve of the Millennium Summit\nwith the participation of a significant number of heads\nof State, Foreign Ministers and prominent scholars and\nthinkers, underlined that dialogue should become the\nnew paradigm of international relations. This\nconstituted a proper launching of the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue. It must be augmented by serious\nprogrammes and the commitment of all to make this a\nmeaningful reality which should persist in human\nexperience long after the United Nations Year of\nDialogue ends. In this context, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference (OIC), which is currently chaired\nby President Khatami, has recently adopted a draft\n\u201cglobal agenda on dialogue among civilizations\u201d, to be\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. We hope that in the course of the next several\nmonths, consultations between various delegations will\nlead to further enrichment and the adoption of this draft\nat the next General Assembly.\nThe United Nations can naturally play a leading\nrole in the democratic global change in the political\nscene. Crises in disparate parts of the world challenge\nthe relevance of the United Nations, requiring it not to\ntake the back seat.\nThe situation of Palestine represents a vivid\nillustration of the failure of the international\ncommunity to provide justice to millions of people\ndeprived of their homeland and the most fundamental\nhuman rights through State terrorism, aggression and\nforeign occupation. Of over 7.5 million Palestinians, 4\nmillion live in diaspora, and many of the rest under\nforeign domination. This lies at the heart of the\nPalestinian question. Disregarding the joint processes\nof expulsion and occupation cannot lead to the\nrestoration of peace and tranquillity in that volatile\nregion. In fact, Israel's persistent disregard for the\nrights of the Palestinian people, coupled with Zionist\npolicies of aggression, State terrorism and acquisition\nof weapons of mass destruction, continue to pose the\ngreatest threat to regional peace, security and stability.\nPalestine belongs to all Palestinians irrespective of\ntheir creed. Peace can return to the region only through\nan end to the occupation of all Arab and Muslim\nterritories, including the Golan Heights, the restoration\nof the rights of Palestinian people, including their right\nto return to their homeland, the exercise of their\ninalienable right to self-determination through\ndemocratic means and the establishment of their\nindependent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital.\nThe persistence of the tragic fratricide in\nAfghanistan, along with the dire humanitarian\nsituation, violations of human rights, particularly those\nof women and girls, the production and trafficking of\nnarcotics and the harbouring and training of terrorists\nhave created a human catastrophe. Peace and national\nreconciliation can be attained only through abandoning\nthe illusion of a military solution and the domination of\none ethnic group. The United Nations, through the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and\nthe \u201csix plus two\u201d Group, continues to provide the\nmost suitable mechanism to facilitate intra-Afghan\ndialogue aimed at a responsible, broad-based, multi-\nethnic and fully representative government. The\nIslamic Republic of Iran has played an active role in\nthis process. Also, in his capacity as Chairman of the\nOIC, President Khatami has undertaken an initiative to\nbring the warring factions to negotiations. We are\nprepared to continue this exercise in close coordination\nwith the United Nations.\nThere are other humanitarian challenges emerging\nglobally, requiring the United Nations to respond.\nFailure to act may bring about arbitrary and\nselective \u2014 and, naturally, politically motivated \u2014\nresponses from States and non-universal organizations.\nThe articulation of the criteria for rule-based reaction\nand the allocation of necessary resources and capacity-\nbuilding in the United Nations for timely response\nconstitute two major tasks ahead. As the Secretary-\nGeneral has pointed out, prevention through diplomacy\nand economic development is the most effective and\nleast costly type of global engagement.\nGood-governance at the international level\nrequires the provision of rational and comprehensive\nmechanisms to ensure security for all. Nuclear\ndisarmament is the most fundamental priority in this\n31\n\nregard. It is imperative to initiate multilateral\nnegotiations for the elimination of all nuclear weapons,\nwithin a time-bound framework and through a\ncomprehensive and universal convention. The proposal\nof the Secretary-General to convene an international\nconference on nuclear weapons is a valuable\ncontribution; such a conference could build upon our\ncollective achievement during the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference.\nFurthermore, following the outcome of the NPT\nReview Conference, serious and comprehensive\ninternational pressure should come to bear on Israel to\naccede to the Treaty and to put its installations under\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nsafeguards. This would pave the way for the\nestablishment of a zone free from weapons of mass\ndestruction in the Middle East.\nFinally, in reforming global governance, the role\nand efficiency of the General Assembly, as the sole\ndemocratic, universal and transparent organ of the\nUnited Nations, must be augmented. It should focus its\ndeliberations on contemporary challenges rather than\nhold outdated debates, coupled with effective responses\nto the reports of other organs of the United Nations,\nparticularly the Security Council.\nEfforts to work out a special political role for the\nUnited Nations come at a time when the Organization\nis in one of the worst periods of its existence from a\nfinancial perspective. The tasks that the international\ncommunity expects the United Nations to fulfil require\nmore innovative ways of raising money for the smooth\nfunctioning of the Organization.\nIn this context, it may be instructive to remember\nthat if only a tiny percentage of the military\nexpenditures of the Member States were allocated to\nthe specific activities of the United Nations, the goal of\ncreating a more secure global environment would be\nmuch more efficiently achieved.\nThe current session of the General Assembly\nfollows the Millennium Summit, the Inter-\nParliamentary Union summit, the global gathering of\nreligious leaders and the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization roundtable on\ndialogue among civilizations. As such, it represents a\ntremendous and historic opportunity to take advantage\nof the political will expressed in those unprecedented\ngatherings, to operationalize their declarations and\ndecisions, and to move the United Nations forward to\nan era of stability, justice, peace and good governance,\nthrough participation and the rule of law.\nCommensurate with such a historic opportunity, we are\nall accountable before our own people and the people\nof the world."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset I would like to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to the President on his well-deserved\nelection. I also wish to express our sincere appreciation\nto His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his\ndevoted work, tireless efforts and dedication while\nsuccessfully presiding over the fifty-fourth United\nNations General Assembly.\nThe Millennium Summit that concluded only a\nfew days ago has reaffirmed the unanimous belief of\nthe world leaders that only together, guided by the\nspirit and the objectives of the founding fathers of the\nUnited Nations and respecting the established system\nof principles, norms and standards of international\nrelations and international law, can we successfully\nrespond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nDespite its weaknesses, imperfections, inadequate\nefficiency and sometimes missed opportunities, the\nconsequences of which were partly felt in my country,\nthe United Nations succeeded in maintaining global\nsecurity, in containing several local and regional\nconflicts, in preserving peace and in facilitating the\nnormalization of life. It has been successful in offering\nrelief and hope to the most unfortunate ones. Again,\nmy country experienced this side of the United Nations\nas well. In this respect, we again welcome the\nSrebrenica Report and subsequent Brahimi Report.\n28\n\nIf all this was achieved mostly under the\nconditions of the confrontations of the cold war, in a\nclimate of mistrust and in the century during which\nhumanity not only achieved the highest objectives but\nalso touched the lowest depths, there should be no\ndoubt that the United Nations can fulfil its new tasks.\nAddressing this Assembly on behalf of the country that\nin the memory of humankind is associated with the\neruption of the First World War  an event that was an\nearly omen of the entire tragedy of the twentieth\ncentury  I would like to express hope that at the very\nend of this century, after all the horrors of the Second\nWorld War and after the inconceivably tragic conflicts\nfollowing the dissolution of the Socialist Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina has\nexhausted all the misfortune of being at the epicentre\nof historic earthquakes. And I hope that, under the\nauspices of the United Nations, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is ready to gain anonymity through a\nspeedy recovery and blessed, long-lasting and happy\nprogress.\nThe United Nations through its activities has and\nwill continue to influence the developments in the\nworld. It has to follow the rapid and very often radical\nchanges in international relations and to adjust\naccordingly and find the best ways to exercise its\nduties and its role. The reform of the United Nations no\ndoubt is a very delicate issue. But its postponement and\nendless debates that only maintain the status quo are an\neven greater issue. Furthermore, these things bring into\nquestion the ability of the United Nations to modernize\nand democratize in order to improve its capacity and\nefficiency. An agreement has been reached on some of\nthe most crucial issues regarding the reform of the\nSecurity Council, including the increase in its\nmembership  both its permanent and non-permanent\nseats  to include the representatives of the developed\nand the developing countries and to provide more\nequitable geographical representation of the countries.\nI believe that by adopting this minimum of initial\nreforms of the Security Council and through\ncontinuous work on the other related issues  such as\nthe issue of the veto  a favourable atmosphere would\nbe created and this would positively influence relations\nwithin and all the activities of the United Nations.\nIn our address to the General Assembly a year\nago, our delegation announced that we would like to\nbecome a more active member of the international\ncommunity, primarily of the United Nations. We said\nthat we were determined to move from the position of\nthe recipient of the concern and attention of the\ninternational organizations and forums  a position in\nwhich we were placed for more or less well-known\nreasons  to the position of a contributor to\ninternational efforts. The fact that we are in a position\nto consider the need or even the imperative of taking a\nmore active and creative role, and thus a bigger share\nof responsibility, testifies to the trend of normalization\nof the situation in our country, which was ravaged by a\nwar only five years ago. Although small in number, an\nintegrated group of 13 policemen from both entities,\ncomprising representatives of all three constituent\npeoples  who only recently were fighting each\nother  have been deployed with the international\npeacekeeping force in East Timor. Furthermore, with\nsignificant assistance from and the endorsement of the\nUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n(UNMIBH), efforts to form a joint unit composed of\nthe military from both entities are under way. Once\nestablished, the unit would be sent to a peacekeeping\nmission under the United Nations flag. We are\nconsidering very seriously the possibility of presenting\nthe candidature of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a non-\npermanent seat in the Security Council after the year\n2010. In this way, we are confirming our commitment\nto the stabilization and normalization of life in our\ncountry, and particularly our commitment to economic\nand democratic development. We are confident that, as\nearly as 10 years from now, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwill succeed in becoming a member of the most\nimportant body of the United Nations.\nAlthough we display courage in expressing\nreadiness to take a larger share of responsibility as a\nMember of the United Nations and of other regional\norganizations, we are fully aware that we still need the\ninternational presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that\nwe still need its assistance and support in the\nnormalization of life, in eliminating the consequences\nof war and in preparing ourselves for self-sustainable\ndevelopment and progress. Implementation of the\nDayton/Paris Peace Agreement still remains the main\nfocus of the activities of the authorities in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina at all levels. Its implementation is also the\nprimary focus of the international community and its\nrepresentatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Imperfect\nas the Peace Agreement undoubtedly is, this cannot be\nan excuse for a lack of commitment to its\nimplementation. For it is exactly its consistent\nimplementation that can bring us closer to the point at\n29\n\nwhich it would be normal, and even unavoidable, to\nestablish a new framework and new directions for\nBosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards higher\nlevels of development and higher living standards.\nHowever, this will only be possible when the common\ninstitutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina become a place\nand an instrument for the realization of common\ninterests and objectives of both of its entities and of all\nof its constituent nations and peoples  instead of\nbeing a locus for very costly obstructions and\nconfrontations to the detriment of all, in particular\nthose who want to return to their homes.\nIn many areas throughout Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in the past 12 months progress has been\nmade. This is encouraging and indicative of the fact\nthat in many fields of life things could advance faster\nand more successfully along the road towards desired\nand needed progress.\nThe return of refugees and internally displaced\npersons still remains the priority. There continue to be\ncases in which returnees have to flee their only recently\nrebuilt homes when faced with brutal attacks by\nneighbours of different ethnicities or religions. But at\nthe same time it is encouraging that more often the\nreturnees are welcomed by their neighbours and\noffered assistance and support. During the first six\nmonths of this year three times more so-called minority\nreturns were registered compared to the same period\nlast year. However, the number of returns is considered\nto be even larger, since not all returns have been\nregistered or have not been fully completed as yet. The\nother positive development noticed in the returns is the\nfact that among the returnees there are more and more\nyoung people and families with school-age children,\nwhich was not the case in the past, when only so-called\nelderly households returned to their homes. This\nprogress, of course, may be the result of improved\nsecurity conditions, freedom of movement, somewhat\nbetter infrastructure or offering assistance with the\nrepairing of houses or apartments; but, above all, this\nprogress is the result of a growing awareness on the\npart of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina that it is\nsavage, illegal and inhuman to deprive people of their\nsacred rights to home, life and security.\nReturns were also significantly increased because\nindicted war criminals were more successfully brought\nto justice and because of a more independent, more\nreasonable and more constructive engagement on the\npart of the media. Still, the role of the international\ncommunity in achieving all that has been mentioned \nin particular the role of the High Representative, the\nPeace Implementation Council, the United Nations\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Stabilization\nForce, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  is irreplaceable.\nIn this context, I would like to take this\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the members of\nthe Security Council for inviting the three members of\nthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to New\nYork last November on the occasion of the fourth\nanniversary of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement. That\nvisit resulted in the adoption of the New York\nDeclaration. Implementation of the provisions of the\nDeclaration brought about major achievements: the\nestablishment of the State Border Service, the\nformation of the Secretariat of the Presidency and\nimprovements that facilitated the functioning of this\njoint institution, the reconstruction and enlargement of\nthe Council of Ministers, and the creation of conditions\nconducive to the return of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons. Also, as a related activity, the first\nsteps in organizing the battle against corruption have\nbeen taken.\nThe decision of the Constitutional Court of\nBosnia and Herzegovina on the constituency of all the\nthree nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have far-\nreaching consequences for overall developments in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. This decision should reduce\nthe unique ethnic and religious apartheid and\ndisenfranchisement of citizens belonging to the so-\ncalled minority nations. Among the achievements that\nencourage and have a positive impact on the change of\nthe overall climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be\nmentioned those made in the area of the judicial\nsystem. Those achievements are reflected in the\nprofessionalization of judges and prosecutors and in\ntheir modernization. Through the establishment of\nmulti-ethnic police comprising uncompromised\nprofessionals, training and education of young\npolicemen in police academies, composition of police\nforces that reflect the demographic picture of the local\npopulation, the space for abuses is thereby narrowed,\nand an environment favourable to arbitrary behaviour\nand unpunished harassment and oppression of citizens\nbelonging to so called minority nations is eliminated.\nIt is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that\nsignificant efforts are being made in the promotion and\n30\n\nprotection of human rights and civil freedoms in\nBosnia and Herzegovina in all fields.\nIn the course of preparing for the World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, we will request\nthat government bodies, courts, the police force,\nschools and universities, non-governmental\norganizations, religious institutions and their leaders\nand distinguished individuals from different spheres of\nlife, challenge those who still advocate and practise\ndifferent forms of discrimination and intolerance and\nstep on human rights, freedoms and human dignity.\nWe, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are aware that\nhealing the consequences of war and post-war\nstagnation and removal of impediments to faster\nstabilization and progress rests primarily with the\ndomestic political leadership.\nWe are also aware that the future of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is in its integration into European and\nother institutions. The Stability Pact for south-eastern\nEurope has therefore been accepted as a framework\nconducive to regional cooperation, elimination of\nmistrust, strengthening of security conditions and for\ncatching up with missed opportunities in the spheres of\nhuman rights and democratic emancipation and\neconomic progress. Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwholeheartedly embraces the Stability Pact as the most\nimportant regional endeavour so far, convinced that,\ndespite the slow realization of a number of projects and\ndespite the slower inflow of contributions, its\nobjectives are fully consistent with the objectives of\nBosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy. The\nachievement of these objectives would embark us on\nthe road to faster integration into the Council of\nEurope, the European Union, the World Trade\nOrganization and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization. There is no doubt whatsoever that the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) should\nparticipate in the Stability Pact, but we share the views\nof those who condition its participation on the\nnecessary democratic changes in that country. At the\nsame time, we consider that the other countries of the\nregion should not be kept hostage by the FRY on their\nway to Euro-Atlantic integration. In this context, we\nwould like to recall that, at the early stages of the\nestablishment of the European Union, there was no\nwaiting list for the present members of the Union and\nthat they did not have to pass the entering examination\nsuccessfully and simultaneously. At this point in time,\nthe waiting lists and admission procedures could be\ncounterproductive and could encourage those forces in\nthe region, including in my own country, to persist in\ncontinuing the state of chaos and exclusion.\nAt the beginning of this year, the situation in the\nneighouring Republic of Croatia has been significantly\nimproved by the opposition victory in the elections. A\nnumber of issues that burdened the relations between\nthe two countries have practically been resolved, since\nsome of the issues were tackled in the bilateral\nmeetings at the highest levels immediately after the\nelections. The change brought about by the elections\nalso positively influenced the return of refugees,\nalthough more visible results in this area are still to\ncome.\nHowever, regrettably, there is still no\nimprovement in relations with the FRY and, at this\npoint, it is still uncertain when the improvement might\noccur. For sure, without democratic changes in Serbia,\nthe establishment of full diplomatic relations between\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the FRY could hardly\noccur. The democratic changes in the FRY certainly\nwould positively reflect on the internal relations\nbetween the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina as\nwell as on overall relations in the region. The\ndemocratic changes in the Bosnia and Herzegovina\nneighbourhood have certainly cut off the influx of\nexported elements of destabilization and crisis. I have\nalready referred to the positive example of changes in\nCroatia.\nWe, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, must gather the\ncourage and strength to face our reality and to choose\nthe path and the direction that would lead us speedily\ntowards the achievements that would compensate for\nthe decade of suffering, deprivation and missed\nopportunities. In the process of making this clear and\nrational choice, we would like to count on the\nunreserved support of the international community, and\non a rather sooner than later integration into Euro-\nAtlantic institutions. We have to say that this\nintegration is already very much behind schedule and\nwe do not have a lot of time to waste."

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait, it gives\nme pleasure to extend to you, Mr. President, warm\ncongratulations on your unanimous election as\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the United\nNations General Assembly. We wish you success in\nsteering the deliberations of this landmark session. Let\nme assure you of my delegation's commitment to work\nconstructively with you towards meeting the common\ngoals and aspirations of the international community.\nI wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nthe remarkable efforts made and prudence shown by\nyour predecessor during his presidency of the last\nsession of the Assembly.\nIn the same vein, let me once again place on\nrecord our great admiration of and appreciation for the\ncrucial role played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, since he assumed the helm at the United\nNations. Mr. Annan has been working tirelessly to\nimprove the performance of the Organization's system\nin the interest of global peace, security and\ndevelopment and to bring it more in line with the\nongoing transformations in international relations.\nOn a membership note, let me now extend a\nwarm welcome to the Republic of Tuvalu, which has\njoined our ranks as the newest Member of the United\nNations. Tuvalu's admission to membership enhances\nthe universal character of the Organization.\nJust a few days ago, United Nations Headquarters\nhosted an unprecedented, historic gathering of a very\nlarge number of heads of State or Government, who\ncome together to renew their commitments to the\nCharter of the United Nations and to reiterate their\nunwavering belief in the importance and relevance of\nthe United Nations in developing a better world,\nstructured on the values of justice, equality,\ncoexistence and cooperation.\nThe Millennium Summit was a momentous\noccasion to review and appraise the achievements and\nfailures of the past. It was an occasion to sketch out a\nvision to face the challenges of the future. The\nDeclaration adopted by the Summit, together with the\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\nSecretary-General on the role of the United Nations in\nthe twenty-first century, are a blueprint for addressing\nthe pressing problems and challenges that will confront\nmankind in key areas. Chief among those daunting\nchallenges that hamper the fulfilment of peoples'\naspirations around the globe to achieve adequate levels\nof freedom, dignity and peace are the arms race,\nincreasing national and racial conflicts, poverty,\nignorance, development, human rights abuses,\nterrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of\nlethal infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria.\nThe list can indeed go on ad infinitum. The effects and\ndangers of those problems cut across national borders\nand transcend any artificial barriers. If anything, this\nfact confirms the need for consolidated international\nefforts and a reinforced United Nations role system-\nwide.\nHere, we note with some measure of satisfaction\nthe ongoing attempts being made at the global level to\ncope with those problems. Numerous world\nconferences and special sessions of the General\nAssembly held in the last few years have facilitated the\nconclusion of several international agreements and\ntreaties covering a range of subjects. In those meetings,\nit was reaffirmed that resolve would rid humanity of\nthe risks of nuclear weapons and the alarming dangers\nposed to international peace and security by their\nproliferation. In another important area, the Beijing\nDeclaration and the Platform for Action were\nentrenched to enhance the status of women and to\nensure their full rights. The Copenhagen Summit, with\nits focus on universal human development, was also the\nsubject of a follow-up conference held recently.\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait takes pride in\nthe fact that the United Nations Development\nProgramme's Human Development Report 2000 states\nthat Kuwait has maintained its rank of first among\nArab countries, and number 36 in the world, in the\nfield of human development. Kuwait is now\ndetermined to pursue its efforts to do even better in the\nfuture. A key component of our efforts is our\n12\n\ncommitment to the implementation of the principles\nand goals enshrined in the international conventions\nand treaties covering human development and human\nrights, and to employ them at the national level with a\nview to improving our economic and social conditions.\nInteraction between the Kuwaiti Government and the\nNational Assembly \u2014 which is the legislative authority\nin Kuwait and the product of robust parliamentary and\ndemocratic life in our country \u2014 will certainly\naccelerate our efforts to fulfil the goals and aspirations\nof the people of Kuwait.\nIn the course of the decades that span the life of\nthe United Nations, the Organization has established a\ngood record of achievement and has proven its\neffectiveness in the resolution of many disputes and\nconflicts. It has also helped to contain many problems.\nThus, it is now really difficult to imagine a world\nwithout the United Nations. The Millennium Summit\nDeclaration reaffirmed that the United Nations is the\ncommon house indispensable to the entire family of\nnations. Having said that, and in view of the profound\ntransformations in the world order and the attendant\nnew problems and challenges, it has become imperative\nto continue to support and cooperate with the\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations bodies\nwith a view to streamlining them in response to the\nglobal changes, thereby enabling them to respond\nbetter to the challenges of the future.\nIn that regard, we reaffirm the need to pursue\nefforts to improve the procedures and working methods\nof the Security Council. The goal is to make the work\nof the Council more transparent and to increase the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent seats, with a\nview to expanding the base of the decision-making\nprocess under controls that ensure equitable\nrepresentation to making an efficient contribution to\nthe Council's fulfilment of its functions and\nresponsibilities in terms of maintaining international\npeace and security.\nAt this juncture, we wish to underscore the need\nfor all Member States to pay their assessed\ncontributions in full and on time, both to the United\nNations regular budget and to the peacekeeping\noperations budget. It is indeed essential to provide\nadequate financial resources to the United Nations so\nthat it may carry out its mandates.\nTen years have elapsed since the Iraqi invasion of\nthe State of Kuwait. That invasion constituted a serious\nprecedent in international relations because it\nrepresented a flagrant violation of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the norms and principles of\ninternational law. Furthermore, that invasion\nundermined the security and stability of the Gulf\nregion. Kuwait now recalls with pride the firm stand\nand resolve demonstrated by the international\ncommunity in condemning, confronting and defeating\nthat aggression. All of that was distinctly illustrated in\na quick series of resolutions adopted by the Security\nCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter as of the very\nfirst day of the invasion, on 2 August 1990. That\nhistoric stand by the international community was a\nremarkable embodiment and consolidation of the\nsystem of collective security. It also ushered in a new\ninternational order and represented a clear and strong\nmessage to any Government or regime that might\npursue a policy of aggression with a view to territorial\nexpansion at the expense of others.\nThe reverberations of the sinister Iraqi aggression\nare still being felt by all of us today. The Security\nCouncil remains seized with the repercussions of that\naggression. Since the invasion, the Council has had to\nadopt 54 resolutions and numerous presidential\nstatements in response to the persistent procrastination\nand equivocation of the Government of Iraq, which has\nconstantly sought to evade its international obligations.\nIndeed, it is regrettable that for 10 years now the\nGovernment of Iraq has failed to meet its obligations\nunder Security Council resolutions.\nThe main requirements yet to be met under the\nresolutions of the Security Council relate to the\nquestion of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and\nhostages. This humanitarian issue illustrates the\ntragedy facing hundreds of families who continue to\ngrieve over the unknown fate of their loved ones. Little\nprogress, if any, has been made. Basically, we are still\nat square one. Resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and\n1284 (1999), which requested Iraq to unconditionally\ncooperate with the International Committee of the Red\nCross (ICRC) to account for prisoners and hostages,\nremain unimplemented. In fact, since its boycott of\nboth bodies in January 1999, the Government of Iraq\nhas continued to illustrate its disregard for the\nhumanitarian nature of this issue through its insistence\non not resuming its participation with the Tripartite\nCommission and its Technical Subcommittee.\nFurthermore, the Government of Iraq also insists on\nnon-cooperation with the high-level Coordinator,\n13\n\nAmbassador Yuli Vorontsov, who was appointed by the\nSecretary-General to facilitate the repatriation of\nprisoners and hostages.\nLet me seize this occasion to reiterate our call to\nthe Iraqi Government to deal positively with this\nmatter, given its humanitarian, religious and moral\ndimensions. This issue must be resolved in accordance\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. Along\nthe same lines, we demand that Iraq cooperate with the\nhigh-level Coordinator to complete the return of stolen\nproperty. This is also in accordance with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. The most important of\nthose assets include military hardware that has been\nincorporated into Iraq's military system and the\nirreplaceable archives of the State of Kuwait, which\nwere deemed by the Security Council as the \u201cState\nmemory\u201d of our country. The stubborn resistance by\nIraq to return these assets and documents betrays the\nnon-peaceful intentions still harboured by the\nGovernment of Iraq towards Kuwait.\nWhat is deeply regrettable is that the Government\nof Iraq has not only failed to meet the obligations we\noutlined earlier, but that it has allegedly completed the\nelimination of its weapons of mass destruction while at\nthe same time not allowing  United Nations inspectors\nto verify those claims. Iraq also claims to have fulfilled\nall its obligations under the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. In its stance, Iraq stands isolated in the\nface of the United Nations, the international\ncommunity and the many regional organizations and\ngroupings that continue to call on Iraq to complete its\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization this\nyear, the Secretary-General put it succinctly and\neloquently when he stated:\n\u201cIraq's lack of compliance with various\nSecurity Council resolutions continues to be of\ngrave concern.\u201d (A/55/1, para. 54)\nIn addition, the decision adopted by the last\nministerial meeting of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, last June\nconfirms beyond any doubt that there is indeed a single\nunified international and regional position on the need\nfor Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions.\nThat decision demanded that the Government of Iraq,\namong other things, continue its efforts to complete the\nimplementation of its commitments under Security\nCouncil resolutions in the interest of peace, security\nand stability in the region. It also welcomed the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)\nand invited Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission\n(UNMOVIC) under the chairmanship of Mr. Hans Blix\nto implement the provisions of resolution 1284 (1999).\nThat same decision further stressed that Iraq must\nexpressly and clearly admit that its invasion and\noccupation of the State of Kuwait was a breach of pan-\nArab, Islamic and international treaties and laws; a\nbreach of the Charter of the League of Arab States and\nthe Common Arab Defence Pact; the Charter of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference; and the\nCharter of the United Nations. The decision also\nrenewed the Organization of the Islamic Conference's\ninvitation to Iraq to take the necessary steps to\ndemonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of\nKuwait and other neighbouring countries, both in\nwords and deeds.\nAgainst this backdrop, we would like to know\nwhere Iraq stands now vis-\u00e0-vis those resolutions and\nthe sincere calls made upon it by regional and\ninternational organizations. We note with regret that\nthe Government of Iraq, for a good 10 years now, has\nnot drawn the right lessons. It continues to reveal its\nnon-peaceful intentions and policies of aggression\ntowards the State of Kuwait and neighbouring\ncountries.\nThe remarks made by the Iraqi President and the\nannouncements by several high-ranking Iraqi officials\nlast month, together with the unjust Iraqi\nmisinformation campaign against Kuwait and the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, are perhaps the most\ncompelling evidence that the Iraqi regime is still\ndetermined to pursue a course of aggression and feels\nno sense of remorse or contrition over its actions of 2\nAugust 1990. Therefore, Kuwait calls on the\ninternational community to maintain its pressure on the\nGovernment of Iraq, with a view to forcing it to\nimplement  all relevant Security Council resolutions\nand to abandon its aggressive attitude, which seriously\njeopardizes the security and stability of the State of\nKuwait and of other States in the region.\nKuwait, for its part, supports all efforts made by\nthe United Nations to alleviate the suffering of the\nbrotherly people of Iraq, with whom we fully\nsympathize. We therefore welcome the improvements\nintroduced occasionally by the Security Council\nsanctions Committee established by resolution 661\n14\n\n(1990) into the operational methods of the\nhumanitarian programme, with a view to facilitating\nand expediting delivery of humanitarian materials to\nthe brotherly people of Iraq. We note with satisfaction\nthe report of the Secretary-General issued last week, in\nwhich he stated that the humanitarian programme had\nsucceeded in providing a great measure of assistance to\nmeet the urgent humanitarian needs of Iraq in all\nsectors, despite the many obstacles and difficulties that\nthe programme faces.\nAt the regional level, in keeping with Kuwait's\nkeen interest in ensuring security and stability in the\nArabian Gulf region, and in view of the close relations\nbetween the sister State of the United Arab Emirates\nand the friendly State of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\nwe support the position of the States of the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) on the question of the\nthree Emirates islands. We hope that the efforts being\nmade by the ad hoc GCC Tripartite Ministerial\nCommittee will prove successful in creating a bilateral\nnegotiating mechanism to resolve the current dispute\nover the islands in accordance with the norms and\nprinciples of international law and good\nneighbourliness. If negotiations fail to bring about a\nsolution, then the dispute should be referred to the\nInternational Court of Justice to resolve it in a\nsatisfactory manner. This will help bolster the\nmechanisms of reconciliation among the States of the\nregion and expand the channels of mutual interests and\nconfidence-building.\nIn the same vein, we would like warmly to\nwelcome the maritime border demarcation agreement\nbetween Kuwait and its sister the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. This accord reflects the depth of brotherly\nrelations between our two countries. It also represents a\nmodel of civilized cooperation in resolving border\ndisputes and problems. With that outcome, we look\nforward with interest to the forthcoming talks between\nKuwait and the friendly State of the Islamic Republic\nof Iran to complete the demarcation of maritime\nborders between the two countries.\nWe take this occasion to pay tribute to the\nwisdom shown by the leaders of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia and Yemen, which resulted in the signing of an\nagreement on the demarcation of the border between\nthe two countries. This will no doubt consolidate the\nunderpinnings of security and stability in the region.\nIn the context of the relentless search for a just,\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\nKuwait has been closely following the peace process\nsince its inception in Madrid in 1991. That process has\ntime and again experienced obstacles, risks and\ndeadlocks due to the unwillingness of the Israeli\nGovernment to carry out the accords concluded with\nthe Palestinian National Authority within the\nframework of the peace process. Israel has so far\ndemonstrated its non-commitment to, and non-\ncompliance with, the operational principles and\nframework of the peace process anchored chiefly in\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973), together with the principle of land for peace.\nIsraeli intransigence aborted the success of the\nrecent Camp David summit despite the immense and\ntireless efforts made by the United States\nAdministration. Here, Kuwait wishes to reiterate its\ncommitment to the Arab position of adherence to peace\nas a strategic option. We also reaffirm our belief that a\ncomprehensive and just peace will not be possible\nwithout the full restoration to the Palestinian people of\ntheir legitimate rights, including the right of return of\nthe Palestinian refugees, pursuant to paragraph 11 of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III), and the\nestablishment of their independent state on their\nnational territory, with Jerusalem as its capital. We also\ncall for the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian-\nIsraeli track, with a view to achieving full Israeli\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the\nborder line of 4 June 1967.\nAt this point, we wish to urge the active and\neffective facilitators in the peace process, especially\nthe United States of America, to redouble their efforts\nand to bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government\nto convince it that the only viable path to easing its\nsecurity concerns is a return to the framework and\nprinciples established at the Madrid Conference, in\norder to achieve a genuine peace that secures the\nreinstitution of lawful Arab rights to their legitimate\nowners.\nStill in the context of the Middle East, we would\nlike to express to our brothers in Lebanon \u2014 the\nPresident of the Republic, the Government and the\npeople \u2014 our warm congratulations on the restoration\nof national sovereignty over their liberated land after\nmore than 20 years of Israeli occupation, which left in\nits wake vast destruction in the regions of southern\nLebanon and western Bekaa. As a contribution to the\n15\n\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of southern Lebanon\nand with a sense of responsibility emanating from the\nclose brotherly bonds between Kuwait and Lebanon,\nthe Government of Kuwait has made a cash grant of\n$20 million and has requested the Kuwait Fund for\nEconomic Development to finance projects for\nrebuilding infrastructure in villages of the South.\nKuwait will in the meantime continue its support for\nLebanese Government efforts to extend sovereignty\nover all its national territory to safeguard Lebanon's\nterritorial integrity and independence.\nKuwait welcomes the positive developments at\nthe national reconciliation conference of Somali\nfactions that was held in Djibouti last month. We pay\ntribute to the sustained and sincere efforts made by the\nPresident of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar\nGuelleh. We hope that the remaining factions will join\nthe national reconciliation process in order to shore up\nthe unity and stability of Somalia, which, we hope, will\neventually bring that country back into the fold of\nArab, Islamic and international life. We take this\nopportunity to stress Kuwait's support for the people of\nSomalia in their efforts to rebuild State institutions and\nto reconstruct the country as a whole.\nTurning to the rest of Africa, Kuwait is following\nwith deep sorrow the conflicts and civil wars that have\nlong afflicted a number of countries. These conflicts\nimperil the peace and stability of many nations and\ndeplete their potentials, capabilities and resources.\nEven though the problems of Africa have come to be a\nfocus of the global agenda, and even though the United\nNations system has embarked on in-depth discussion\nand analysis of the root causes of those problems, the\nproposed solutions remain blueprints awaiting\nimplementation. The net result is that the continent\ncontinues to be plagued by bitter conflicts and painful\npolitical instability, which aggravate already intractable\neconomic and social problems, foremost among them\nforeign debt, poverty, illiteracy and the spread of\ncontagious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria,\nwhich afflict millions of people and claim the lives of\nhundreds of thousands of innocent victims every year.\nIt is very sad indeed that many countries in Africa\nare suffering from these problems at a time when the\nmodern world has made enormous progress in all areas\nof human activity. We therefore urge the international\ncommunity to pursue its efforts more vigorously to\nhelp bring peace and security to African nations and to\nassist them in meeting their economic and social\ndevelopment goals. A vital role can be played by the\ninternational aid agencies and financial institutions,\nwhich we hope will redouble their outreach efforts to\novercome Africa's daunting problems and challenges.\nKuwait believes that any such donor drive will not be\neffective unless and until African peoples and\nGovernments themselves shoulder their responsibilities\nand dedicate their full energies to lifting themselves up\nout of their current misery and onto the path of\nmainstream modern progress. Another key factor in\nthis process is the need to resolve disputes by peaceful\nmeans in order to create a climate of security and\nstability and to preserve sorely needed economic\nresources.\nThe world today is witnessing the emergence of\nseveral promising economic phenomena created by the\nimmense information and technology revolution that is\nsweeping the communication and trade sectors. Of\nparticular significance is the formation of numerous\ninternational and regional economic blocs that are\nseeking to remove customs restrictions and to liberate\ntrade among nations. In response, many developing\ncountries have made drastic changes in their economic\nand administrative structures in order to align\nthemselves with those transformations and to put\nthemselves in an advantageous position with respect to\neconomic globalization in the hope of achieving better\neconomic growth and progress.\nKuwait thinks that the phenomenon of\nglobalization, notwithstanding its merits, could have an\nadverse impact on the economies of developing\ncountries unless the very basis of North-South\neconomic relations is restructured in line with the\ntenets of mutual benefit, common interest, the need to\nnarrow the technology gap, and the removal of\nobstacles that impede the access of the products of\ndeveloping nations to the markets of the developed\nindustrialized countries in the interest of both groups.\nIn the meantime, developed countries should provide\nadequate economic assistance to developing nations to\nhelp them strengthen their infrastructures and build up\ntheir economies on a sound and solid foundation.\nIn this context, Kuwait has never shrunk from\ndoing its fair share to meet all its international and\nregional obligations towards the developing countries.\nOur assistance is channelled through international aid\nagencies and institutions as well as through the Kuwait\nFund for Economic Development. That fund has\nprovided loans and financial grants for many\n16\n\ndevelopment projects and programmes in scores of\ndeveloping countries. More than 96 countries on all\ncontinents have benefited from these loans and grants.\nWithin its means, Kuwait will remain committed to\nhelping the development efforts of developing\ncountries, because of our belief that overall\ndevelopment and broader participation and cooperation\nare essential for ensuring security and stability for all\ncountries of the world.\nWe remain hopeful at the outset of a new century\nthat the nations of the world will close ranks to fulfil\nthe noble principles and purposes of the United Nations\nCharter. We also hope that the Millennium Declaration\nwill be translated into a tangible reality that fulfils the\naspirations and the vision of peoples yearning to live in\na climate of security, peace, freedom and justice, and in\na world where the enormous power of science and\ntechnology will be harnessed to serve human\ndevelopment in all spheres of life and to enrich human\ncivilization.\nLet us make partnership and cooperation to build\na better tomorrow for our children our guiding motto in\nthe new century. Let us pledge ourselves to bequeath to\nthe generations of the coming century the assurance\nthat we have kept our faith to them, and that we have\nsown for them the seeds of goodness that will yield a\nbetter life."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at the current\nsession and to wish you every success in discharging\nyour duties.\nI would also like to pay full tribute to your\npredecessor, Minister Gurirab, whose vast diplomatic\nexperience and able guidance throughout the fifty-\nfourth session greatly contributed to its success and to\nthe ultimate triumph of the Millennium Summit.\nIt has been only 10 days since the historic event\nof the Millennium Summit secured an unprecedented\nquorum of the world's leaders to discuss at the highest\nlevel the role and place of the United Nations in the\nsystem of international relations in the new era. By\nadopting the Millennium Declaration, the international\ncommunity clearly demonstrated its support for the\nfundamental purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter, which continue to be the basis of\ninternational law and the main instrument that governs\ninternational relations.\nUkraine's active participation in the work of the\nMillennium Summit and in the Security Council\nSummit, which was held on the initiative of the\n6\n\nPresident of Ukraine, testifies to the special importance\nthat my country attaches to the activities of this\nuniversal Organization.\nLike most other States \u2014 and the Millennium\nSummit unequivocally reconfirmed this \u2014 Ukraine\ndenounces the threat or use of force as a means of\nsolving inter-State problems. We strongly believe that\nonly the United Nations possesses both the relevant\npowers and the wide range of tools and mechanisms to\naddress today's major global problems. These problems\nare the same today as they were several decades ago:\nwar, poverty, inequality in distribution of resources,\nrepression and discrimination.\nHaving gathered on 7 September at the level of\nheads of State and Government for the second time in\nUnited Nations history, the Security Council reaffirmed\nits readiness to bear an essential share of responsibility\nfor building a world free of fear, poverty and injustice.\nWe consider the most important achievement of\nthe Security Council Summit to have been the\ncommitment, reaffirmed at the highest level, to\nensuring the effective functioning of the system of\ncollective security and to enhancing the efficiency of\navailable mechanisms for preserving peace and, in\nparticular, for conducting peacekeeping operations. We\nbelieve that the United Nations will not be able\nadequately to respond to the challenges to peace and\nsecurity in the twenty-first century unless its\npeacekeeping potential is enhanced. Ukraine welcomes\nthe report of the Panel on United Nations Peace\nOperations, chaired by Ambassador Brahimi. My\ncountry finds most of its recommendations substantial\nand far-reaching and calls for their speedy\nimplementation.\nUkraine has always considered United Nations\npeacekeeping to be one of the most important raisons\nd'etre of this Organization, which is called upon \u201cto\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d.\nThat is precisely why since 1992 more than 12,000\nrepresentatives of Ukraine have participated in 20\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and missions.\nSince the beginning of this year, Ukraine, fully\nrecognizing its additional responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace as a member of the\nSecurity Council, has increased twentyfold its\ncontribution to peacekeeping operations.\nIn the course of the past eight months alone,\nUkraine has deployed a contingent of 650 troops with\nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\n(UNIFIL). We have also sent a group of military\nobservers to the United Nations Organization Mission\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),\nto Ethiopia and Eritrea, and have sent a group of\ncivilian police to the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET). The\ndeployment of a special Ukrainian police unit of 115\nservicemen with the United Nations police force in\nKosovo is being completed this week. Our military\ncontingent earmarked for the United Nations operation\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo stands in full\noperational readiness.\nRegrettably, it is common knowledge that human\nhistory can be called a chronicle of continuous wars\nand conflicts. I hope that at the end of the second\nmillennium, having learned from its tragic past,\nhumankind has finally grasped the simple truth \u2014 that\nit is necessary to fight the fires of wars long before\nthey have erupted, because even the costliest peace is\nmuch better than the cheapest war. This leads me to\nemphasize the importance of the most expeditious and\neffective implementation of the proposal put forward\nby the President of Ukraine at the Millennium Summit\nand at the Security Council Summit. He spoke in\nfavour of developing a comprehensive United Nations\nconflict prevention strategy, based on the large-scale\nuse of preventive diplomacy and peace-building.\nUkrainian experts stand ready for this work. I am glad\nto note that almost all the leaders who addressed the\nMillennium Summit recognized preventive action as a\npriority for the United Nations in maintaining peace.\nIn our view, the concept of regional centres on\nconflict prevention can become a practical step towards\ndeveloping a relevant United Nations strategy. In this\ncontext, Ukraine's recent proposal to establish a\nregional centre for ethnic studies in Kyiv, under the\nauspices of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), deserves proper\nattention. We think that the activities of such a centre,\nauthorized to monitor current developments in the\nsphere of inter-ethnic relations in the OSCE region and\ndirected at the timely detection of dangerous separatist\ntendencies, will be conducive to a further elaboration\nof the United Nations preventive strategy in\ncooperation with the OSCE.\nMy country is keenly following the process of\nconflict settlement in the neighbouring Balkans, the\ntroublesome region of Europe. While developments in\n7\n\nBosnia give us sufficient grounds for optimism about\nthe future of its peoples, the situation in Kosovo still\ncauses us serious concern. We are confident that a\npeaceful settlement in Kosovo has to be pursued in\nstrict compliance with Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999), with full respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia. In our view, it is impossible to resolve this\nproblem without determining the future status of\nKosovo following negotiations between the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the authorized\nrepresentatives of the province.\nUkraine is determined to intensify efforts aimed\nat promoting the final peaceful settlement of the so-\ncalled \u201cfrozen\u201d conflicts in the post-Soviet territories,\nparticularly in Abkhazia, Georgia; Nagorny Karabakh,\nAzerbaijan; and Transdniestria, Moldova. As a member\nof the group of Friends of the Secretary-General, which\nis promoting a peaceful settlement of the almost\ndecade-long Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, Ukraine cannot\nbut be concerned about the lack of real progress\ntowards peace in the region. I once again confirm the\ninvitation by President Kuchma to host in Yalta the\nnext round of negotiations between the Georgian and\nAbkhaz sides aimed at confidence-building.\nPresident Kuchma has also presented a feasible\nplan for the settlement of the Transdniestria conflict,\nbased on the principle of \u201cacquired status\u201d acceptable\nto all conflicting parties. Ukraine, together with the\nOSCE, is currently examining the possibility of\nreorganizing the peacekeeping mission in the region,\nwhich will be made up of peacekeeping contingents\nfrom Ukraine, Russia and other OSCE members. We\nvery much hope that in the long run these initiatives\nwill reinvigorate the process of resolving the conflict.\nThe credibility of the United Nations will always\nbe measured by its ability to provide an adequate\nresponse to threats to peace and security in every\nregion of the world. Today this principle should be\nupheld by giving special attention to the problems of\nthe African continent. The untold sufferings of the\npeoples of Africa, resulting from both intra-State and\ninter-State conflicts, are unlike those in any other part\nof the globe.\nUkraine is determined to make a practical\ncontribution to United Nations peace efforts aimed at\nresolving conflicts in Africa. This determination is\nreinforced by our aspiration to expand trade and\neconomic cooperation with our African partners. Let\nme repeat the words of the President of Ukraine at the\nSecurity Council Summit:\n\u201cUkraine looks forward to a century of African\nrenaissance and stands ready to hasten its\narrival.\u201d (S/PV.4194, p. 13)\nI would like to underline that, in resolving\nconflicts in Africa the international community has no\nalternative but to promote the need for strict adherence\nto the principles of sovereignty, political independence\nand territorial integrity of the countries of the region.\nThis has to be particularly emphasized in relation to the\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\nmost dangerous challenge to peace at the turn of the\ncentury. Ukraine calls on all parties to the Lusaka\nAgreement to comply fully with the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions and to implement their own\ncommitments.\nThe recent events in Sierra Leone have become a\nserious test for our Organization. They prove the urgent\nneed to consolidate international efforts, with a view to\nstrengthening the effectiveness of United Nations\npeacekeeping.\nI reiterate our position on the need to continue\nenhancing the sanctions regime against Angola's rebel\ngroup, UNITA. We are convinced that reducing\nUNITA's ability to wage war is an essential\nprerequisite for restoring peace in Angola. It should\nalso be borne in mind that the sanctions have to be\naccompanied by greater international efforts to resolve\nthis long-lasting conflict.\nWe note with optimism the latest developments in\nthe process of settlement in Somalia. This long-\nsuffering nation is painfully but steadily overcoming\nthe obstacles in its path to peace and stability.\nOver the past year an important step forward was\ntaken in advancing one of the integral parts of the\nMiddle East peace process \u2014 its Israeli-Lebanese\ncomponent. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from\nsouthern Lebanon in compliance with Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978) has created new conditions for\nfurther progress in the whole process. Ukraine\nsincerely hopes that Israel and Syria will also be able\nto achieve a breakthrough in their stalled negotiation\nprocess in the near future, and calls upon the parties to\nresume the dialogue as soon as possible.\n8\n\nWe are following closely the process of solving\nthe core issue of the Middle East problem \u2014 the\nquestion of Palestine. It is our firm belief that the\npolitical wisdom and farsightedness of the Israelis and\nPalestinians will eventually help them to reach a\nmutually acceptable compromise. We welcome the\n10 September decision by the Palestinian Central\nCouncil to postpone the date of proclamation of the\nState of Palestine. Ukraine hopes that, following\nstrenuous efforts on both sides, the Palestinian people\nwill finally exercise their right to self-determination\nand to their own statehood.\nThe promotion of disarmament and nuclear non-\nproliferation are among the crucial issues before the\nUnited Nations and the whole international community\nat the turn of the century. We are convinced that those\nprocesses should go along with the overall\nimprovement of the international situation in other\nspheres, the creation and practical implementation of\nuniversal security guarantees, unconditional adherence\nby States and international organizations to the norms\nand basic principles of international law and the\nconsolidation of an atmosphere of mutual trust.\nAs a country which has made outstanding\ncontributions to the process of practical nuclear\ndisarmament, Ukraine fully shares the concern that the\nattention of the international community to this issue\nhas substantially decreased. We believe that nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are the cornerstones\nof international security and a means of averting a\nglobal conflict. In our view, achieving the universality\nof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the\nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty is the best way to\nprevent nuclear proliferation and to ensure the\nelimination of nuclear weapons. It is the nuclear States\nthat should be in the vanguard of this process.\nThe problem of illegal arms trafficking, which\nhas acquired a global dimension, also requires a\nuniversal approach to its solution. The key role of the\nUnited Nations is indispensable in consolidating the\ninternational efforts to fight this evil.\nTurning now to the problem of the Security\nCouncil-imposed sanctions, I would like to reaffirm the\nposition of my country on this issue. Sanctions were\ndesigned as a powerful tool to ensure the\nimplementation of the Council's decisions. However,\nthey were eventually turned into ineffective and\nsometimes even harmful instruments. It is therefore\nabsolutely necessary to develop a clear and coherent\nmethodology for the imposition and lifting of sanctions\nthat takes into consideration the concerns of innocent\ncivilian populations and the interests of third countries.\nUkraine supports the recent Security Council\npractice of defining time limits of sanctions at the stage\nof their imposition. We believe that it is of primary\nimportance to develop objective criteria and\nmechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of sanctions\nand their impact \u2014 including on the target State. We\nalso support the immediate lifting of sanctions when\nthere are sufficient grounds to believe that they have\nserved their purpose. This is indeed the case as far as\nthe sanctions against Libya are concerned, where the\nSecurity Council should move, as soon as possible, to\nthe next stage and take a long-overdue action.\nAmong the major challenges of the new century,\nthe problem of HIV/AIDS occupies a special place.\nAIDS has become an epidemic of global proportions\nwith enormous human and social ramifications that go\nfar beyond the province of health alone. The time has\ncome for the United Nations to elaborate a\ncomprehensive agenda for action against this\npandemic. Aware of the magnitude of this problem, the\ndelegation of Ukraine, together with other sponsors has\npromoted the convening, as a matter of urgency, of a\nspecial session of the General Assembly on that\nquestion. We are encouraged by the wide support for\nthis idea and look forward to further work towards its\nrealization.\nWe are convinced that the multilateral forms of\ninternational cooperation have played and will continue\nto play a decisive role in the attainment of the goals of\nsustainable development. We support the reform efforts\nof the Administrator of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for improving the\nsituation in the field of mobilization of resources and\nenhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of its work.\nDuring the difficult period of economic\ntransition, the assistance to Ukraine by UNDP plays an\nimportant role by streamlining the efforts of various\ninternational partners. It also helps to alleviate the\ncomplex problems related to the elimination of the\nChernobyl disaster's consequences and the\ndecommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power\nplant.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude to the countries participating in the July\n9\n\ndonors' conference in Berlin, which pledged more than\n$320 million of additional funding for the\ntransformation of the shelter facility into an\nenvironmentally safe system. Almost $50 million still\nneeds to be raised to reach the amount required, and we\ncount on continuing international assistance in this\nregard. I believe this could be effectuated within the\nframework of the United Nations Chernobyl\nprogramme. Let me underline that these funds will be\naimed mainly at the implementation of realistic\nobjectives, specifically the decommissioning and\neventual closing down of the Chernobyl nuclear power\nplant by 15 December 2000, a decision that was\nreconfirmed by the President of Ukraine at the\nMillennium Summit.\nWe also hope that consideration at the current\nsession of the General Assembly of the item relating to\nthe integration of the countries with economies in\ntransition into the world economic system will make it\npossible to elaborate a common strategy to solve\nspecific problems of these countries.\nIn this context, we attach great importance to the\naccession of Ukraine to the World Trade Organization.\nInternational economic cooperation at the regional\nlevel is also of significance for Ukraine. I mean, in\nparticular, the development of our relations with the\nEuropean Union and interaction within the framework\nof the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization\nand the Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and\nRepublic of Moldova (GUUAM) group.\nFulfilling the concept of \u201chuman rights for all\u201d in\nthe next century is a task of global dimension. That is\nwhy strengthening and improving the international\nmonitoring of human rights violations becomes\nparticularly acute today. At the same time, we remain\nconvinced that the use of force cannot be considered an\nadequate means of ensuring respect for human rights.\nI wish to emphasize that adherence to and\nprotection of human rights became the key policy\nprinciple of my country. Ukraine has signed and\nratified all basic international documents in the field of\nhuman rights and put in place at the national level\neffective mechanisms for their implementation. This\nyear Ukraine adopted a decision to abolish capital\npunishment.\nThe time that has passed since the historic Rome\nConference clearly reaffirmed the epoch-making\nsignificance of the document it adopted. We consider\nthe International Criminal Court the only viable\ndemocratic mechanism of a universal character to\nenforce compliance with and respect for international\nhumanitarian law.\nI would like to join previous speakers in\nexpressing our great hopes for the continuing role of\nthe United Nations in bringing solutions to global\nproblems. Given the complexity and the\nmultidimensional nature of this task, our Organization\nneeds to stand on a solid financial footing. We hope\nthat this session will enable us to speed up the process\nof reforming and improving the mechanisms of the\napportionment of the United Nations expenses on the\nbasis of objective economic criteria. Therefore, the\nprocess of United Nations reform, initiated three years\nago, should get additional impetus.\nThere is also a need to reactivate the efforts\naimed at Security Council reform, which is the key\nelement within the process of renewing the United\nNations. This was rightly emphasized in the statements\nof many world leaders at the Millennium Summit.\nThe absence of substantive progress on this issue\nlimits the capacities of the Council as the major\ninstrument of collective security. I would like to\nreiterate the position of Ukraine that the Security\nCouncil's comprehensive reform should be based on\nthe norms and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nIn our view, increased representation in the Security\nCouncil for all regional groups should remain an\nessential principle. The interests of both developed and\ndeveloping countries have to be taken into account.\nUkraine believes that the necessary balance within an\nexpanded Security Council can be achieved through an\nincrease in both categories of its members.\nBy pursuing the path of strengthening the United\nNations and building up its institutions on democratic\nfoundations, the international community reinforces its\nown capacity to meet the challenges of the time and to\ncreate a climate of justice in international relations and\nan atmosphere of mutual respect between States,\npeoples and civilizations.\nIn the course of the historic Millennium Summit,\nthe international community, enriched by this\nOrganization's half-century of experience, outlined the\nroad map to be followed by mankind in the twenty-first\ncentury. Only by intensifying concerted and resolute\nefforts to attain our determined goals will we realize\n10\n\nthe ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. After\nall, this is the only raison d'\u00eatre for our Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like, on behalf\nof the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic, to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\nour Assembly stands to gain a great deal from your\nable leadership and from your wide knowledge of\ninternational affairs.\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the\nguidance he provided to the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe twentieth century has been an epoch of great\ntechnological and scientific discoveries and\nachievements. This is indeed one of the positive things\nabout the past century that we all can be proud of.\nHowever, this same past century has brought enormous\ncalamities and left manifold complex problems as we\nenter the twenty-first century.\nCertainly, we have to accept the responsibility for\nresolving them and in order to succeed in addressing\nthis daunting task, we must lay down sound basic\nfoundations aimed at encouraging and building peace\nand international cooperation for development. This is\nthe lofty goal of our new age that we should all strive\nto achieve.\nIn preparation for the new millennium, a number\nof international conferences were held on different\nissues under the auspices of the United Nations, such\nas the World Summit for Children in New York, the\nEarth Summit in Rio, the World Social Summit in\nCopenhagen, the World Conference on Women in\nBeijing, UNCTAD X in Bangkok and other\ninternational conferences of equal importance. The\nmain objectives of those assemblies were to solve the\nmultifaceted problems that have occurred in the world,\nwith the hope that the new millennium will face\nminimal risk in every area and that humankind will\nconcentrate its intelligence and resources on\ndeveloping the economy, civilized culture and\nprosperity in equality, in a just and peaceful\nenvironment free from violent confrontation, with\nconcern for poverty, disease and others. However, the\nobjectives set forth by these conferences have not lived\nup to our expectations. In addition, new challenges that\nare far more complex have erupted in the light of\nglobalization.\nThe South Summit of the Group of 77 and China,\nwhich was held in Havana in April this year, rightly\nidentified the positive and negative sides of\nglobalization and put forward a collective guideline for\nfuture action. The conference was of the view that the\nunsolved problems are the well-known issues of the\ngrowing debt, the unfavourable world trade measures\nimposed on goods from the developing countries  in\nparticular, the least developed ones  as well as\nhuman resources that have not yet been developed to\ncope with new technologies and others. Overall, all\nthese issues need to be seriously dealt with together\nbetween the North and the South, so as to meet the\nchallenges and make use of favourable opportunities\nthat will lead to a North-South cooperation based on\nequality and mutual interest, as explicitly expressed in\nthe Havana Declaration.\nThe achievements of humankind in the past\ncentury are of immense value. We believe that, if these\nachievements are correctly used, happiness and\nprosperity will be brought to the new generation of the\nnext century. Nonetheless, we are still yet concerned\nover the challenges that the new generation has to face.\nToday many young girls and boys worldwide have not\nenjoyed happy lives and lacked opportunity for\neducation. Moreover, they are subject to exploitation\n6\n\nfor the purpose of pornography, prostitution and drug\naddiction, that destroy their own future, their families,\nthe society and, subsequently, becomes the source of\ninternational terrorism.\nSimilarly, the gender issue is also of great\nimportance. Although equality between women and\nmen is respected and women's participation in social\nlife has increased, poverty and violence continue to be\nthe major obstacles that affect women's life. To\nsuccessfully tackle this problem, countries around the\nworld should help each other and devote the necessary\nresources to this domain.\nDrug abuse continues to be a subject of major\nconcern for the international community. In the Lao\nPeople's Democratic Republic, the Lao Government\nhas implemented, with the cooperation and assistance\nof friendly countries and international organizations \nin particular the United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme  a number of projects with a\nview to remedying the effects of drug abuse.\nExperience has shown that people involved in poppy\ncultivation continue to remain poor. Therefore, in order\nto definitely solve this problem, it is imperative to\ncarry out alternative development projects, ensure food\nsecurity, enable people to earn more by cultivating\ncrops other than poppies, as well as traditional\ncultivation. The Lao Government is determined to\ncontinue its efforts in drug control and supervision. It\nis our hope that the international community will lend a\nstrong helping hand in order to help us to overcome our\ndifficulties as soon as possible for the bright future of\nour children.\nWhile the world is entering the new millennium,\na number of regional conflicts have been satisfactorily\nsettled, thus responding to the aspirations of the\naffected nations. However, at the same time, many\nother regional conflicts remain unsolved and continue\nto cause pain and suffering to the people directly\ninvolved.\nIn the Middle East, durable peace has not been\nensured: the inalienable national and fundamental\nrights of the Palestinian people have not yet been\nexercised. We welcome the resumption of peace\nnegotiations between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization. The two parties should seize\nthis opportunity to write a new page of history based\non peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation\namong the peoples in the region. In this perspective,\nwe look forward to seeing the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State and of respect for an\nexistence of all States in the region, thus ensuring\ndurable peace and cooperation between the nations, in\nparticular between the Arab States and Israel.\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\napplied against the Republic of Cuba continues to\ncause enormous difficulties and damage to the Cuban\npeople. In compliance with the relevant resolutions of\nthe General Assembly, we urge that an end be put to\nthis restrictive commercial practice, which runs counter\nto the principles of the Charter, international law and\nthe present world trend.\nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic is\nfollowing closely the situation in the Korean peninsula.\nWe welcome the outcome of the Korean Summit\nbetween Chairman Kim Jong 11 of the National\nDefense Commission of the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and President Kim Dae Jung of the\nRepublic of Korea, who met in Pyongyang last June\nand laid down an important foundation in response to\nthe aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful\nreunification of Korea and the settlement of the\nproblems in the Korean peninsula through peaceful\nnegotiations, which contributed thereby to the\npromotion of peace, stability and cooperation in the\nregion.\nOn 2 December 2000, the Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic will commemorate its twenty-\nfifth anniversary. Over this period, the Lao people have\nupheld the spirit of patriotism, self-sufficiency, and\nstrength and have attracted assistance and cooperation\nfrom the international community. They have made\ntremendous accomplishments in national construction.\nAs a result, their living standard has gradually\nimproved. The most outstanding achievement, attained\nfor the first time in the country's history, is that we\nhave reached self-sufficiency in rice production and\neven have a surplus for export. The socio-economic\ninfrastructure has been continuously expanded, the\nState is governed by the rule of law and freedom and\ndemocracy are respected and constantly promoted. The\nsolidarity of the Lao people of all ethnic groups has\nbeen further strengthened. These are all fundamental\nfactors in ensuring political stability and social order.\nThanks to the policy of renewal consistent with the\nmechanisms of the market economy, the development\nof the people's right to self-determination and an open-\ndoor policy in our international relations, we are\n7\n\nconvinced that the Lao People's Democratic Republic\nwill be able to emerge from underdevelopment in the\nnear future.\nGlobalization has had an uneven impact on the\ndevelopment of every country, because each nation is\nat a different stage in the development process. While\nsome developing economies are making use of the\nincreasing economic opportunities, a large number of\ndeveloping countries continue to be marginalized and\nare therefore not in a position to benefit from this\nprocess. Most countries in the developing world\ncontinue to face problems of access to markets, capital\nand technology. Many are obliged to undertake painful\nstructural reforms that are not compatible with their\nrealities and have an undesirable negative impact that\nimpedes their integration into the world economy.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a need to build a\nfavourable environment that would enable the\ndeveloping countries to compete in the world trading\nsystem and to fully benefit from globalization. The\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in helping to\nmake this happen.\nAs we bid farewell to the twentieth century,\nhumanity is still yearning for a world of peace, a world\nfree from want and misery, a world governed by\ninternational relations based on respect for the national\nsovereignty of States, cooperation for development and\npeaceful coexistence between peoples. The\ninternational community is therefore duty-bound to\nincrease its cooperation in all possible areas so as to\nensure that the objectives of the United Nations\nSummit Declaration are achieved and to bring benefits\nto peoples throughout the world, as well as guarantees\nto new generations of a better life and a more\nprosperous future. In this spirit, I wish the present\nsession great success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I join previous speakers in\ncongratulating the President on his well-deserved\nelection to preside over this Millennium Assembly. I\nam confident that, with his wisdom and consummate\ndiplomatic skill, he will steer the Assembly to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nLet me also express our appreciation to Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, for his\n24\n\nexemplary leadership as president of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, especially in the\nrun-up to the Summit. Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nalso deserves our unqualified tribute for his innovative\nleadership to prepare the United Nations for greater\nchallenges ahead.\nNepal wholeheartedly welcomes Tuvalu as the\nnewest member of the United Nations family. We\ncongratulate the people and Government of that Pacific\nisland country on this happy occasion of joining the\nworld body as an independent nation.\nLast week the heads of State and Government\nassembled in this Hall of the people to ponder\nmeasures to address the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury, and reaffirmed their faith in the United\nNations as the central instrument for promoting peace,\nprosperity and justice. The vision given us by the\nSummit's Millennium Declaration will be a guide for\nthe global community, and particularly for the United\nNations, in the days ahead. Nepal welcomes the\nDeclaration and pledges its commitment to implement\nit with the utmost seriousness.\nMy Prime Minister, addressing the Summit,\nexpressed the view that the future will judge us by the\nability of our leadership to make a difference in\npeople's lives. We in Nepal expect the global\ncommunity to work in cooperation and solidarity, in a\ntrue spirit of partnership, to change for the better the\ndestiny of every man, woman and child around the\nworld.\nAs we enter a new century and a new millennium,\nthe world is replete with paradoxes. It now has fewer\ninter-State wars, but numerous civil wars. Science and\ntechnology have made unprecedented advances, but\ndiseases like AIDS still defy treatment. More people\nenjoy democracy and freedom, but terrorism still draws\nyouth. The walls of frontiers are crumbling in the\nglobalized economy, but the assertion of cultural\nidentity has increased. The United Nations has to work\nin the midst of these paradoxes.\nThe United Nations has succeeded remarkably in\nbringing peace in some situations and failed in others.\nIts involvement has eased tensions in the Central\nAfrican Republic and Tajikistan. East Timor is heading\ninto independence in relative calm. Kosovo is engaged\nin building democratic institutions. Israel has\nwithdrawn its forces from southern Lebanon, a\nwithdrawal which has vastly improved the prospects of\na comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nStill durable peace remains as elusive as ever. In\nessence, it entails a culture of peace founded on\ndisarmament and the peaceful resolution of conflicts,\nas well as on measures that remove the root causes of\nconflict \u2014 poverty and exclusion.\nLasting peace cannot be secured until nuclear\nweapons, which constitute the major threat to global\nsecurity, are eliminated in a time-bound manner. Nor\ncan it be achieved without the complete eradication of\nother weapons of mass destruction. We consider that\nweapons delivery systems and the so-called national\nmissile defence systems threaten the peace as well.\nSmall arms and light weapons have killed more\npeople than all weapons of mass destruction combined.\nWe must turn our backs on the guns by controlling\nsmall arms and light weapons. In this context, we\nwelcome the proposed conference on small arms to be\nheld in 2001.\nConflicts disturb Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin\nAmerica. The Middle East is yet to conclude the final\nsettlement and be at peace with itself. The Balkans are\nstill rife with dispute, though of a lesser extent now.\nSouth Asia is in the perennial pain of low intensity war.\nTerrorists are on the prowl in many places, exploiting\nthe fragility of States. As a result, thousands of\ninnocent lives have been lost. The action of the\nSecurity Council, which is the world's sentry, has been\ntoo little, too late in many situations; it has let\nemerging disputes descend into full-blown conflicts.\nNepal urges the Security Council to act in a timely\nmanner, promptly, decisively and adequately to prevent\nconflagrations.\nNepal has always been an active participant in\nUnited Nations peace operations. Nepalese\npeacekeepers have served with impeccable\nprofessionalism and dedication and have earned a name\nfor themselves. Many valiant Nepalese Blue Helmets\nhave laid down their lives in the service of world\npeace. The recent death of Private Devi Ram Jaishi, a\nNepalese peacekeeper, while defending peace in East\nTimor, rekindles our commitment to abiding peace,\nwherein no one needs to lose a father, husband or son\nto violence.\nAs host to the United Nations Regional Centre for\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal\n25\n\nis strongly committed to enhancing the Centre's\ncontribution to peace and disarmament, and is fully\nprepared to meet its obligation to house the Centre in\nKathmandu.\nThe report (A/55/305) of the panel on the United\nNations peace operations provides a wealth of ideas to\nput peacekeeping on a sound footing and to improve\npeace and security in the world. My delegation agrees\nwith the tenor of the report, and will be willing to\nexamine it in greater detail as it comes up for closer\nscrutiny.\nA survey of the present trouble spots on earth\nwould lead us to one unmistakable conclusion: most\nconflicts have poverty and exclusion at their root. All\ntoo often, we tend to treat the symptoms, not the cause.\nNepal strongly believes that a durable peace will\ncontinue to elude us as long as we do not eliminate\ndehumanizing poverty and deprivation. Prime Minister\nKoirala aptly described at the Summit the vicious circle\nof poverty and conflict, and asked the world\ncommunity to redouble its efforts to reduce poverty in\nsearch of peace. That deserves serious consideration.\nToday more than one fifth of humanity lives on\nless than a dollar a day. Poverty, illiteracy and diseases\nare rife in the poor countries. Unemployment among\nyouth is rampant. A growing population finds itself\nscrambling over shrinking resources in a stagnant\neconomy, which has been the case in most developing\ncountries. The AIDS pandemic has become a major\nscourge of the developing world, particularly in Africa.\nUnscrupulous leaders, often for narrow political gains,\nfish in the troubled waters and incite violence, which\nshatters the fragile economy further, making the next\ncycle of violence inevitable and even more deadly.\nIf we are ever to achieve lasting peace, we must\nreduce poverty and build peace from there. We\nsubscribe to the targets, suggested by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report (A/54/2000), and adopted by the\nSummit, to reduce poverty and promote development\nin the developing countries. World conferences, one\nafter another, have concluded that this is the only way\nforward. A series of their mid-term reviews has\nreaffirmed this conclusion; yet, sadly, nothing much\nhas changed.\nIn global forums, both North and South have\nagreed to work together for accelerated growth and\ndevelopment in the South, to open the markets in the\nrich countries to the products of the poor countries and\nto improve access of the developing countries to\ntechnology in the advanced countries; to relieve the\npoor countries of their debt obligations; and to promote\nsocial development and human rights. The global\ncommitments are forgotten before the ink on them\ndries. We must narrow the gap between what we say\nand what we do.\nMost advanced countries have, for instance,\nsorely lagged in meeting their pledges of development\nassistance. More aid now means no need for it later.\nNepal commends those rich countries that have met the\naid targets, and urges others to do so. It is disturbing\nthat the United Nations funds and programmes, which\nare the main sources of unconditional assistance, have\nbeen facing a decline in their resource base; we call on\nthe global community to replenish their fungible\nresources.\nAlthough global trade has increased several times\nin the last few years, the developing countries \u2014\nespecially, the least developed ones \u2014 are losing\nground as their share in world trade diminishes, due\nmainly to the declining terms of trade for them.\nGlobalization has gained momentum as people, trade\nand services move across borders at an exceptional\nspeed. And information technology has opened a whole\nnew vista of communication, including e-commerce.\nMuch as both of these phenomena have potential\nbenefits for all, they have benefited some more than\nothers, widening the disparity between the rich and the\npoor. We believe that the wealthy countries, together\nwith the World Trade Organization, must work towards\nmore equitable and rule-based trade to narrow the\nincome gaps, promote equitable globalization and\nbridge the digital divide.\nCountries in the South are sinking under the\nunbearable burden of foreign debt. While we appreciate\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\nInitiative of the rich countries, we also urge them to\nexpedite its implementation and expand its scope to\ncover all the least developed countries and other\ncountries in serious difficulties, not of their own\nmaking.\nForeign direct investment has become a motor of\ngrowth for a few, but the vast majority of developing\ncountries remain untouched by this new phenomenon.\nUnderstandably, markets drive investors in their\ninvestment decisions, yet Nepal believes that our\ndevelopment partners can encourage investors, through\n26\n\na vigorous guarantee and incentive scheme, to invest in\nthose countries that have yet to see much foreign direct\ninvestment.\nThe unsustainable patterns of production and\nconsumption in the rich countries, together with the\npopulation pressure in the poor countries, have taken a\nhigh toll of the environment, the common human\nheritage. The global agreements to promote sustainable\ndevelopment and to reduce greenhouse gases remain\nlargely unfulfilled. As for Nepal, we have taken\nmeasures to preserve the environment through\nestablishing norms, reducing pollutants, extending the\nforest coverage and building the green component into\ndevelopment projects. We are also studying the Kyoto\nProtocol with a view to becoming a party to it.\nThe least developed countries, particularly the\nland-locked ones like Nepal, are confronted with the\nmost formidable challenges of development. Over the\nyears poverty in these countries has increased and their\nshare of world trade has sharply declined. In Nepal, for\ninstance, more than 50 per cent of the people are\nilliterate and live below the poverty line. Lack of\naccess to the sea not only makes transportation difficult\nfor us, but also deprives us of sea-based resources.\nThese disadvantaged countries therefore need special\nmeasures to overcome their development constraints,\nincluding better transportation facilities for the land-\nlocked countries so that they can reduce poverty and\njoin the global economic mainstream. We believe that\nthe conference on the least developed countries to be\nheld in Brussels next year will open up a new vista of\ncooperation for their development.\nNepal hopes that the high-level event on\nfinancing for development next year will find reliable\nmeans for funding development in the developing\nworld. It must energize both North-South and South-\nSouth cooperation to fulfil shared objectives.\nAs a functioning democracy, Nepal is committed\nto human rights and good governance. We have a\nGovernment that is accountable to people and pledged\nto serve them best. As democracy, development and\nhuman rights reinforce each other, we strive to promote\nthem together so that people have the opportunity to\nrealize their full potential. Nepal is a party to most\nhuman rights instruments, and we hold the view that\ncivil and political rights are as important as economic,\nsocial and cultural rights \u2014 including the right to\ndevelopment, for the healthy progress of society.\nTherefore we oppose any selective use of human rights\nvalues to suit vested political interests.\nI also wish to report to the Assembly that Nepal\nhas recently freed the remaining few thousand bonded\nlabourers and established the National Human Rights\nCommission. During the Summit we also signed the\noptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child, protocols on the sale of children and on\nchildren in armed conflicts.\nToday more than 22 million people have taken\nrefuge outside the country of their origin, and millions\nare displaced within \u2014 sometimes because of natural\ncalamities, but very often because of their\nGovernments or because of terrorists. Nepal itself has\nnearly 100,000 refugees from Bhutan; their presence\nhas created economic, social and environmental\nproblems for us. Nepal believes that both State and\nnon-State actors must respect the human rights of the\nweak and vulnerable, including those of women and\nchildren.\nThe security of small States has remained a\nperennial concern for us. During the cold war the fear\nwas of being trampled in the super-Power rivalry; in\nthe post-cold-war era the fear is that small States will\nbe economically, militarily or politically bullied if they\nact in a manner that incurs the wrath of the stronger\nStates. It is saddening that even the United Nations is\nforced frequently to acquiesce to the designs of the\npowerful. We urge the international community to\nuphold the rule of law and the rich and powerful\ncountries to respect the right of small States to\nsovereign independence, something they zealously\nguard themselves.\nWhenever there are problems anywhere on the\nlength and breadth of the planet, the United Nations is\ncalled on to inspire and act, without necessarily being\ngiving the requisite resources. Since there is no\nalternative to the United Nations, we must revitalize\nand reinforce it through comprehensive reforms so that\nit can rise to the challenges of changing times. It is\nimperative to restore the primacy of the General\nAssembly, which is the closest thing to a world\nparliament, so as to bring the will of the peoples to\nbear on vital global policies.\nThe Security Council reform process has dragged\non for quite a while. Although there is no quick fix, nor\nshould one be pursued, it is time to give reforms shape\nand make the Council more representative in\n27\n\ncomposition, more transparent in function and more\ncapable of keeping peace. The Security Council, by\ndoing too little too late, has often proved part of the\nproblem, rather than of the solution. We must change\nit.\nNow that the recent Summit has recognized\npoverty and social exclusion as the principal cause of\nconflict, it is critical that we focus our attention on\nreinforcing the Economic and Social Council on a par\nwith the Security Council on economic matters. We\nmust work towards making the Economic and Social\nCouncil capable of coordinating the funds and\nprogrammes within the United Nations and with the\nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\nOrganization and other outside bodies.\nNepal applauds the Secretary-General for the\nsilent and continuous revolution at the United Nations\nin search of economy and excellence. Indeed, there is a\nconstant need to regenerate and reinvent the world\nbody to attune it to the emerging challenges in a\nchanging world.\nSadly, the United Nations has to limp from one\nyear to the next as some of the key contributors fail to\nlive up to their treaty obligations. We believe that the\ncardinal principle for apportioning financial obligation\nshould be the capacity to pay based on one's share of\nworld gross national product, with special\nresponsibility on the part of the permanent members of\nthe Security Council in peacekeeping budgets. It is\nmorally indefensible to make the poorer countries\nsubsidize the richer countries to keep the United\nNations and its peacekeeping activities going. We call\non all Member States to pay their dues in full, on time\nand without conditions.\nSouth Asia has one fifth of the world's people,\nbut lacks recognition and clout commensurate with its\nsize and potential. The only way for it to gain the place\nit deserves is through regional cooperation. Yet we in\nthe region have not been able to work closely and\ncohesively for the greater good of our peoples. The\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is\nvirtually at a standstill. Nepal urges all fellow South\nAsian countries to work collectively for the shared\nprosperity of our peoples. Time will not be kind to us if\nwe fail to seize the opportunity."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to\nparticipate in this historic session on behalf of His\nExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, President of\nthe Republic of Liberia.\nI am pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session. My delegation acknowledges the\nastute diplomatic skills and esteemed wisdom that you\nbring to this important assignment. We are therefore\nassured of a successful convocation, and assure you of\nthe full cooperation of the Liberian delegation.\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia,\nmy brother and colleague, for the very able manner in\nwhich he conducted the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nIn the same vein, I commend our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision, far-\nsightedness and the efficient manner in which he\ncontinues to carry out his mandate.\nThis session has the challenge of determining\nhow the international community will address the\nprimary issues of peace and development. It has the\ntask of assisting in preventing intra-State, inter-State\nand regional conflicts, as well as of ensuring that we\npursue balanced and non-selective approaches to their\nsolution. In addition, it must consider how to bring\nequity to the present international financial structure.\nDespite the much heralded dividends that globalization\noffers, developing countries are still beset by mounting\ndebt burdens, unfair trade practices, declining official\ndevelopment assistance, poor health delivery systems\nand inadequate resource flows. An improved\nenvironment for global interaction, sensitive to the\nneeds of developing countries, is a dire necessity that\nmust not be ignored during our deliberations.\nThe purposes and principles of the Charter have\nproved to be of durable value over the years. Today, as\nin the past, Liberia reaffirms its commitment to this\ninstrument. The machinery that has evolved continues\nto be an indispensable framework for better\ninternational relations. But Member States cannot\ncontinue to support the United Nations in words only,\nand must avoid resorting to the expediency of\nexploiting it in the pursuit of narrow national aims that\nconsistently discredit others.\nAt the dawn of this millennium, the United\nNations performance will be measured principally by\nits capability to sustain and protect the universal values\nof liberty, equity and solidarity, tolerance, non-\nviolence, respect for nature and shared responsibility,\nas endorsed by the Millennium Summit a few weeks\nago. Liberia intends to be a part of the process.\n2\n\nThere are areas of the United Nations that need\nconstant attention and improvement. Liberia and other\nMember States have spoken of the need to deal with\nsome of the structural and institutional malaise that\ncontinues to undermine the Organization's\neffectiveness. As emphasized in my address to the\nMillennium Summit, we must, first, review the\ninequitable representation of the world's people\nreflected in the present structure of the Security\nCouncil; secondly, review the undemocratic processes\nof decision-making in the Security Council; and,\nthirdly, review the continuous violations, with apparent\nimpunity, of the United Nations Charter by the big, the\nrich and the powerful.\nIndeed, when the Organization was constructed,\nfive nations were entrusted with the responsibility of\noverseeing the entire world. The prevailing\ncircumstances justified this dispensation, and Liberia, a\nsignatory to the Charter, reasoned that the arrangement\nwas acceptable. Time has unfolded new realities that\nmake the arrangement of old unrealistic, unjustifiable\nand certainly unacceptable.\nThere is a need to take into account existing\npolitical, economic and security realities. I need hardly\nsay that one area of concern to Liberia is the use of the\nveto in the Security Council \u2014 a use that, on some\noccasions, has proved to be in conflict with the noble\nobjectives of the Charter.\nLiberia is interested in peace, justice,\ndevelopment and economic progress for its people, and\nwill not restrain its voice on issues that are vital to all\nnations and on which it should speak with an equally\nauthoritative voice.\nMindful that peace can translate into a sustained\nclimate for development, Liberia has continued to work\nwithin the framework of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to make peace in our\nsubregion a reality. In this regard, Liberia was\nprivileged to assume the mandate given to President\nCharles Ghankay Taylor by his colleagues, heads of\nState of ECOWAS, in Abuja in May 2000.\nIn keeping with consultations held among the\nChairman of ECOWAS, the Chairman of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the President of\nNigeria, and the President of the Gambia, hosted by the\nPresident of Liberia, in Monrovia on 26 July 2000, a\nnew leader and interlocutor of the Revolutionary\nUnited Front (RUF) has been named by the RUF high\ncommand, through a letter to the Chairman of\nECOWAS. Thus Corporal Foday Sankoh was removed\nfrom the peace process in Sierra Leone. Additionally,\nthe new RUF leadership has indicated, in writing, its\nwillingness to accept a ceasefire, to return to positions\nheld at the signing of the Lom\u00e9 Agreement on 7 July\n1999, to accept the deployment of an ECOWAS\ncontingent of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL) into RUF positions and to proceed\nwith the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration\nprogrammes.\nLiberia, along with other ECOWAS member\nStates, has also called upon the new RUF leadership to\nshow good faith by returning all seized arms,\nammunition and equipment to UNAMSIL. It has been\nreported that some armoured personnel carriers have\nbeen returned to UNAMSIL, but we must continue to\ninsist on full restitution.\nLiberia wishes to take this opportunity to again\ncondemn the taking of United Nations peacekeepers by\nthe RUF, an act that challenged and undermined our\nconcerted efforts to ensure collective security.\nLikewise, the recent attacks on United Nations\npersonnel in East Timor and Macenta, Guinea, are\nunacceptable and warrant the collective actions of\nMember States of the United Nations to prevent any\nfuture attacks against United Nations personnel. We\nmust send a clear and unambiguous message to all\ngroups that the people of the world intend to\nadequately protect those individuals commissioned to\ncarry out specific assignments for and on behalf of the\nUnited Nations, whether in the area of peacekeeping or\nin the discharge of other humanitarian services.\nThe Government of Liberia has expressed its\nsupport for Security Council resolution 1306 (2000),\nwhich calls for an end to the smuggling of diamonds\nfrom Sierra Leone. As evidence of this, my\nGovernment has committed itself to undertaking\nseveral initiatives, including the enactment of a statute\ncriminalizing the export of undocumented or\nuncertified diamonds; the enforcement of legislation\nrequiring the Central Bank of Liberia to issue\ncertificates of origin, in line with existing laws; and the\ndevelopment of a transparent process, with the\nassistance of experts from the International Monetary\nFund and the World Bank.\nAfter the Liberian civil war our Government took\nseveral measures to consolidate peace and security in\n3\n\nour subregion, especially since many disgruntled\nformer combatants sought refuge in neighbouring\ncountries. The Government of Liberia voluntarily\ndestroyed, with the assistance of ECOWAS and the\nUnited Nations, more than 21,000 small arms and more\nthan 3 million rounds of ammunition. The Government\nof Liberia also signed the protocol to the ECOWAS\nsmall arms Moratorium.\nDespite these measures, and the current\nimposition of an unjust arms embargo against Liberia,\narmed insurgents from the neighbouring country of\nGuinea have attacked Liberia for the third time. The\nrepeated violations of Liberia's territorial integrity by\narmed insurgents from the area of the Guinea-Sierra\nLeone borders have been reported to this Assembly and\nthe Security Council, the OAU and ECOWAS. Though\ngenerally unacknowledged and not condemned, in\nApril 1999 there was an incursion from Guinea,\nfollowed by another in August of the same year.\nA third and most recent attack emanating from\nthe Republic of Guinea is ongoing and has resulted in\nthe loss of lives and property and the displacement of a\nlarge number of our people.\nWe are alarmed by the large quantities of new\narms and ammunition being used by the insurgents\ncoming from Guinea, and the implications for ongoing\narmed conflicts and potential hotbeds in our subregion.\nThe repatriation of some 32,000 refugees to\nLiberia by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been\nsuspended as a result of the armed incursion. Indeed,\nLiberia is a stakeholder in the peace and security of the\nsubregion, and especially in bringing the illegal arms\ntrade in West Africa to an end.\nThe inviolability of the borders between Liberia,\nGuinea, and Sierra Leone remains a crucial issue. We\ncall, once more, for a monitoring presence of the\nUnited Nations at these borders to monitor all crossing\npoints capable of vehicular traffic. We recognize the\nenormous cost of policing the entire length of the\nborders and suggest the utilization of an airborne\nmulti-spectral service to detect any unusual movements\nof any type along the entire border. Intelligence\ngathered therefrom could prove useful to the three\ncountries and the international community at large. The\ncost of this service is reasonable and could be\nunderwritten by the international community.\nThe Government of Liberia wishes to bring to the\nattention of this Assembly the maltreatment of Liberian\nand Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea, which was\nincited by a speech given by the President of Guinea,\nGeneral Lansana Cont\u00e9, on 9 September 2000, and\nconfirmed by Human Rights Watch. The refugees have\nbeen arrested, beaten and some even raped.\nThese actions are in violation of international\nconventions and we appeal to the international\ncommunity to call upon the Guinean authorities to\nrespect and to protect all refugees living within their\nterritory. The attack on Guinea, while condemnable, is\nno excuse for such inhumane treatment meted out\nagainst innocent refugees.\nLiberia remains committed to the pursuit of peace\nand stability, both at home and in the subregion, and in\nso doing, will assiduously struggle for the socio-\neconomic uplifting of its people and those of the\nsubregion under the ECOWAS Treaty.\nIn my intervention last year, I renewed my\nGovernment's request for the Security Council to lift\nthe arms embargo imposed on Liberia eight years ago\nin 1992. I advanced reasons in support of this request,\nprincipal among which was the constitutional duty to\ndefend the territorial boundaries of Liberia and to\nprotect all individuals therein, and especially in light of\nthe repeated armed incursions into Liberia by\ndissidents from Guinea. Again, in early July 2000 there\nwas another incursion into Liberia from the same\ncountry by dissidents with the declared objective of\noverthrowing the duly elected Government of President\nCharles Ghankay Taylor. As I speak, there is an\nongoing war between Government forces and the\ndissidents.\nAlthough our repeated requests for the lifting of\nthe arms embargo have not received a favourable\nresponse from the Security Council, we again put this\nmatter before that body for urgent consideration.\nThe present security situation within Liberia and\nthe West African subregion compels us to seek removal\nof these restrictions, so that the Government of Liberia\ncan acquire the means to protect its citizens and others\nwithin the territorial confines of the country, as well as\nto maintain a stable environment. On the other hand,\nthe continued existence of an arms embargo against\nLiberia in the midst of repeated armed aggression is a\nviolation of our inherent right to self-defence under\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter. If the United\n4\n\nNations fails to grant Liberia the right to defend itself,\nthen the United Nations is obligated to provide for the\nsecurity and defence of Liberia.\nThe persistent attacks on Liberia, we believe, are\nprecipitated and encouraged by the knowledge that\ndissident forces have of the existence of the United\nNations arms embargo on Liberia, which leaves Liberia\nvulnerable to such callous and unwarranted attacks on\nits nation and people by dissidents outside of the\ncountry.\nThe Security Council arms embargo has not only\nundermined and compromised Liberia's capacity for\nself-defence, but it has further deprived our universities\nfrom obtaining needed laboratory chemicals, deprived\nour industries from acquiring essential explosives for\nmining and rock quarries. Hence, the arms embargo\ncontinues to have a disruptive impact on our\neducational system and our economy as well.\nIn this post-conflict environment, there is the\nurgent need to build confidence and enhance the\ncapacity of government institutions, such as health,\neducation and agriculture-related agencies and security\napparatus, which are vital to meeting the basic needs of\nLiberians, including ex-combatants.\nPledges were made toward the achievement of\nthis objective in Paris in December 1997. However,\nlittle aid has trickled in to further the reconstruction\nprogrammes of our Government.\nDespite the assurances from the international\ncommunity that the road to international assistance was\na successful disarmament process followed by the\nholding of free and fair elections, the international\ndonor community has continued to pursue a policy of\npunitive disengagement.\nPursuant to this policy, essentially, all known\navenues for obtaining assistance are laden with\nimpractical conditionalities, which are difficult to meet\neven by countries that have not experienced civil war.\nWe wish to note that this exclusionary attitude\napproximates the imposition of economic sanctions on\nLiberia and its people.\nHowever, whatever justification we may\nrationalize, there is a population of Liberia that has\nsuffered the scourge of seven years of civil war:\nvulnerable children, women and the elderly, who\ndeserve humane assistance irrespective of any political\nimperatives; people who care less for the politics of the\nmachination of power brokers who arrogate unto\nthemselves the right to determine what is acceptable\nbehaviour in the international political system. I might\nadd that Liberians are not automatons.\nAs a sovereign people, we claim the incontestable\nright to exercise the leading role in determining our\ndestiny, especially the right of ownership of our\ndevelopment programmes. We are an integral part of\nthe human family, pulsating with needs and aspirations\nthat are good and honourable. We too desire to reap the\nbenefits of the people-centred development underlined\nin the Millennium Declaration.\nAt this precarious period of our national life,\nLiberians have shown uncommon resilience and are\nrelentlessly striving to rebuild their lives. What we\nseek from the international community is its empathy\nand human understanding in providing the requisite\nassistance that will enable Liberians to enjoy the basic\nhuman rights of food, security and peace. Importantly,\nwe wish similar benefits for our neighbours and others\nbeyond the West African subregion.\nFollowing the successful celebration of the\nMillennium Summit, which reinforced our collective\ndetermination for the improvement of the management\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century, it\nwould seem morally incongruent that the 23 million\npeople of Taiwan are being denied the right to\nparticipate in a United Nations.\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) denies\nthe Taiwanese people the right to participate in United\nNations activities and contravenes the United Nations\nCharter's principle of universality. How can such\ninjustice suffice in this era of increased global\ninteraction, economic interdependence, political\ntransformation, democratization and rapprochement?\nWith the undeniable record of the Republic of\nChina, its experience in democracy as proven by the\nrecent election of President Chen Shui-bian, its respect\nfor human rights, its economic power resulting from its\nacceptance of the market economy; the energy,\nimagination and courage of its people; technological\nachievements and humanitarian attributes all over the\nworld, who would query its overarching relevance?\nLiberia fervently reiterates its call for the\ninclusion of the Republic of China in this world\nOrganization. We believe that the Republic of China\n5\n\ncan make important contributions that would serve the\nbest interests of the United Nations community.\nThe world has witnessed a significant\nachievement in science and technology, leading to\nrapid industrialization and the improvement of the\nstandard of living of humankind. Although the gains in\nscience and technology have led to the development of\nnew medicines and other scientific knowledge, it has\nequally posed a threat to the environment and human\nsurvival. Rapid industrialization and scientific\ndiscoveries are dangerously impacting the\nenvironment. Unless we modify our activities, the\nsweet stories of scientific achievement will sadly lead\nto tragedy and doom. In this new millennium we\ncannot ignore the potency of threats posed by\nenvironmental degradation to our survival. Saving the\nplanet is a precursor to the continued existence of its 6\nbillion inhabitants.\nThis is why my delegation supports the efforts of\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, and\nendorses the Commission's recommendation to\nconvene a General Assembly summit-level review,\npreferably in a developing country in 2002, to reassess\nthe decision reached on Agenda 21 at the Rio\nConference in 1992.\nAmong the many impediments to social and\neconomic development in Africa are poverty, poor\nhealth delivery systems, intra-regional wars and civil\nconflicts. It is a known fact that there is a correlation\nbetween war, civil conflict and the spread of\nHIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic targets and\ndestroys our human resource, which is the basis for our\nsocio-economic development. United Nations records\nshow that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS increases in\ncountries affected by war and civil conflicts, owing to\npopulation movements. Therefore, we should not\nignore the fact that post-conflict countries need special\nattention to fight the disease.\nThroughout Africa, HIV/AIDS accounts for the\nincrease in the death rate among young people and\nadults between ages 10 and 24, and 25 and 45\nrespectively.\nWe appeal to the relevant United Nations\nagencies and other partners in the HIV/AIDS\nprogrammes to help Liberia obtain the $6.5 million\nneeded to prevent and control the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nMeanwhile, in reference to the Inter-Agency\nStanding Committee working group established by the\nSecurity Council in January this year to examine the\nrelationship between war and civil strife and the spread\nof HIV/AIDS, I would like to state my delegation's\nendorsement of the targets set for reductions in new\ninfections, and applaud the measures taken thus far to\nprovide care, support and access to information and\nmedication for HIV/AIDS victims. Hence, my\ndelegation commends the United Nations for its\nassistance to countries significantly affected by this\ndreadful epidemic.\nApart from HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\npolio contribute immensely to the obliteration of socio-\neconomic gains in countries where they are\nwidespread. Cognizant of the impediments that these\ninfectious diseases pose to our socio-economic\ndevelopment, Nigeria has offered to host an African\nSummit on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other\ninfectious diseases in the year 2001. Meanwhile, we\ncommend President Olusegun Obasanjo for hosting the\nAfrican Summit on \u201cRoll Back Malaria\u201d in April this\nyear.\nWe in Liberia have not relented in our efforts to\nreduce, if not eliminate, these health scourges that\ncontinue to threaten our social and economic\ndevelopment. Hence, the Liberian Government in\ncooperation with the World Health Organization has, as\na result of a vigorous campaign, successfully contained\npolio, which killed and immobilized thousands of our\ncitizens in  past years. The polio vaccination campaign\ntargeted 900,000 people, and the number of people\nvaccinated was 911,423.\nI am pleased to report that, if I am allowed to\nborrow and paraphrase the main slogan from this\nsuccessful campaign: we are determined to \u201cKick polio\nout of Liberia\u201d.\nLiberia continues to be saddled by the debt\nburden. This debt overhang, which remains a major\ncontributor to the gap between the rich and poor\nnations, was acquired out of loans given in the pursuit\nof influence in the cold war, which, as I stated in my\naddress to the Millennium Summit, was not in the\ninterest of the borrower. As a result of the debt burden,\nour children are deprived of food, education, health\ncare, and jobs for their parents.\nWhile we commend countries that have taken\nsteps to relieve poorer countries of their debt burden, I\n6\n\nemphasize that unless all rich creditor nations adopt\nmeasures to erase this burden, it will continue to be\noppressive, and an impediment to sustainable\ndevelopment for poor countries.\nLiberia rejects the proclaimed efficacy of the\nhighly indebted poor countries initiative, and calls\nupon the G7/G8 countries to consider a comprehensive\ndebt waiver programme for all highly indebted poor\ncountries.\nIn January this year, the meeting on poverty\nreduction and growth held in Libreville, Gabon,\nhighlighted the situation in post-conflict countries that\nthe Copenhagen Conference failed to address.\nIn this regard, Liberia has proposed the holding\nof a regional summit of post-conflict African States to\ndevelop a realistic approach to debt eradication, and\ncalls on the international community to support this\nimportant venture.\nAs I conclude, I cannot help but wonder what this\nnew Millennium has in store for the people of the\nworld. Nationalism remains an unchallenged reality\ntoday, despite the wave of globalization engulfing our\nworld. Also, the politics of power and \u201cmight makes\nright\u201d still pervade in inter-State relations, especially\namong the powerful. Will the powerful break down the\nzeal of nationalism under the cover of their demand for\ngood governance, democracy, transparency and human\nrights?\nWe have indeed seen with what double standards\nand ulterior motives these demands have been made.\nOr, will the lofty tenets of the Charter be upheld in\nequally recognizing and respecting the right of self-\ndetermination of the small and the big, the poor and the\naffluent, in a world rich in cultural diversity deserving\nof coexistence in peace and universal harmony? Will\nthis millennium see the end of cultural hegemony and\narrogance, primitive sentiments undeserving of this\nnew age of enlightenment and technology?\nOnly the test of consistency between our moral\nvalue system and our actions will stand witness to\nposterity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Humanity, our greatest\nconcern, is the reason why we are gathered here today.\nHumanity stands at a defining moment in world\nhistory. The challenge before us is to harness the\ncollective consciousness and will of the international\ncommunity to address the problems of planet Earth.\nDuring the course of the past century, the\ndisparities between and within nations have widened.\nPoverty, ill-health, illiteracy and hunger among the\nworld's people have increased. The world's ecosystem,\nthe foundation upon which we all depend for survival,\nis rapidly deteriorating. That is why we must regard\nthis moment as significant in human history, despite\nFukuyama's claim that history has ended. The Third\nMillennium offers us the opportunity to break away\nfrom the shackles of the past and create new\nbeginnings. The choices that we make can change the\nface of humankind and lead to the accepted goals of\nglobal peace, economic and human security and the\ngreater good of humanity.\nThe past century was replete with examples of\nnations preening themselves for conquest and\ndomination. The conquistadors who plundered the New\nWorld are still at large, using global institutions, new\ntechnologies and weapons of destruction to oppress and\ndominate the weak, the innocent and the dispossessed\nsectors of mankind. The message that Saint Lucia\nbrings to this Millennium Assembly comes from the\npen of Saint Lucia's Nobel Prize Laureate Derek\nWalcott, who reminds us that, \u201cThere are no worlds to\nconquer/But worlds to re-create\u201d.\nMinds that are historically poisoned with\nconquest can hardly experience the essential\nequanimity and calm of re-creation. The theme of this\nmillennium Assembly reaches out in the direction of\nre-creation: a people-centred reshaping of the role and\nfunction of the United Nations and a purposeful moral\nthrust in re-creating the battered, demoralized societies\nin which we live.\n8\n\nThat is why we must embrace the United Nations\nMillennium Summit's theme, \u201cWe the peoples: The\nRole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d.\nThe attainment of meaningful transformation in the\nworld system calls for a United Nations capable of\nassuming a vanguard role in development and in\nadvancing human society and security. The United\nNations system must play a critical role in promoting\nglobal responsibility. Global responsibility implicitly\ninvolves some form of moral commitment to human\nwelfare. It is the formulation of economic programmes\ndesigned to bring about economic redistribution, to\nsafeguard against economic crises and to formulate\ndevelopmental policies that are in keeping with\nenvironmental protection and sustainability.\nThe United Nations should be strengthened to\nplay a more central role in development, ensuring\nequity and security for its small, vulnerable Members\nlike Saint Lucia against the greed of profit-driven\nPowers. Instead, we are witnessing a consistent,\nsystemic weakening of the United Nations' role in\ndevelopment, with development issues being left to\nundemocratic institutions like the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), which perpetuate global\neconomic inequities and ignore the development issues\nand concerns of developing countries.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the United Nations' primary development\nagency, is now reoriented to giving advice in\ngovernance and democratic elections. The United\nNations therefore plays a peripheral role in\ndevelopment, and small States like Saint Lucia are left\non their own to be devoured by powerful States backed\nby powerful transnational corporations.\nSaint Lucia joined this Organization and\nentrusted it with our hopes of peace, security and\ndevelopment. This Organization has passed on our trust\nto a few dominant Powers and corporations. If the\nUnited Nations has a diminished role in ensuring\ndevelopment, peace and security for its small and\nvulnerable Members, then our presence here is an\nunnecessary diversion of our scarce resources. In these\ncircumstances we feel threatened and vulnerable that\nour trust has been betrayed.\nThe greater good of human security cannot be\nfostered simply through peacekeeping operations and\nhumanitarian missions. There must be a global drive to\nempower people, through the elimination of the\nadverse conditions that cause the incapacitation of the\nhuman spirit and the imprisonment of the imagination.\nHence, the United Nations of the twenty-first century\nmust be capable of playing a significant role in\nliberating the human spirit and imagination through\neducation and real opportunity. It must be able to\nreposition itself to give practical meaning to the rising\ntide all over the world as the common man aspires to\nhigher and wider horizons.\nIn reaffirming our faith in the United Nations and\nits Charter, it is again with the hope of saving\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. The\nthreat to peace does not necessarily emanate from\nmilitary warfare. There are new forms of war currently\nbeing waged on the small, the weak and the vulnerable.\nIn previous addresses to this Assembly, and in the\nstatement of our Head of Government to the\nMillennium Summit, we pointed out the injustice\nperpetrated on Saint Lucia and other banana-producing\ncountries of the Caribbean by the WTO, through its\nrejection of the marketing regime for bananas in\nEurope as being WTO-incompatible. That ruling has\ncondemned our countries to the prospect of economic\nruin, in that the stabilizing force of our economy has\nbeen dealt a mortal blow.\nSince that ruling by the WTO, which granted an\nunreasonably limited time to adjust our economy, we\nhave lost 50 per cent of our foreign exchange earnings,\nwhile thousands of farmers have become unemployed\nand poverty and crime are on the increase. Yet, despite\nour urgent economic situation, negotiations between\nthe European Union (EU) and the United States have\nbeen stalled. Saint Lucia calls on the United States to\nresume discussions with the European Union on a new\nmarketing system for bananas that could be acceptable\nto all, giving due consideration to the Caribbean\nproposal. But that is a pipedream. Our hopes have\nslipped on a banana skin, because there is a new\nsweetheart deal between Britain and the United States.\nResilient a people as we are, we are moving to\ndiversify our economies and to build another sector \u2014\nfinancial services. Again, the economic giants are\ndetermined to crush our development efforts and\nsubject our people to poverty by attacking yet another\nsector of our narrow economic base.\nSaint Lucia has acted in good faith in fulfilling\nour obligations to the Charter of the United Nations,\n9\n\nassuming equality of all Member States. We have\nrespected the territorial integrity and political\nindependence of other Member States and have never\ninterfered in the internal affairs of another State.\nToday, the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) has chosen to\ndictate the tax policies of Saint Lucia and other\nCaribbean islands by labelling our tax regime as a\nharmful tax haven and is threatening to impose\nsanctions for non-compliance with its prescribed\nchanges to our tax policies.\nIt is Saint Lucia's sovereign right to determine its\ntaxes. We cannot tell the OECD countries what taxes to\nimpose, nor do we expect interference in the exercise\nof the sacred right entrusted to us by our citizens. Our\ndevelopment options are few and limited, and we\nconsider the OECD action a violation of our basic\nhuman right to development and to pursue a decent\nstandard of living for our people.\nOur peace is threatened, our democracy is being\nundermined. The conditions for conflict are being\ncreated in my country and in the region, and yet,\ninstead of addressing development, we are being asked\nto strengthen the United Nations to intervene in\nnational crises.\nWithin the context of a globalized world, the\nconcept of sovereignty is fast becoming an endangered\nspecies. No self-respecting nation would willingly\nabandon its sovereignty for the illusion of a better\nworld, when all the signals from this brave new world\nare destructive and negative. In respect of\npeacekeeping interventions, one can surrender\nsovereignty to avoid a holocaust but certainly not to\npermit well-heeled rapacious countries to hog the\ncapital flows in the financial services sector.\n\n\n\nLast week, through our Heads of State and\nGovernment, we reaffirmed our faith in the United\nNations and its Charter as indispensable foundations\nfor a more peaceful, prosperous and just world. This\nreaffirmation is of particular significance to small\ndeveloping States like Saint Lucia, lacking the size and\nresources to urge the international community to give\ndue consideration to our concerns and interests. We\nagreed to entrust the United Nations with ensuring\nequality among States. It is of paramount importance to\nus that the United Nations does not flinch in its role of\nfostering international dialogue and consensus\nbuilding, so that the concerns and interests of all\nMember States are adequately addressed and reflected\nin the work of the Organization. We do not expect our\ntrust to be given to more powerful influences to\ndetermine our collective future. We rededicated\nourselves to upholding the principle of equality of\nStates and expect that equality to be realized in policy\ndirectives of the United Nations with a balance in\nrepresentation of the interests of Member States and\nregions.\nSaint Lucia calls on the United Nations to assume\nits rightful, central role in development and the\ngovernance of globalization, to promote democracy\nand good government nationally and internationally, to\nstand for right and the protection of its weak and\nvulnerable Members against the powerful and\ndominant and to seek equality and justice for all. This\nshould be the focus of the United Nations in the new\nmillennium if poverty is to be eradicated and peace\nenjoyed.\nSaint Lucia cannot be enthusiastic about other\nissues until development and equity in the global\neconomy become a priority. Our decline in revenues\ndenies us the capacity to increase our contribution to\npeacekeeping, and we will be reluctant to do so until\nthere is an increase in our participation and benefit\nfrom the global economy. Man cannot live by\ngovernance alone or peace alone. Our people must find\nthe sustenance that will enable them to participate in\ngovernance and peace. Saint Lucia therefore eagerly\nlooks forward to the convening of the\nintergovernmental conference on financing for\ndevelopment to discuss in a holistic manner issues of\ntrade, finance and monetary matters in the context of\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\nWe have always promoted an integrated approach\nto development and global issues, and this age of\ntechnology and interdependence lends itself more than\never to the integrated approach of assessing and\naddressing the issues at hand.\nWe continue to view the financing for\ndevelopment process as the missing and the critical\nlink in the development agenda for a sustainable and\nlasting resolution to poverty and threats to peace. We\nhope that through this process the United Nations will\nreclaim its legitimate role in development, entrusted to\n10\n\nit in the Charter, and promote the effective\nparticipation of all its Member States in the governance\nof the global economy and globalization, for the\nbenefit of all the peoples of the world.\nThe greatest threat to world peace and democracy\nis the systemic imbalances and inequities in the global\neconomy and the institutions that govern it. This\nsituation is unsustainable and explosive. The thrust of\nmany statements made during the Millennium Summit\nand this session has been to strengthen peacekeeping\nefforts with resources and personnel. We recognize that\nthere is need for improvement in peacekeeping efforts\nto make them more effective. However, equal emphasis\nand effort are not being committed to addressing the\nreal threats to peace and the primary causes of war.\nDeveloping countries are threatened by continued\ndeprivation and inequities in the global economy.\nUnless these inequities and imbalances are corrected,\nwe will continue to create situations of unrest and\nthreaten intervention while causes go unaddressed.\nSimilarly, we parade the fashionable notion of\npoverty eradication in isolation, ignoring the complex,\nmulti-faceted nature of poverty and the causes of\npoverty, including global economic inequities. This\nfa\u00e7ade to placate the poorest is fooling some of the\npeople, but not all of the world's poor. The holistic\nnature of development takes precedence over the\npalliative of poverty eradication. International\ncooperation in development should instead be\ndemonstrated through meeting the United Nations\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product in\noverseas development assistance, through debt\ncancellation, special and differential treatment on a\ncontractual basis for developing countries and adequate\nfinancial support for the United Nations' development\nprogrammes.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment to\npromoting democracy, albeit with the emphasis on\ndemocracy at the national level. The inherent problem\nin achieving this objective is clear, since democracy at\nthe national level is undermined by the lack of a\ncommensurate level of democracy at the international\nlevel. The world's peoples and leaders will rightly\nmock the call for democracy if this principle is not\nequally applied in the Security Council, the Bretton\nWoods Institutions and the World Trade Organization,\nthe main institutions that currently govern world affairs\nin peace, security and the world economy, respectively.\nThe United Nations must demonstrate leadership of\ndemocracy at the global level if we are to believe in\nthis principle as a foundation for peace and prosperity\nin the new millennium. All Member States must be\nable effectively to participate in matters of peace,\nsecurity and the global economy in order to give real\nmeaning to democracy and governance.\nThe symbolism of the United Nations is\nuniversally recognized, but our role in this millennium\nis to redefine its goals, sharpen its focus and make it a\nmore efficient instrument for effecting global change\nand development. But this institutional change must be\ninspired and fired by the commensurate determination\nof Member nations to re-create their own societies. The\nresonance and sympathetic vibration of our visionary\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan is not enough. We as\nMember nations must set about the task of societal re-\ncreation, within the parameters of our own societies, to\noffset the negative influence of moral degradation,\ncrime, drugs and anti-social behaviour. These are the\nbenchmarks of the uncivil society.\nIn the re-creation of our own societies we face the\nstructural disadvantages of unemployment, illiteracy\nand the tyranny of consumerism and materialism. Our\nyoung people are cannon-fodder for the blandishments\nof cable television. They lap up a culture and a lifestyle\nthat militate against their own self-development. They\nfail to understand the nexus between earning and\nspending and develop an appetite for consumer\ndurables which their economic base could never\nsupport. They become aggressively fired-up with\ndemands and rising expectations that neither the\nresources of the State nor their flimsy work ethic can\nentertain. They develop a culture of carping criticism\nthat leaves no space for a culture of appreciation.\nCaribbean Governments look on almost helplessly at a\ngrowing phenomenon that threatens to disturb the\nrhythm of projected economic growth and breeds a\nkind of lawlessness which conventional law-and-order\ntechniques cannot contain.\nAs globalization erodes the economic and social\nbases of our islands, international and bilateral aid\ndwindles. As ideologies and ideals give way to\npragmatism, the weak social and political fabric of\nthese fledgling nations is laid bare. The vocabulary of\ncontainment and patience can no longer hold back the\nanarchist tide of popular revolt. Small nations will\nencounter their own Seattles, with no National\nGuardsmen to come to the rescue, no sustaining\n\n\nphilosophies to stem the tide, only the grim statistics of\nfalling revenues and rising expectations.\nNations which attempt to grapple with these\nsocial problems have incurred the wrath of large\ncountries, culminating in isolation and the imposition\nof sanctions. Countries like Cuba and Libya have felt\nthe crush of sanctions. The United Nations system must\nrethink the strategy of imposing sanctions and must\ndevise other means of ensuring compliance within the\ninternational community. The imposition of sanctions\nis often inhumane and is usually accompanied by\ndevastating economic consequences and fails to\nproduce the desired effect in targeted countries. The\ninternational community should realize that\ninterventions, embargoes and sanctions do not a\ndemocracy make.\nBecause of the untold suffering inflicted on\ncivilian populations, a twenty-first century United\nNations system cannot continue to endorse the\nimposition of sanctions. What is even more devastating\nis that the general will of this Assembly is often flouted\nand ignored when the international consensus calls for\na removal of sanctions. Is democracy merely a\nconvenient attitude? If so, it begs the question as to the\ninsistence that countries like Cuba should conform to\nthe principles of democracy when these principles\nthemselves are being compromised and rejected as a\nmatter of convenience. It is these injustices and\nviolations that have turned world opinion in favour of\nthe embattled Caribbean country Cuba and have made\nits leader Fidel Castro a living symbol of the\nunconquerable spirit of our people to triumph over\nadversity and incredible odds.\nMore than ever, the positives of a reformed\nUnited Nations will become a refuge, a bastion of hope\nfor nations nonplussed by events that seem suddenly\nout of their control. In my previous address to this\ntime-honoured institution, I alluded to the plight of\nAfrica. I should like to reiterate that as Africa was the\nlast impression of the twentieth century, poetic justice\ndemands that it must be our first preoccupation in the\ntwenty-first century.\nIn the process of re-creation, Saint Lucia and the\nCaribbean must strive to become a catalyst for peace in\nthe international forum. We must use our collective\ninfluence to contain the border disputes that threaten to\ncreate friction in Latin America and the Caribbean. We\nmust also be wary of importing conflicts into our\nregion.\nIn the case of Taiwan and China, it is vital that\nwe pursue the line of working towards a one-China\npolicy instead of fuelling the hostilities that\ncharacterize the existing relationship between these\ntwo countries. An early resolution of the impasse\nbetween Taiwan and China will strengthen the\nsolidarity of the developing world.\nIn the case of Africa, the Caribbean has always\nenjoyed a peculiarly symbiotic relationship with\nAfrica. Men like Padmore, C.L.R. James, Eric\nWilliams, Sir Arthur Lewis and Walter Rodney have all\nworked assiduously at the side of African leaders like\nNkrumah, Nyerere, S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and L\u00e9opold Senghor\nin order to realize the ultimate dream of a united Africa\nliberated from the bondage of poverty, disease and\nexploitation. This noble tradition must continue. Once\nagain, Saint Lucia calls on its CARICOM colleagues to\npursue the possibility of obtaining observer status at\nthe Organisation of African Unity.\nThe peoples of the African continent face the\nonslaught of the AIDS pandemic that threatens to\ndecimate the population of the entire continent. But the\ndevastating effect of AIDS is felt not only on the\nAfrican continent. Today the world is confronted with\nthe greatest health crisis in human history. The effects\nof this disease can destabilize fragile democracies and\neconomic progress in both the developing and the\ndeveloped world.\nWe welcome President Clinton's efforts to create\nan African AIDS Trust Fund and the pledge of one\nbillion US dollars to combat AIDS in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. We also welcome Cuba's undertaking to send\nthree thousand Cuban doctors to Africa. However,\ngiven the transnational nature of the disease, the United\nNations should use its institutions to launch a\nmovement aimed at the complete eradication of this\nscourge. If the world is to survive the ravages of this\nplague, we must not only pledge financial resources\ntowards research and the development of\npharmaceuticals, but we must make those\npharmaceuticals affordable and accessible and also\ncontinue to sensitize the international community to\npreventive measures.\nAt year's end, the General Assembly will witness\nthe end of the first International Decade for the\nEradication of Colonialism. Much remains to be done\n12\n\nbefore the United Nations is successful in carrying out\nits statutory mandate to ensure complete and absolute\npolitical equality for the peoples of the relevant\nterritories. This must remain the guiding principle of\nthe international community. That the majority of the\nremaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are small\nislands does not mean that the self-determination of\ntheir peoples is less important than for former\nterritories which achieved sovereign status. We must\nresist all attempts to legitimize the present unequal\ncolonial arrangements, which do not provide for full\nand absolute political equality. Saint Lucia therefore\nfully endorses the proclaiming of a second Decade for\nthe Eradication of Colonialism and calls on Member\nStates and United Nations organizations to fulfil their\nresponsibilities under the Charter and relevant General\nAssembly resolutions.\nOn the initiative of the Government of Canada, a\ndebate has started in the forum of the Organization of\nAmerican States on the subject of global human\nsecurity. It is comforting for developing States, and\nespecially small developing States, to feel that the\nconscience of the international world has been pricked\ninto focusing on the security of the entire globe \u2014 the\nentire globe. On a discordant note, the United States of\nAmerica is now concentrating its attention on a\nnational missile defence system aimed at protecting the\nUnited States from missile attacks. At this strategic\njuncture in the new millennium, when world leaders\nare gingerly nurturing a culture of peace and\ndisarmament, this action runs counter to the mood for\nreconciliation and universal nuclear disarmament. This\nunfortunate and myopic emphasis on the protection of\none nation and one people might well trigger a rash of\nself-protective nuclear explosions, effectively eroding\nthe fragile trust which underpins the hope for global\nhuman security.\nThere are no worlds to conquer, but worlds to\nrecreate. The recreation of the United Nations must be\nposited on the basis of mutual respect between rich and\npoor, mutual respect between large and small nations.\nAs small and desperate as our islands appear to be, we\nshould hold fast to the principles that inform the\noperations of the United Nations.\nWe challenge the paradigm shift which the\ndeveloped nations are cleverly manipulating to shunt\nthe focus of the United Nations towards peacekeeping\nand humanitarian assistance. Saint Lucia states clearly\nand unequivocally that the United Nations focus should\nzero in on development as a radical instrument for\neradicating poverty and war.\nNo $600 million carrot will tempt us to abandon\nthe principle of a nation's capacity to pay. No Congress\nshould determine the scale of assessments for the\nUnited Nations, and there should be no conditionality\nfor paying arrears and meeting one's obligations to this\nOrganization.\nThe hungry sheep look up and are not fed. The\nwolves run amok and batten on their hunger, and the\ncycle goes on in its impropriety. This Organization\nmust not flinch in its millennial resolve to end the\ncarnage.\n\u201cSo I come to you from the weary battlefield of\ntime\nArmed with the disappointments of yesterday\nThe sufferings of today and the dreams of\ntomorrow\nIn the struggle I may die\nBut let's not forsake another tomorrow\u201d.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my\npleasure to congratulate the President on his election. It\nbears witness to the esteem which the international\ncommunity has for his country and for him. In wishing\nhim every success in the conduct of our work, I should\nlike to assure him also of the sincere cooperation of the\ndelegation of Benin.\nMay I also pay a well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, for the outstanding work\nhe accomplished.\nIn view of the developments in international\nrelations, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, had\nthe felicitous initiative of gathering the highest\n20\n\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the world for\nconsultations on a new world order and on the role\nwhich the United Nations will be called upon to play.\nI would like to pay him a well-deserved tribute\nand emphasize the determined conviction and\ncompetence with which he heads the Organization.\nThe Millennium Summit showed once again that\nmultilateralism and international cooperation remain\nthe best approach to confront problems in\nglobalization. Indeed, the positive effects of\nglobalization remain limited, as is borne out by\nimbalances in economic and social terms that\ncharacterize the world today and violate human dignity\nand human rights. What must be done therefore is to\nchannel the globalization process towards economic\nand social progress for the benefit of the greatest\nnumber.\nIn this process, the United Nations has a\ncomparative advantage \u2014 it is the only institution able\nto embody universally accepted values and the only\nplatform for organizing fruitful debate on world issues,\nas well as on the ways and means for settling them.\nThe United Nations is the body where the weak\nand the forgotten are able to make their voices heard\nand to participate in the attainment of a consensus on\nquestions of common interest.\nAnd, indeed, globalization today is a fait\naccompli; however, we must emphasize that it is not\nneutral. Good governance, democracy and transparency\nmust be consolidated not only in national terms, but\nalso in international relations.\nThese principles must be applied both within\nStates as well as with respect to forces that govern\nglobalization and make use of it as before to avoid any\nform of democratic control.\nAt the Millennium Summit, the heads of State\nand Government adopted a document which determines\nthe main outlines of the United Nations action for the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt is now up to the world community and, thus, up\nto our States, to civil society and to the private sector\nto show the necessary determination to implement the\nguidelines of the Summit quickly and resolutely to\nmake a reality of the message of hope and\ndetermination which was expressed by the leaders of\nthe world.\nBenin is pleased that special attention was\nfocused on Africa. The initiatives taken for the\ncontinent require the firm support of the development\npartners in the sense of a partnership and solidarity\nwhich must basically work on the following: a lasting\nsolution to the debt problem; a more just order for the\ninternational trade system; support in terms of financial\nresources and strengthening production capacity.\nWe call for the effective implementation of\nmeasures to integrate developing countries into the\nworld economy taking account of the special needs of\nthe least-developed countries with a view to halting the\ndeterioration in their situations.\n\nIn this regard, the holding of the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries is of\nparticular importance. It is essential that it lead to\nconcrete results.\nThe elimination of poverty is one of the\nchallenges that the international community was unable\nto meet in the twentieth century. It is our responsibility\nto dedicate ourselves to this task. In this regard, we are\npleased with the initiative taken by the Administrator\nof the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) to organize a special ministerial meeting to\ndiscuss the strategic orientation of UNDP and the need\nto provide it with the resources essential for it to carry\nout its missions. Benin is relying on UNDP, the main\nbody for coordinating development assistance, to meet\nthe challenges facing developing countries.\nIn commending the countries that have\nannounced an increase in their official development\nassistance, I appeal for the restoration of a balance in\nfavour of core budgetary resources to make it possible\nto execute the programmes and projects to which\nGovernments accord priority.\nWith regard to financing for development, it is\nparticularly essential to ensure that resources are better\nmobilized and that development action involving all\npartners, including the Bretton Woods institutions, is\nbetter coordinated.\nAll these programmes and plans can be\nimplemented only in an environment in which peace\nand security are guaranteed. Benin therefore welcomed\nwith great interest the Brahimi report (A/55/305),\ncontaining an in-depth analysis of peacekeeping\noperations.\n21\n\nWith regard to Somalia, Benin would also like to\nexpress its satisfaction with the leader of the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development and all the\nfacilitators for their courageous initiatives to bring\npeace to that country through a process of dialogue and\nreconciliation. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to lend its support to the consolidation of\nthe process so that Somalia can rapidly become part of\nthe community of nations.\nBenin is, and will remain, committed to\nrespecting and promoting human rights, democracy and\nthe rule of law. These principles are inscribed in its\nConstitution. In that context, since the fifty-second\nsession the General Assembly has supported Benin in\nits organization of the Fourth International Conference\nof New or Restored Democracies, to be held in\nCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. This Conference\nwill undoubtedly be an important stage in the\ninternational community's progress towards the\nconsolidation of democratic principles. At the\nConference the old and new democracies will exchange\ntheir experiences and commit themselves to promoting\ndemocracy, peace and political stability and\ndevelopment. Cotonou is preparing a warm welcome,\nand hopes that there will be a great response to its\ninvitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to\njoin other speakers in congratulating Mr. Harri Holkeri\non his election to preside over the Millennium\nAssembly. I am confident that under his able\nstewardship we the peoples, and particularly those of\nus from the developing countries, can look forward\nwith optimism to a highly proactive session of the\nGeneral Assembly. His election to the presidency is a\nclear reflection of the confidence which the\ninternational community has in his great country,\nFinland. He can count on the continued support and\ncooperation of the Malawi delegation in this\nmomentous task.\nLet me also pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nthe Republic of Namibia, for his highly successful\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session.\nLess than a fortnight ago, our leaders gathered at\nthis very venue to map out the way forward in this\nmillennium. The enthusiasm with which the\ndeliberations were conducted culminated in a highly\ninspiring outcome document, which gives a clear\noutline of what needs to be done.\nMalawi welcomes the outcome of the Millennium\nSummit. At the same time, we recognize that the\nstrategic partnership required for the implementation of\nthe outcome document calls for the political\ncommitment of the international community. It is\ntherefore our hope that the enthusiasm with which the\nworld leaders approached the Millennium Summit will\ntranslate into genuine political will in the\nimplementation of the measures that were adopted.\nLet us all build on the consensus that emerged\nfrom the Millennium Summit. Recognition by world\nleaders of the urgent need to address issues bedevilling\nhumanity today is the first step towards building a\nprosperous and better tomorrow.\nA multiplicity of factors are constraining the\nefforts of the developing countries towards achieving\neconomic development. There is therefore a need for a\nmultidimensional approach in order to address the\nplight of these countries. Such efforts must, of\nnecessity, be pursued at both the national and\ninternational levels.\nNot long ago, Malawi joined other members of\nthe international community in welcoming the process\nof globalization. We joined the chorus in\nacknowledging the inevitability of the march towards a\nglobal village. In our enthusiasm, we looked forward to\nmeeting the challenges and taking advantage of the\nopportunities that globalization was envisaged to offer.\nToday, the experience has proved daunting. A number\nof constraints dog our march towards the global\nvillage.\nAlong with other sub-Saharan African countries,\nMalawi has yet to meaningfully enjoy the benefits of\nmodern information technology. We all know that the\nprocess of globalization is centred on the swift and\naccurate flow of information. The interconnectedness\nwhich information technology brings about offers the\nbenefits of choice. Those who possess the\ntechnological capacity are, hence, ahead of the rest in\nthe march towards the global village.\nMalawi therefore calls upon the donor community\nto level the playing field by assisting those who lack\nthe capacity to meaningfully take advantage of a\nmodern global information network. There is need to\nclose the existing digital divide.\nInternational trade is critical if the economies of\nmost developing countries are to thrive. Malawi's\nexport-oriented economy is, in this regard, no\nexception. With no mineral wealth of significance, our\neconomy depends almost solely on the export of\nprimary agricultural products and the importation of\nmanufactured goods. The steadily deteriorating barter\nterms of trade for the primary products has long been a\nsource of concern to us. As if this were not daunting\nenough, the situation is compounded by the imposition\nof protectionist measures by countries that offer\nmarkets for our exports. A range of non-tariff barriers\nis being subtly put in place, rendering it difficult for\nour products to reach those markets. These\nprotectionist measures run counter to the spirit of free\ntrade which we all profess and which we all believe to\nbe necessary for the growing interdependence among\n21\n\ncountries. As long as barriers to free trade among\ncountries are erected, global integration will face a\nserious setback.\nMalawi therefore calls upon the development\npartners to open up their markets to products from the\ndeveloping countries. Increased market access is one\nway in which a country like Malawi could be\nempowered to meaningfully participate in the\nglobalization process.\nTime and again, we in the developing countries\nhave expressed serious concern over the existing\nproblem of external debt. Debt servicing has compelled\nour Governments to divert meagre resources from\ndevelopment programmes. As a result, basic social\nservices and investment in other infrastructure\nprogrammes suffer.\nWe welcome initiatives adopted by the\ndevelopment partners to address the problem of debt.\nThe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative is, among other measures, notable. We all\nlooked forward with hope to the recent G-8 Summit\nheld in Okinawa, Japan. However, the lack of\ncommitment to deal with the problem of debt\ndecisively means that the burden still remains virtually\nintact.\nMalawi therefore believes that the only way in\nwhich the problem of external debt can meaningfully\nbe addressed is through outright cancellation. We invite\nour development partners to exercise the political will\nfor debt cancellation. We need to free resources for\ninvestment in basic infrastructural services.\nOfficial development assistance and foreign\ndirect investment are necessary if developing\neconomies like Malawi's are to develop. It is largely in\nrecognition of this reality that the United Nations set\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\nof developed countries for official development\nassistance. The general decline in official development\nassistance flows to the developing countries therefore\nruns counter to the internationally recognized target.\nWe therefore pay tribute to those development partners\nwho have either met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent\ntarget. At the same time, we call upon those falling\nshort of it to live up to the expectations of the\ninternational community.\nMalawi welcomes the trend towards a rise in\nforeign direct investment over the past few years.\nHowever, we observe that, in spite of the steady rise,\nthe distribution itself has been uneven, with sub-\nSaharan Africa making no meaningful gains. We hope\nthat efforts will be made to address the disparity.\nJust over 10 years ago, the Berlin Wall came\ntumbling down in a highly symbolic move marking the\ndemise of the cold war. All peace-loving people in the\nworld who wanted humankind to live in dignity\nwelcomed that momentous development. The concept\nof \u201cpeace dividend\u201d gained currency as the\ninternational community welcomed the opportunity to\nturn swords into plowshares.\nToday's reality has not borne out our\nexpectations. Trouble spots, both long-standing and\nemerging ones, dot the globe. During the cold war, we\nblamed conflicts on super-Power rivalry. Yet conflicts\ntoday have assumed different dimensions, and they\ncontinue to divert meagre national resources away from\ndevelopment programmes.\nThe protracted civil war in Angola, civil strife in\nSierra Leone, the Great Lakes region of Africa, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo and\nCentral Asia, among other areas, perhaps reveal causal\nfactors that we glossed over during the cold war. Greed\namong politicians and the ruthless pursuit of profit by\nmultinational corporations have, in a number of cases,\ncoalesced to prolong conflict. We have all noted the\nrole that a precious mineral like diamonds can play in\nunleashing human tragedy.\nMalawi welcomes the recent adoption by the\nUnited Nations Security Council of a resolution that\naims at regulating the trade in diamonds, especially\nthose acquired illegally. The international community\ncan count on our unflinching cooperation in the\nimplementation of the resolution.\nWe have also noted the untiring efforts of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. However, the lessons of the United\nNations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, and\nindeed elsewhere, clearly point to the need for a serious\nreview of the mandate of such missions. The\nembarrassment that the peacemakers were subjected to\nis something that, we believe, must not be allowed to\nhappen again. In this regard, my delegation welcomes\nthe recommendations made in the Brahimi Report.\nWe, at the same time, join the international\ncommunity in condemning the recent murder of three\n22\n\nUnited Nations relief workers in West Timor. We call\non those responsible to desist from further interfering\nwith the safety and freedom of refugees and\nhumanitarian workers in the region.\nMalawi recognizes that the United Nations alone\ncannot provide miracle solutions to conflicts that rage\nin the various regions. It is largely incumbent upon the\nprimary players to exercise political maturity and\nrestrain their passions.\nWe note that in most conflict areas, there exist\nnegotiated frameworks for resolution of the\ndifferences. And yet, the sheer lack of political\ncommitment has led the parties to wantonly renege on\nagreements that they so painstakingly negotiated. We\ntherefore call upon all warring parties to respect\nexisting peace agreements and pool their efforts\ntowards nation-building.\nThe Government of Malawi welcomes efforts by\nthe United Nations to rid the globe of weapons of mass\ndestruction. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) represent some of the notable efforts by the\ninternational community to bring about lasting global\npeace and security. Malawi would like to express its\nreadiness to join the international community in the\nadoption of measures that seek to advance the cause of\ninternational peace and security.\nWe waste meagre resources to keep conflict\ngoing, while in the process sacrificing the welfare of\nour people. His Excellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi,\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, time and again\ndecried this, saying that we, especially in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, are too poor to divert meagre resources to\nsustain conflict.\nThe above factors present a front which impedes\neconomic development in the developing countries,\nespecially the least developed among them. Investment\nin basic infrastructure suffers as a result of, directly or\notherwise, an interplay of these forces.\nAs long as the international community holds\nback the political will needed for decisive action, the\nplaying field will remain uneven. As such, the\ndeveloping countries will continue to be marginalized\nin the march towards the global village.\nMy delegation does not intend to heap all blame\non international factors alone. At the national level, we\nin the developing countries have to take stock of our\ndomestic policies. Malawi, for one, is doing its part in\nthis regard. The democratic governance which the\nruling United Democratic Front (UDF) ushered in the\ncountry in June 1994 is well on course. The people's\nconfidence in the UDF-led government was manifested\nwhen they re-elected it in the June 1999 general\nelections. In the seven years of its existence, the\nGovernment has put in place institutional mechanisms\naimed at promoting human rights and other freedoms\nthat form the core of good governance.\nMalawi's commitment to the consolidation of\ndemocracy is now irreversible. In November this year,\nthe country will take yet another step forward with the\nconduct of local government elections. We fully\nrecognize the contribution which good governance\nmakes to economic development in a country.\nIn this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the\nUnited Nations and those development partners who\nhave contributed to our effort towards the promotion of\ngood governance. As the process goes on, we shall\ncount on your continued assistance.\nWe in Malawi further recognize the central role\nthat a vibrant private sector plays in economic\ndevelopment. For long, the previous government in\nMalawi neglected the private sector, opting, instead, to\nboost parastatal enterprises.\nThe new political dispensation has opened up the\ncountry to a competitive, free market economy.\nInefficient parastatal organizations are falling into\nprivate ownership through a privatization programme.\nAlready, there are discernible benefits accruing, most\nnotably marked improvements in the quality of\nproducts and services on the domestic market.\nThe existing political stability and the general\nwarmth of the friendly people of Malawi create an\ninviting climate to the foreign investor. The\nGovernment has, in addition, adopted measures which\nare aimed at creating a conducive investment\nenvironment. We, therefore, welcome entrepreneurs to\ncome and sample the market.\nAt the core of Malawi's fight against poverty is\nthe Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP) which the\nUDF-led Government launched upon its assumption of\noffice. Within the context of the programme, the\nGovernment later launched the Malawi Social Action\nFund (MASAF), a bottom-up framework that involves\nthe villager in taking decisions on development\n23\n\nprogrammes. MASAF is making the difference in the\nlives of the citizenry. The face of infrastructure in the\ncountryside, where nearly 80 per cent of the country's\npopulation resides, has been considerably transformed.\nWe, therefore, thank the World Bank for the\nsupport it is extending to the Malawi Social Action\nFund, which is currently in its second phase.\nAmong other strategies, Malawi has adopted\nmeasures aimed at empowering vulnerable groups in\nsociety. A systematic programme aimed at empowering\nwomen through micro-credit and improved access to\neducation for girls are some of these. A few years ago,\nthe Government established the Ministry of State in the\nPresident's Office Responsible for Persons with\nDisabilities, whose impact is beginning to show.\nOur determined efforts to rid the country of\nexcruciating poverty are impeded by the HIV/AIDS\npandemic. In the last decade, the extent of devastation\ncaused by the pandemic in Malawi has been\nfrightening. By targeting the productive age bracket of\nthe population, HIV/AIDS has clearly begun to reverse\nthe hard-won gains that the nation had made towards\nthe close of the last decade.\nAt the same time, we are aware of the advances\nthat the West has to date made in the treatment of\nHIV/AIDS. The prohibitive cost of the drugs precludes\ndeveloping countries like Malawi from gaining access\nto them. And yet, these are the countries that are in the\ngreatest need of such therapy, in view of their high\nincidence of HIV/AIDS.\nMy delegation appreciates the effort of the United\nNations, through the Joint United Nations Programme\non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), to deal with the pandemic.\nWe welcome the fact that the Security Council gave\ncentre stage to HIV/AIDS issues early this year. We\nbelieve that the devastation left by the scourge deserves\na high international profile. Malawi further calls on\nthose countries with the capacity to make the necessary\narrangements to render the drugs affordable for all\nthose who need them.\nIt is clear that if the international community is to\nforge the strategic partnership needed for a smooth\nmarch towards the global village, we need to level the\nplaying field. This calls for political will on the part of\nall of us. We need to fulfil our shared responsibilities\nfor the benefit of humankind.\nMalawi welcomes the recent admission of Tuvalu\nas the 189th Member State of the United Nations. On\nbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi, I\nextend our support and best wishes to the Government\nand the people of Tuvalu.\nTime and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of\ngranting the Republic of China on Taiwan the role that\nit deserves in the international community. The hard-\nworking and peace-loving people of Taiwan have\nclearly demonstrated that they are ready to actively\ncontribute to the goals and ideals for which the United\nNations stands.\nWe therefore appeal to the Organization's\nmembership to look beyond narrow political\nconsiderations and face the geopolitical realities that\nobtain on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The\ncontinued isolation of Taiwan does not bode well for\nthe spirit of globalization, which we all acknowledge,\nhas to be all-inclusive.\nFinally, allow me to reaffirm the commitment of\nthe Government of the Republic of Malawi to live up to\nthe obligations enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. This is the only universal body that is well\nplaced to take us all into the millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My delegation\nwelcomes the inclusion of commitments to fight\npoverty, disease, ignorance, injustice, violence and\ndegradation of the environment, among others.\nIn the matter of poverty and disease, the United\nNations must address the inequalities that exist around\nthe world. In this twenty-first century, more than 1.2\nbillion people live on less than one dollar a day.\nMillions of children and the elderly go to bed hungry.\nDisease and sickness wreak havoc on the lives of\nchildren, men and women. Today the HIV/AIDS\npandemic cuts short the lives of millions of people who\ncould be making useful and productive contributions to\nour world.\nTrade is vital to the livelihood of Grenadians. For\nthe banana-exporting countries of the Caribbean\nsubregion, which includes Grenada, the export of\nbananas accounts for a significant percentage of\nforeign exchange. However, our economies are\nthreatened by the callous ruling of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) against the European Union\nbanana regime of assistance to our small growers.\nOur struggling farmers, with limited acreage, find\nit difficult, if not impossible, to compete with a\ntransnational corporation. Our farmers need an\nadjustment period in order to effect the requisite\nstructural changes needed by the new trade regime. We\nlook to the United Nations to call upon the WTO to\ntake into consideration the special structural problems\nfaced by the small banana producers of the Caribbean.\n2\nWe call for corporate responsibility. We appeal\nfor measures to encourage the sustainability of small\neconomies and economies in transition. We urge a\nmore equitable global partnership.\nYou may recall that the Heads of State and\nGovernment, including the Prime Minister of Grenada,\nstressed recently in this very hall the urgency of\nreleasing poor developing countries from their debt\nburden. The leaders expressed an interest in finding\nnew approaches and new thinking with respect to this\nproblem. A solution should be vigorously pursued with\ndeliberate speed.\nDebt forgiveness is not a financial loss to the\nglobal economy. Rather, it provides an opportunity for\nstimulation in the depressed and stagnant parts of the\nworld's economy. Investing the dividends realized by\ndebt forgiveness in the economy of the debtor\ndeveloping countries \u2014 especially the least developed\nand those with economies in transition \u2014 would be a\nmajor investment in global development.\nAnother area that needs urgent and immediate\nassistance from the international community is that of\nnatural disasters. The costly restoration of\ninfrastructure and rehabilitation of the productive\nsectors, especially agriculture and tourism, and the\nhigh cost of recovering and rebuilding make the\nattainment of sustainable development a monumental\ntask.\nMy delegation calls upon the United Nations and\nits agencies, the International Monetary Fund, the\nWorld Bank and other international agencies, as well as\nthe private and public sectors in global partnership,\nincluding the Global Compact, to contribute to a wellstructured disaster relief fund, a relief fund that can\nrespond quickly and effectively.\nA large percentage of the needs of the developing\ncountries in the Caribbean subregion and elsewhere can\nbe met. We look forward to positive developments\nenvisaged from globalization, trade liberalization,\ninformation technology and sustainable development.\nThese and other well-conceived programmes must be\nseriously pursued. Lip service is not enough.\nAs the Secretary-General noted in his report to\nthe fifty-fifth General Assembly on the work of the\nOrganization: \u201cTo some, globalization is imbued with\ngreat promise; to others, it appears deeply threatening.\u201d\n(A/55/1, para. 13)\nThe international community must help to ensure\nthat the have-nots are on board this fast-moving train\nof globalization. All Member States need to share in\nthe opportunities provided by globalization. This would\nact as a vehicle for international peace and economic\nsecurity.\nRemoving some of the barriers to trade and\ncapital flow are prerequisites to successful reduction of\npoverty and disease in the developing countries. This\ncan be mutually beneficial to developed and\ndeveloping countries.\nTrade has been the engine of economic growth\nand development from the days of bartering to the\npresent day of e-commerce and globalization. We\ntherefore regard the unilateral interference in our\noffshore services sector as an attempt to hinder our\ntrade in services and our role in the global economy.\nIn that connection, my delegation recalls the\nwords of my Prime Minister about the unfair charges\nlevelled against our offshore financial-services sector.\n\u201cA cartel of high-tax nations, comprising\nthe richest and most powerful countries, has\nlaunched a destructive and high-powered attack\non our country, accusing us of anti-competitive\ntax practices. Threats, imperialistic pressures and\nabuse of power in multilateral organizations are\nbeing used to force many small States, including\nGrenada, to give up our fiscal sovereignty. They\nhave used adverse publicity techniques\ndeliberately to condemn and harm our economies.\nThey have threatened various sanctions, sought to\nblock access to capital funds in multinational\norganizations and to impose financial\nprotectionism and total ostracism.\u201d\nThat is fiscal imperialism. It tramples on the principle\nof sovereign equality. It is contrary to international law,\nand it undermines freedom of competition, global\ninvestment and trade liberalization.\nThe role of education in poverty alleviation, in\nthe application of science and technology and in the\nvast area of information sharing and communications is\nvital. The Government of Grenada, recognizing the\nsocial, cultural and economic potential of education, is\ninvesting an increasing proportion of its limited\nresources to prepare its people to participate in, and\nbenefit from, the information and technology\nrevolution. Towards that end, the Government of\n3\nGrenada is seeking the assistance of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the World Bank and\nagencies and donors of goodwill to establish a new\nprogramme of distance learning by means of global\ncomputer interconnectivity.\nGrenada attaches great importance to the\nconvening in 2001 of the United Nations High-level\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\nDevelopment. My delegation welcomes the attempt to\naddress monetary, trade and financial issues in a\nholistic manner and in the context of globalization and\nsustainable development. The international community\nshould not miss this opportunity to focus attention and\nresources on the pursuit of development, peace and\nstability.\nAnd here, my delegation reaffirms that the root\ncause of conflict within nations and among nations can\nbe found in some of the injustice done to the weaker\nmembers of the international community by the\nstronger ones. Unless the basics of life \u2014 food,\nclothing, shelter, health and employment \u2014 are\nattained, human rights and the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights will be meaningless to those who suffer\nsuch extreme deprivations. This is especially so in the\ncontext of economic, social and cultural rights, which\nare downplayed in favour of civil and political rights.\nSince all human rights are universal, indivisible,\ninterdependent and interrelated, attention to the full\nrange of rights will contribute better to the observance\nand enjoyment of this noble goal.\nI join my Prime Minister in paying tribute to, and\npublicly thanking, the Government and the people of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan for the assistance\ngiven to Grenada with respect to agriculture, marine\nresources, education, health, culture and infrastructure.\nThe friendship and sincerity of the Republic of China\non Taiwan have been a source of strength and\nendurance for our two countries. 1t is in this spirit that\nGrenada calls once more for the return of the Republic\nof China on Taiwan to full membership of the United\nNations. A people that diligently works to achieve such\nhigh levels of human and technological development\nand a people that makes such positive contributions to\nthe global economy must become a full Member of this\ngreat organization, the United Nations.\nFinally, we must seek to ensure that the\nOrganization is responsive to the ever-changing global\nenvironment. Let us ensure that we address the needs\nof our peoples. And let us move forward with a United\nNations that is prepared to fuel the engine that would\nbring about more equitable participation in the global\ncommunity. Let us always put people first and be\nguided by God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am\ndelighted to extend to Mr. Harri Holkeri, the new\n25\n\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession, my sincere congratulations on his election.\nI warmly welcome Tuvalu, the latest newcomer to\nthe United Nations family.\nI cannot continue without expressing my sincere\nappreciation to our dedicated Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, under whose leadership the winds of\nchange keep on blowing.\nI hail the results of the Millennium Summit. The\nviews expressed by leaders from all over the world\nhave shown how crucial it is, at this point in history, to\nreshape our Organization so as to respond adequately\nto the great challenges of our times.\nFrom this rostrum, and in other forums, political\nleaders have endeavoured to describe their perceptions,\nexpectations and concerns with regard to the all-\nencompassing manifestations of globalization. Last\nyear, my predecessor stated that the United Nations\nwas all about institutionalized solidarity. Bearing this\nidea in mind, we are convinced that the United Nations\nshould reshape its role in such a way as to manage\nglobalization in the interest of all nations and to correct\nits excesses.\nGlobalization creates opportunities for\ncommercial, economic and financial expansion.\nHowever, improved technological competitiveness and\nwider economic freedom do not automatically produce\ngreater equity.\nThe contribution of globalization to the\nbetterment of the human condition will remain limited\nto a small number of individuals, social categories and\ncountries unless it is oriented towards the common\ngood. This implies that, in the new context of\nintegration and participation in the globalization\nprocesses, good governance should intelligently and\npredictably combine economic reforms with social\nresponsibility, adjust the system of education and\nprofessional training, and initiate institutional reforms\nthat are able to achieve long-term internal stability and\nemployment, individual security and social justice, and\nthe protection of national economic interests, resources\nand the environment.\nThe process of globalization creates a new\nbalance of power between States, non-governmental\norganizations and transnational corporations. What is\nin question today is how to use their potential in order\nto influence the course of globalization so that it can\nhave a much more positive impact on people's lives.\nThis means bringing globalization closer to the people\nby promoting human values and democratic principles\nand practices; an open, inclusive and pluralistic\npolitical culture; economies that sustain a decent life\nfor all citizens and prosperity for societies as a whole;\nand institutions that protect both individuals, with all\ntheir rights and fundamental freedoms, and the\ncommon good. Nothing can really benefit the citizens\nof a country if, at the same time, it prejudices the\nprevailing international standards of a democratic\nworld.\n(spoke in French)\nWe need to pool our efforts in order to enlarge the\nsystem of values shared by the international\ncommunity. In this globalized yet conflictual world, the\nmanifestation of solidarity can provide a sound basis\nfor progress and prosperity for individuals and nations.\nFrom this perspective, I am convinced that solidarity in\nthe creation and allocation of educational capital is\nessential for the access of young people to the\nopportunities for progress engendered by globalization.\nI strongly support better access for young people to the\nnew technologies based on information and\ncommunication through investments in informatics\neducation, based on firm partnerships among\nGovernments, business communities and non-\ngovernmental organizations. In coping with the new\ninformatics reality of globalization, good governance\nhas to act with vision, responsibility and solidarity.\nAccess to educational capital in computer sciences\nshould not create new demarcation lines across the\nplanet, but rather should unite the world, primarily\nyoung people, by providing new opportunities for\nprogress, communication and professional success.\nAccess to digital education will also mean civic\nemancipation, greater transparency and less corruption.\nThe first key word \u2014 solidarity \u2014 that I have\ntried to illustrate should be accompanied by a second:\nresponsibility. For the United Nations as a whole and\nfor its Member States, responsibility is another way to\nreact to the forces of globalization, both domestically\nand internationally. That is why Romania welcomes the\nset of priorities and recommendations formulated by\nthe Secretary-General in his report to the Millennium\nAssembly.\nMember States know that responsibility requires\nthem to give the Organization \u2014 in what I would call a\n26\n\n\u201cpeace ritual\u201d \u2014 the political support and concrete\nmeans necessary to improve the management of\nglobalization and to fulfil its mandate. This role is not\nan easy one. In an era of the most advanced\ntechnological capabilities, poverty continues to be a\npainful reality. While there is increasing acceptance of\nthe universality of human rights, innocent people\ncontinue to fall victim to inter-ethnic wars. In fighting\nterrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, States\nfind that the perpetrators are as well-armed as their\npolice forces. The lack of determination or promptness\nin preventing the degradation of the environment\nendangers life on our planet. The United Nations must\nstrive to give globalization a human face.\nWithin our own Organization, responsibility also\nmeans that we have to strengthen the authority of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security; pursue the process of reforming the\nSecurity Council, once we have agreed that an increase\nin its membership is justified; be more effective in\nassisting Member States to cope with their serious\neconomic and social problems; and enhance the\nOrganization's capacity to mount and deploy peace\nmissions on a timely basis.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the increasing\nrole of non-governmental organizations and other non-\nstate actors, in particular the powerful transnational\ncorporations. There is a need for them to assume\nincreased responsibility as well. Non-governmental\norganizations should be prepared to mobilize more\neffectively the resources of civil society in the service\nof the public well-being.\nAs for the transnational corporations, we are\naware of their role in stimulating the forces of\nglobalization and also in reaping its fruit. It is only fair\nfor them to assume responsibilities beyond the borders\nof their profit. There is a long way to go, so it is high\ntime to set out in this particular direction.\nThe Global Compact initiative launched by the\nSecretary-General should be built upon. In Romania,\nwe have already explored its potential and the results\nare promising. We believe, indeed, that the business\ncommunity can enhance support and enact a set of core\nvalues in the areas of human rights, labour standards\nand environmental protection. After all, profit is\nmeaningless if it does not lead to the improvement of\nthe human condition for all.\n(spoke in English)\nWe believe that all Member States, including\nRomania, can assume a share of the collective\nresponsibility. Indeed, my country is doing its best to\nmake its own contribution to the goals and purposes of\nthe United Nations. First, Romania is party to the\nmajority of the key multilateral treaties and\nconventions identified as such by the Secretary-\nGeneral in the context of the Millennium Summit.\nSecondly, we submitted a valuable resolution,\nentitled \u201cPromoting and consolidating democracy\u201d, that\nwas adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on\n25 April this year. Encouraged by its success, we will\ninvite the General Assembly to adopt this resolution at\nthe current session. We are convinced that all members\nof the General Assembly are prepared to reiterate their\nrecognition of the values, principles and practices that\ngive meaning to a democratic society.\nThirdly, Romania is a strong supporter of the\nUnited Nations role in peacekeeping. Our peacekeepers\nhave served in various places where we had no specific\nnational interest other than maintaining peace on behalf\nof the world and of the innocent people who make up\nthe majority of victims of conflicts and disputes. We\nhave worked hard to diversify our contribution to\npeacekeeping. Romania is also proud to be part of the\nfirst Multinational Stand-by Forces High-Readiness\nBrigade. That is a clear way of expressing support for\nenhancing the United Nations capacity to deploy\npeacekeepers rapidly and effectively. In the same\ncontext, we welcome the work of the Panel on United\nNations peace operations, which has provided a\nconvincing outline for an important reform of this\nparticular function.\nFourthly, we also believe that the time has come\nfor us to try to review the peacekeeping scale of\nassessments. As a concrete contribution to this effort, I\ntake this opportunity to announce that Romania is\nwilling to gradually move from Group C to Group B of\nthe assessment mechanism for peacekeeping. We\nappeal to all Member countries to work together to put\nan end to the current financial crisis.\nFifthly, in the same vein, let me emphasize that\nRomania has increased its voluntary contribution to the\nUnited Nations Development Programme's work in our\ncountry. This is one way of reiterating our support for\nand interest in the operational activities of the United\nNations.\n27\n\nWe have always supported creative and efficient\nforms of cooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations. I am pleased to announce to this\naudience that Romania is preparing to take over the\nhigh responsibility of the chairmanship of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) in 2001. We will work hard to make OSCE a\nmore instrumental organization, based upon a specific\ncommitment to improving the life of the citizens of its\n54 participating States. At the same time, we will use\nto its best the potential for dialogue and cooperation\nbetween OSCE and the United Nations in conflict-\nprevention and crisis management, in strengthening\ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law, in fighting\ncorruption and in other realms of common interest.\nHaving said this, I would make a plea to Member\nStates to integrate the two essential ingredients for\neffective action, namely solidarity and responsibility,\ninto the concept of total diplomacy. This means the\nsystematic use of firm and efficient diplomacy that\nshould be called upon before any dangerous tensions\nburst into conflict. It also means that we should give\nabsolute priority to diplomacy, prevention and\ncontainment, and in all circumstances use them\nextensively and comprehensively for the pacific\nsettlements of disputes. All of the means provided for\nin Chapter VI of the Charter and others that might be\ncreated through our collective effort of imagination\nshould reinforce the Organization's capacity to cope\nwith threats and conflicts, whether predictable or\nunpredictable.\nRecent developments in longstanding conflicts\nand disputes confirm that at the end of any road paved\nwith a heavy toll in human lives, material destruction\nand distorted mentalities, one can find a negotiating\ntable. Diplomacy, if used up to the point of exhaustion,\ncan eventually prove decisive, provided all the\npossibilities of statesmen, professional negotiators,\npublic opinion and civil society are comprehensively\nmobilized. Intense dialogue, diplomacy and flexibility\nfrom all parties are still needed in critical points of the\nworld, such as Kosovo. Resolution 1244 (1999) of the\nSecurity Council is a remarkable innovation, which\ncombines the specific capabilities of the United\nNations and some prominent regional organizations\nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of\nEurope. Let us work together, guided by resolution\n1244, to use the diplomatic and material potential of\nthese organizations with full positive impact on all the\ninhabitants of this province, irrespective of ethnic\nbackground or religion.\nI address the same appeal to responsibility to the\nparties involved in the Transdneister tension problem,\nwith the hope that the commitments assumed during\nthe OSCE Summit in Istanbul will be respected, so that\nnext year we will see concrete measures in the\nwithdrawal of military troops and arms from this part\nof the Republic of Moldova.\nWe are aware that there are many complex and\nunsolved situations for which energetic enforcement is\nneeded. We are ready to participate in a profound and\nresponsible debate on humanitarian intervention. We\nwould join other delegations in taking a fresh look at\nthe use of sanctions and seeing how effective they are\nwith respect to their target and what are the\nconsequences on the innocent civilian population or\nthird countries.\nAmong the possible consequences, it is worth\nmentioning the irrational retaliation reactions from\ncountries concerned. A case in point is the perpetuation\nof the blocking of the Danube \u2014 the blocking of\nnavigation on the Danube \u2014 which makes all the\nriparian countries suffer. Procrastination, resisting the\nlifting of the blockade on the Danube under various\npretexts defies international law and ignores the\neconomic interests in the region. Every day, shipping\ncompanies accumulate huge losses, which add to the\nalready heavy burden on the third countries in the area,\naccumulated during the years of the Yugoslav crisis.\nSpeaking of the situation in the Balkans in\ngeneral, we have to say that we are far from having\nreached complete stability. We are still witnessing\nconfrontation between the forces of integration and\nthose of dissolution. Time has come to get rid of the\nghosts of intolerance and hatred and open the door to\nthe fresh air of the European spirit of integration. The\nresults of the actions by the inflexible regime in\nBelgrade can be clearly seen today. Unfortunately, our\nneighbours are forced to cope with a destroyed and\nisolated economy and an unpredictable political\nsituation in a Yugoslav State once viable and respected,\nyet finding itself, today, in a process of dismantlement.\nPolitics should be judged by its results, and not by its\nintentions. We strongly wish for Yugoslavia to return to\nthe European mainstream, for which it must re-embrace\n28\n\nthe values of democracy, tolerance and freedom of\nexpression.\nThe historic conflict in the Middle East is not\nover yet, but it is diplomacy that still gives us hope for\na solution. I applaud the recent efforts made by the\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders to come closer to a final\nsettlement. This year we have also heard good news\nfrom the Korean Peninsula, a part of the world where\nhistory separated one people into two hostile parts.\nRomania is happy to see a fresh wave of diplomatic\nactions and human contacts that open new windows for\nan era of which the Korean people would be the first\nbeneficiary.\nFor us it is obvious that total diplomacy can be\nsuccessful if it is constantly and solidly based on\nhuman realities and on the fundamental aspiration of\nordinary people to a peaceful and decent life. With the\ncurrent, unprecedented level of knowledge we have\nreached, I am confident that we can find, in ourselves\nand our societies, resources for greater tolerance,\nmutual respect and dialogue, as opposed to the\nprimitive inclination to hatred, intolerance and\naggression.\nIt is incumbent to the United Nations, as the only\ninternational organization of universal vocation, to\nidentify new resources for our concerted endeavours to\nfind solutions to problems of global concern. I am glad\nto see that our position coincides in many respects with\nthe major ideas agreed upon by participants in the\nSummit. The United Nations should stubbornly keep\nworking to renew its profile and vigour while entering\nthe new millennium. Romania will continue to be ready\nto add its contribution to that effect."

        "file_text": "Allow\nme, first of all, to congratulate you most warmly, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to the presidency of the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Allow me\nalso to express the conviction that under your authority\nour work will be conducted with the same high level of\nvision and competence demonstrated by the President\nof your country, Ms. Tarja Halonen, in her\nCo-Chairpersonship of the Millennium Summit at the\nside of the President of Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma. I\nalso extend my thanks and congratulations to the\nSecretary-General, who continues to imbue the\ninternational Organization and the entire international\nstaff he commands with the virtues of rigour,\nmoderation and integrity that he embodies in his\nservice to the great ideals of the Organization.\nThose are the same ideals that have just been\nreaffirmed by the Heads of State and Government.\nThey also reaffirmed their confidence in the capacity of\nthe United Nations to ensure the advancement of, and\nrespect for, those ideals so long as the international\ncommunity gives the Organization the necessary\nsupport through a renewed commitment.\nFor a small State such as Monaco, nothing is\nmore important than such a reaffirmation of the ideals\nthat should govern relations between sovereign States\nin a spirit of equality and dignity. It is not a question of\ndisregarding the profound differences that may exist\nbetween States with regard to their objective\ncharacteristics, influence or weight in the affairs of the\nworld. However, it is appropriate to reaffirm the fact\nthat, no matter how small, each State should enjoy the\nright to respect, and that all States are be bound by the\nsame rules in conducting international affairs.\nIts history of over seven centuries makes it\npossible for Monaco to gauge what that reaffirmation\nrepresents, a reaffirmation supported by the common\ndetermination of all States represented here. For its\n2\n\npart, the Principality associates itself fully with the\nimpetus provided by the Millennium Summit. To the\nextent it is able, Monaco intends to contribute to\ndeveloping the full potential of that impetus.\nAllow me, before I touch on the principal issues\nwe will be dealing with at this session  in which\nMonaco has a longstanding interest  to address a\ntopic that seems to require some clarification: the\nPrincipality of Monaco itself.\nThough the notoriety enjoyed by the Principality\nseems well established, since the whole world has\nheard of it, all too often people have a one-sided view\nof it in which it is reduced to a set of appealing but\nvaguely archaic clich\u00c8s.\nMany people still believe that the casino is the\nmain source of income for the State, while in fact the\nassessment paid by the Societ\u00c8 des Bains de Mer,\nwhich manages the casino, yields only 4 per cent of\npublic revenue. The rest derives primarily from taxes\nand income from public property. In truth, the structure\nof our budget is not very different from that of any\nother country. As concerns expenses, many might envy\nus, as we are able each year to devote a third of our\nresources to investing in civil engineering projects.\nMany people also believe that we depend to a\nlarge extent on tourism. We are pleased, of course, that\nMonaco attracts about 6 million visitors a year. But\nhere again reality contradicts the image of a tourism-\ndependent economy, because tourism accounts for only\n10 per cent of the principality's revenues. Of the rest,\n40 per cent  are the product of local or international\ncommerce, 20 per cent of banking activities, 10 percent\nof industrial activities  emanating from about 100\nhigh-technology, non-polluting companies  and the\nrest derive from a variety of services.\nClearly, Monaco, rather than being a sort of old-\nstyle paradise for a happy few, has all the\ncharacteristics of a highly developed country.\nIn this connection, we must also note to what\nextent the Principality provides jobs in the region.\nThough Monaco has 30,000 residents, it has 38,000\nworkers, some 30,000 of which live outside of Monaco\nand commute to the Principality every day, which\nenables them and their families to enjoy the same\nsocial benefits and educational, sports and medical\namenities as the people of Monaco themselves.\nMonaco is undoubtedly a small country, but it\ndoes not live in the past. On the contrary, we have a\nbroad and modern outlook, and it is this vision that has\nenabled us to become a highly developed State that use\nstate-of-the-art technology and is involved in massive\nprojects, such as the one that has enabled us to build\nout over the sea and thus expand our territory by more\nthan 20 per cent during the reign of the current\nSovereign Prince.\nAlthough all of this is based on unarguable fact,\nsome still question the source of our prosperity. To our\nsurprise and indignation, we recently heard it said that\nthe Principality was too lenient with respect to certain\ncriminal activities. Quite the opposite: we have sought\nways and means of combating criminal activities and\nhave consistently reaffirmed our will to strengthen the\nmeasures we take to meet the challenges of today.\nAll foreign activities require Government\nauthorization, which is granted only following an in-\ndepth investigation. Nearly every week the\nGovernmental Council must veto certain projects. In\nthe area of banking and finance, monitoring systems\nhave been set up, and here we also rely on the help of\nour great friend and neighbour, France. The legislation\nin place to combat money-laundering is the same as\nthat in most developed countries. In fact, in certain\nareas, it is even more stringent.\nMonaco has set up an information and monitoring\nservice on financial flows to allow for the involvement\nof legal authorities when necessary and for the\nexchange of information with the equivalent foreign\ninstitutions. The Principality is in no way a laissez-\nfaire zone in which all types of wealth can be\naccumulated. Nor can it be termed an `opaque'\nfinancial venue, unless we believe that transparency\ndoes not exist anywhere.\nSome see Monaco as a kind of fiscal paradise, as\nif we had attempted to create artificial mechanisms to\nattract floating capital and wealthy people trying to\navoid taxation in their own countries. The truth is that\ndirect taxation was abolished in 1869, at a time when\nthere was no tax on the income of natural persons\nanywhere in the world, and thus competition could not\nhave been an issue. The fact that this situation\ncontinues to prevail today certainly places Monaco\namong the countries having `soft' tax laws. But there\nare, in fact, taxes: two-thirds of the country's income\nemanates from direct or indirect fiscal contributions,\n3\n\nthat is to say, the value-added tax and the tax on the\nprofits realized from commercial, industrial and\nintellectual activities.\nIn sum, Monaco is a highly developed country\nthat wishes to be an active participant in the European\nsphere and that observes all international commitments\nto combat present-day scourges such as financial\ncriminality and money laundering, which pose a clear\nthreat to the equilibrium of financial systems. The\nPrincipality is, by its very nature, supportive of its\nenvironment, but this is also the will of leadership.\nI now turn to the basis of its external activities,\nwhich also reflect its status as a small State focusing on\na few areas in which its tradition, experience and\nabilities can provide added value at the international\nlevel.\nOne of our priorities has always been\nhumanitarian action and social development. This was\nmade clear when, on 26 June last, His Serene Highness\nthe Hereditary Prince of Monaco, signed, in the\npresence of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, the two Optional Protocols to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, on the\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict and on the\nsale of children, child prostitution and child\npornography.\nThe actions taken in relation to the World Summit\nfor Social Development will be followed up during the\nspecial session to review the achievement of the goals\nof the World Summit for Children, to be held next year.\nWe expect that session effectively to address the issue\nof the protection of children, who are always the first\namong the civilian population to suffer in time of war.\nThe Principality also wishes to contribute to\ndevelopment at the public level as well as in terms of\nthe non-governmental organizations, which are very\nactive in Monaco, where they receive the strong\nsupport of all those who feel themselves morally\nobligated to contribute to the activities undertaken in a\nspirit of solidarity by a country that allows them to lead\na privileged life. We expect from the upcoming\nConference on the fight against poverty in the least\ndeveloped countries, to be held next May, and in\nparticular from the 10-year review of the outcome of\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, known as Rio + 10, a new impetus for\ninternational cooperation in these areas so vital to the\nfuture of humanity, in which progress is currently\nlagging.\nIt goes without saying that environmental issues,\nincluding in particular those relating to the marine\nenvironment, have always been priority concerns for\nMonaco, situated as it is on the Mediterranean coast.\nWe will continue to follow up on these activities and to\ntake initiatives along the lines of those we have been\npromoting.\nI can only reaffirm the role that the Principality\nplays in all relevant forums to intensify the struggle\nagainst the severe scourges of our times, such as\nterrorism, trafficking in drugs and in human beings,\nand the illegal financial flows which they create or\nsustain.\nLet me conclude by expressing the hope that I\nhave been able to provide a clearer view of the\nsituation in present-day Monaco, a situation of\ncontrasts. Monaco is one of the smallest countries in\nthe world, but at the same time one of the most highly\ndeveloped. It is an anachronism for those with an\nunrealistic or prejudiced view, but its economic\nstructures reflect great modernity and dynamism. Its\nimage may be identified with play and leisure, but the\nfact is that it creates jobs well beyond its borders. It is\nviewed as a curiosity, yet it remains an acknowledged\nsovereign State, as proved by its participation in the\nprincipal international organizations and by the fact\nthat its voice is heard in areas where its contribution\ndeserves to be taken into account.\nI could continue that list of contradictions, but I\nthink those are sufficient to provide a key to what His\nSerene Highness Prince Rainier III said when he\nopened the fabulous new Grimaldi Forum  a\nconference and cultural centre in Monaco  in\nsummarizing the inspiration that has always sustained\nhis dynasty and the Principality over the centuries:\n`One does not need a great territory to have great\ndreams, or a great number of people to make\nthem come true."

May I also assure you of my delegation's\ncooperation in achieving the objectives we all desire. It\nis also my pleasure to thank your predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his efforts in conducting the\nproceedings of the fifty-fourth session, as well as the\nproceedings of the special sessions held during the\nsame period.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress my deep appreciation for the valuable and\nconstant efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has\nmade to enable the Organization to deliver its message\nand to enhance its role in the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity throughout the world.\nMay I also extend my delegation's\ncongratulations to the Government and people of\nTuvalu on the occasion of its admission to membership\nin the United Nations. Its admission is a further\ndemonstration of the universality of the Organization.\nThe fifty-fifth session is remarkable because it\nalso encompasses the work of the Millennium Summit,\nwhich was attended by a large number of leaders of\nMember States. The very presence of those leaders, and\nthe discussions and meetings they held, served to\nunderscore the importance they attach to the role and\nresponsibilities of the United Nations in the new\ncentury. They also identified the changes and\nchallenges that will require joint international\ncooperation on the basis of the lofty and noble\nprinciples and purposes enshrined in the Organization's\nCharter.\nMore than half a century after its establishment,\nthe world Organization must deal effectively with\npolitical, economic, social and cultural changes and\ntake advantage of their positive impact. This is\nparticularly the case with regard to the ongoing and\naccelerating revolution in the fields of\ncommunications, modern technology and economic\nglobalization. In this regard, it is my pleasure to\ncommend the Secretary-General's report to the\nMillennium Summit, entitled, \u201cWe the peoples: the role\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century\u201d. That\nreport has shed light on the global issues of the years to\ncome and includes the positive aspects, misgivings and\napprehensions associated with those issues.\nThe State of Bahrain welcomes the United\nNations Millennium Declaration and the reaffirmation\nby Member States of their faith in the Charter's\nprinciples and the need to strengthen the role of the\nOrganization. We are confident that if we are\nsuccessful in giving effect to those principles, the\n2\n\nOrganization will be able to fulfil its political,\neconomic, social and human responsibilities. Foremost\namong those responsibilities are the preservation of\ninternational peace and security and combating disease,\npoverty, ignorance, drugs, violence, terrorism and\ncrime. Those responsibilities also include preservation\nof the environment and natural resources.\nWhile the cold war era threatened the world with\nthe dangers and risks of war, the ultimate challenges\nthe world must face in the future include border\ndisputes, racial and ethnic conflict, globalization of the\ninternational economy, development issues, and other\npolitical, social and environmental challenges, as well\nas issues related to weapons of mass destruction and\nterrorism.\nThe State of Bahrain \u2014 whose full integration\nand close association with the international community\nwas emphasized in the address to the Millennium\nSummit by His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa\nAl-Khalifa \u2014 is determined to continue to shoulder its\nnational, regional and international responsibilities\nwith a view to meeting the requirements of the new\ncentury. Given its ancient civilization and the fact that\nit is fully committed to the obligations associated with\nmembership in the United Nations and the international\ncommunity, Bahrain will deal positively and within the\nframework of regional and international cooperation\nwith the changes dictated by the new era in such a\nmanner as to ensure justice, security, peace and\nprosperity for all.\nSince it attained political independence and began\nto exercise full sovereignty over all its islands,\nterritories and territorial waters, in 1971, under the late\nEmir, His Highness Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa,\nthe State of Bahrain has constantly sought to build a\nmodern State and a developed civil society by\npreparing and training its people to deal with the\nrequirements of the modern age and to take a positive\nrole in the changes taking place currently and in the\nfuture. Today, in its new era, the State of Bahrain\ncontinues its strenuous efforts at modernization and\nprogress through domestic openness and by taking\nprogressive and measured steps in various fields. Those\nsteps include guaranteeing freedoms and ensuring the\nrule of law and women's participation in all aspects of\nnational life, notably through membership in the\nConsultative Council.\nIn the field of human rights, Bahrain continues to\ntake considerable steps by signing a number of\ninternational conventions in recognition of the\nimportance of those rights. Those conventions have\nmade the resulting legal rights and obligations\nabsolutely clear, while at the same time they firmly\noppose the use of human rights as a pretext for\ninterfering in internal affairs or for undermining\nreligious beliefs, human values and cultural and social\ncharacteristics of States.\nDespite its continuous efforts and the admirable\nstanding it has achieved in the field of human\ndevelopment, the State of Bahrain, like other\ndeveloping island States, faces a number of challenges\nstemming from its limited size, high population density\nand limited natural resources. As a result, Bahrain has\nundertaken ambitious development projects with a\nview to diversifying the sources of its national income.\nThose projects include an open economic policy that\nhas made Bahrain an advanced regional and global\ncommercial and financial centre.\nIn the area of foreign relations and the fulfilment\nof national and international obligations, the State of\nBahrain's contributions to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security are evidenced by the\nclose relations it maintains with brotherly and friendly\nStates on the basis of cooperation, mutual interests,\nmutual respect and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States. Driven by its firm belief in the\nimportance of regional and international security, the\nmaintenance of which is a joint responsibility, and in\nthe light of the serious and dangerous events witnessed\nby the Gulf region over the last 20 years the effects and\nramifications of which continue to pose a threat to the\nsecurity and stability of the area, the State of Bahrain\nwill continue to call for adherence by all States to the\nprinciples that contribute to the maintenance of\nsecurity and peace and the prevalence of stability,\nprogress and prosperity.\nAmong the most important of those principles are\nrespect for the status quo and the sanctity of existing\nborders; establishment of relations among States on the\nbasis of the principles of good neighbourliness, mutual\nrespect and non-interference in the internal affairs of\nother States; recognition of the national sovereignty of\neach State; and settlement of disputes through peaceful\nmeans and in accordance with the principles of\ninternational law accepted by the parties to the dispute.\n3\n\nOn this basis, and given its commitment to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\nespecially in the strategically important Gulf region, in\nwhich many States have vital interests, the State of\nBahrain reaffirms its principled and consistent\npositions on current regional and international issues.\nAccordingly, it renews its invitation to Iraq to\ncooperate with the United Nations; to fully implement\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, particularly\nthose relating to weapons of mass destruction; and to\nrelease prisoners and detainees of Kuwaiti and other\nnationalities, as a means leading to the lifting of\nsanctions and to an end to the suffering of the brotherly\nIraqi people. Meanwhile, it declares anew its call for\nthe preservation of Iraq's independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity and its objection to any\ninterference in Iraq's internal affairs.\nWith its deep interest and concern for a continued\nspirit of cooperation and good-neighbourly relations\namong the Gulf States, the State of Bahrain hopes that\nthe positive developments in relations between the\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran will lead to a peaceful\nresolution of the dispute over the three islands \u2014 Abu\nMusa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb \u2014 which all\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. It also reaffirms\nits support for all efforts to that end and hopes that the\nwork of the tripartite ministerial committee established\nby the Gulf Cooperation Council will succeed in\nfinding a solution aimed at ensuring the preservation of\nthe region's security and stability, in an atmosphere of\namicable and natural relations among all its States and\npeoples.\nThe Middle East peace process has witnessed,\nand continues to witness, developments, both\npolitically and on the ground, as evidenced by the\ncontacts and negotiations between the Palestinian\nAuthority and Israel, including, most importantly, the\nCamp David summit, held recently under the auspices\nof the United States of America, with a view to\nreaching a final agreement between the two parties.\nFurther, the contacts that have taken place in\nWashington in search of a possible resumption of\nnegotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are among the\nmost significant developments in the peace process this\nyear, despite the failure of such efforts owing to\nIsrael's refusal to withdraw completely from the Syrian\nArab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967.\nInsofar as the situation on the ground is\nconcerned, the withdrawal from southern Lebanon,\nwhich Israel was forced to carry out as a result of the\nsteadfast opposition and heroic resistance put up by the\nbrotherly Lebanese people against the occupation,\nconstitutes a significant turning point in the peace\nprocess and demonstrates that occupation can in no\nway ensure security.\nThe developments through which the peace\nprocess has gone on all tracks and in all stages have\nshown that the success of the process and the\nachievement of the desired just, comprehensive and\ndurable peace are contingent upon the implementation\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973) and of all relevant resolutions of international\nlegality, which call for the withdrawal of Israel from all\nArab territories occupied since 1967 and acknowledge\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding the right to establish their own independent\nstate, with Jerusalem as its capital.\nIn accepting peace, with all the steps it entails, as\na strategic option, the Arab side had hoped that Israel\nwould implement all these resolutions and fulfil the\nterms of all agreements and commitments, as well as\nabide by the principles of the 1991 Madrid Conference,\nnotably the principle of land for peace.\nWe believe that a fully comprehensive solution is\na fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of a\njust, durable and comprehensive peace in a region\nwhose peoples have been beset by conflicts and\ninstability, which have drained their resources and\nabilities in the context of a heated and futile arms race\nthat has deprived all parties of security. In order to save\nthe peace process from total collapse and failure, we\ncall upon the co-sponsors of the peace process and the\ninternational community to redouble their efforts and\npressure Israel into meeting the requirements of peace\nby fully implementing all resolutions of international\nlegality.\nDespite the easing of global tensions with respect\nto certain regional and international issues, there are\nstill issues in a number of different regions that give\nrise to concern on the part of the international\ncommunity and that threaten security and stability, both\nwithin those regions and beyond.\nIt is unfortunate that internal strife persists in\nAfghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as\nwell as in other areas. We therefore call once again for\n4\n\nthe intensification of efforts to find solutions to such\nconflicts and to encourage the parties to direct their\nefforts and capacities towards the settlement of their\ndisputes and the development of their countries and\nsocieties. We are pleased, in this connection, to\nwelcome the recent positive developments in Somalia,\nwhich have led to the election of a President in that\ncountry. We appreciate all the efforts that have been\nexerted towards that outcome, which, we hope, will\nbring about security and stability for Somalia and for\nits brotherly people.\nFurthermore, it is our pleasure to express our\nsatisfaction at the agreement reached in Algeria this\nyear between two neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and\nour appreciation for the efforts exerted in this direction\nby the Organization of African Unity and the\nconstructive role played by President Abdelaziz\nBouteflika of the brotherly People's Democratic\nRepublic of Algeria.\nIt is perhaps true to say that the globalization of\nthe economy and the stunning developments in the\nfields of information, communications and scientific\ninnovation \u2014 which have torn down the barriers to the\nflow of international trade, facilitated the transfer of\ncapital across borders, made interaction among various\ncultures inevitable and made every State in the world a\nneighbour to all other States \u2014 have both pros and\ncons and therefore constitute a great challenge for the\nfuture.\nThe misgivings with regard to globalization have\nbeen amply discussed and identified. Foremost among\nthese is the fear that it will weaken States' national\nauthority and their ability to act freely in determining\nthe levels of their own economic and social\ndevelopment, which would have a serious effect on the\nliving standard of the peoples of those States. The\nsituation therefore requires a reform of the\ninternational economic order so as to enable it to deal\nwith the financial, economic and social ramifications\nand consequent difficulties of globalization, whose\nprimary victims are likely to be developing and poor\nsocieties.\nThe process of economic globalization and\ndevelopment has given rise to many challenges for the\nworld economy and the international community. The\npositive aspects of globalization, as perceived by some,\nsuch as the smooth transfer of products, goods and\nservices across borders and the immense advances in\ninformation technology, should be coupled with a\nbalance between global and national economic policies.\nDespite the benefits of globalization in the fields\nof information technology, electronic commerce,\neducation, health, social development, access to\nmarkets and consumer benefits through the ability to\ncompete, there is fear that globalization's adverse\naspects might affect numerous segments of developing\nsocieties that might not have the ability to benefit from\nthe opportunities provided by globalization, given their\ninability to compete \u2014 thereby increasing poverty and\nthe marginalization of vast sectors of the population.\nIt is in the interest of the international community\nthat the progress accompanying globalization be\nutilized to achieve economic growth and integration, to\nassist in the eradication of poverty and to achieve\nsocial equality and development by way of directing\nthe process of globalization in a humane manner in\norder to mitigate its adverse effects. We must deal with\nthis phenomenon in a manner conducive to the\nestablishment of a world where a balance of interests is\nstruck and where equality, mutual interest and an\nhonourable way of life are available to all, without\nexception.\nIt is our pleasure to express, in this context, our\nsupport for the decisions and recommendations of the\nSouth Summit held in Havana and the Summit of the\nGroup of 15 held in Cairo in June 2000, and the\ncontents of the final document of the twenty-fourth\nspecial session of the General Assembly, held in\nGeneva last June, to follow up the implementation of\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in respect of the human dimension of\ndevelopment.\nAmong the challenges that mankind and our\ninternational Organization must address in the new\ncentury is the conservation of the environment and the\nmitigation of the adverse effects of economic,\nindustrial and technological developments in the world.\nSuch a task undoubtedly requires a global effort to be\nmade within the framework of the continuing\nimplementation of the world programme for the\nprotection of the environment set out in Agenda 21,\nwhich was adopted at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development, by linking the\ninterests of the developed countries with those of\ndeveloping countries, while using all means and\nmachinery available to fight pollution for the sake of\n5\n\nsafeguarding our children and grandchildren from the\ndangers of a planet spoiled by human activity.\nAnother challenge is the military one posed by\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\nnuclear capabilities and their means of transfer, which\nhave increased in many regions of the world in the past\nfew years. Given the threat to the world's future,\nsecurity and safety that such weapons pose, it is a\nwelcome sign for mankind as a whole that the States\nMembers of the United Nations have welcomed the\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in New\nYork in April and May 2000, and that the nuclear\nPowers have agreed on the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons.\nAware of the dangers of the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons, especially in the light of the wars and\nconflicts that our region has witnessed in recent\ndecades, we in the Middle East, including the Gulf\nregion, have supported all initiatives aimed at freeing\nthe region from all weapons of mass destruction, in\nparticular nuclear weapons.\nThe gravity of the phenomenon of terrorism \u2014\nwhich has intensified in recent years, challenging the\nwill of the international community and posing a threat\nto the security and stability of States and peoples \u2014 is\nof concern to us all. In reaffirming our condemnation\nof terrorism, regardless of its form, cause or origin, we\ncall for further measures to combat it, to punish its\nperpetrators and to prevent them from practising their\nactivities by denying them shelter.\nIt is incumbent upon us to reaffirm and reactivate\nthe role of the United Nations in order to meet and\neliminate these challenges in the framework of the\ncollective partnership provided for in the Charter, one\nof the most important objectives of which is to replace\nwar and confrontation with dialogue and cooperation.\nWe are convinced, however, that the momentum\ngenerated by the Millennium Summit and by the\nemphasis in its Declaration on support for the role of\nthe United Nations in promoting harmony in\ninternational relations and maintaining world peace and\nsecurity can be exploited only through the\nimplementation of the essential reforms of the\nOrganization's organs and bodies, especially the\nSecurity Council, by adhering to the principle of\nequitable geographic representation and transparency,\nwhich are among the most important elements that\nenhance its role in the maintenance of international\npeace and security.\nThe advent of the third millennium, with all the\nhopes it inspires, requires us all to consider and\nevaluate the action we should take to correct the\nconcepts and adjust the machinery through which we\nhope to achieve peace, security, prosperity and well-\nbeing for all in a framework of close international\nsolidarity on the basis of the oneness of the human race\nand its mutual interests. The unique characteristics of\nthe cultures, civilizations, religious beliefs and social\ntraditions of various societies and peoples should be\nused to promote understanding, rapprochement and\ninteraction among all States and peoples in a world of\ntranquillity, justice, security and peace.\nThe millennium to which we look forward is one\nin which we hope relations among peoples will be\nenhanced and dialogue and cooperation will replace\nwar and conflict, which bring nothing but devastation\nand destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Andorra will\nbecome, through the Western European and Others\nGroup (WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United\nNations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three\nyears. This is a great responsibility and a particular\nchallenge for a small country that has only been a\nMember of the United Nations since 1993.\nMy Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert\nPintat, would have loved to have been here today to\nexpress to Members Andorra's commitment to the\ngoals of the United Nations and specially our\nobligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the\nBrahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping\noperations, which my country supports. When he\nlearned that he would be unable to lead this year's\ndelegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable\nofficial functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light\nof our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to\ncontribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with\nsome free reflections \u2014 if possible innovative ones \u2014\non what globalization might mean for a small State.\nThis is a daunting task since everything seems to have\nbeen said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully\ncarry out my Minister's instructions.\nFirst, however, let me convey to President Harri\nHolkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election\nas President of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben\nGurirab, for a difficult job well done.\nWhen I was a student here in the United States\nmany years ago, I took a course in photography. I had\ntaken from my family's house in Andorra a negative \u2014\nit was one of the older glass negatives \u2014 and there in\nthe university photography lab I set it up for\ndeveloping. I remember that moment when I peered\ninto the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the\nwhite photographic paper, an image, the image of my\ngreat grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven,\nto see this face from a long distant past, from long\nbefore I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost\nimage from a lost past.\nIf I had the time, and Members the inclination, I\ncould tell them about my great-grandmother, a\nformidable woman who never left the Valley of\nAndorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I\ncould tell them what her face, strong and hard as the\nstone of the mountains, says about the history of my\ncountry. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black,\nand looks away from the camera, down at the rocky\nground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the\n16\n\nfamily farm, high up in the mountains above Saint\nJulia, one of the seven parishes that make up the\nPrincipality of Andorra.\nHer Andorra is very different from the country\ntoday. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone-\nstrewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and\nhotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are\nthe pride of my country, churches that date back to the\nfoundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth\ncentury and that loomed over the villages for almost a\nmillennium, are now hemmed in by concrete\nbuildings \u2014 stores, apartments, houses, the same\nbuildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro,\nBeijing or New York.\nYes, so much has changed since my grandfather's\nhand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother\nwould recognize only the church towers and the stones\nof the mountains. And what was so specific about her\nworld \u2014 the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily\nlife \u2014 well, that has disappeared.\nIn the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed\nfrom being a poor and remote place to a prosperous\ncountry, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come\nfor skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We\nare now a commercial hub. If you look for a country\ntransformed by globalization, you might look to\nAndorra.\nAndorra is a country that has survived,\nindependent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the\noldest and one of the smallest democracies in the\nworld. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact\nis due to its isolation and poverty, or because for\ncenturies the outside world was neatly balanced by its\nco-Princes \u2014 the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to\nthe north the Count of Foix, later the French King and\nsince 1805 the head of the French State.\nUnsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record\nof peace to the cautious character of the Andorran\npeople. Or rather \u2014 and less partially \u2014 I think that\nbecause it is a small country, where parishes have been\nable to readily communicate with one another at the\nCasa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys,\ncommunication never broke down.\nThe Millennium Summit of the United Nations\nhad as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was\naptly named, since I would say that globalization is the\nstory of the second millennium \u2014 indeed perhaps it is\nthe story of human culture. I am a politician, not a\nhistorian, but we all know the effect on both Europe\nand the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of\nindigenous and European cultures brought about by the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, or the effect of the\nslave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\non both Africa and the Americas. These violent\nencounters formed the world even as they brought\ndeath and destruction. They also sparked our\nimaginations. The Globe was the name of\nShakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London,\na joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to\nthink of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre\nin which we are the players or \u2014 if we have the\nimagination \u2014 the dramatists for the story of our\nfragile planet.\nBut the globalization we are now facing is of a\ndifferent nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his\nopening introduction to the Millennium conference, the\nstarting point for this millennium can be summed up in\none word: \u201cglobalization\u201d \u2014 the melting away of\nnational boundaries as the world becomes one\neconomy, one common space, one village.\nIt is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a\nvillage. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too\naware of the negative effects of the process. In the\nsame introduction, he cautions:\n\u201cGlobalization offers great opportunities, but at\npresent its benefits are very unevenly distributed\nwhile its costs are borne by all.\n\u201cThus the central challenge we face today is\nto ensure that globalization becomes a positive\nforce for all the world's people.\u201d (A/54/2000,\nparas. 13 and 14)\nWe all know the protests that have taken place,\nand will take place, against this same word,\n\u201cglobalization\u201d. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the\ninterested groups, chosen at random, the International\nForum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the\nterm as referring to a \u201cglobalized economic system\ndominated by supranational corporate trade and\nbanking institutions that are not accountable to\ndemocratic processes or national Governments\u201d. The\nIFG accuses\n\u201cthe GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined\nwith structural adjustment policies of the IMF\nand the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the\n17\n\nprocesses that weaken democracy, create a world\norder that is under the control of transnational\ncorporations, and that devastate the natural\nworld\u201d.\nAccording to the IFG, globalization brings the\ndiminishment of powers of local and indigenous\ncommunities, States and even nations, destroys both\nsmall-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining\nwilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of\ndiverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its\neffects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local\ncommunities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the\nrecognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the\nabandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic\ngrowth.\nWhen I listen to these words, I cannot help but\nhear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world:\nthe world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded\nof that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work\nthat indeed informs the thinking behind the activists\nwho struggle against the forces of globalization \u2014\nClaude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes\nTropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon\nbasin, which even as he captured it on paper was\ndisappearing into our modern world.\nI understand the sadness for the lost world, the\nworld of the past that is always slipping away from us,\nthat exists in the black-and-white negative of our\nmemory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly,\nall that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in\nthe world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by\nthe forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone,\ntelevision, cinema and the Internet.\nThese technologies link the world; they narrow\nits distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the\nglobe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners\nnow: what new discoveries await us? We cannot\nimagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we\nthink, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours.\nAnd yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not\nposted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a\nnew technology that sparked another revolution, the\nReformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was\ndownloaded from a web site on the Internet. This\nWeb \u2014 in which ideas, images, voices travel across our\nglobe in a flash \u2014 is a remarkable invention that\ncollapses both time and space.\nIn the same way, I now realize that my image of\nmy great-grandmother came from a negative, from a\ncamera \u2014 a technology that perhaps more than any\nother, besides the computer, has transformed and\nquickened the pace of our world.\nThis is to make a very simple point: not simply\nthat this manifesto is presented in the very technology\nof globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy\nmight be a product of globalization itself.\nMy great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard\none, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work.\nWould she have chosen this life, if she could have had\nanother? If she had known another? And more to the\npoint, would she have been allowed to choose?\nWe need to remember that people themselves\nhave embraced change. Real people who are not\ncontent to live \u2014 physically or imaginatively \u2014 in\ntheir places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better\ntheir lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to\ngrasp change, if only to know what they have lost.\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize\nthat people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain\nforests, might want to leave their paradise \u2014 not\nbecause they were driven out by modernity, the\nmodernity that L\u00e9vi-Strauss himself made so much of,\nbut because they wanted to better their lives, to\nembrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful\npulse of gain and loss.\nWe need only leave this Hall and walk through\nany street in the city to recognize this. People from all\nacross the world, people of all races, walking up and\ndown, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy,\nhomesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to\nproffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer\nwonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion\nrestaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or\nfusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or\nHong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are\nchanging, colours are shifting. What brave new world\nis being born around us?\nIn saying this, I do not want to contradict the\nconcerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their\nrecognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our\nperil practical questions that turn around international\nfinance, international corporations, the widening gulf\nbetween have and have-not countries, the dangers to\nthe environment.\n18\n\nThese are practical matters to be seen to. To\nparaphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the\nbenefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing\nfor all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for\nsuperfluous material goods, but shelter and health and\nprotection from disease. And I would add, simply, that\nbefore and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the\nUnited Nations hosted a series of summits or\nconferences designed to address these very\nproblems \u2014 Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing,\nRome, just to name a few. The world conference\nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nrelated intolerance, the world summit for children and\nRio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of\nwork in place to address the stresses of globalization.\nWhat we need to do now is continue to work towards\nour goals.\nIn conclusion, I would like to consider a\npresupposition of both global optimists and pessimists:\nthe notion that globalization has replaced nationalism.\nAgain, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means \u201cthe\nmelting away of national boundaries as the world\nbecomes one economy, one common space, one\nvillage\u201d.\nSimilarly, the report published in The New York\nTimes concerning the protests against globalization\nstated that \u201cspeakers do not oppose globalization per\nse, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is\ncoming to its inevitable end\u201d.\nAre globalization and nationalism opposed? On\nthe surface, they would appear to be. So much of\nglobalization \u2014 economies that transcend borders,\ncommunication networks that shrink the world \u2014\nseems to render an earlier model of the nation-State\nobsolete.\nAnd yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in\nRwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the\ndeveloped world or conflict in East Timor, we know\nthat the question of the border, of the passport, remains\nincreasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness,\nnationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a\nnationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is\nto the love of a place. I pray that the world does not\nsuccumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist\nsimply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of\nunscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic\nnationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of\nindividuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out\nfrom the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries \u2014 a\nnationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to\nthe scramble for loot \u2014 but a new nationalism that is\nnot predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a\nnationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no\nlonger restricted by national borders, a democratic or\ncivic nationalism, a global nationalism.\nThis would be a new nationalism, I must add, in\nwhich Andorra and other small countries are not\nhistorical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this\ncivic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the\ndemocratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's\nquiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and\ncommunication, can modestly serve as a kind of\nhistorical model.\nCountries need to rethink what it means to be a\nnation in order to participate effectively in the life of\nthis our globe, in order to become what we must be and\nto a certain extent already are: united nations. In its\nvery name, in its very mission, the United Nations\nanticipated the globalization that is so rapidly\noccurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and\nlater by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of\nnational struggles, the United Nations is an activist\nforum for issues that are global, not in the sense that\nthey transcend any individual nation, but in the sense\nthat they are of concern to all nations.\nThe International Criminal Court, whose statute\nwill soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had\nthe honour of contributing to it by composing the first\nparagraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an\nentity that respects borders but that places human\nrights above all. Crimes against humanity must be\npunished, and shall be.\nThis new nationalism, while it recognizes\nborders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and\npeace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as\nit respects national borders, needs to recognize that it\ncan and should become proactive in the protection of\nthose rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the\ngreat global threat of AIDS and other infectious\ndiseases demands a response from each nation and a\nrecognition that these threats can never be adequately\ndealt with alone, but only by working globally through\nthe United Nations. In short, we need not only the\nUnited Nations, but, as many have said, we need united\nnations.\n19\n\nI began this speech with the image of my great-\ngrandmother looking down at the stony ground of her\ncountry. I would end it, symbolically at least, with\nanother image: our image. Someday, our great-\ngrandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even\nour image here in this place. Perhaps they will\nreproduce it through a technology so strange, so\nremarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope\nthat they live in the brave new world I have spoken of\ntoday. And let us hope that they see us as an image of\npositive change. We who have lived through such\nchange cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the\nground of this great globe of ours, we need to look\nforward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach\nout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I welcome\nthe opportunity and the honour afforded me to speak on\nbehalf of Gabon at this session of the Assembly which,\nalthough a regular one, is no less an exceptional one.\nIndeed, not only does this session prepare us to\nenter fully into the third millennium but also, and\nabove all, it is being held at a time in the history of\nhumankind that gives rise to new encouraging\nprospects in the minds of men throughout the world for\na better future.\nThis is why, Mr. President, we welcome your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\nthe Assembly.\nWe are in fact convinced that your qualities as a\nstatesman and your wealth of personal experience are a\nguarantee for the success of our work.\nWith this in view, Gabon, as a Vice-President,\nwill give you its full cooperation so that this session\nmight effectively meet our expectations.\nI am pleased to express my deep gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for the\nefficient way in which he discharged his mandate.\nWe, in our turn, would like to warmly welcome\nthe State of Tuvalu, which has just joined the great\nfamily of the United Nations.\nI should like to pay a sincere tribute to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his steadfast\nefforts to realize the ideals of our Organization.\nIt has been 55 years since We the peoples of the\nUnited Nations decided to maintain international\npeace and security, to achieve international cooperation\nin solving international economic and social problems\nand in encouraging respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms without distinction as to race,\nlanguage or religion.\nThese are the primary missions set out in the\nUnited Nations Charter, which, in Article 55,\nrecommends the creation of conditions of stability and\nwell-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relations\namong  and, I would add, within  nations.\nThe San Francisco Charter clearly established a\nclose correlation between peace and development.\nIndeed, without peace there can be no development,\nand without development there can be no just and\nlasting peace. We acknowledge that it is difficult to\ncreate conditions of increased prosperity for the\ngreatest number in an environment where chaos and\ndisorder reign. In this regard, the case of Africa is\nparticularly revealing. When, after the end of the cold\nwar, the world seemed to be developing towards a\npromising situation because of the gradual reduction of\ninter-State conflicts, the African continent suddenly\nfell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented\nviolence. Dormant antagonisms have been reawakened,\nwith the primary manifestation being the clash of arms\nand disdain for fundamental humanitarian norms.\nSeveral of our countries have come under the\nyoke of warlords and become chaotic, ungovernable\nentities that now require humanitarian assistance.\nDespite the 50 or so peacekeeping operations that it has\nundertaken since the creation of the United Nations,\nthe Security Council has shown its limitations in the\nface of crises, especially in Africa. The Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone and\nSomalia are all cases that, in recent memory, have put\nthe solidarity of the United Nations to the test.\nIn the area of development, the world has seen\nunprecedented economic progress in the past 55 years.\nCountries that were underdeveloped not very long ago\nhave become dynamic centres of world economic\nactivity. But there is another fact: the vast majority of\nour countries and peoples remain desperately poor.\nIn his message to commemorate the World Day of\nPeace, His Holiness Pope John Paul II wrote,\nAt the beginning of a new century, the one\nissue which most challenges our human and\nChristian consciences is the poverty of countless\nmillions of men and women.\nAccording to the report (A/55/1) of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the work of the Organization dated\n20\n\n30 August 2000, almost half of the world's population\nmust content itself with living on less than $2 per\nperson per day. So it is that 300 million Africans do not\nhave even $1 a day on which to subsist. Furthermore,\nthis poverty is being made worse, in particular by the\nrapid spread of AIDS, another scourge that has\nravaged, brought suffering to, divided and decimated\nentire families in Africa and throughout the world. In\nsome African countries, AIDS has even become the\nmain cause of death.\nThese are factors for destabilization. While they\nare all different, together they create disorder and make\ninternational relations uncertain. But I do not intend\nmerely to provide a list of all the evils with which the\nAssembly is only too well acquainted and the United\nNations is constantly dealing. Nor should we neglect\nthe efforts undertaken and the progress achieved.\nRather, I should like to stress  here I am in\nagreement with the Assembly  that the United\nNations and the multilateral system do not have\nsufficient resources to face these major challenges. We\nhave been working at this for a long time now. We\ncannot now give in to discouragement. We are duty-\nbound to give the necessary impetus to our action.\nHow are we to do this? First, by moving from a\nculture of war to a genuine culture of peace. Gabon's\ndedication to the ideal of peace, which is a constant\nelement of its foreign policy, draws its strength from\nthe same roots as the Bantu civilization. We have a\nduty to give pride of place to the virtues of dialogue\nand tolerance among peoples and nations  virtues\nthat we practise in our homes and families, and that my\ncountry, through the personal intercession of President\nOmar Bongo, a tireless mediator, has made into a\nprinciple of political and diplomatic culture.\nWe must therefore return to our roots. That is, we\nshould go back to those traditional precepts that have\ngreater force today than ever before, given that today,\npeace is most often threatened not from outside our\nterritories but from within. We must adapt the United\nNations Charter to these new situations, in particular\nby adjusting the mandate of the Security Council with\nregard to internal crises.\nIt is in this context that we welcome the issuance\nof the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace\nOperations, presided over by Mr. Brahimi. We are\nconvinced that this report will help to promote a new\napproach to peacekeeping operations. Although\npeacekeeping operations are necessary as a means of\nresponding, they are nevertheless insufficient. What is\nat stake in the third millennium is not simply the\nachievement of ceasefires among adversaries in open\nconflicts, but the ability to nip conflicts in the bud\nthrough action designed to eliminate the deep-rooted\ncauses of violence.\nAn important step would be the creation or\nstrengthening of regional security machinery to allow\nus to resolve conflicts through dialogue and\nnegotiation, thus enabling us to considerably reduce\nmilitary expenditure and allocate the resources thereby\nreleased to other development needs.\nAt the subregional level, therefore, Gabon is\ncontributing, in cooperation with the other States of\nCentral Africa, to the establishment of a climate of\nconfidence after implementing preventive diplomacy.\nThe heads of State of our subregion have, for\nexample, set up the Council for Peace and Security in\nCentral Africa (COPAX), a body for military and\npolitical cooperation between the member States of the\nEconomic Community of Central African States, to\npromote measures to maintain and consolidate peace\nand security. COPAX has a multinational force for\nCentral Africa and an early-warning mechanism for\nCentral Africa.\nThe Gabonese Government has taken practical\nand financial steps for the effective start of MARAC's\nactivities, for which it is the headquarters. However, it\ngoes without saying that it is with the support of the\nUnited Nations and other partners that this instrument\nwill play its role fully.\nIn a broader regional context, a similar\nframework for joint action, cooperation, development,\nprevention, management and conflict resolution, the\nGulf of Guinea commission, made up of neighbouring\nNigeria and seven coastal central African States, was\ncreated on 19 November 1999 in Libreville.\nFinally, it is important to strength the multilateral\ndisarmament and non-proliferation machinery. Gabon,\nwhich ratified the Convention banning anti-personnel\nlandmines, the Convention banning chemical weapons\nand the Treaty banning nuclear testing, will continue to\nactively support international disarmament efforts by\nencouraging the process that has been set in motion of\ncombating the illicit trade in light arms and small\nweapons. The convening, in the summer of 2001, of an\n21\n\ninternational conference on that trade is important,\nsince it is quite clear that most conflicts in Africa and\nelsewhere in the world are fed by traffickers in arms,\ndrugs and diamonds, and are supported by, among\nother things, a number of major multinational\ncorporations that benefit from ill-gotten gains,\nproviding arms and drugs to the conflict zones and\nparticipating in money-laundering operations.\nWe also unreservedly support the creation of the\nInternational Criminal Court, and strongly advocate the\nrapid entry into force of the Rome Statute.\nWith regard to strengthening the fight against\npoverty and the initiation of new cooperation in the\nservice of development, the African continent accepts\nthat it bears the primary responsibility for its economic\nrecovery and that success in this task depends mainly\non its own efforts. But, at a time when the world is\nhappily entering the twenty-first century, Africa,\nmarginalized, is prey to destitution and poverty. The\nscope of the crisis it is experiencing and the importance\nof the resources to be made available require that the\ninternational community support its efforts through\nincreased concessional resources, expansion of\ncommerce and trade and debt relief.\nCooperation on this painful issue of poverty was\ndiscussed last January in Libreville by the heads of\nState and Government of sub-Saharan Africa and the\nBretton Woods institutions, at a conference where a\nnew approach to poverty eradication was proposed,\nwith a target date of 2015. During that economic\nsummit the heads of State and Government made\nrecommendations on considering the continent's\nprospects at the dawn of the new millennium and on\nthe challenges to be faced in speeding up economic\ngrowth and eradicating poverty.\nThere is no doubt that poverty eradication\nrequires much quicker economic growth, with its fruits\nbenefiting the greatest number. In this regard, social\njustice is a useful guide if we wish development and\neconomic growth to produce beneficial results that are\nmore equitably shared.\nOur heads of State and Government committed\nthemselves to redoubling their efforts to promote solid\nand sustainable growth in order to reduce poverty.\nFurthermore, they reiterated their determination to\nspeed up the process of subregional and regional\nintegration already begun with the creation of the\nAfrican Union this year in Lom\u00c8.\nAn open and interdependent world needs\nmechanisms to retain its balance and to help promote\njustice by preventing aggression against individuals\nand nature. It also needs participation in development\nfor all countries and peoples and efficiency in\neconomic relations by encouraging transparency,\npredictability and stability in international relations.\nOne solution would be  and on this point I\nagree with the view of many experts  for\ninternational development cooperation to cover not\nonly assistance, but also all activities necessary to\nguarantee sustainable development throughout the\nworld based on the individual.\nWe could then agree that development assistance\nfirst contributes to creating national conditions for\ndevelopment and to combating poverty, which is\nobviously incompatible with justice, popular\nparticipation and effectiveness.\nAs necessary as the achievement of food self-\nsufficiency throughout the world may appear, the\nnational capacity of the developing world should be\nstrengthened in order to facilitate the effective\nimplementation of international agreements on\nenvironmental protection, trade liberalization,\nmacroeconomic management and banking supervision,\nwhich are so essential to the proper functioning of a\nglobalized economy.\nLooking back at history, one can see that after the\nSecond World War development cooperation was\nsynonymous with solidarity and aid: assistance from\nthe richest countries to the poorest. It is time for this\ncooperation to be transformed, made more dynamic\nand, above all, become part of the new fact of\nglobalization.\nThe recent ministerial meeting initiated by Mr.\nMark Malloch Brown, the Administrator of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), highlighted\nthe need to strengthen the institution's capacity in order\nto fulfil its mission more effectively. This\nstrengthening is particularly necessary, since today,\nmore than ever before, it is not possible to conceive of\ndevelopment without taking environmental\nrequirements duly into account. UNDP could, for\ninstance, intensify its assistance to countries that draw\npart of their resources from forest products to achieve\nsustainable and ecologically viable management of the\nforests.\n22\n\nWith regard to strengthening protection of the\nenvironment, the debate under way in the United\nNations, which consists of blaming only the forest\ncountries, is unjust, since we know that the greenhouse\ngas emissions produced by the industrialized countries\nare largely responsible for the harm done to our planet.\nPassing responsibility back and forth would not be\nconstructive. To the contrary, we should rather search\ntogether, in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference, for\nways and means to enable us all to preserve the balance\nof our natural ecosystem.\nI turn to the alleviation of the crushing external\ndebt burden. On this crucial point, my country devotes\nnearly half its annual budget to repaying debt, thereby\ncompromising its efforts and chances for development.\nThe debt relief mechanisms advocated in recent years\nhave been discriminatory with regard to our country by\nexcluding us from their application. We say that the\nreasoning is unfair, being based on our high per capita\ngross domestic product, without taking into account\neither our ability to pay or the seriously\ndisproportionate distribution of national income\nbetween capital, labour and taxation.\nA study carried out recently by a team of\nuniversity specialists in Gabon shows that less than 40\nper cent of our gross domestic product is likely to\ncause a multiplier effect locally.\nThe peculiar situation of Gabon, the only country\nin the so-called intermediate-income category in sub-\nSaharan Africa, is due to the fact that its wealth is\nproduced by, and for, external protagonists.\nThus the appeal made to the international\ncommunity for a fairer treatment of my country's debt\nand that of others is not simply a form of begging.\nWhat is at stake is the strengthening of the\ninternational trading system for the benefit of all, so\nthat globalization, as the Secretary-General has quite\nrightly said, might become a positive force for all of\nhumankind. The debt problem remains a major source\nof concern for African countries, not just my own. We\nbelieve that our partners should show some\nimagination rather than coming up with the same tired\nsolutions.\nThat is why, in considering the debt problem,\naccount should be taken not only of socio-economic\nindicators but also of the efforts made by a State to\ncombat poverty and the deterioration of the\nenvironment. We will say it again: helping the South\nhelps the North and helps everyone.\nThe status of the developing countries,\nparticularly those of Africa, requires broad-based\naction on the part of the international community in\norder to translate into reality our duties of solidarity\ntowards peoples.\nOfficial development assistance continues to\ndecline. Following up on the recommendations of the\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development,\nrecently reaffirmed in Geneva, my country, in its fight\nagainst poverty, is now implementing the 20/20\ninitiative  that is, 20 per cent of its national budget\nand 20 per cent of official development assistance are\nallocated to basic social services. We all know here that\nthe 20/20 initiative is an excellent way to combat\npoverty.\nRegrettably, Gabon's efforts have been hampered\nby the dizzying decline in official development\nassistance and its exclusion from the benefits of\nexternal concessional financing.\nI turn now to the protection of vulnerable peoples\nand the fight against HIV/AIDS.\nAnother aspect of political and social problems in\nAfrica and throughout the world is the status of women\nand children in society. In my country, women have the\nsame rights as men. Our educational system ensures\nfree schooling for all school-age children, in the\ninterests of the Gabonese nation as a whole. School\nenrolment has risen from 27 per cent in 1950 to more\nthan 90 per cent today.\nFurthermore, my country is resolutely committed\nto promoting and protecting the rights of the child.\nAccordingly, we hosted in February 2000 in Libreville\nan international conference on trafficking in children\nand on child labour.\nWe call for the implementation of the\nrecommendations of that conference, which are a direct\nfollow-up to the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child and its two additional Protocols,\nsigned here by the head of State of Gabon.\nRegarding the campaign against HIV/AIDS, I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that, at the initiative of\nPresident Bongo, the Gabonese Government has just\ncreated a national solidarity fund to combat this\npandemic. Gabon believes that the creation of an\n23\n\ninternational solidarity fund to combat AIDS would no\ndoubt help the 35 million people stricken with this\nillness, the majority of whom are in developing\ncountries, especially in Africa.\nI turn now to the reform and restructuring of the\nUnited Nations system. In his report entitled We the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century, the Secretary-General emphasized the\nneed to renew the United Nations. This renewal\nrequires that we identify the major assets of the United\nNations, rebuild its infrastructure and information-\ntechnology capacities, and continue the peaceful\nrevolution  that is, the reforms begun in 1997.\nIn this context, it is necessary to revise the scale\nof assessments. It is in the interest of us all that we\nreadjust the scale of assessments, so that the burden of\nthe Organization's expenditures, and thereby its\nfreedom of action, does not rest on the shoulders of\nonly a few Member States.\nThe current millennium, a symbol of divine\ngenerosity and perfection to which we are bearing\nwitness, has the potential to give rise to further\nprogress in the building of a more just and peaceful\nworld. Every nation represented here is a reflection of\nhumankind, whose common values were recalled by\nthe founders of the United Nations. Humanity is itself\nin the image of God, and we must therefore together\nbring to fruition the precious gifts bestowed by our\nCreator: love, peace and freedom.\nThe United Nations must retain what has shown\nitself to be tried and true, adapt where necessary and\ndevise new forms of regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Year after year, we gather\nunder this universal roof to join our minds and\nresources in order to make the world a safer and more\nprosperous place  or, at least, one a little less\nburdened with all the troubles we have been trying to\nresolve for decades but have so far not succeeded in\neradicating. Never before have we assembled in such\nnumbers and extent in the span of just a few weeks \nfirst the religious leaders, then the Parliamentarians,\nthen the heads of State and Government and, finally,\nthe representatives to the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfifth session. Let us hope that this unprecedented\ncongregation will not remain just a tribute to the dawn\nof the twenty-first century, but will emerge as a\nfoundation for a better United Nations and a better\nworld it has to serve.\nWhen our heads of State met at the Millennium\nSummit earlier this month, they unanimously agreed on\nthe importance of the United Nations for our common\nfuture. To say that the United Nations is the only\nOrganization that brings together all the countries of\nthe world would be stating the obvious, but we must\nnever underestimate the simple fact that this is the only\nglobal Organization with universal membership and\ncomprehensive scope that indeed belongs to all of\nus  to all the peoples of the world. This is where the\nultimate strength of the United Nations lies.\nUnfortunately, we have too often failed to recognize\nthis.\nSome haunting facts should not be forgotten: the\nfact that 1 billion people in this world of ours live on\nless than $1 a day; the fact that 1 billion people do not\nhave access to clean water; the fact that the last time\nthe number of Security Council members was\nexpanded was nearly four decades ago, at a time when\nthe overall United Nations membership was almost half\nof its current size.\nThe United Nations must amount to more than a\nresolution or a decision, a plenary meeting or informal\nconsultations. We all have to work together, to spare no\neffort to make the Organization more proficient, more\neffective and fully at the disposal of all its Member\nStates. That is why Croatia welcomes the millennium\nreport of the Secretary-General and shares his views on\nthe need for action to adapt the functioning of the\nOrganization to the challenges of the new century.\nThere is a growing need and plenty of room for\nimprovement along the lines of efficiency,\ntransparency, equality and good governance. There is\nno room for excuses or for delaying reforms any\nfurther. The time for reform is now.\nCroatia has been an active Member of the\nOrganization since its international recognition as a\nsovereign State in the early 1990s. At that time, in spite\n\n\nof all our activities, Croatia was primarily the object of\nnumerous peacekeeping operations and endless debates\nwithin the Security Council. Today, Croatia is a major\ngenerator of peace and stability in South-East Europe,\nan active promoter and facilitator of democracy in the\nregion, a reliable partner and a member of numerous\nregional organizations and initiatives. We have not\nforgotten the difficult years when Croatia was on the\nreceiving end of United Nations activities. Today, we\nstand ready to put our expertise gained in peacekeeping\nand other fields to the service of peace and democracy.\nThe experience of the homeland war, as well as\nthe lessons learned during peacekeeping operations in\nCroatia, have served us well in Croatia's active\nengagement in the United Nations peacekeeping\nmission in Sierra Leone. We are ready to expand our\nrole in peacekeeping and to actively participate in its\nconceptual development. Croatia welcomes and will\ncarefully study the recently published report of the\nSecretary-General on the reform of peace operations\nand the recommendations proposed.\nUnfortunately, the number of incidents with tragic\nconsequences involving members of peace missions all\nover the world is constantly increasing. Just few days\nago, three members of the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in\nAtambua in West Timor were brutally killed. One of\nthem was Pero \u00e4imund\u00fba, a citizen of Croatia. I would\nlike to use this opportunity to pay tribute to him\npersonally and to all peacekeepers whose tireless\nefforts cost them their lives in performing their noble\ntasks in the line of duty.\nCroatia is currently a member of the Economic\nand Social Council, the central body of the United\nNations. The increasing development of the Council as\na forum for policy dialogue, together with its follow-up\ndimension of the major world conferences, adds\nimportant value to its work and puts a heavy workload\non its members.\nCroatia's international responsibilities start with\nthose towards the region of South-East Europe. At the\nJanuary elections, citizens of Croatia demonstrated\ntheir strong commitment to democratic values, respect\nfor human and minority rights, the rule of law and\neconomic reforms. They opted for broad changes that\nwill bring them into the mainstream of the European\nintegration processes.\nThe new Croatian Government is well aware of\nall the responsibilities it has undertaken and all the\nopportunities that are arising. We firmly believe that\nCroatia's leading role as a contributor to peace and\nsecurity in the region of South-East Europe will\nconsiderably contribute to turning this part of Europe\ninto an area of peace and prosperity.\nIn February, the Croatian Government adopted a\nprogramme that, as its primary goals, stresses\ndemocratic values, respect for human and minority\nrights, the return of refugees and displaced persons,\ngood-neighbourly relations and integration into the\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization. The new Government is determined to\nfulfil all Croatia's ongoing international commitments\nand to assume new ones, if the need arises.\nThe elections in Croatia at the beginning of this\nyear resulted in important changes. They provided for\nan increased level of human rights protection and\nmedia freedom, as well as the acceleration of the return\nprocess. Important legislative revisions in the field of\nthe return of refugees have opened the door for the\nunimpeded return of all Croatian citizens, regardless of\ntheir ethnicity and without condition of reciprocity. All\nthe citizens of Croatia stand equal before the law in\nterms of the reconstruction of their houses and all other\nreturn-related rights. The Government of Croatia will\ndo its best to fully implement those laws.\nCroatia is mindful of the fact that the return of\nrefugees represents a necessary prerequisite for lasting\nstability in the region. In order to accelerate the process\nof return, the Croatian Government, in cooperation\nwith UNHCR, has prepared a special return project for\n16,500 persons, tailored to their needs. The necessary\narrangements for the return of refugees to both Croatia\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be made through\ncentral institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in line\nwith the new Croatian policy towards that country.\nAdditionally, to speed up the process of two-way return\nwith Republika Srpska, the former Prime Minister of\nthe Republika Srpska and I have signed a joint\ndeclaration on the facilitation of the return of refugees.\nThrough this document, we have committed ourselves\nto enabling the return of 2,000 people from each side,\nas well as to exchanging information and adjusting\nprocedures in that regard. I can proudly say that real\nprogress in the return process has been achieved.\n3\n\nAt the same time, I have to stress that the number\nof returns to Croatia by far exceeds the number of\nreturns of Croats to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAdditional efforts have to be invested to speed up the\nreturn process of Croats and all others to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. All the refugees have the right to return,\nbut they also have a right to stay in the areas where\nthey presently reside. For all those Bosnian Croats who\nwish to stay in Croatia, we have to provide appropriate\nhelp in finding new housing facilities.\nThe success of the return of refugees does not\ndepend solely on political and legal parameters. It has\nto be accompanied by the development of the State\neconomy and the local economy. The return process\nmust be sustained by job opportunities, small- and\nmedium-size enterprises, strengthening of the social\nfabric and adequate schools and health institutions, as\nwell as better living conditions generally. Otherwise,\nwe shall just turn returnees into economic migrants and\nthey will be on the road once again.\nNot a small part of legislative changes relates to\nthe protection of human and minority rights in Croatia.\nThe Croatian Government is of the opinion that the\nnecessary preconditions have been met for excluding\nCroatia from the omnibus resolutions on the situation\nof human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, which have been adopted by both the\nGeneral Assembly and the Commission on Human\nRights, and for the exclusion of Croatia from the\nmandate of the Special Rapporteur derived from the\nCommission's resolution.\nImportant recognition of the progress Croatia has\nmade in respecting fundamental values of democracy,\nhuman rights and rule of law came recently from the\nCouncil of Europe. The Monitoring Committee of its\nParliamentary Assembly concluded last Friday that\nCroatia has honoured its obligations and most of its\ncommitments undertaken at the time of its accession to\nthe Council of Europe in 1996. Consequently, we\nexpect that the monitoring procedure will be formally\nclosed at the plenary session of the Parliamentary\nAssembly, at the end of this month.\nFor the Croatian Government, cooperation with\nthe International Tribunal in The Hague remains\nprimarily a legal issue, not a political one. The\nCroatian State Parliament adopted the Declaration on\nCooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in April,\nunambiguously affirming its support for the Tribunal,\nand this important document remains a framework for\nCroatia's policy towards the ICTY. It is our firm\nposition that the guilt for the crimes committed must be\nindividualized: no nation can be held collectively\nresponsible for the crimes committed by war criminals\nclaiming to act in its name. In order to improve the\nquality of cooperation with the ICTY, the Government\nCouncil for cooperation with the ICTY has been\nconstituted and close working relations with the\nTribunal established.\nPromotion of good relations with its neighbours\nis Croatia's high-priority goal. In its programme, the\nCroatian Government clearly stipulated that its\nrelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are based on\ngood-neighbourliness, equality and transparency.\nCroatia will continue to cooperate with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the international community in the\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, which\nremains the foundation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's\nself-sustainability and the guarantee of the preservation\nof the national interests of its three constituent peoples.\nCroatia's policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina rests\non full respect for the independence and sovereignty of\nthat country.\nCroatia sees this as the only way to a prosperous\nfuture for the Croatian people in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the care for whom remains our\nconstitutional obligation. Croatia will continue to\nsupport Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it\nforesees doing this in a transparent way, in accordance\nwith the Dayton Agreement and with a clear Euro-\nAtlantic orientation.\nTransparent financing of the Croatian component\nof the Federation Army through the Standing\nCommittee on Military Matters is only one of the steps\naimed at enhancing the central institutions and concrete\nproof of the new Croatian policy towards Croats in\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe relations between Croatia and Serbia cannot\nbe regarded outside the framework of the international\nisolation of the Milosevi? regime. Croatia is not\nquestioning at all the need to continue the\nnormalization process with the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, but its dynamics and substance will depend\non the democratization of Serbia, which remains one of\nthe necessary conditions for international and\n4\n\neconomic stability in the region. Croatia hopes that the\nforthcoming elections in the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia will be conducted in a democratic way that\nreflects the true will of the people and that they will\nresult in democratic changes. Bearing in mind the fact\nthat the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope has been denied an opportunity to monitor the\nelections means that the elections could lose their\ninternational credibility. Still, Croatia wants to believe\nthat Serbia will find a way to end the present situation\nand join the mainstream of the political and economic\nintegration process in the region and Europe as a\nwhole.\nCroatia supports democratic developments in the\nYugoslav Republic of Montenegro. An open,\ndemocratic, multi-ethnic, stable and economically\nviable Montenegro is in the interest of Croatia and of\nthe region at large. In the course of this year a number\nof meetings have been held between the Croatian and\nMontenegrin officials at various levels, including the\nhighest level. Two border crossings between Croatia\nand Montenegro are operating without impediment, and\nfurther steps for enhanced cooperation, especially\neconomic ones, are under way. Croatia will continue to\nsupport the process of democratization that has already\nbegan in Montenegro and help in its opening towards\nEurope, firmly in line with the efforts of the\ninternational community.\nCroatia remains seriously concerned about the\npresent situation in Kosovo and continued violence,\nwhose victims are both Albanians and the Serbs. We\nhope that efforts of the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) forces\nand civilian administration will be successful in\nbringing peace and stability to the region, as well as\nfacilitating preconditions for the return of refugees.\nOne issue, however, stands out in regard to the\nstability and lasting security of the whole region. It is\nthe question of succession of States created after the\ndissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia.\nAn important aspect of the succession problem is\nthe question of membership of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia in the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations. The four successor States\nare of the opinion that this must be resolved in line\nwith the already existing Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions. That means that the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia cannot automatically continue\nthe membership of the former State in the United\nNations, and therefore, that it should do what other\nsuccessor States have done  apply for membership as\nthe fifth successor. Moreover, the four successor States\nare of the opinion that the current practice in the\nUnited Nations should reflect the above-mentioned\nresolutions and be more consistent in that regard.\nTherefore, we call for immediate implementation of\nthose resolutions and emphasize once again the\nimportance of resolving the question of succession,\ndespite the rejection by the present Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia regime.\nThere are still a small number of United Nations\nmilitary observers within the international borders of\nCroatia. Their performance in Prevlaka, the\nsouthernmost part of my country, has considerably\ncontributed to the lasting solution to this problem,\nwhich is definitely one of security, not one of a\nterritorial nature. Since 1992, Croatia has accepted the\nUnited Nations mandate on Prevlaka, with the last six-\nmonth extension on 15 July this year. The steady\nnormalization of relations between Croatia and the\ndemocratic Government of Montenegro has\nconsiderably improved the situation on the ground and\nshould serve as a bedrock for a lasting solution for\nPrevlaka. In approaching the Prevlaka issue one has to\nrespect existing international borders, as well as\nlegitimate security concerns, land ownership rights and\nthe need for economic cooperation and development in\nthe region.\nThe stability of South-East Europe is an\ninseparable part of the overall European stability\narchitecture. Being at the same time a Central\nEuropean, Mediterranean, Danubian and South-East\nEuropean country, Croatia plays an active role in\nseveral regional initiatives that serve as a foundation\nfor stabilization, cooperation and development in our\npart of the world. Let me mention in this regard the\nCentral European Initiative, one of the oldest regional\ninitiatives, and the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, the\nnewest.\nDuring its chairmanship of the Working\nCommunity of the Danube Region this year, Croatia\nwill host the traditional Conference of the heads of the\nregional Governments as well as the Economic and\nCultural Forum. Alpe Adria is another subregional\ninitiative in which Croatia plays an active role.\nCroatia's role as an active observer in the South-East\n5\n\nEurope Cooperation Initiative additionally emphasizes\nour intention to contribute to regional security and\nstability.\nFrom the very outset, Croatia has actively\nengaged in the creation and implementation of the\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This strategic\nprocess represents a comprehensive approach towards\nthe region in which the concept of stability includes\ndemocratization and human rights, economic\ndevelopment and security issues. Croatia has presented\nseveral project proposals to all three working tables of\nthe Stability Pact, the construction of the Adriatic-\nIonian highway being the most important of them. The\nconstruction of this highway, stretching along the\ncoastline from the Italian to the Greek border, would\nmean a significant improvement in road travel between\nthe countries of the region, and would also bring\neconomic development to the very part of the region\nthat most dearly needs it.\nI have the satisfaction of informing the Assembly\nthat at the beginning of this week Croatia hosted the\nparliamentary summit of the Stability Pact, which had\ncomplete success in strengthening the important\nparliamentary dimensions of the Pact.\nThe Stability Pact also serves as a mechanism for\nfacilitating the European Union (EU) and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership\nprospects for all those countries of South-East Europe\nthat wish to pursue this path. Croatia is one of them.\nFull integration into the EU and NATO is the priority\nstrategic objective of Croatian foreign policy.\nIn a brief span of six months Croatia's\ninternational position regarding the European Union\nhas thoroughly changed. It has gone from being a\ncountry with no institutional relations with the\nEuropean Union to a country awaiting the start of\nnegotiations on a stabilization and association\nagreement and, consequently, candidacy for EU\nmembership. Croatia is very pleased with the results of\nthe joint consultative task force, whose\nrecommendations helped us to prepare the start of the\nnegotiations on the stabilization and association\nagreement. We are encouraged by the European\nCommission high representative's statements that this\ngeneration of agreements will be tailored according to\nthe present needs and achievements of the stabilization\nand association process countries, and that countries'\nfurther progress towards European Union membership\nwill be assessed on their individual merits.\nIn late November Croatia will host a summit of\nthe European Union member States and the\nstabilization and association process countries \nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. We\nfeel privileged to host such a historic meeting, one that\nwill signify the importance that the European Union\nattaches to the region within the framework of the\nUnion's enlargement process. At the top of the Zagreb\nsummit's agenda will be the issue of opening EU\nprospects to the region and the countries of South-East\nEurope. This is firmly in line with the policy of\ncreating one Europe without walls or curtains of\ndivision. We see the arrival of the EU heads of State or\nGovernment to Zagreb as a tribute to Croatia's\ndemocratic achievements and a harbinger of our status\nof country associated with the European Union.\nIn May Croatia entered the Partnership for Peace.\nThis provided Croatia with an opportunity to contribute\nmore actively to the peace and security of the region\nand to strengthen its democracy and stability at the\nsame time. In parallel, Croatia has begun the\nsubstantial reconstruction and modernization of its\narmed forces, aiming to meet all NATO requirements\nas well as democratic standards.\nCroatia continues its active engagement in the\npivotal European organizations, such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe. It has achieved\nsignificant progress in working together with the OSCE\non the improvement of security in the Danubian region\nthrough the engagement of OSCE civilian police\nmonitors there, as well as in other fields of\ncooperation, such as the improvement of democratic\nstandards in Croatia.\nWorld peace does not depend solely on peace and\nsecurity in Europe. It is with concern that we look at\nthe ongoing threat of new crises on the African\ncontinent, where tremendous amounts of human\nresources and money are feeding the war machines,\ninstead of serving to fuel development. The cause of\nour special concern lies in the fact that many armed\nconflicts in Africa erupt encouraged by and with the\nparticipation of neighbouring countries, often using\nforeign mercenaries who sometimes come even from\nEastern European countries. Croatia sees the\nimplementation of the Non-Aligned Movement\n6\n\nprinciples, as well as of the principles of the\nOrganization of African Unity and other, subregional\norganizations, as an important element in the political\ndevelopments in that part of the world.\nThese organizations undertake commendable\nefforts in order to establish mechanisms for conflict\nprevention, as well as to find the ways to end the\nongoing crises. These efforts include the establishment\nof their own peacekeeping forces. In this regard,\nCroatia welcomes the determination of the African\ncountries to solve their problems regionally and with\nsupport from the United Nations.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to shift\nbetween the brink of war and the brink of peace. The\npeace process between the Israeli and Palestinian sides\nmust be maintained, and all of us should spare no effort\nto extend assistance and support to the accomplishment\nof this paramount task. From its own experience,\nCroatia is well aware of how important it is to\nstrengthen the peace process through Security Council\nand General Assembly resolutions that are supportive\nof it, both in language and in political substance. Thus,\nCroatia advocates that forthcoming resolutions on the\nMiddle East reflect all the aspects of the ongoing peace\nprocess, serving as an important impetus for its\nsuccessful completion.\nCroatia is a country highly contaminated by\nantipersonnel landmines, with about 1 million\nlandmines scattered over many parts of its territory.\nTheir presence poses serious obstacle to the economic\ndevelopment of the country, and even more so to the\nreturn of people to their homes. The mine-clearing\nprocess is under way, but it has to be intensified if real\nprogress is to be seen anytime soon. Many of the\nongoing activities are performed in cooperation with\ndonor countries, to which we extend our sincere\ngratitude; but maximum efforts have to be made to\neliminate this evil completely and for good. In this\nconnection, Croatia calls for further international\nassistance so as to enable the unimpeded development\nof the country at large.\nLet me briefly address the issue of the reform of\nthe Security Council. Croatia holds the view that the\npresent structure and functioning of the Security\nCouncil does not properly reflect the reality of\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century, or the\nneed for universal democratization. We support\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-\npermanent seats in the Council, taking into account\nequitable geographical distribution as well as\ncontributions to the United Nations budget. However,\nreform must go beyond the sole issue of membership\nenlargement. The Council's methods of work should be\nmade more transparent, in particular regarding informal\nconsultations, which have proved to be anything but\ninformal.\nThe subject of greatest concern is that, with the\nadvent of globalization, the number of people that are\nmarginalized and strongly affected by its negative\neffects is growing. Therefore, we have to minimize the\nnegative impacts of globalization and, at the same time,\nmake its benefits available to all.\nThe effects of globalization on the international\neconomy are significant and call for enhanced\ncooperation through multilateral institutions. In\naddition to the efforts aimed at avoiding\nmarginalization and at ensuring full integration into the\nworld economy, the countries with economies in\ntransition face challenges associated with privatization\nand structural and macroeconomic reforms. In the case\nof Croatia there is an additional challenge, that of the\npost-war recovery. In such circumstances, our pivotal\ngoal is to consolidate economic recovery and create\nconditions for sound and sustainable economic and\nsocial development. Our overall economic programme\nand policy measures are designed to support further\neconomic stability, with stable prices and low inflation,\nconcurrent economic growth, a faster rate of\nemployment and more exports.\nTo attract foreign investments that are so\nimportant for the ongoing process of development, a\nnew Investment Law has been adopted. Constructive\neconomic cooperation on bilateral, regional and global\nlevels remains Croatia's firm goal. Croatia has recently\nsigned the Protocol of Accession to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) and, within a few months, once\nthe process of ratification is completed, Croatia will\nbecome a full member of the WTO.\nThe challenges facing the Organization are\nnumerous. Answers will have to be found for questions\nregarding how to renew the structure and mandates of\nthe main United Nations bodies, how to ensure better\nmanagement and mobilization of new resources, how\nto define new forms of partnership, both with the\nprivate sector and with non-governmental\norganizations, how to make cooperation more effective\n7\n\nand, above all, how to turn the United Nations into a\nresult-based Organization. Croatia believes in the\npotentials of the United Nations and considers that it\nwill be made truly efficient if we  the Member\nStates  accept our responsibilities towards it.\nCroatia is ready to work together with all\ninternational actors in searching for the right answers\nto the challenges that lie ahead. Stability and prosperity\nof the world will become possible only if we never stop\nlooking for ways to improve them. Croatia will\ncontinue to use its best efforts to preserve the positive\ntrends in its general achievements and to contribute to\nEuropean and world stability.\nIn conclusion, allow me to congratulate\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign Minister of\nNamibia and the President of the fifty-fourth session of\nthe Assembly, on his dedicated work and on the great\nskills with which he performed his demanding job. I\nwould also like to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri,\nForeign Minister of Finland, on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session and to wish him all\nsuccess in his future work.\nFinally, I would like to express the hope that this\nMillennium Assembly will result in new commitments\nthat will bring progress in responding to the challenges\nof the new century."

        "file_text": "Before I begin, I should like to make a\npersonal comment. As a former official of the United\nNations Population Fund, I should like to express my\ngreat pride and personal satisfaction at being able to\nspeak to the Assembly today and to address those\ncountries with which I have worked, together with my\nother colleagues in the United Nations. All of us, of\ncourse, share a hope that our dream of a better world\nwill come true.\nIt is a great source of satisfaction to see the\nPresident preside over the work of this Assembly,\nfamiliar as I am with his great personal and\nprofessional skills, which guarantee the success of our\nwork. I should also like to express to his predecessor,\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab, our gratitude and\nrecognition of the efficient work he has done.\nSimilarly, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the detailed report on the work of\nthe Organization that he has presented. It describes the\nimportant work carried out by the United Nations over\nthe past year as well as the challenges for the future.\nI should also like to express on behalf of my\nGovernment our pleasure at the entry of Tuvalu as a\nnew Member of our Organization. This is an important\nstep forward along the road of universality, which is\nthe aspiration we all share.\nThe recently concluded Millennium Summit was\na useful instrument for reflection by our Heads of State\nupon the present and future of the Organization. This\nOrganization must adapt its structures and mechanisms\nfor action to the new challenges facing humanity. I am\ncertain that the numerous suggestions that have been\nmade will help establish clear lines of action so the\nUnited Nations can operate more efficiently and\neffectively.\nAt the last summit of the Rio Group, which took\nplace in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, the Heads of\nState who comprise this political consultation\nmechanism endorsed the Cartagena Declaration as our\nsingular contribution to the Millennium Summit and to\nthe future of the United Nations. It is our intention to\nensure appropriate follow-up to the initiatives and\naspirations expressed in this document in order to make\ncertain that they become a reality in the future for the\nbenefit of all humanity in terms of democracy, trade\nflows, better dynamics in international relations in\nterms of human security and the pursuit of multilateral\nsolutions.\nI fully agree with the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization when he says that the conclusion of one\ncentury and the turn of the millennium provide us with\na unique vantage point for reflecting upon our common\ndestiny. Fifty-five years have passed since the creation\nof the United Nations, and during that period we have\nseen many auspicious as well as many worrying events.\nLet us pause for a moment and think about all the good\nthat we have done and the good that we have failed to\ndo, as well as upon what we have done wrong or\nshould not have done.\nThe conclusion of the cold war, of which this\nOrganization was one of the most important theatres,\nseemed to herald a period of peace and prosperity for\nhumanity, in fulfilment of the Biblical mandate to beat\nour swords into plowshares. Nevertheless, humanity is\nstill facing terrible threats, not only to its security \u2014\nbecause war and violence persist in new and more\nsophisticated forms \u2014 but also threats to its very\nexistence, in light of the prospect that our planet may\nbecome uninhabitable as a result of human activities.\nConsequently, in the new millennium the United\nNations will be equally if not more important than it\nwas in the previous millennium. Our Organization must\nof course adapt to new times. The reform of our\nOrganization cannot be postponed any further. The\nstructures of its main organs must adapt to the new\ncharacteristics of the international community, with the\nincreasing number of nations which belong to it. We\nmust adapt to the increasing role of civil society, the\nspread of the system of representative democracy, the\nglobalization of our world markets and the intolerable\npersistence of serious social deficits in most of our\nStates.\n23\n\nIn particular, our Organization must adapt so that\nour efforts towards development are rendered\nappropriate for each individual wherever he or she may\nlive and wherever his or her community may be\nlocated, and wherever we want to see our families\ngrow.\nThe human being as the centre of development\nwill continue to be at the centre of our mandate, as well\nas the commitments assumed by each and every one of\nour countries at summits of the United Nations over the\npast decade. The efforts made by each man, woman or\nchild to take advantage of the opportunities offered by\nglobal markets and new economic trends is first and\nforemost a local and community effort and secondly a\nnational effort, which can create opportunities for\ngrowth and ensure participation for each man and each\nwoman.\nThe reorganization of the United Nations, and in\nparticular its system of development, must ensure that\nit can respond creatively and flexibly to these\ncommunity and national efforts. This will make it\npossible progressively to improve for each individual\ndaily access to health, education, sanitation services,\ntechnology and reasonable credit, as well as the\nequitable participation of women in productive\nactivities. In that way, we can ensure the integration of\nall our citizens into the global market and make certain\nthey can benefit from this process.\nIt is vital that the cooperation activities of the\nUnited Nations be well structured and have a real\nimpact on our populations, in particular women,\nchildren and adolescents. It is essential that these\nactivities create an environment of national dialogue in\neach of our countries with a view to harmonizing views\non development and creating consensus on the means\nfor achieving growth, in order to give true meaning to\nsocial and productive investments and to meet the\nqualitative demands of civil society.\nNational consensus must necessarily be the basis\nfor global consensus, and today more than ever it must\nbe the basis for consensus among integrated groups\nthat wish to negotiate with each other. However, a\nreorganized and renewed United Nations, in the\nultimate analysis, must be the guarantor of the\nwell-being of each of our citizens. The United Nations\nexists so that all of our citizens can benefit from new\ntrends in trade, development and technology in order to\nachieve growth as individuals and as families and to\nimprove their quality of life and feel that they live in a\nbetter world where their sons and daughters will be\nable to continue to grow, in peace.\nTurning to another subject, we are concerned\nabout the delay in the adoption of a decision about the\nfuture composition of the Security Council, because we\nfeel that its enlargement cannot be postponed. Its\ncomposition must become more equitable and\nrepresentative and allow for a better political balance.\nThis gradual process of democratization must begin\nwith an increase in both categories of members,\npermanent and non-permanent, and it should also\ninclude both developed and developing countries.\nSpecial attention should be given to the fact that the\ndeveloping countries are now under-represented in that\nvery important body. Paraguay also believes that this\nreform should include the gradual elimination of the\nveto rights of the permanent members.\nWe welcome the Brahimi report, which\nestablishes a valid framework for the reform and\nstrengthening of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. Paraguay has always supported such\noperations as a fundamental mechanism contributing to\nworld peace and security.\nI should also like to refer to the regular budget of\nthe Organization, in connection with the aspirations of\nsome developed countries to reduce their contributions\nto a lower percentage. We believe that this should not\nmean that the assessed contributions of developing\ncountries would increase to unprecedented percentages,\neven though the figures involved may seem to others\nmodest or insignificant. It is paradoxical that some\ndeveloped countries would have their contributions\nreduced precisely when they are enjoying excellent\neconomic growth, while other countries that are\nexperiencing difficulties would see an increase in their\ncontributions.\nIt is in this context that we must seriously study\nthe scale of assessments so that when we adopt it this\nyear we will achieve a fair and equitable distribution of\nthe financial burden of this Organization. We hope that\ntogether we will find balanced solutions and equitable\nformulas and timetables for redistributing the\nbudgetary burden so that we can promote and\nreactivate the participation of large and small States in\nour Organization.\nInternational relations have acquired a new\ndimension as a result of the revolution in computer\n24\n\ntechnology, telecommunications and communications\nin general. The effect of this is what we call\nglobalization, which has both positive and negative\nconsequences. On the one hand it has produced a\nchange in the consciousness of human beings, who for\nthe first time feel they are part of a whole \u2014 that is, of\nhumanity in its entirety. On the other hand, it has\nincreased the divide between the poorest countries and\nthe more advanced countries owing to the advantages\naccruing to those that are better prepared for the\ndismantling of national barriers. In these conditions,\nsolidarity takes on a new urgency. It is an act of justice\nfor those peoples who see all their potential progress\nsubordinated to this process.\nIn this regard, we fully agree with recent\nstatements made by the representative of the Holy See\nduring the special session of the General Assembly on\nsocial development, to the effect that the benefits of\ngreat scientific advances must be shared by all peoples\nand should not be enjoyed exclusively by the few.\nOtherwise we will merely be perpetuating differences\nand widening the gap between rich and poor countries.\nWe know that decades of development assistance\nunder past conditions have not succeeded very well in\neradicating poverty and cultural backwardness in vast\nregions of the world. Nevertheless, this should not\nbecome a pretext for reducing the amount of\ndevelopment assistance, especially multilateral\nassistance, nor should we see any increase in\nconditionality. We believe fully in the multilateral\napproach, and we should totally reject conditionality\nwhen determining how to provide development\nassistance. Nor do we wish to justify the lack of good\ngovernance in many nations, which has meant in some\ncases that efforts were wasted to a great extent and\nonly fuelled corruption and caused the loss of age-old,\nnoble traditional practices.\nIn the recent elections for the vice-presidency of\nthe Republic, my country demonstrated once again the\npreference of our region for representative democracy.\nIn the elections, which all observers considered\nexemplary because of the discipline, civic spirit and\nparticipation shown by the citizens, we saw the\nelection of the opposition candidate, of the radical\nliberal party, Mr. Julio C\u00e9sar Franco. The fact that two\nparties, until now adversaries, can share power is far\nfrom negative. Rather, it constitutes an opportunity to\nestablish lasting political stability through the\nestablishment of a Government of national unity that\ncan efficiently foster the institutional and economic\nreforms needed in our country in order to achieve\nsustained progress.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude \u2014 to the international community, to our\nfriends in the Southern Common Market\n(MERCOSUR), the Rio Group, the European Union\nand the Organization of American States, and to the\nUnited States of America, Japan, the Republic of China\nand other countries around the world \u2014 for their\nconstant support for our process of democratization. I\nwould like to say to all of them that thanks to their\nefforts Paraguay is continuing along the road to\ndemocratic growth.\nWe are certain that the spread of democracy and\nthe increasing exercise of its freedoms by peoples will\nbring greater effectiveness to our State institutions in\nthe short term. This, together with the increasing role\nof the private sector, can create fertile ground for\ninvestment and the transformation of productive\nactivities in a large part of the world, leading to a\nreduction in unemployment and poverty.\nInternational cooperation, for its part, must\nestablish clear priorities and offer what each of us\nneeds. It cannot be simply humanitarian aid, although\nhumanitarian aid is fully justified in emergency\nsituations. Instead, international cooperation should be\naimed at the integral, sustainable development of\npeoples. These are two words that are used and\nmisused \u2014 \u201cintegral\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d. When we say\n\u201cintegral\u201d, we understand it to mean that aid must try\nto come to grips with the entire set of development\nproblems of each country and of each individual, in\norder to guarantee respect for human rights \u2014 not only\npolitical rights but also economic and social rights; and\nmerely partial solutions should not be offered.\nWhen we say \u201csustainable\u201d we mean that\nassistance must not become an addiction for the\nbeneficiaries. It should empower them to continue\nalong the road to progress relying on their own efforts\nand should guarantee growth for future generations.\nCombating poverty means building peace. The\nsecurity of the world must be based on the elimination\nof the underlying causes of violence, two of the\nprincipal causes being ignorance and poverty. This\ndoes not exempt us, however, from taking effective\nmeasures to limit the use of the instruments of\nviolence, from their most deadly form, such as\n25\n\nweapons of mass destruction, to the more conventional,\nincluding small arms. In the latter case, my country\nsupports the initiative to establish an international legal\ninstrument with specific measures to check the illegal\ntrade in such weapons.\nThe preservation of our natural environment is a\ngreat source of concern and a subject for reflection.\nParaguay, like many other developing countries, gives\nextremely high priority in its national policies to\npreserving the integrity and diversity of our natural\nheritage, handed on by our ancestors. This is not only\nbecause on it depends our current and future wealth,\nbut also because we are fully aware of our grave\nresponsibility to all humanity, since we are the\nguardians of resources needed for its very survival.\nParaguay reaffirms its resolve to continue\nrespecting and implementing the principles established\nin Agenda 21. In this regard, we attach high priority to\nthe participation of the States parties in the legal\nframework developed during the implementation phase\nof the Agenda. With great pride I report that Paraguay\nis a fully fledged party to the most important\ninternational agreements on the environment.\nIn this area, finally, it is important to mention the\nneed to come to grips with the grave problem of the\nunsustainable use of water resources. It is necessary to\nintensify scientific cooperation and research in order to\nreduce the effects of environmental disasters, both\nnatural and man-made.\nWe believe that an equitable and fair trade system\nis vital for our development. In this regard, we reject\nany intent to perpetuate protectionist measures in the\ndeveloped countries, particularly subsidies for\nagricultural production and exports, as well as the use\nof technical regulations as trade barriers against\nmanufactured products. We claim our right to free\naccess to the world's markets for those goods in which\nwe are competitive.\nOn this occasion, as we highlight the importance\nof reaffirming our commitment to this Organization, I\nbelieve it is appropriate to stress the essential role that\nthe international legal framework can play in the\nachievement of our common objectives. In this regard,\nthe Government of Paraguay has paid special attention\nto the invitation by the Secretary-General to all\nMember States to take advantage of this opportunity to\nstrengthen our support for the international legal\nframework by signing, ratifying or acceding to treaties\ndeposited with him that bear a special relationship to\nthe spirit and objectives of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nIn this respect, I am very pleased to announce that\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of\nParaguay I have signed the following international\ninstruments: the Optional Protocols to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child \u2014 on the involvement of\nchildren in armed conflict, and on the sale of children,\nchild prostitution and child pornography; the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their\nFamilies; and the International Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I\nshould also note that the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, of which Paraguay was\none of the first signatories, is in the process of\nparliamentary approval.\nI conclude by reaffirming the conviction of my\ncountry's firm belief in the United Nations, which is\nmore necessary than ever in order to meet the great\nchallenges of peace and development, which, despite\nsignificant progress, continue to be an urgent need of a\ngreat part of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am confident that under your\nable guidance, we shall be able to build upon the\nmomentum generated by the Millennium Summit and\nenjoy a successful and result-oriented General\nAssembly session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of\nNamibia, the President of the fifty-fourth session, for\nhis leadership and tireless efforts throughout the past\nyear. His wisdom and dedication to the tasks of our\nAssembly enabled him to serve as an effective bridge\nbetween the last session and the Millennium Summit,\nthus laying a firm foundation for our work this year.\nOn this occasion, may I, on behalf of the people\nand the Government of Thailand, extend a warm\nwelcome to Tuvalu on its admission as the newest\nMember of the United Nations family.\nThe dawn of the new millennium is a time for\nboth justified celebration of and sombre reflection on\nthe achievements and shortcomings of the United\nNations during the past 55 years. As we review the\nUnited Nations track record, I cannot but recall the\nvery first words written in the United Nations Charter:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d. These few\nsimple words convey an idea of overwhelming\nsignificance \u2014 that it is the peoples of our respective\nnations who represent the core raison d'\u00eatre of this\nforemost assembly of humankind. It is the peoples who\nshould be the primary beneficiaries of every resolution\nthat we adopt and every programme that we launch.\nAs we proceed with the first General Assembly\nsession of this millennium, we should ask ourselves the\nquestions, \u201cHave we indeed put the peoples at the\ncentre of all our deliberations and activities? Have we\ndone enough to ensure that ordinary people, both men\nand women, young and old, benefit from all our\ninitiatives and actions, collective as well as\nindividual?\u201d\nWe are encouraged that the Secretary-General, in\nhis report to the Millennium Assembly, has highlighted\nthe \u201cpeoples' concerns\u201d as one of the primary agenda\nitems for the international community to take up. And\nwe are gratified that many countries have highlighted\nissues of direct interest to peoples at the Millennium\nSummit, from reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS,\nmalaria and other diseases to combating the scourge of\ndrugs, from rolling back poverty to closing the\neducational gaps within and between countries. These\nare all important steps in the right direction.\nBut we need to do more. We need to adopt a fresh\nmindset that places the interests and welfare of the\npeoples \u2014 the peoples of our own countries and those\nof other nations \u2014 at the centre of our policies in\nsocio-economic development and in maintaining\ninternational peace and security. We need to keep in\nmind that promoting the interests and welfare of\npeoples requires that we also promote human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. We need to work collectively to\ntranslate commitments made at the Millennium Summit\nand in other forums into concrete results that reach\npeople directly.\nAlthough the recent economic and financial crisis\nhas brought devastating consequences to millions of\npeople across the Asia-Pacific region, it has helped\nrefocus the attention of Governments on the need to\nprotect the most important of any economy's assets,\nnamely, its people. The crisis, by exposing the\ninadequacies of national social safety nets in protecting\nthe welfare of vulnerable peoples, has raised many\ndifficult questions. In essence, how can one pursue\n4\n\nsustainable development and even attempt to attain\neconomic prosperity when the basic needs of people\ncannot be fulfilled and the potentials of people not\nfully developed?\nThe idea of putting people at the centre of\ndevelopment efforts is not new. But its application has\nbeen far from widespread. As various countries slowly\nrecover from the economic and financial crisis in Asia,\nthe value of pursuing people-centred development has\nbecome ever greater. This development paradigm\nconsiders development as a means to promote people's\nwelfare and interests rather than as an end in itself. It\nlooks beyond quantitative indicators of growth and\nfocuses more on how to nurture the capabilities of\npeople in society so that they are empowered and are\nable to make positive contributions to a country's\ndevelopment efforts. And it needs to be forward-\nlooking, taking into account the interests and welfare\nof future, unborn generations.\nAs part and parcel of the efforts to pursue people-\ncentre development, we must put a premium on\ntackling those issues, national and transnational, that\nhave a direct impact on people's welfare. I should\ntherefore like to highlight three issues in particular that\naffect the very essence of the welfare of our peoples:\ndrugs and narcotics-trafficking, HIV/AIDS and poverty\nalleviation through sustainable development.\nOne of the most unfortunate consequences of\nglobalization is the globalization of the drugs and\nnarcotics problem. Illicit trafficking in and production\nof narcotics erode an economy's resources, generate a\nhost of social problems and undermine our human\npotential. These effects are widespread, from the most\nrural and remote of villages to the most modern of\nmetropolises. It is a global social problem that affects\npeople directly, both users and non-users. While all\ntypes of drugs and narcotics are a threat to society, we\nhope that the international community will give as\nmuch attention to the growing threat of\nmethamphethamines as it did to heroin and other drugs\nin the past. The small size and low cost of producing\nmethamphethamines make them readily accessible to\nall sectors of society and therefore difficult to suppress.\nThailand has spared no effort in tackling the drug\nand narcotics problem at the national level, and is at\nthe forefront of regional and international cooperation\nto meet this challenge, with the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). I am\npleased to announce that Thailand and UNDCP will be\nhosting an International Congress, \u201cIn pursuit of a drug\nfree ASEAN 2015: Sharing the vision, leading the\nchange\u201d, in Bangkok from 11 to 13 October this year.\nWe hope to establish an effective coordinating\nmechanism to tackle the drugs and narcotics problem\nalong all fronts and at all levels, and we hope that the\ninternational community will support us in these\nendeavours.\nWe are gratified that the global problem of\nHIV/AIDS, which is affecting an increasing number of\npeople in our societies, was given due attention at the\nMillennium Summit. But international efforts will have\nto be strengthened and sustained if the international\ncommunity is to make a dent in a problem that has\nalready affected more than 36 million people\nworldwide and is reaching epidemic proportions. We\nare honoured that Thailand has been cited as one of the\nsuccess stories in tackling the HIV/AIDS problem in\nthe developing world. Nevertheless, the sustainability\nof successful national efforts requires strong support\nand cooperation at the regional and multilateral levels\nand effective partnerships with non-governmental\norganizations, including the private sector.\nIn this connection, we hope that regional and\ninternational cooperation in preventing and alleviating\nthe HIV/AIDS problem will emphasize the exchange of\nAIDS-related technologies and state-of-the-art\ntechniques for the prevention and alleviation of this\ndisease, as well as the sharing of knowledge on\naffordable HIV/AIDS-related drugs. We call on the\nSecretary-General to enhance his efforts in\ncoordinating international action against HIV/AIDS.\nWe also support the proposal for a special session of\nthe General Assembly in 2001 to address this problem.\nUplifting peoples from abject poverty and\nendowing them with appropriate means to lead\nproductive lives are the best guarantees of long-term\nsocial stability, and provide a secure foundation for\nfuture prosperity and international peace. Poverty\nreduction is thus at the core of people-centred\ndevelopment and the first step in promoting a more just\nand equitable global order. The tenth session of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD X), which Thailand had the honour of\nhosting from 12 to 19 February this year, drew\nparticular attention to the risks of marginalization of\nthe poorest countries in the global economy and of the\n5\n\nmost vulnerable groups within both developing and\ndeveloped countries.\nUNCTAD is endeavouring to build a new\nconsensus on how to have greater equity and\nparticipation by all in the international economy in this\nera of globalization. In line with the \u201cSpirit of\nBangkok\u201d emerging from UNCTAD X, Thailand, as\ncurrent President of UNCTAD, greatly appreciates the\ninitiative by Japan during the Group of Eight (G-8)\nSummit in Okinawa and the G-8 Foreign Ministers'\nMeeting in Miyazaki in July this year to invite\nrepresentatives from developing countries as well as\nregional and international organizations to meet with\nthe G-8 leaders as a means to strengthen North-South\ncooperation. We are also very appreciative of China's\ninitiative to hold a Sino-African dialogue on\ndevelopment cooperation soon. We are convinced that\nthese initiatives are a step in the right direction.\nI was astounded to learn that fewer than 2 per\ncent of the world's population is connected to the\nInternet, despite all the hype, and that a large portion of\nmankind have never heard a dial tone. If such\ndiscrepancies in information (IT) and/or digital divides\nare not reversed soon, the developing world will be left\nfar behind the rest of the world. Thailand believes that\nwe should act in concert to maximize the benefits of IT\nand to ensure that the greatest possible percentage of\nthe world's population is guaranteed IT access.\nTo this end, Thailand fully supports and\nappreciates the G-8 Okinawa Charter on the Global\nInformation Society to bridge the so-called digital\ndivide. We also welcome the contributions of the\nprivate sector, such as those of the Global Digital\nDivide Initiative of the World Economic Forum and the\nGlobal Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce.\nWe hope that more, similar initiatives will be\nforthcoming so that we, especially the developing part\nof the world, can overcome the digital divide.\nDebt problems are also recognized as a serious\nobstacle to the pursuit of economic and social\ndevelopment, and all countries should be assisted in\nmanaging their debt obligations, including through a\ndebt standstill. Thailand therefore also supports the\nconvening of an international intergovernmental event\non financing for development next year at the highest\npossible level and hopes that feasible and effective\nmeasures can be agreed upon to generate greater\ninternational financial assistance to support sustainable\ndevelopment and to address poverty. In this connection,\nwe see great value in securing the active participation\nof the international financial and trade institutions and\nthe private sector, as well as all the NGOs concerned.\nThe most effective way to ensure poverty\nreduction and promote sustainable development is to\nempower peoples with the capacity to help themselves.\nAnd there is no better way to achieve this than through\neducation and training. Thailand thus attaches great\nimportance to human resources development (HRD).\nOur efforts are not confined to the national level but\nextend to a wider, regional scale. We have been at the\nforefront in promoting HRD in the Mekong subregion,\nfor we sincerely believe that the upgrading of human\npotential is the best way to fight poverty and ensure\ncloser regional cooperation and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nInternational peace and security begin at home. If\nwe are able to pursue an all-encompassing notion of\nsecurity that places the security of peoples at the apex\nof our considerations, if we can secure for people\nfreedom from want as well as freedom from fear, then\nthe likelihood of threats to international peace and\nsecurity will be drastically reduced. Human security\nand people-centred development are two sides of the\nsame coin: they each promote the welfare of peoples in\ndifferent ways and reinforce one another at the same\ntime.\nIt is gratifying to note that the concept of human\nsecurity is gaining ground, even though the debates on\nwhat constitutes human security are by no means over.\nThailand believes that human security can only take\nfirm root if the basic needs of peoples are fulfilled and\npeoples are free from social and economic threats to\ntheir well-being. How can we begin to talk about\nhuman security, let alone international peace and\ninternational security, when 1.2 billion people in the\nworld live on less than 1 US dollar a day, about 90\nmillion children are out of school at the primary level\nand about 1.2 million women and children under 18 are\ntrafficked for prostitution each year?\nWe therefore advocate freeing people from want\nby effectively and collectively meeting the challenges\nposed by poverty, illiteracy, infectious disease, famine,\nnatural disaster, social unrest and disintegration. These\nare in fact the very same goals that we need to achieve\nin promoting people-centred development.\n6\n\nThe achievement of human security also requires\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. We cannot support human\nsecurity and effectively pursue people-centred\ndevelopment if we are unable to ensure that people are\nprotected from the worst forms of abuse, suffering and\ndeprivation. We cannot claim to put people at the\ncentre of development efforts if we are unwilling to\ncreate political conditions whereby people are able to\npursue their lives free from threats to their dignity and\npersonal safety. We cannot expect to develop human\npotential to the fullest or make people effective\ncontributors to economic development if they cannot\nhave the intellectual freedom to pursue their hopes and\ndreams for their own future.\nThailand therefore calls upon the international\ncommunity to renew its commitment to promoting and\nprotecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in\norder to ensure that people's interests and welfare are\nindeed at the centre of our policies and programmes. It\nis with this conviction that Thailand commits itself to\nplaying an active and responsible role within the\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights.\nDrawing strength and inspiration from one of the most\ndemocratic constitutions anywhere, we will continue to\ngive our full support to the efforts of the United\nNations aimed at the protection and promotion of basic\nhuman rights, freedoms and dignity.\nIn this connection, Thailand also calls upon the\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to assist\ndisplaced persons wherever they may be. As host to\nover 100,000 displaced persons and over a million\nillegal economic migrants, Thailand attaches great\nimportance to this issue and hopes that it will be\nresolved comprehensively and as soon as possible.\nWhile we seek to promote international peace and\nsecurity from within by building support for the\nadoption of the human security paradigm among\nnations, we should also redouble our efforts\ninternationally. We should engage in prompt and\neffective collective action at the regional and\nmultilateral levels to create conditions of peace and\nstability. At the Millennium Summit, many leaders\nspoke of the need and urgency of Security Council\nreform. In line with the increased membership of and\nmounting challenges to this world Organization,\nThailand, for one, supports the expansion of both the\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council, based on the principle of equitable\ngeographical representation, efficiency and readiness to\nshare responsibilities.\nFurthermore, Thailand fully supports the reform\nof United Nations peace operations to ensure their\neffective conduct and thus the credibility of the United\nNations itself. As I mentioned during the Millennium\nSummit, we strongly support the Brahimi report on\nUnited Nations peace operations, for we believe that its\nrecommendations are right on target and constitute\nachievable and practical steps towards the\nstrengthening of United Nations peace operations\nworldwide. I should also add that peace operations\nshould be prompt and non-selective as well as being\ncomprehensive in nature.\nThailand is therefore honoured to play an\nimportant part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts\nunder the United Nations International Force, East\nTimor (INTERFET) and now under the United Nations\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET),\nthrough the contribution of over 1,500 Thai\npeacekeepers and the role of Lieutenant-General\nBoonsrang Niumpradit, Force Commander of\nUNTAET. At the same time, Thailand has always been\nconscious of the value of regional cooperation in\nfostering peace and stability and strongly supports\nregional efforts aimed at confidence-building and\npromoting preventive diplomacy.\nIn this connection, we are proud of the seventh\nmeeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)\nrecently concluded in Bangkok in July, which saw the\nadmission of the People's Democratic Republic of\nKorea (DPRK) into our forum. We warmly welcome\nthe Democratic Republic of Korea's participation in the\nARF, the only regional forum that brings together all\nthe key countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We are\nconfident that this will strengthen the momentum for\nregional peace and security in the Asia and Pacific\nregion.\nIt is our fervent hope that at this first General\nAssembly of the twenty-first century, 55 years after the\nUnited Nations held its first meeting, we, the\nGovernment representatives of Member States, can\nmove forward in fulfilling our promise made in the\nUnited Nations Charter to serve the interests of \u201cWe\nthe peoples of the United Nations\u201d. More than ever\nbefore, we need to remind ourselves that it is the\npeoples of our nations who are at the core of all our\nefforts, whether these be to pursue social and economic\n7\n\ndevelopment, maintain international peace and security\nor promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nFor if we do not fulfil our task in advancing the cause\nof protecting the welfare of our peoples, who will? If\nwe cannot adequately promote and protect the interests\nof the peoples of the United Nations, then it is time to\nconsider other ways in which the peoples of the United\nNations \u2014 indeed, our own peoples \u2014 can interact\ndirectly with the United Nations.\nNow is the time. Let us rededicate ourselves to\nthe task that we set out to accomplish 55 years ago. Let\nus strive to become what we were always meant to\nbe \u2014 a truly representative body of \u201cWe the Peoples of\nthe United Nations\u201d, acting in defence of their welfare\nand the advancement of their interests above all else.\nLet us resolve and pledge to each other that we shall be\neven more united, better prepared and more resilient to\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I join my colleagues in\ncongratulating the President on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly for its fifty-fifth\nsession and you, Madam Vice-President, on your\nelection to your position.\nI am also delighted to welcome Tuvalu as the\n189th Member of the United Nations. Australia has\nlong-standing and very friendly relations with Tuvalu,\nand we have worked closely together as members of\nthe South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. We\nare pleased that Tuvalu is now a Member of the United\nNations, and look forward to new opportunities to work\ntogether for the United Nations common goals of peace\nand development.\nWe meet today just after the largest number of\nheads of State and Government in history gathered for\nthe Millennium Summit. While the Summit touched on\nthe multitude of problems facing the world at the start\nof a new century, a theme common to many speeches\nwas the need for the United Nations to reform so as to\nmeet the challenges of the era: the challenges of\nsecuring peace, of fighting poverty and of empowering\nand liberating oppressed peoples.\nI want to respond to those calls for reform in my\nremarks to the Assembly today.\nWithout continuing commitment to reform, the\nUnited Nations \u2014 like any organization \u2014 cannot\nexpect to keep up with rapid change in the\ncontemporary international environment. In the\nabsence of change and adaptation, the Organization\nwill wither as the nations of the world bypass it in\nfavour of institutions and mechanisms that are more\nrelevant to their needs.\nAustralians believe that the most fundamental\ntask of the Organization \u2014 and the very reason for its\ncreation at the end of the Second World War \u2014 is the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In\nrecent years we have seen the United Nations perform\nat both ends of the spectrum of relevance and\neffectiveness: at a low point in addressing problems in\nKosovo and Rwanda, and at a high point in the\nresolution of the conflict in East Timor.\nI am a strong advocate of an active role for the\nUnited Nations in the restoration and preservation of\ninternational peace and security, especially in situations\nwhere there may be imminent danger of humanitarian\ncatastrophe. Appropriate action by the United Nations\nin these circumstances does more than perhaps\nanything else to demonstrate the continuing relevance\nof the Organization to an often sceptical international\npublic.\nToday I want to focus attention on four aspects of\nreform within the United Nations system: reform of the\nSecurity Council; electoral group reconfiguration;\nreform of peacekeeping; and reform of the human\nrights treaty committee system. It is our view that\nprogress in each of these areas must be achieved to\nenable the United Nations to deliver results and ensure\nits relevance and effectiveness.\nReform and expansion of the Security Council is\ndriven by two fundamental, interrelated imperatives:\nthe need to restore the representative nature of the\nCouncil by reconfiguring its composition to reflect the\nsize and diversity of contemporary United Nations\nmembership, and the need to enhance the Council's\ncredibility, authority and legitimacy.\nThe Australian Government's view has long been\nthat expansion in both categories of membership is\n26\n\nneeded to restore balance and equity to the composition\nof the Council. New permanent seats should be\nassumed by the under-represented developing regions\nof the world. New permanent seats should also be\nallocated to the major industrialized Powers best able\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Equally importantly, other Members of\nthe United Nations should be given the opportunity to\ncontribute directly to the work of the Council through\nperiodic participation as elected members. Expansion\nof the non-permanent membership would enhance the\nrepresentative nature of the Council, enabling it to act\ngenuinely on behalf of the whole membership.\nAustralia has long voiced concerns about the veto\nand continues to argue that there must be limitations on\nits use. Of course, all permanent members of the\nCouncil, old and new, must remain accountable for\ntheir performance, and to this end any new\narrangements for the Council should be reviewed after\n10 or 15 years.\nRegrettably, discussion on Security Council\nreform has failed to reach agreement on a package of\nreforms in the six years since the Open-ended Working\nGroup was established. The impasse is disappointing,\nand I hope that this session will give new impetus to\nthe reform effort. It is clear from statements at the\nMillennium Summit, and during this debate, that there\nis strong support for reform. Renewed commitment and\nflexibility are needed from all sides.\nIn the recent debate about United Nations reform,\none key element has largely been missing. I refer to the\nUnited Nations electoral groups. The electoral groups\nwere established to ensure that there was fair and\nequitable representation on United Nations bodies, so\nthat all Members who wanted to make a contribution to\nUnited Nations decision-making would have an\nopportunity to do so. Now that three decades have\npassed since the formalization of the present groups, it\nis time that we focused on their relevance to present\nand future geopolitical realities.\nThe current group system reflects the geopolitics\nof the 1960s. Since that time, more than 60 nations\nhave joined the United Nations, leading to significant\ndisparities between the size of groupings and an\ninadequate level of representation for some subregions.\nIn addition, the original rationale for the configuration\nof the electoral groups has eroded, creating dissonance\nin the way many Member States organize themselves\npolitically and electorally.\nThe previous realignment of groups in 1963 was a\nlong and difficult process, impelled by significant\nchanges to the United Nations system after the entry of\nmany newly independent States from Africa and Asia. I\nrecognize that group reconfiguration is no easy matter,\nand accept that change now will be similarly complex.\nFor that very reason, we should delay no longer in\ncommencing a serious debate of these issues. While\nthere are many possible configurations for revised\nelectoral groupings, and many sensitivities around\naltering the status quo, the dramatic global changes\nsince the current system came into force have created\nhistorical anomalies that cry out to be redressed.\nAustralia looks forward to working with others to\nachieve that goal.\nAs part of the Australian Government's\ncommitment to a strong and relevant United Nations,\nwe recently completed a review of the United Nations\nhuman rights committee system, with the objective of\nimproving its effectiveness. The review proceeded\nfrom our Government's commitment to the\ninternational promotion and protection of human rights,\nand a firm belief that the United Nations has a central\nrole to play.\nAustralia has a proud human rights record, and\nwe take our international rights and obligations\nseriously. We are party to both human rights Covenants\nand to the four conventions. Within Australia, which\nhas a strong civil society, human rights are protected by\na range of key civil and political mechanisms,\nincluding a strong democratic tradition, our\nConstitution, an independent judiciary, a free press and\nwide-ranging anti-discrimination legislation.\nInternationally, Australia is a strong proponent of the\nuniversal application of human rights standards and is\ncommitted to continued support for international\nhuman rights protection.\nWe are concerned that the committees established\nto monitor international compliance with human rights\ntreaties are beginning to lose credibility and\neffectiveness because of the way they operate. It is also\nimportant that the international protection system work\nefficiently and effectively so that democratic countries,\nsuch as Australia, which have a proud record of\nextending generous humanitarian assistance can\ncontinue to have the confidence and support of their\n27\n\nown domestic constituencies for such humanitarian\nprotection.\nAustralia's review found that the committees\nneed to adopt a more consistent approach to their role\nand understand the pitfalls of simply accepting without\nanalysis the submissions put before them by non-\ngovernmental organizations. It is important that\nadequate recognition be given to the role and views of\nGovernments which are democratically elected and\nwhich take their treaty commitments and reporting\nobligations seriously. The committees also need to be\nmore balanced and strategic about targeting key human\nrights offenders and avoid unfairly focusing their\ncriticism on countries with good human rights records.\nFor some years now Australia, together with a\nnumber of other countries, including Canada, New\nZealand and Norway, has been advocating reform of\nthe treaty committees. Most recently, the Australian\nMission to the United Nations in Geneva hosted a\nmeeting of about 20 countries to discuss treaty\ncommittee reform. The United Nations itself has also\nrecognized the need for reform of the treaty committee\nsystem, and Australia has been fully supportive of\nthese international reform efforts.\nAustralia now intends to broaden such efforts by\nspearheading a high-level diplomatic initiative to\ngarner broad support for reforms to improve the\nfunctioning of the committees and professionalize their\noperations. Reforms could include the provision of\nadequate resources to the human rights treaty\ncommittees, improvements in their working methods,\nstandardized rules of procedure when considering\nStates' reports and better consultation between the\ncommittees themselves to coordinate reporting\ntimetables and to facilitate cooperative work on reform\nissues.\nBut Australia does not have a monopoly on good\nideas, and we want to work closely with United\nNations officials and with like-minded countries to\nmake the treaty committee system work more\neffectively for the good of all Member States and for\nthe protection of human rights.\nWe will therefore be talking widely with others to\ndevelop concrete proposals for reform. We will raise\nthese issues in the General Assembly, at the\nCommission on Human Rights and in other appropriate\nmeetings. We also think that the regular meetings of\nStates parties to the six human rights treaties should\ndiscuss reform issues and provide guidance to the\nrespective committees on their working methods.\nAustralia wants to maximize the effectiveness of\nthe treaty bodies. We will not shy away from our\nresponsibilities, but will press for the reforms that are\nneeded to make the system work well and achieve its\nobjectives. If reform does not occur, the committee\nsystem will increasingly be ignored and made\nredundant. That would be a setback for the cause of\nhuman rights.\nI now turn to the matter of peacekeeping and the\nmaintenance of international security. Australia has a\nlong and honourable tradition as a participant in United\nNations peacekeeping operations, most recently in East\nTimor, and I believe that the strength of our\ncommitment is reflected in the recent appointment by\nthe Secretary-General of Australian Major-General Tim\nFord as his Military Adviser. The experience of the\n1990s has clearly shown that the ability of the United\nNations to meet an expanding and increasingly\ncomplex range of peacekeeping demands is under\nstrain. The decade witnessed some important successes\nin peacekeeping, notably in East Timor, but also some\nsmaller and frankly rather unheralded operations. It\nalso saw some tragic failures, the costs of which were\noften measured in human lives.\nI commend the Secretary-General's commitment\nto blunt scrutiny and review of the United Nations\nperformance, including the reports on Srebrenica and\nRwanda. We particularly commend his initiative in\nconvening the Brahimi Panel on United Nations Peace\nOperations. The Brahimi report (A/55/305) is a\nlandmark document, setting out a blueprint for\nmodernizing the United Nations peacekeeping and\nrelated functions. We must move expeditiously to\nconsider its recommendations.\nLet me highlight briefly five points that, in\nAustralia's view, are among the most significant\nlessons of recent experiences.\nFirst, military intervention must be used only as a\nlast resort. All efforts must be made to find peaceful\nsolutions. In this context, we welcome the Brahimi\nreport's emphasis on preventive action and peace-\nbuilding.\nSecondly, when the United Nations is deployed,\nthere must be a peace to keep. There are real dangers in\nsending troops indefinitely into harm's way in the\n28\n\nabsence of a clear peace plan and reasonable prospects\nof achieving it. Disputing parties must be committed to\npeace and must be held accountable for their actions.\nThirdly, peace operations must have a mandate\nfrom the Security Council that is appropriate to the job\nthey are being asked to do. If the environment is\nhostile, they must be appropriately equipped and able\nto project credible force.\nFourthly, deployment must take place quickly\nonce a decision is taken by the Security Council.\nDelays can lead to the further deterioration of a\nsituation and can cost lives. The Brahimi report offers a\nnumber of useful ideas to speed deployment which\nmerit careful consideration.\nFifthly, United Nations peace operations must\nhave a clear exit strategy. This is linked in particular to\nthe clarity of Council mandates: as the Brahimi report\nrightly stresses, mandates must be clear, credible and\nachievable. It is also linked to the efficacy of\naccompanying peace processes and peace-building\nefforts.\nWe welcome the attention given to these issues in\nthe Brahimi report. We also support the point that the\nUnited Nations must be given the resources it needs to\ncarry out the demands that we make of it. There is no\nquestion that the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations needs to be strengthened and reformed.\nUltimately, it is our responsibility, as Member States,\nto support a stronger and more effective United Nations\npeacekeeping capacity. This includes placing the\nfinancing of peacekeeping on a surer footing and\npaying our assessed contributions in full and on time.\nI cannot conclude without referring to the\nquestion of East Timor. When I addressed this\nAssembly one year ago East Timor was in the throes of\nthe most appalling violence at the hands of a brutal and\nlawless militia. Since then important progress has been\nmade in restoring security and building the foundations\nof an independent East Timor. Australia pays tribute to\nthe men and women of the International Force in East\nTimor and of the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor for their commitment\nand, in too many cases, their sacrifice.\nEast Timor faces a long and difficult path to\npeace and prosperity. Australia is playing a major role\nin the territory's reconstruction through the United\nNations and other organizations, as well as bilaterally.\nWe are committed for the long term to helping the East\nTimorese build their emerging nation not only for the\nbenefit of the East Timorese, but in the interests of\nstability and security in our region.\nRegrettably, the pro-integration militia continue\nto pose a significant threat to security and stability.\nIntimidation and violence against Timorese refugees\nand humanitarian aid personnel in the camps on the\nEast-West Timor border must be halted. The killing of\nworkers of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) earlier this\nmonth deserves the world's strongest condemnation.\nAustralia reiterates its call on Indonesia to fulfil its\nresponsibility to provide effective security in West\nTimor, including by bringing to an end militia activity,\nbringing to justice those responsible for crimes,\ncreating the necessary conditions for the return of\nUNHCR and resolving the refugee situation. We urge\nthe Indonesian authorities to take all possible steps in\nthis direction, including cooperating with the proposed\nSecurity Council mission.\nIf the United Nations is to remain relevant and\ncredible, it must work on its strengths and maintain a\nstrong commitment to a continuing programme of\nreform and renewal. The challenges that face the\nOrganization are formidable, but not insurmountable.\nThe need for change is clear and urgent, but I believe\nthat it is not beyond the ingenuity and good will of our\ngeneration to emulate our predecessors in grasping the\nreform nettle.\nAt the Millennium Summit the world's leaders\nhighlighted the need for the United Nations to meet the\nchallenges of the new century.

        "file_text": "\u201cWe, the\npeoples\u201d is a powerful rendition of world affairs and a\ndaunting portrait of life for future generations. It took\nintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex\ncase in such a concise and forceful way. We are\ngrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for\nproducing it.\n\u201cWe, the peoples\u201d are of course the opening\nwords of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point\nof departure. Other speakers have done so before me\nand have argued in favour of a more robust structure\nfor keeping the peace in the world community. They\nare right. The United Nations role in the area of\npreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as\nits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown\nhow, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping\nfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. The\nBrahimi recommendations deserve to be\nimplemented \u2014 the sooner the better. At present, the\nNetherlands Government and parliament are debating\nhow to improve our national contribution to\npeacekeeping.\n15\n\n\u201cWe, the Peoples\u201d can lead to reflections on a\ntotally different side of the United Nations reality as\nwell. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in\nfavour of closer ties between the United Nations and\nthe private sector.\nIn 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter\nhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of\nlife as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and\nsecurity to social justice, from economic cooperation to\nhuman rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly\nmentions any other actors besides States. Non-\ngovernmental organizations appear in the Charter only\nonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. In\nother words, the Charter conforms to a model of\ngovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state\nsystem going back to the mid-1600s.\nIn order to strategize for the future, we need to\nask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world\ntoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; and\nhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?\nThe United Nations is made up of Member States.\nThat is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians\nof foreign relations for a long time to come. But their\nroles have changed significantly with time. States can\nno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of\ninternational relations. Internationalization has altered\nthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous\nentities as before, pursuing self-defined national\ninterests. Their actions are now much more shaped by\neconomic pressures, information flows, and population\nmovements. For States, too, globalization is here to\nstay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and\ninternational scenes. Civil society is one. The private\nsector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of\nnon-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide\nspectrum, beyond any expectation of the United\nNations founding fathers. Many non-governmental\norganizations operate across national boundaries. At\nthe present time, the United Nations system could\nnever hope to operate properly without the assistance\nof non-governmental organizations, not to mention\nnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental\norganizations have acquired access to the United\nNations at different levels, and participate in many of\nits discussions.\nAlthough a potent actor on the domestic and\ninternational levels, the private sector has been\nvirtually ignored by traditional United Nations\ndiplomacy. The business community, and notably\ntransnational corporations, were viewed by many as the\ncompetitor, if not as the enemy of international public\ninterest. Documents critical of multinationals were\nbeing issued by the United Nations and the specialized\nagencies until recently. Confrontation rather than\ndialogue. I am not contending that there were no\ngrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However,\nnowadays we see a growing awareness in the business\ncommunity of the necessity of responsible corporate\npolicies and of a role for private enterprise in the\npursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing\nimmediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the\npharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with\ninternational organizations, Governments and other\nactors.\nWe need to build on that. Indeed, the time has\ncome to expand the concept of a partnership with the\nprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the\nworld is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the\nprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power in\nthe international arena.\nAbout the odds: take a sustainable future, where\nelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not\neven the most powerful Government can put a stop to\nglobal warming \u2014 nor all the Member States of the\nUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needs\nto be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society\nand the scientific community. For equitable working\nconditions, and other forms of social justice, States\nneed to involve the private sector. The same is true for\nfighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting\nwater or AIDS.\nWe have truly entered an era that is very different\nfrom the one in which the United Nations was born \u2014\nan era in which the course of humanity and the quality\nof life on earth have more and more become a shared\nresponsibility; an era where Governments, the private\nsector and civil society are drawn ever more closely\ntogether. They all have a stake in global governance.\nThe so-called global public goods are a matter for all of\nthem together.\nThe private sector has a stake in the future of the\nplanet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no\nplanet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own\ninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight\nin international relations and the influence they have at\n16\n\nthe domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want\na livable world for their grandchildren. The private\nsector must be called upon to enter into a responsible\ncorporate partnership in sync with other actors at the\ninternational plane. True, the role of each actor needs\nto be different. Their motivation can remain different,\ntoo \u2014 as does the legal basis on which they act. But\ntheir determination needs to be the same: the\ndetermination to secure the longevity of life as we\nknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet an\nequitable share of its bounty.\nDifferent roles, shared responsibility. That\nconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.\nThe United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a\ngalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the\ncoming century if it cannot show that its debates and\nits action platforms reflect the real world outside the\nconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations\nas \u201cunique in world affairs\u201d \u2014 as the Millennium\nreport puts it \u2014 it must be able to show that all players\nare on the stage.\nThe Secretary-General's Global Compact could\nnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is the\nmere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising\nstart. The Global Compact deserves the active support\nof the international community, and it deserves to be\njoined by other multinationals. I do understand the\ntrepidations of some non-governmental organizations\nwho fear that multinational corporations will drape\nthemselves in the United Nations flag and become\nuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too,\nthe apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who\nhave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State\nand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the\nGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.\nAnd I will go even further. We have given civil\nsociety structural access to the United Nations system.\nBy contrast, the access we are giving to the private\nsector, with the notable exception of the International\nLabour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural.\nIn the future, we must create appropriate channels of\ncommunication with the private sector, inside this\nOrganization, where they, as well as Governments and\ncivil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions\nof our time \u2014 a forum where, at the very least, they\ncan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of\nmistrust that have divided them for so long.\nThat is the first reason why the United Nations\nneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.\nThe second is the power of the private sector. Many\ncompanies have turnovers larger than the national\nbudgets of some Member States, and the same is true\nfor the personal fortunes of some chief executive\nofficers. The relationship between States and the\nprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. States\nwere once thought of as bulwarks against harmful\neconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight was\nviewed as a trump card in the power play among\nnations. Today, States are increasingly serving as\ninstruments for adjusting domestic policy to the\nrealities of the present-day world economy. They have\nbecome intermediaries between the world economy,\nwith its own structure of power, and domestic societies.\nThis brings up the question of where world affairs\nare being conducted and how they have caused a shift\nin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has\nshifted the focus of attention to forums other than the\nUnited Nations here in New York, notably to the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\nWorld Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the\nEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins of\nthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decided\nelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.\nThat focus has brought on a different cast of players\nthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign\nMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only with\ndevelopment ministers, but also with finance and trade\nministers, as well as with central bankers. International\naffairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about\neconomics.\nForging a relationship with the private sector is\ntherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to\npreserve its relevance over the long haul. The\nmultilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties\nwith other centres of power and with the business\ncommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously\npursuing closer relations with all these various forums,\nand we encourage him to do more of the same.\nResponsible corporate partnership is also about\nprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not\nonly to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure\nfreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages,\nglobalization is leaving too many victims by the\nwayside. The gap between the rich and the poor\ncontinues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in\nwar and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields\n17\n\na great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will\nbuy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly\non the quality of life in many developing countries.\nEven though the odds are staggering, the United\nNations system can make a difference in reducing\npoverty, gender inequality and child and maternal\nmortality. But it can make a difference only from a\nposition of strength and from a platform shared by\nother actors at the international level: from a position\nof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has\ndeclared poverty eradication the United Nations\nnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fighting\npoverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has\nbeen; it has also become an economic one. That is\nanother reason for the United Nations to become more\ninclusive of the private sector.\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), \u201cWe\nthe peoples\u201d, duly poses the question of how to take\nthe United Nations forward. Whatever the way\nforward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we\nhave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we\nhave kept the United Nations on a very short leash,\nhardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of\nthe same is not enough. In other words, the United\nNations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples,\npursue our business as usual. The future will pass us\nby.\nThe alternative is an avenue that is much more\nambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations\nsystem as a vehicle for the development of a new\nvision of world politics, a vision for the \u201cpost-\nWestphalian\u201d era. In such a vision, present trends\nwould be given legitimacy and a conceptual\nframework. In such a vision, the principle of non-\nintervention yields to the defence of human rights;\nsovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for\ncivil society and the private sector; and economics are\nalso held responsible for social and development goals.\nSuch is the road less travelled, but the only one that\ncan make all the difference."

        "file_text": "Before\ndiscussing some of the concerns of the African\ncontinent and our views on some of the problems\nfacing the United Nations, I should like at the outset to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on having been chosen\nto guide the work of our world body at this important\nsession. The high office to which you have risen in\nyour country, Finland, and the major role that Finland\nplays in the world constitute a guarantee that the\nGeneral Assembly is truly in good hands.\nI wish also to pay tribute to our brother the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose ability and\ndedication we highly appreciate.\nThe General Assembly session that took place 40\nyears ago was seen as the session of Africa. It was at\nthat session that many newly independent African\ncountries participated in the work of United Nations\nbodies for the first time as States Members of the\nOrganization.\nYet despite the progress our continent has made\nover the past 40 years, Africa continues to be\nweakened by the ills of underdevelopment. Today, 33\nof the world's 48 least developed countries are African\ncountries. In other words, three fifths of the States of\nour continent belong to that group of countries that are\nlagging behind in the pursuit of development.\nAs the world's least developed region, Africa\nsuffers from a number of specific ills which hamper its\ngrowth and for which it is important that the\ninternational community help provide a substantial,\neffective remedy. Here I would first mention two\npandemics that ravage the continent and whose human\nand economic consequences are particularly severe and\nalarming: AIDS and malaria. We are most grateful for\nthe initiative taken last January by the Security Council\nto consider the question of AIDS in Africa. More\nrecently, the Thirteenth International AIDS\nConference, held at Durban, South Africa, took stock\nof the situation regarding the advance of the epidemic\nand of possible ways to control it. Members are\nundoubtedly aware that 70 per cent of the 34 million to\n35 million AIDS sufferers worldwide live in sub-\nSaharan Africa, and that in some African countries\nschools have been closed because of the ravages of\nAIDS among the teachers.\nIn a number of countries the skilled workforce\nhas been considerably reduced by AIDS. The number\nof orphans in many countries affected by this epidemic\nis relatively high, thus exacerbating the economic and\nsocial situation of those countries. Therefore, it is\nessential that the international community rapidly and\ngenuinely mobilize in order to help the African\ncontinent control AIDS and eliminate its ravaging\neffects.\nWith respect to malaria, a special summit of\nheads of State and Government of the countries\nconcerned was held on 24-25 April in Abuja, Nigeria,\nwhere a plan of action was adopted to combat the\ndisease. Malaria kills one person somewhere in the\nworld every 30 seconds. The Assembly of Heads of\nState and Government of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), meeting in Lom\u00c8 from 10-12 July this\nyear, appealed to the United Nations to proclaim the\nperiod 2001-2010 the decade to combat malaria. We\nfirmly hope that this Assembly will respond positively\nto our appeal, at this session, taking the necessary\nmeasures to ensure the decade's success.\nThe African debt problem was also of concern to\nthe OAU Heads of State and Government at the Lom\u00c8\nsummit. At a session more than 12 years ago, the\nAfrican countries adopted a common position on the\nAfrican foreign debt crisis. Unfortunately, our\ncontinent continues to be the region of the world where\nthe debt burden is heaviest. As the General Assembly\nnoted last year in resolution 54/202,\n`the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems\nof heavily indebted developing countries'\n5\n\nare one of the factors that hinder their development and\neconomic growth. This finding should motivate the\ninternational community, especially the developed\ncountries and international financial institutions, to\ntake more courageous measures, such as the outright\ncancellation of the African countries' debt. Such a\ndecision would greatly contribute to the success of the\nefforts of our countries, which have committed\nthemselves to implementing sustained programmes to\neradicate poverty.\nThat is why we strongly support the proposals of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who believes that the\nindustrialized countries should take a number of\nmeasures for the benefit of the African countries and\nother developing regions to ensure the possibility of\ntheir making significant progress in the new world\neconomy.\nThe African continent is grateful to the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) for its\ninvaluable assistance over many years, resulting in the\ncarrying out of numerous projects. However, the\ncontinuous decline in UNDP resources worries us,\nbecause it affects our development prospects.\nAt a more global level, we note that major\ntransnational companies, which play a crucial role in\nthe world economy, are remarkably absent from United\nNations economic forums. As in the International\nLabour Organization (ILO), where representatives of\nGovernments, employers and employees work together,\nit is desirable that in the Economic and Social Council\nrepresentatives of Governments should sit side by side\nwith those of multinational companies. That would\nenhance the effectiveness and impact of this important\nUnited Nations body. The international community, for\nits part, should prove, by decisive action, that it truly\nwishes to put an end to the suffering of the poorest\npeoples, the largest proportion of whom, unfortunately,\nare in Africa.\nI take this opportunity to thank President Bill\nClinton for having the United States Congress approve\na law making possible the establishment of a closer\npartnership between the United States of America and\nthe African States.\nI also welcome the convening in Cairo in April\nthis year of the first Africa-Europe summit. We place a\ngreat deal of hope in such meetings, which can only\nstrengthen the existing cooperation between the\nEuropean Union and the African countries.\nIt is well known that our continent is not afflicted\nsolely by the economic underdevelopment that puts it\nin last place in terms of the quality of life. It is also a\nregion of the world where numerous lethal conflicts\ncontinue to sow death and desolation. Consequently,\nAfrica accounts for the largest number of refugees and\ninternally displaced persons. We are grateful to the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies,\nparticularly the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, for their assistance in\nhelping our continent to control various conflicts and\nmitigate their disastrous consequences.\nWe must recognize very sadly, however, that, by\ncomparison to other regions of the world that have also\nexperienced bloody conflicts, the attention that our\ncontinent receives from the international community is\nsomewhat meagre. We strongly urge the Security\nCouncil to demonstrate the same concern for us that it\nbestows on other regions of the world that have been\naffected by conflicts, inter alia, Europe and Asia.\nWe subscribe to the relevant recommendations\nmade by the Panel of experts which the Secretary-\nGeneral has mandated to consider all problems related\nto the improved use of peace operations. We are of the\nview that the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions should be clear, credible and achievable.\nThese missions must be adequately financed and\nrapidly deployed where they are expected. They must\nbe capable of fulfilling their mandates successfully and\nable to defend themselves and control all those who\nwould seek to hinder their action on the ground.\nIn the area of peacekeeping in Africa, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has endowed\nitself over the years with valuable instruments for\nmanaging conflicts, such as the Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, the Conflict Management Centre\nand the Early Warning System. More than five years\nafter the creation of these mechanisms, we believe that\nthey should be complemented by the establishment of\nan operational and effective African peacekeeping\nforce. If such a force were created, it would discourage\nall subversive actions that underpin conflicts.\nThat is why I have proposed, with a view to\nstrengthening that force, the establishment of an\nAfrican institute for peace and conflict prevention, with\nthe assistance of the United Nations and the OAU. This\ninstitution would train African cadres in the art of\n6\n\nnegotiation, conflict management and the culture of\npeace.\nThe persistence of conflicts in Africa seriously\naffects the continent's opportunities for development\nand hampers its efforts to achieve unity. It was with a\nview to remedying this situation that the heads of State\nand Government of the OAU decided in Syrte, Libya,\non 9 September 1999, to transform the OAU into a new\norganization to be known as the African Union. Its\nCharter was unanimously adopted at the 36th Assembly\nof Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at\nLom\u00c8 last July. We are convinced that, with the birth of\nthe African Union, the continent will hasten its process\nof economic and political integration and strengthen\nthe peace and solidarity that are indispensable to\ndevelopment.\nThe General Assembly was right to convene the\nMillennium Summit that was held here last week from\n6 to 8 September. That historic conference was held to\nconsider the role of the United Nations in the world at\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century. In my message to\nthe Millennium Summit, I stressed two basic problems.\nOne related to the activities of the United Nations in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe other concerned the stakes of development,\nparticularly in relation to Africa.\nWhen the Organization was established 55 years\nago, two thirds of its current Members did not exist as\nsovereign States and their peoples still lived under the\ncolonial yoke. The planet had a scant 2.5 billion\ninhabitants, as compared to 6 billion today. Despite the\nexpansion of the Security Council over the years, its\ncomposition has in truth remained virtually unchanged\nsince the establishment of the United Nations. To use\nthe words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, this\ncomposition\n`does not fully represent either the character or\nthe needs of our globalized world'. (A/52/2000,\npara. 44)\nWe therefore think that it is high time to\nreconsider the composition of the Security Council,\nwith a view to admitting new permanent members\nselected from the new economic Powers that have\nemerged since the Second World War, to which would\nbe added regional Powers from the developing\ncountries.\nThese are a few ideas that I wanted to contribute\nto this general debate.\nDespite its imperfections and shortcomings, I\nthink that the United Nations is irreplaceable, but we\nmust do everything possible to enhance its impact and\ninfluence.\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore that the\nAfrican continent, despite its difficulties, continues to\nbe a region of great potential wealth; however, its\nresources have inadequately been inventoried,\ndeveloped and exploited.\nWe must not despair and think that Africa will not\novercome these difficulties. We are resolved to do\neverything within our power to improve the political,\neconomic and social situation of our continent.\nWe simply need the benevolent assistance of all\nthose who are today richer and are prepared to join us\nto bolster our efforts."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like\nto warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved\nelection to the presidency of this historic Millennium\nAssembly. We firmly believe that, under your able\nstewardship, the first session of the General Assembly\nin the new century will be a resounding success. This\nsession provides us with an opportune moment to take\nstock of the track record of the Organization, its\nachievements and the areas where it needs to be\nstrengthened so that it will be equal to the challenges\nof the new century.\nI also wish to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, for the\nleadership he provided us in our preparations for this\nMillennium Assembly and for his tireless efforts and\nthe dedication, skill and intelligent management with\nwhich he led the last session of the General Assembly\nof the twentieth century to a successful conclusion.\nMy delegation is most delighted to see in our\nmidst Tuvalu as a new Member of this world\nOrganization. With the admission of Tuvalu as the\n189th Member of this Organization, our objective of\nuniversal membership is closer to reality. On behalf of\nthe delegation of the Union of Myanmar, I would like\nto extend our warmest congratulations to the delegation\nof Tuvalu.\nAfter the Second World War, under the Charter of\nthe United Nations, we established the present system\nof collective security. Since then, we have witnessed\nsubstantial changes in the geopolitical map of the\nworld, leading to new realities in international\nrelations. There is a strong consensus that our\nOrganization must be reformed and adapted to the new\nrealities in order to enable it to effectively respond to\nthe new challenges. This consensus has resulted in\nvarious measures and proposals to reform the\nOrganization, including a process to make the Security\nCouncil more effective, democratic, transparent and\naccountable.\nWhen this process started in 1993, we had hoped\nthat we would have completed the reform of the\nCouncil by the beginning of the new millennium. After\nseven years of discussion on the reform of the Council,\nhowever, reality has revealed that the issue we took on\nwas so complex that it could not be resolved quickly.\nWhile there has been convergence of ideas on some\nareas, in others we have come to an impasse. This does\nnot mean that we should give up. On the contrary, we\nshould explore new possible avenues to enhance the\nmomentum we have gained. We must make use of this\nhistoric opportunity to give added impetus to reforming\nthe Council so that it meets the needs of our time.\nWe believe that, at this stage of deliberations, we\nshould identify areas of possible agreement and build\non them. For instance, it appears to be generally agreed\nthat the Council should be expanded in both categories\nof permanent and non-permanent membership.\nSimilarly, a majority of countries tends to agree that\nthe new members should come from among the\ndeveloped and developing countries alike. While we\ncontinue our discussion on other aspects of the issue, it\nwould be conducive to the reform process if we could\nestablish general agreement on such possible areas\nwhere our views converge. I trust that the future\ndiscussions among us will give serious thought to these\npossibilities. We must redouble the efforts to reform\nour Organization so that it can truly serve us in our\nendeavour to build a better world.\nAs we enter the new millennium, we find to our\ndismay and alarm that some major international issues\npersist in defying our collective creativity and attempts\nto solve them. We must not let these setbacks cast a\nshadow over the credibility and effectiveness of this\nOrganization. We consider it our primary duty to focus\nour attention on those questions dealing with\ndevelopment as well as those dealing with peace and\nsecurity.\nDespite the efforts of the international\ncommunity, peace throughout the Middle East remains\nelusive. We hope that the important progress made so\nfar will pave the way for achieving a just and lasting\npeace in the region. We would like to see an enduring\npeace in the Middle East, one which would guarantee\nthe restoration of the inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people and the right of Israel to exist within\nsecure and recognized borders.\nThere are many other questions that merit our\nattention. One such question I wish to bring to the\nattention of the Assembly is that of Cyprus. This\nquestion has been on the Assembly's agenda for the\nlast 26 years. We are heartened to note that the United\nNations is now engaged in another effort to solve the\n13\n\nproblem. Myanmar has consistently supported the\nnegotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot\ncommunities under the auspices of the United Nations\nSecretary-General, and we would like to take this\nopportunity to pledge our continued full support for the\ntask.\nLet me touch upon an important question that is\nof serious concern to the international community and\non which we in Myanmar place special emphasis. I am\nreferring to the problem of narcotic drugs. Nationally\nspeaking, this is a problem that we inherited from the\ncolonial administration. The poppy plant, from which\nopium is harvested, is not native to Myanmar. It was\nintroduced into our country by the colonial\nadministration, which relied on licensed opium dens as\na source of revenue. Since then, this evil scourge has\nbedevilled the country. Successive Governments have\nbeen relentless in their efforts to eradicate the problem\nof narcotic drugs.\nThus, the eradication of poppy cultivation\nremains one of the top priorities for Myanmar.\nNotwithstanding the harsh and undue criticism levelled\nagainst Myanmar for a problem with wide international\ndimensions, our sustained efforts to combat the\nproblem of narcotic drugs have resulted in a noticeable\ndrop in opium cultivation and production. This fact is\nacknowledged by the International Narcotics Control\nBoard (INCB). Here, it bears reiteration that narcotic\ndrugs are a global problem, to be solved in a concerted\nmanner and through global efforts. The problem must\nbe tackled in a holistic manner, both from the\nproduction side and the demand reduction side.\nNational efforts must be supported by international\nassistance and cooperation. Myanmar has been trying\nto combat this global problem mainly with its own\nresources. Except for the assistance provided by the\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme\n(UNDCP), no substantial assistance has been provided\nto Myanmar in its current efforts to combat this global\nmenace. This is tantamount to making a travesty of the\nmuch-avowed principle of shared responsibility.\nDespite our efforts, Myanmar has been a target of\nunfair criticism and censure. An objective assessment\nwill identify which countries are making real efforts to\neffectively tackle this global problem and which\ncountries are paying mere lip service. The fact of the\nmatter is that the scourge of narcotic drugs is not the\nsole responsibility of any one country. No country\nacting on its own can successfully overcome this\nmenace. To tackle this global problem, we must join\nhands and cooperate with each other. Myanmar stands\nready to do so.\nThe principles enshrined in the Charter have\nserved the world community well for more than five\ndecades. Sovereignty, sovereign equality, respect for\nterritorial integrity and non-intervention in internal\naffairs are cardinal principles that remain vital for the\npeace and security of all nations. These are\nirreplaceable bedrock principles underpinning the\ncurrent international system. These are the principles\nthat have enabled the international community to\nsuccessfully deter world conflagrations. Therefore, we\nare greatly dismayed by the recent tendency in some\nquarters to cast doubt on the continued soundness of\nthese basic principles.\nThere are some who are bent on compromising\nthese cardinal principles of international relations,\nvoicing support for interference in countries' internal\naffairs on various grounds. This is indeed a dangerous\ntrend, with dangerous implications for the peace and\nstability of our international system. At a time when\nthe powerful increasingly make use of various\ninternational forums to fulfil their hidden political\nagendas, a very valid question must be posed: who\ndetermines the existence of a situation that warrants\ninterference in internal affairs? The justification of\ninterference in internal affairs under certain conditions\nis a concept easily vulnerable to abuse by the powerful\nfor their narrow national interests. Interference, even\nfor such a worthy cause as humanitarian assistance, can\nundermine the principles of neutrality and impartiality,\nthus endangering the entire system of humanitarian\nassistance. A well-intentioned mistake can unravel the\nfabric of the present international system, which has\nstood us in good stead.\nNo nation is entirely free from problems or\ndifficulties. While some are more successful in solving\ntheir problems, others are less successful. There are\nsome situations where the assistance of the\ninternational community is necessary to resolve these\nissues and difficulties; in other situations, national\nmeasures would best suit the situation. In trying to\nresolve these problems, a proper understanding and a\ncorrect perspective on the issue, both historical and\ncurrent, are necessary. A solution obtained without\nsuch understanding and perspective is tantamount to\ntreating the symptoms rather than the disease.\n14\n\nA careful look at countries with ongoing conflicts\ndemonstrates that some issues are not susceptible to an\neasy and quick solution. They are deeply rooted in\nintra-State tensions and mistrust that have been\nlingering for hundreds of years. There are instances\nwhen seemingly successful solutions causing fleeting\neuphoria have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. This is\nprincipally because the root causes were never\nthoroughly understood and addressed.\nFurthermore, appropriate and pragmatic national\nattempts at finding lasting solutions should be\nencouraged and supported. There are many cases where\nthe role of the international community is\nindispensable. There are also many other cases where\nits proper role should be limited to assisting the State\nconcerned in its efforts, complementing those efforts\nonly where necessary.\nThe situation in Myanmar has been the subject of\nunfair scrutiny and political pressure by a number of\npowerful countries for quite some time. Therefore, I\nfind it appropriate to take this opportunity to apprise\nthe Members of the Organization of the situation in my\ncountry. The Government of Myanmar is in the process\nof establishing a democratic society. In this endeavour,\nit has chosen the path that is most suitable to the\ncountry, its people and its historical peculiarities.\nContemporary history has shown that the transition to\ndemocracy from a totally different and centralized\npolitical and economic system is not always smooth. It\nrequires ingenuity, patience and understanding to make\nthe process peaceful.\nHere I wish to underscore that the present\nMyanmar Government is making all-out efforts to\nsolve the most fundamental problem of the country: the\nconsolidation of national unity. Without satisfactorily\nresolving this basic question, the objectives of\ndemocracy, peace, prosperity and stability will not be\nrealized. National unity will not be consolidated if we\ncannot address issues such as the eradication of\npoverty, equitable distribution of national wealth and\nthe maintenance of peace and security.\nThe people of Myanmar share the view that these\nissues must be adequately addressed first and foremost\nin order to achieve the emergence of a developed,\npeaceful and prosperous State.\nIt is at this important and delicate juncture that all\nsorts of superficial and unsubstantiated charges are\nbeing made against us, placing many obstacles along\nour chosen path to democracy. This line of approach\nwill only perpetuate the existing programmes in the\ncountry. It will give rise to unnecessary delays in our\ncurrent democratization process. Here I wish to stress\nthat it was a situation of chaos and anarchy that had\nthreatened the country's survival as a State and that led\nthe Tatmadaw, the armed forces, to assume State\npower. Although the present Government is a military\ngovernment, the country is not governed by martial\nlaw. The entire body of legislation remains in place and\nthe country is governed according to these legal\nprovisions. The country also retains an independent\njudicial system.\nDespite all obstacles placed in our path to\ndevelopment and against all odds, we have made\nconsiderable achievements, both economically and\npolitically. On the political front, because of the\nGovernment's endeavour to build national unity, 17\narmed groups have returned to the legal fold. We have\nbeen able to establish unprecedented peace and\ntranquillity. We have also made considerable strides in\nthe country's economy. The country's gross domestic\nproduct continues to grow year after year. The\neconomy registered 10.9 per cent growth last year. This\ngrowth pattern is expected to continue this year. The\neffective control of inflation also resulted in an\nappreciable increase in the living standard of the\npeople of Myanmar. The people of the country are fully\nconscious of all these remarkable achievements. They\nare fully aware that they themselves are the direct\nbeneficiaries of these positive results. The Government\nis determined to redouble its efforts to bring about\npeace and stability and a better standard of life for the\npeople of Myanmar.\nThe peace and stability that we have today do not\ncome easily. It is only in recent years that peace and\nstability returned to virtually all corners of the country.\nWhat we are doing is laying down a firm foundation\nnecessary to build a modern, prosperous and peaceful\nnation. Far from recognizing the unprecedented\nachievements made by the Government, some Western\ncountries have imposed on us political pressure and\nunilateral sanctions. International financial institutions\nare being used to deny us our rightful loans and\nassistance. These are hampering all our sincere and\nvigorous efforts to address the pressing problems of the\nnation and to uplift the country to a prosperous stage.\nHowever, we will continue on our chosen path of\nbuilding a democratic society best suited to our\n15\n\ntraditions, thus fulfilling the aspirations of our people.\nWe are resolute in our determination to develop the\ncountry in the shortest possible time.\nIn accordance with Myanmar's foreign policy,\nMyanmar makes every effort to forge friendly relations\nwith all countries. In conformity with this time-tested\npolicy, we have successfully established friendly and\nclose relations with all neighbouring countries. It is a\npolicy that we pursue in our relations with fellow\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN), countries of the region and all other\ncountries of the world. I wish to take this opportunity\nto urge those countries that now have negative views\non Myanmar to look at our situation in a more\nobjective manner. We are building a democratic\nsociety, a society in which peace and stability prevails,\na society where our people can enjoy a better life in\nlarger freedom.\nWhat we urgently need in the new century is the\nrealization of a just and an equitable international\norder. We need an international order where right, and\nnot might, prevails. In establishing such an\ninternational order, the United Nations is the only\norganization that can provide the necessary leadership.\nThe envisaged international order must also respect the\nright of every nation to adopt the political, economic\nand social systems that best suit its domestic context. It\nmust be an international order in which the legitimate\ndesire of every nation for justice and equality is\naccepted by powerful States with understanding and\nsympathy. In this, the role of the United Nations, as the\nprincipal intergovernmental institution of universal\nnature, is irreplaceable. Hegemonic tendencies and\npower politics will certainly undermine the basis of\ninternational relations and will thereby jeopardize our\nsystem of collective security.\nIt is my fervent hope that every Member State\nwill play its part and make this Organization equal to\nthe challenges of the new century. At this Millennium\nAssembly let us all resolve to translate the ideals of the\nOrganization into a concrete reality through\ncooperation, goodwill and firm commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of\nmy delegation and the Government and people of the\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, add my vice to those before\nme to offer warm felicitations on your election as\nPresident of this epoch-making fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, the Millennium Assembly. Your\nlong and distinguished career in the service of your\ncountry and on the international scene makes you\neminently suitable for election. My delegation is\nconfident that under your able guidance, our\ndeliberations will be smooth and productive. Indeed,\nwe have seen evidence of that in your insistence on\npunctuality. I want to assure you, Sir, of my\ndelegation's fullest cooperation.\nTo our brother and colleague Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab of Namibia, I convey my delegation's gratitude\nand appreciation for the able manner in which he\nconducted the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI should like to thank Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and his\ncolleagues and staff, whose dedication to duty deserves\nthe highest commendation. I extend our special\ngratitude to Mr. Annan for his insight into the problems\nin my country and the objective manner in which he\nhas reported his findings to the Security Council. The\nUnited Nations Security Council has deployed over\n13,000 peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone, the largest\nnumber in any country at any one time. In\ncollaboration with my Government, it is setting up a\nspecial court to try all those who are guilty of the most\nhorrendous and atrocious crimes against humanity. In\nfurtherance of its interest in bringing stability to the\ncountry, it has planned to send a high-level delegation\nto Sierra Leone to assess the situation on the ground.\nI should also like to extend a warm\ncongratulations to Tuvalu on its admission as the 189th\nMember of this Organization.\n2\n\nFollowing the unwarranted criminal abduction by\nthe Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of hundreds of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping troops of the United\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), a\npeaceful demonstration by the members of civil society\nof Sierra Leone was organized to appeal to Foday\nSankoh, the leader of the RUF, for the unconditional\nrelease of the hostages and to prevail upon him to\ncooperate in order successfully to implement the Lom\u00e9\nPeace Agreement, especially the Disarmament,\nDemobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Programme.\nAs soon as the demonstrators reached his\nresidence, Mr. Sankoh's men opened fire on the\nunarmed and defenceless crowd, gunning down 20 and\nseriously wounding several others, two of whom later\ndied in hospital. Subsequent events have revealed that\nthe RUF had planned a bloody overthrow of the elected\nGovernment on the following day, 9 May 2000. This at\nfirst put the whole Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement in doubt,\nespecially Mr. Sankoh's role as leader of the RUF.\nUnder the Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement, Mr. Sankoh\nwas appointed Chairman of the Strategic Mineral\nResources Commission, with the status of a vice-\npresident; he used this position to open secret\nnegotiations with a number of people for the\nexploitation and sale of Sierra Leone's diamonds,\nwithout reference to any other person.\nThe Government of Sierra Leone had signed the\nLom\u00e9 Peace Agreement in the belief that it would put\nan end to the atrocities being inflicted on defenceless\ncivilians, especially women and children. Among other\nthings, it provided for the demobilization, disarmament\nand reintegration of former combatants into society. It\nprovided for the repatriation and resettlement of\nrefugees and internally displaced people. It also\nprovided for the deployment of United Nations\npeacekeepers (UNAMSIL) in the country. The RUF\nleaders have forfeited their right to benefit from the\nprovisions of Lom\u00e9; however, because of its other\nprovisions, my Government will revive the Agreement,\nparticularly the DDR Programme.\nMy Government has already expressed\ncondolences to the Governments of those who lost their\nlives during the hostage-taking. UNAMSIL is to be\ncongratulated for the professional manner in which it\nfreed the hostages. Another group of bandits, the so-\ncalled \u201cWest Side Boys\u201d, had seized and held captive 1\nSierra Leone soldier and 10 British servicemen who\nwere in Sierra Leone to train a professional army which\nwould be responsible to the democratically elected\nGovernment of the country. That group refused to\nrelease the hostages, despite the long and patient\nnegotiations, and was even beginning to threaten their\nlives.\nMercifully, to everyone's relief, the hostages have\nnow been rescued. Unfortunately, one member of the\nBritish rescue team lost his life, while another was\nseriously wounded. My Government has already\ncongratulated the British Government for the\nprofessionalism of the rescue team. At the same time,\nwe have expressed heartfelt condolences for the loss of\nthe life of a member of the team.\nAnother recent and very welcome resolution of\nthe Security Council is the ban on the sale of illegal\ndiamonds from Sierra Leone, the so-called \u201cBlood\nDiamonds\u201d. As is well known, the proceeds from this\ntrade have been used to fuel the rebel war machine. I\nwould like to thank the Government of the United\nKingdom, the United States of America and Canada for\ntheir perseverance in opposing this horrible activity,\ncalling things by their proper names and pointing\nfingers in the right direction. My country is confident\nthat the new arrangements for the marketing of our\ndiamonds will not only end the illegal trade but will\nalso bring sanity into the system, to the benefit of the\ncountry.\nThanks to the decisive actions of the Security\nCouncil and the Economic Community of West African\nStates under the indefatigable leadership of President\nObasanjo of Nigeria and President Konare of Mali,\nSierra Leoneans now see a real light at the end of what\nhas been a long and tortuous tunnel. The forthcoming\ntrials of those who have committed such horrendous\nand inhuman crimes against their fellow countrymen\nwill be a signal to would-be adventurers that such acts\nwill no longer go unpunished.\nNo words can sufficiently express the thanks and\ngratitude of the people of Sierra Leone to the Security\nCouncil, the international community as a whole and\ntroop-contributing countries. Following the occupation\nand destruction of economic areas, the carting away of\nour resources, the displacement of hundreds of\nthousands of our people and the wanton destruction of\nlife and property, I would like to appeal to all our\nfriends to continue and intensify their humanitarian\n3\n\nassistance and to support programmes for rebuilding\nour country.\nWe have just entered a new millennium, bringing\nwith us many unresolved problems \u2014 problems which\nhave been discussed in this and other international\nforums over the years and which appear to lack any\nsolution. We have only one world, and my delegation\nbelieves that it is worth our love. We should therefore\ndemonstrate that love by adequately addressing\noutstanding issues like general disarmament, nuclear\nnon-proliferation, peaceful settlement of disputes,\nprohibition and control of small arms, prohibition of\nlandmines, poverty alleviation, affordable drugs and\ntreatment of debilitating and killer diseases such as\nmalaria and HIV/AIDS, advancing the Middle East\npeace process in accordance with various Security\nCouncil resolutions, equitable trade negotiations and,\nof course, reform of the Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session. I am confident that your vast\nexperience and unswerving efforts will guarantee the\nachievement of the best results at this session.\nI would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nRepublic of Namibia, for having wisely and\nsuccessfully conducted the deliberations of the fifty-\nfourth session. I would be remiss if I failed to express\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, our thanks\nand appreciation for his efforts to preserve the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter with a view to\nconsolidating the prospects for peace and stability\naround the world.\nA new century has been ushered in. Our peoples\nand countries believe in the United Nations and in its\nability to embrace new visions and concepts. We have\nhigh hopes that a reinvigorated Organization will\npromote a new world order forged, in essence, by the\nnew forces at play. This will be a world order free from\nthe new power play in order to consolidate the\nprospects for international peace and security in\ndifferent parts of the globe and to meet the costs of\ndevelopment, which is the right of each and every\nindividual. This can only be accomplished if we\nsucceed in reactivating the central role of the United\nNations. The primary organs of the Organization,\nnamely, the Security Council and the Economic and\nSocial Council, must be entrusted with containing and\nchecking the dangers that face humanity and that\nthreaten its social and economic peace as well as its\nsecurity.\n2\n\nI am pleased to announce that, towards the end of\nnext year, Lebanon will host the summit of the\nInternational Organization of La Francophonie to be\nheld in the context of the Dialogue among\nCivilizations. Lebanon's experience in coexistence, its\npluralistic nature and its openness to the world are, in\nour view, the best expression of such a dialogue.\nWe all agree that the United Nations is an\nindispensable international institution, notwithstanding\nits inability to settle many disputes since its inception.\nThe United Nations has at times been lax in enforcing\nits own resolutions, and at others it has been influenced\nby the international balance of power, which made it\nblind to the double standards at play. But what is\nindisputable is that the United Nations, with its\nmandates and its multifaceted world activities,\nconstitutes a major human achievement and tradition.\nWe must build upon this achievement by evincing the\nnecessary will to lead the world towards reconciliation\nwhilst maintaining the necessary balance between the\ncollective interests of States, large and small.\nOur actions must be based on the principles of\nsolidarity, equality and justice enshrined in the Charter.\nThis is of particular importance at this crucial juncture\nin our human existence. While vast regions of the\nworld are plagued by poverty, deprivation and disease,\nothers are enjoying a social and economic boom rarely\nmatched in the history of mankind. It is therefore\nimportant to jump start the different United Nations\norgans and specialized agencies, which have already\nimpressed us with daily records of achievement that\nstand as a true measure of our collective spirit of\nsolidarity . This solidarity must be the cornerstone of a\nnew humanitarian world order capable of protecting the\nindividual and of respecting all aspects of his rights.\nIn this context, we highly value the steps taken to\nrestructure some of the development organs of the\nOrganization. Such steps have introduced into their\nwork programmes the concept of cooperation with the\ninstitutions of civil society and with international\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and the donor\ncommunity.\nIn the second half of May this year, Lebanon and\nthe United Nations witnessed a historic event when my\ncountry recovered most of its occupied territories in the\nsouth and in western Bekaa. Thanks to the resistance\nand steadfastness of the Lebanese people and the\nsupport of the international community, Israel had to\nwithdraw from these territories after a ferocious\noccupation that lasted more than 22 years. It left behind\na trail of devastation and destruction of infrastructure,\nprivate property and the environment, as well as a\ncollapse in local production centres. Lebanon has paid\ndearly for its liberation. Thousands fell as martyrs on\nthe road to victory and thousands more were injured or\ndisabled.\nHuman and material losses were not confined to\nthe areas that were immediately under occupation. For\n30 years, the Israeli arm of aggression has stretched far\nto reach all Lebanese territories. Repeated Israeli\nstrikes terrorized our civilian population, destroyed\ncivilian and vital establishments and wreaked havoc on\nour economic and service sectors. The Israeli\nwithdrawal came in the wake of 22 years of continued\nrefusal to comply with Security Council resolutions\n425 (1978) and 426 (1978), which called upon Israel to\nwithdraw immediately and unconditionally from\nSouthern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the\ninternationally recognized borders, with strict respect\nfor the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political\nindependence of Lebanon.\nFor the first time since 1978, the United Nations\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was allowed to\nfulfil its mandate under resolution 425 (1978). To do\nthis, the United Nations had to identify a line for the\npurpose of confirming the Israeli withdrawal.\nRegrettably, in three locations, this line did not\nconform to the internationally recognized boundary\nline demarcated in 1923 between Palestine and\nLebanon under the French and British Mandates. The\nUnited Nations border line also leaves the Shabaa\nfarmlands outside UNIFIL's area of operation in\nSouthern Lebanon.\nLebanon has seriously cooperated with the United\nNations to fulfil the requirements for the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425\n(1978). Despite Israel's repeated violations of the\nwithdrawal line and its obstructive practices, which\nhindered the deployment of the international work\nforce for weeks, the force was at long last able to\ndeploy, accompanied by the Lebanese armed forces.\nAt this juncture, I see it fit to recall Lebanon's\ncivilized stance and the wisdom and tolerance\ngraciously shown by its valiant people after its victory\nand the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. Contrary to\ndire predictions, no mayhem or acts of vengeance\n3\n\nensued. This has earned us the appreciation and\nadmiration of the international community.\nOn this occasion, allow me to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, to his assistants and to the officers and soldiers\nof UNIFIL for the tireless and unswerving efforts they\nhave been making in fulfilment of their noble task and\nin compliance with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy.\nIn this context, I would like to underline the\nimportance of the following points. First, Lebanon\ninsists that its internationally recognized borders\nremain intact. They are the borders demarcated in\naccordance with the 1923 Paulet-Newcomb maps, and\nreaffirmed later in the 1949 Israeli-Lebanese General\nArmistice Agreement. Second, Lebanon confirms its\nreservations on three locations on the blue line of\nwithdrawal adopted by the United Nations as the\nwithdrawal line. This reservation is included in the\nreport submitted by the Secretary-General to the\nSecurity Council on 16 June 2000.\nThird, Lebanon insists on its right to sovereignty\nover the Shaba'a farmlands, which are an integral part\nof Lebanese territories. Fourth, Lebanon insists on its\nsovereignty and authority over the locations set by the\nUnited Nations inside the United Nations\nDisengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) line in the\nMount Hermon area.\nFifth, Lebanon demands the immediate release of\nall Lebanese detainees from Israeli prisons. They are\nkept as hostages in violation of the terms of the 1949\nFourth Geneva Convention, of the relevant Protocols\nand of the Hague Convention of 1907. Lebanon\nbelieves that the release of the detainees will be a\ncompletion of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and\nwill therefore be a fulfilment of Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978).\nSixth, the liberation of Lebanese territories from\nIsraeli occupation shall remain compromised unless a\njust solution is found to the problem of Palestinian\nrefugees residing in Lebanon. The solution lies in\nallowing these refugees to return to their homeland, as\nprovided for in the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy.\nIsrael must compensate Lebanon for the human,\nmaterial and economic losses sustained as a result of\nIsraeli occupation and other acts of aggression, in\naccordance with international and customary laws and\nwith the principles of the United Nations Charter. In\nthis regard, we recall Security Council resolution 262\n(1968), which entitled Lebanon to appropriate redress\nfor the enormous destruction it suffered when Israel\nattacked Beirut's International Airport in late 1968. In\nthat attack, Israel destroyed 13 civilian Lebanese\naircraft. The Lebanese firmly believe in their right to\nreceive adequate and fair reparations for the substantial\nloss and devastation inflicted upon them after many\nlong years of occupation and repeated acts of\naggression. Those acts have been perpetrated by Israel\nsince 1978 in stark defiance of the will of the United\nNations.\nLebanon will therefore resort to the International\nCourt of Justice (ICJ), which is the proper organ to\nwhich to address its claims. We hope that the ICJ will\nbe able to endorse our request for adequate reparations\nand we appeal to the international community to\nsupport our just and fair demands.\nThe question of the reconstruction and\nrehabilitation of the Lebanese liberated territories\nenjoys a high priority on the Lebanese agenda. It also\nenjoys tangible international support. In this context, I\nwould like to recall the preparatory meeting of the\ndonor community, held in Beirut on 27 July in\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and the support of the World Bank\nand the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. This\nmeeting was attended by representatives of 40 States\nand international financial institutions. The participants\ndiscussed the question of providing urgent financial\nassistance to help restore normalcy to the liberated\nterritories. The preliminary deliberations were\npromising and we hope to see them materialize at the\ndonors' conference to be held at the ministerial level in\nOctober.\nThe Lebanese feel that the international\ncommunity did not exert adequate efforts to compel\nIsrael to comply with Security Council resolution 425\n(1978), which called upon Israel to end its occupation a\nlong time ago. Due to this delay, Lebanon as a whole\nhad to suffer the dire consequences of occupation. Our\nresources plummeted, our economy crumbled and our\npeople endured untold suffering. From this rostrum, I\nappeal to the donor countries, to international financial\ninstitutions and to the United Nations specialized\nagencies to provide sufficient assistance for the\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of South Lebanon.\n4\n\nThis will be a token of solidarity on behalf of the\ninternational community.\nWe thought that the prospects for the realization\nof a just and comprehensive peace in the region were\nreal following the recent rounds of negotiations.\nRegrettably, the results were disappointing. The\nnegotiations for peace floundered and the process was\nderailed on all tracks. This was due to the fact that the\nIsraeli leaders gave the logic of No's' precedence\nover the principles of right and justice. This is\nparticularly unfortunate in the light of the many\nachievements made in bringing the negotiations so\nclose to an optimal solution, especially on the Syrian\ntrack.\nThe prerogatives of peace are not commensurate\nwith the Israeli No's'. These No's' run counter to the\nresolutions of international legitimacy that provided for\nthe return to Syria of the entire Golan up to the line of\n4 June 1967. These resolutions also recognized the\nneed to enable the Palestinian people to recover their\ninalienable rights, including their right to self-\ndetermination, the establishment of their independent\nState on their own national soil, with Jerusalem as its\ncapital, and their right to return to their homeland in\nPalestine.\nThe liberation of most of the Lebanese territories\nfrom Israeli occupation will not affect Lebanon's\ncommitment to the process of peaceful settlement of\nthe Middle East question. Lebanon upholds its position\nwith regard to the inseparability of the Syrian and\nLebanese tracks. We believe that the opportunity for a\njust and comprehensive peace remains, provided that\nIsrael complies with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy and the Madrid terms of reference.\nLebanon believes that Israel has forfeited the\nachievements made in its negotiations with the Arab\nside due to the conflicting domestic agendas of various\nIsraeli political groups. This will hinder the settlement\nprocess in the region, and will further compromise our\nprotracted pursuit of peace. Lebanon calls on the co-\nsponsors of the peace process  the United States and\nthe Russian Federation  and the European Union to\nrenew their efforts to relaunch the peace process from\nthe point where it left off in 1996.\nLebanon cannot fail to stress once again that in\norder to achieve a peaceful settlement, the Palestinian\nrefugees, particularly those hosted by Lebanon, must\nbe allowed to return to their homeland. Ignoring their\nproblem or attempting to resettle them in Lebanon will\nfurther exacerbate the tension and the volatility of the\nregion. This would in turn threaten the prospects of a\njust and lasting peace.\nMore than 10 years have passed since the Iraqi\ninvasion of Kuwait. Nevertheless, the question of the\nrelease of the Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of war\nstill awaits a solution. We in Lebanon have condemned\nthis invasion. We believe that, in addition to other\nmeasures required of Iraq, the release of prisoners will\nbe an important step towards improving relations with\nthat country. Lebanon calls for lifting the sanctions\nimposed on Iraq in order to alleviate the suffering of\nthe brotherly Iraqi people and to allow them to restore\ntheir security, stability and prosperity.\nThere is a favourable trend in the relationship\nbetween Iran and the Gulf States. That trend must be an\nincentive to settle the dispute over three islands that\nhas been going on between the Islamic Republic of Iran\nand the United Arab Emirates for over three decades. It\nshould be settled in the context of good-\nneighbourliness and the common interests promoted by\nthe League of Arab States and the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference.\nThe Millennium Summit was convened as part of\na global effort to foster the credibility of the United\nNations and its ability to seek solutions to the problems\nof all countries and peoples. The international\nOrganization must be capable of keeping up with the\ndemands and challenges of the new millennium,\nwhenever and wherever they arise. The deliberations of\nthe Millennium Summit made it clear that what was at\nstake was the individual. Attempts to arrive at a global\nvision may differ in the details, but should definitely\nagree on the substance. In our view, the Millennium\nDeclaration embodied creative ideas and principles that\nmust be embraced in a global blueprint and translated\ninto reality. Such a blueprint introduces novel\napproaches to the purposes and working methods of the\nUnited Nations.\nLebanon agrees with the conclusions of the\nSummit. The main challenge we face today is to\nguarantee that the benefits of globalization are shared\nby all peoples of the world. The correct approach is for\nus to stand united so that globalization and its\nmanifestations and results will have a human face.\nAdequate controls must be developed and must take\ninto account the different cultures, traditions and real\n5\n\nneeds of the peoples of the world. The costs and\nbenefits of globalization must be fairly and equally\ndistributed.\nLebanon also believes that the protection of our\ncommon environment presents a different kind of\nchallenge. Careful strategies must be developed for\nwater-resource management, combating desertification,\nrespecting and preserving ecosystems and combating\nenvironmental pollution. Those strategies must be\ngoverned by new ethics. God has privileged Lebanon\nwith a scenic landscape and an optimal geographic\nlocation. Regrettably, we have had our share of\nenvironmental degradation. We therefore attach\nincreasing importance to environmental issues. Laws\nare currently being enacted for the preservation of the\nenvironment pursuant to the decisions of relevant\ninternational conferences. We need the support of the\ninternational community in our endeavours.\nDevelopment has become the main preoccupation\nof the developing and least developed countries. It\nmust be linked to an open and just global trading\nsystem within an institutional framework that\nguarantees unobstructed investment and capital flows,\nas well as the transfer of technology.\nWe must develop an international mechanism\nwithin the United Nations to address the indebtedness\nof developing countries.\nIn our view, there is an inherent link between the\nmaintenance of regional and international peace and\nsecurity and the process of development and peace-\nbuilding. Hotbeds of tension and protracted armed\nconflict in some regions of Africa, the Balkans and the\nMiddle East impede the realization of integrated\ndevelopment. Our international Organization must\ntherefore dedicate more efforts to defusing tensions and\nto resolving crises by reforming and invigorating the\nroles of its two primary organs, namely, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\nIn conclusion, Lebanon is a founding Member of\nthe United Nations and has contributed to the drafting\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today,\nLebanon looks forward to playing a distinct role in the\nregional and international arenas. We are anxious to\nreconstruct and rehabilitate our vital and civil\ninstitutions and productive sectors after the liberation\nof our land from the Israeli occupation. We in Lebanon\nare striving for a just and comprehensive peace in the\nMiddle East that will bring back stability to our region\nand allow us to play a positive role in building a new\nworld in which we aspire to live."

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir,\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you on your\nelection as President of this historic Millennium\nAssembly and wish you every success in your\nimportant mission. I also pay tribute to Mr. Gurirab for\nhis skilful leadership during the fifty-fourth session.\nMy delegation welcomes Tuvalu as the newest\nMember of the United Nations.\nAll of us were witnesses to the historic\nMillennium Summit, at which an unprecedented\nnumber of heads of State and Government gathered to\naddress the issues of the future of humanity. Many\nleaders reiterated that our future depends on our\ncommon efforts for humanity's betterment, and that the\nUnited Nations has always been, and continues to be, a\nunique forum which, by virtue of its universal\ncharacter, has the mandate to solve the pressing\nproblems of peace, security and development.\nIn this regard, the Kyrgyz Republic favours\nincreasing the overall effectiveness of the United\nNations and recognizes that the United Nations should\nbe a results-oriented Organization. Kyrgyzstan supports\nmeasures aimed at transforming the United Nations\ninto an Organization with a more perfect management\nand a well-ordered structure, and thus better prepared\nto cope with both humanitarian and political crises.\nEmphasizing the importance of the United\nNations as a global Organization of the human\ncommunity, Kyrgyzstan supports the universal\ncharacter of its reforms, which should include all\nbodies of the United Nations, including the Security\nCouncil. Confirming its position on the quantitative\nexpansion of the Security Council in both categories,\nthe Kyrgyz Republic favours clear, geographical\nrepresentation of the countries of Asia, Africa, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\nA decade ago Kyrgyzstan chose as its goal the\nestablishment of a democratic open society and an\neconomy based on free market principles. Today we\ncan look back at our first 10 years with some\nsatisfaction. However, the invasions of international\nterrorists into the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic\nin 1999 and August this year have shown that the new\ndemocracies are very fragile. These events also testify\nto the fact that international terrorist organizations have\nevery intention of perpetrating their criminal activities\nusing the territories of the States of Central Asia. These\nactions should be seen for what they are: part of the\nglobal plan of international terrorism, with the express\npurpose of destabilizing a wide region.\nNo individual country can cope with these\nchallenges on its own. It has become quite clear that\nterrorism represents a threat to the whole global\ncommunity, which can, and should, take adequate\nmeasures in the struggle with this evil. The struggle\nagainst terrorism should be conducted at the national,\nregional and international levels.\nKyrgyzstan has contributed to strengthening the\nglobal consensus on combating international terrorism.\nFurthermore, as of this year, Kyrgyzstan is a party to\nthree major international Conventions, and a Protocol,\nagainst terrorism. Kyrgyzstan is currently working on\nbecoming a party to the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly on 15 December 1997, and the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which was opened for\nsignature this year.\nAn important step towards strengthening regional\nsecurity is the Summit of the heads of State of the\nmembers of the Shanghai Five, which is assuming a\ndefinitive character. The Bishkek group has been\ncreated within the framework of the Shanghai forum.\nThis group of law-enforcement bodies and special\nservices of the member countries conducts work on the\ncoordination of our countries' actions in preventing\nand confronting all manifestations of international\nterrorism, extremism, separatism, the illegal drug trade,\nthe smuggling of weapons, illegal migration and other\nkinds of criminal activity. The anti-terrorist centre of\nthe Shanghai Five is currently being created, with its\nheadquarters in Bishkek.\nThe Bishkek meeting of the heads of State of\nKyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and\nthe special envoy of the President of the Russian\nFederation, which was held on 20 August 2000,\ndemonstrated the unanimous resolve of the countries of\nCentral Asia and Russia jointly to eradicate the threat\nof terrorism in their territories. We believe that the\nefforts of our countries will be supported by the\ninternational community. The United Nations plays the\nmost important role in this process. The Kyrgyz\n17\n\nRepublic is taking action in favour of the creation of an\ninternational system of measures for controlling\nterrorism and other forms of extremism. In this regard,\nwe are considering with interest Uzbekistan's initiative\nto establish an international counter-terrorism centre\nwithin the United Nations system.\nThe efforts made by Kyrgyzstan and other States\nof Central Asia in the struggle against international\nterrorism, religious and political extremism and illegal\ndrug trafficking, will not be crowned with success\nwithout the normalization of the situation in\nAfghanistan. We express the hope that effective\nmeasures for the radical improvement of conditions in\nAfghanistan will be undertaken. It is particularly\nimportant to guarantee that such forms of common\nactivity be further developed. Furthermore, expressing\nits sincere aspiration to promote the prompt\nestablishment of peace in Afghanistan and stability in\nthe region as a whole, the Kyrgyz Republic confirms its\nreadiness to make its territory available for the holding\nof a peace conference on Afghanistan under the\nauspices of the United Nations.\nIn its desire to make its own contribution to the\nefforts of the global community in creating a safe,\nnuclear-free future, Kyrgyzstan is continuing to move\nforward with its very active participation in the\ncreation in Central Asia of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nWe welcome the assistance of the United Nations in the\nrealization of this initiative. We express our hope that\nthe countries of Central Asia will successfully finish\nthe work on the drafting of a treaty that responds to the\ninterests of the peoples of the region and of the entire\ninternational community.\nThe issue of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\ncannot be avoided when speaking about world security.\nSigned in 1972, it became an important cornerstone of\nstrategic stability. In this regard, we should reaffirm\ntoday its role in international security and our need to\nstrictly observe it and comply with all of its provisions.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic aspires to make a\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. Kyrgyzstan is currently represented in the\npeacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone and Kosovo.\nMy country is going further to make efforts to expand\nits contribution to the peacekeeping activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nFor Kyrgyzstan, a country with an economy in\ntransition, the most significant problems are those of\ndevelopment. The key role in their resolution should be\nplayed by the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), as the main body of the United Nations\nresponsible for coordinating the provision of assistance\nwith national development purposes. The Kyrgyz\nRepublic welcomes the decisive steps taken by the\nUNDP Administrator aimed at structural reform and\nthe easing of the heavy financial burden, which can\nthreaten the realization of a number of national projects\non democratic and economic reform.\nWith regard to the problems of financing for\ndevelopment in the context of globalization and\ninterdependence, Kyrgyzstan draws particular attention\nto financing for the eradication of poverty. The\nSecretary-General's report (A/54/2000), \u201cWe the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century\u201d, has identified poverty as one of the main\nchallenges facing mankind. Shorn of all the\nsophisticated economic rhetoric, poverty reduction\nmeans simply the creation of new jobs and productive\nactivities that will provide people not only with income\nand employment, but also with self-respect and hope\nfor their future and the future of their children. Special\nmeasures should be taken by the international\ncommunity to assist developing countries and countries\nwith economies in transition in their efforts to develop\nand participate fully in the global economy.\nThe establishment of a uniform transport system\nis especially important for Central Asia, which is\nlocated far from major sea routes. Kyrgyzstan is\nworking for the development and realization of large,\nregionally important projects, such as the creation of a\nuniform transport system with access to external\nmarkets and of modern communication systems. This\nwill not only optimize the global transport system by\nreducing distances and transportation time, but also\nprovide a very powerful impetus for economic\ndevelopment because of the expansion of exports. Such\nlarge projects as the transport corridor between Europe,\nthe Caucasus and Asia, known as TRACEKA, have\nalready begun to be developed and realized.\n\nWe support those provisions of the Secretary-\nGeneral's report that address the issue of the building\nof \u201cdigital bridges\u201d. It is obvious that the huge progress\nin computer science and telecommunications has\nradically changed the picture of the world. The\n18\n\ntelecommunications \u201cSilksat\u201d project has been\ndeveloped for the purpose of preventing the threat of\ninformation breakdown between countries. Its purpose\nis to facilitate the optimal entry of the countries of the\nGreat Silk Road into the global telecommunications\nsystem.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic, believing that stability has\nnot only political and economic aspects, but also an\nenvironmental perspective, submitted to the Secretary-\nGeneral this year its instruments of ratification and\naccession to the following treaties concerning\nenvironmental issues: the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change; the Convention on\nLong-Range Transboundary Air Pollution; the\nRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent\nProcedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and\nPesticides in International Trade; and the Vienna\nConvention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and\nthe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\nOzone Layer.\nToday the Kyrgyz Parliament is working on the\nratification of the Kyoto Protocol, in support of the\nidea expressed by the Secretary-General in his\nmillennium report that\n\u201cThe need to preserve biodiversity is a less\nself-evident conservation issue than polluted\nbeaches, burning forests or expanding deserts.\nBut it is as crucial, if not more so. \u201c (A/54/2000,\npara. 293)\nI would add mountain ecosystems to the Secretary-\nGeneral's list of major ecosystem concerns. I take this\nopportunity to express our deep gratitude to the global\ncommunity for its support of Kyrgyzstan's initiative\nwith the adoption during the fifty-third session of\nresolution 53/24, proclaiming 2002 the International\nYear of Mountains. We express the hope that its\nobservance will promote mobilization by the\ninternational community of economic, technical and\nfinancial resources for the sustainable development of\nmountainous areas. To that end, the Kyrgyz Republic\noffers to host in Kyrgyzstan in 2002, under the auspices\nof the United Nations, of an international conference\non mountains.\nIn preparation for the International Year of\nMountains, we call on States and international\norganizations to give further attention to the problems\nof preserving the natural balance of mountainous\necosystems and the development of mountainous\ncountries and regions. We commend the Food and\nAgriculture Organization, the leading agency for\npreparing for the Year, for its comprehensive concept\npaper on mountain issues and for its tireless efforts in\nthat field.\nKyrgyzstan supports the initiative of the Republic\nof Tajikistan to proclaim 2003 the year of fresh water,\nwithin the framework of the United Nations. We hope\nthat the global community will support it.\nKyrgyzstan faces problems in dealing with\nnatural disasters and their regularly occurring\nconsequences, especially in mountainous regions. The\nKyrgyz Republic has a direct interest in the further\nstrengthening of the international capacity to deal with\naccidents, in advanced specialized technologies to cope\nwith the consequences of accidents, and in increasing\nthe coordination of the rescue services of various\ncountries.\nIn conclusion, I assure the President that the\nKyrgyz delegation will take a most active part in\nachieving our overall common purpose: to ensure the\nsuccessful work of the Millennium Assembly.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I begin by joining\nothers who have congratulated you, Mr. President, on\nyour election. I also assure you of the New Zealand\ndelegation's full cooperation as you carry out your\nimportant duties.\nI also welcome the admission last week of our\nneighbour and friend Tuvalu into the United Nations.\nThe admission of four new Pacific nations in the space\nof a year contributes to the truly universal character of\nthe Organization.\nThis general debate is taking place at the start of\na new century and a new millennium. Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan has called upon the Member\nStates of the United Nations to harness the symbolic\npower of the millennium to meet the real and urgent\nneeds of people in every part of the world. This is an\nappropriate time to recommit ourselves to the beliefs,\nthe values and the principles that led to the birth of the\nOrganization 55 years ago.\nLike many other Members of the Organization,\nNew Zealand is a small country that tries to take a\nprincipled and independent view of the world. In 1945,\nin San Francisco, we played an active part through the\nLabour Prime Minister of the day, Peter Fraser, in\nframing the Charter in which heads of State and\nGovernment reaffirmed their faith here last week.\nWe have always viewed the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, and the practical task\nof peacekeeping, as key roles of the United Nations.\nWe are currently making our largest-ever contribution\nto the United Nations peacekeeping operation in East\nTimor. This commitment underlines our full support for\nthe central role of the United Nations in building a\nstable, democratic and economically viable East Timor\nin partnership with its people. So do the non-military\npersonnel and development assistance we have\nprovided to help the East Timorese create essential\nservices.\nJust over a year ago, the East Timorese people\nvoted overwhelmingly for an independent future, and I\nhad the privilege of being part of the United Nations\nMission in East Timor (UNAMET) group that oversaw\nthat electoral process. We recall the horrors which\nfollowed as pro-integration militias laid waste to the\nterritory, slaughtered innocent people and forced\nthousands of East Timorese into West Timor.\nRelative calm and stability has been restored in\nmost of East Timor, and we remember here today the\nsacrifices made by peacekeepers from Australia,\nBangladesh, Nepal and my own country who in recent\n24\n\nmonths laid down their lives to help achieve this. But\nthe militias continue to hold sway in the border areas\namong the refugees in West Timor. Unless brought\nunder control, these militias will destabilize both West\nand East Timor.\nThe murder last week of three United Nations\nhumanitarian workers in Atambua in West Timor\nrepelled us all. New Zealand was able to respond\nquickly, along with Australia, to the United Nations\ncall for help in evacuating their colleagues and non-\ngovernmental organization personnel from Atambua.\nWe committed helicopters with security and medical\nelements from our forces serving on the border with the\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\nTimor (UNTAET). This airborne evacuation, which had\nthe cooperation of Indonesian forces, was successful.\nBut the pain and the outrage we feel at the murder of\nthree United Nations humanitarian workers remains\nundiminished.\nThe Security Council, in its resolution 1319\n(2000), insisted that the Government of Indonesia\ndisarm and disband the militia immediately to ensure\nsafety and security in the refugee camps and for\nhumanitarian workers, and to prevent cross-border\nincursions into East Timor. It also called for those who\nhave carried out attacks on international personnel to\nbe brought to justice. These are binding obligations.\nThe world awaits action to implement them without\nfurther delay.\nBesides East Timor, New Zealand is at present\ncontributing to 12 other peacekeeping operations,\nincluding in Kosovo, on the borders of Syria, Israel and\nLebanon, in the Prevlaka peninsula and in Sierra\nLeone. New Zealand personnel also serve with the\nPeace Monitoring Group in Bougainville, the\nMultinational Force Organization (MFO) in Sinai and\nwith the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Being\nconscious of the many challenges faced by the United\nNations in meeting its peacekeeping responsibilities,\nwe greatly welcome the Brahimi report. We trust that\nthe report's important recommendations will receive\nserious and expeditious consideration during this\nMillennium Assembly session, with a view to their\nearly implementation.\nAs the Brahimi report points out, weak mandates\nand poor resourcing underlie most of those operations\nwhich did not succeed in their objectives. We are\nconcerned too at the tendency to rely overly on\n\u201ccoalitions of the willing\u201d to carry out operations that\nshould be undertaken by the United Nations. The\nfailure of some Member States to pay their assessed\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions\nimposes an impossible burden on the Organization and\non troop contributors. We agree that the scale of\nassessments for peacekeeping needs revision to make it\nmore equitable and transparent. Any revision must be\nestablished in accordance with the longstanding\nprinciple of apportioning expenses according to\nMember States' capacity to pay.\nHeads of State or Government agreed at the\nMillennium Summit to intensify their efforts to achieve\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all\nits aspects. In the past seven years of debate on this\nmatter, it has been shown just how difficult an issue it\nis, especially in regard to how the Council might be\nenlarged. There is no agreement on this aspect at this\ntime. And yet I am sure that most Member States\nwould agree that the Council must be made more\nrepresentative of today's membership as well as more\ntransparent in its working methods and more\ndemocratic in its decision-making. If there is to be\nprogress towards an overall package deal on reform,\nthen compromises will have to be made.\nAt the heart of any reform, in New Zealand's\nview, must be the curtailment of the veto, if indeed it\ncannot be eliminated. We have argued this case since\n1945, and we believe that it is even more relevant\ntoday. A device which 50 years ago might have had the\nutility of preventing the permanent members from\nusing the Organization to make war on one another has\nin recent times served to frustrate the will of the wider\nmembership. I believe there is very broad agreement in\nthe General Assembly on the need to deal with the veto\nurgently, so that the Security Council can be more\neffective in carrying out its important responsibilities.\nI would not want to suggest that there has been no\nprogress at all on Council reform. There have, in fact,\nbeen some major steps forward in opening up the\nCouncil's meetings and briefings to participation by\nnon-members. We are grateful for that. I would also\nlike to reaffirm New Zealand's strong support for the\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\nreform, whose deliberations have contributed to this\nprogress. In our view, the Working Group continues to\nbe the appropriate forum in which to pursue efforts\naimed at reforming the Council, because it is essential\nfor the health of the Organization that any reform\n25\n\npackage enjoy the widest support and buy-in. Council\nreform is too important a matter for back-room deals.\nThe Millennium Declaration contains some\nimportant guidance on human rights, democracy and\ngood governance. For example, all countries are\nenjoined to strengthen their capacity to implement the\nprinciples and practices of democracy and respect for\nhuman rights, including minority rights. This could not\nbe more timely for my own region, the South Pacific,\nwhere over the past year we have seen the collapse of\ndemocracy and governance in some countries in the\nface of disputes over land and economic disparities and\nas a result of ethnic tensions.\nThere are no easy solutions to some of the\nproblems the region faces, but one thing is clear, and\nthat is that the answer to these problems is not to adopt\npolitical systems that discriminate against particular\nethnic groups, as some in Fiji this year have sought to\ndo. To do so simply breeds a deeper sense of frustration\nand exclusion, which is a recipe for further instability.\nSmall States, especially small developing countries like\nour neighbours in the Pacific, face particular challenges\nfrom globalization. They are uniquely vulnerable to\nexternal impacts. We need to find fresh and more\neffective means to development.\nIt is essential to help countries build for\nthemselves inclusive and democratic forms of\ngovernment that in turn take account of cultural values.\nUnderpinning this must be robust and accountable\ninstitutions, respect for the rule of law, independence\nof the judiciary, an effective press, strong civil society\nand, above all, greater public education to foster a\nmore widespread understanding of democratic values\nand processes.\nThe Millennium Summit provided heads of State\nor Government the opportunity to take action on a\nrange of treaties which are fundamental to the\ndevelopment of international human rights law and\ninternational humanitarian law. My Prime Minister\ntook action in respect of six, and I record here in\nparticular New Zealand's ratification of the Optional\nProtocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women, the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, and the two\nOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child.\nThe practices of child prostitution, child\npornography and the appalling exploitation of children\nto fight wars are a disgrace and a crime against\nhumanity which must be expunged. We encourage\nothers also to sign and ratify these agreements. I should\nalso add that we greatly welcome the recent decision\nby the Economic and Social Council to establish a\nPermanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders agreed\nto strive for the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. The outcome\nof the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in\nMay, where the five nuclear-weapon States gave an\nunequivocal political undertaking to accomplish the\ntotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals, demonstrates\na new determination to achieve a world free of nuclear\nweapons. This is a matter of real urgency. We must\npromote the implementation of the new commitments.\nNew Zealand, with its new agenda partners, will submit\na draft resolution during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nNew Zealand will also, in partnership with Brazil,\npromote a southern hemisphere free of nuclear\nweapons. In addition, we will, along with Australia,\nMexico and Japan, urge all countries that have yet to\ndo so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty. We will also support further\npreparations for the United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects and join calls for adherence to the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction.\nNew Zealand urges caution regarding decisions\non missile developments that could impact negatively\non nuclear disarmament, lead to a new nuclear arms\nrace or be inconsistent with the commitment to the\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons. This is no time\nfor complacency. The United Nations disarmament and\narms-control machinery must engage again in\nnegotiations and other work on the new programme of\naction agreed at the NPT Conference.\nLeaders also declared their resolve to minimize\nthe adverse effects of United Nations economic\nsanctions on innocent populations. Sanctions are an\nimportant tool at the Security Council's disposal to\nencourage compliance with its resolutions, but they\nmust be appropriately targeted for maximum effect.\nThey should not impose blanket measures which harm\n26\n\ninnocent populations and even strengthen the grip of\ndespotic regimes. We support efforts within the\nOrganization to develop proposals for smarter, more\neffective sanctions which apply pressure where it we\nwill have maximum impact.\nThe Millennium Declaration also speaks of the\nneed to protect our common environment. My Prime\nMinister announced during the Summit our intention to\nbecome party to the Kyoto Protocol to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change by\nmid-2002. I also wish to recall a particular\nachievement over the past year in the holding of the\ninaugural session of the United Nations Open-ended\nInformal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs and\nthe law of the sea. This is a significant step forward in\nproviding an appropriate forum for discussion of cross-\ncutting oceans issues. The success of this process\nshould be judged by the extent to which there is\nenhanced global understanding of oceans issues and an\nincreased willingness to cooperate and coordinate\ncross-sectorally to address them.\nFinally, the Millennium Declaration sets some\nkey goals for development and poverty eradication and\nurges meeting the special needs of Africa. This year,\nNew Zealand was able to increase its core funding of\nthe United Nations Development Programme by more\nthan a third and of the United Nations Children's Fund\nby almost a half. We believe that the United Nations\nhas a key role to play in the coordination of official\ndevelopment assistance delivery. The preparations for\nthe event on financing for development are an excellent\ndemonstration of leadership by the Organization and a\nsignificant step forward in furthering cooperation with\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. The crushing and\nseemingly never-ending debt burden, especially on the\ncountries of Africa, must be urgently reduced. We must\nalso address more effectively the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS.\nLeaders at last week's Summit provided this\nMillennium Assembly with a clear direction and a\nstrong mandate. Our countries have delegated us the\nresponsibility to realize that vision of a better world\nand we must ensure through our efforts and\ndetermination that we do not fail them."

        "file_text": "It is a\ngreat pleasure for me to convey through you, Sir, to the\nPresident of the General Assembly our sincere\ncongratulations upon his election. I am confident that\nhe will lead the work of this Millennium Assembly\nmost ably.\nI should also like to express our sincere\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Gurirab, the\nForeign Minister of Namibia, for his exceptional\nleadership of the fifty-fourth session.\nMay I also express our high esteem for the\nSecretary-General for his most efficient preparation for\nboth the Millennium Summit and Assembly. We\nappreciate his efforts to maintain and promote the role\nof the Organization and to strengthen its effectiveness\nand credibility.\nThe convening of the Millennium Summit and\nAssembly is an important milestone in the international\nsystem and the future of the United Nations. The two\noccasions constitute a unique forum to review the state\nof the world and its developments and to take stock of\nthe performance of the Organization so as to enable it\nto occupy its central place in the international system\nand hence lead the movement of change on the basis of\na general consensus and a meeting of all minds.\nThe goal of the establishment of a stable and\neffective system of collective security through dialogue\nand cooperation in the context of international\ndemocracy has been one of the most important\nobjectives of the United Nations and those of the\ninternational community. It is thus necessary to allow\nthe United Nations to achieve its objectives by\nadapting its work to the current international variables\nthat must take the United Nations seriously. This might\nvery well be the thrust of the Secretary-General's\nreport to the Millennium Assembly.\nIn our opinion, the first step down this road is to\nagree on a broad modern definition of collective\nsecurity in the coming decades. Security in its most\nsimple and realistic definition is based on three basic\nand organically linked rights, namely, the right to\nsafety and stability and avoidance of the scourges of\nwar, mass destruction and armed conflicts, the right to\ndevelopment and to a decent life free from poverty,\ndestitution and want and the right to live in a healthy\nenvironment free from pollution, disease and negative\nsocial phenomena. A cursory glance at the state of\nthose three rights would reveal that during the last\ndecade of international transformations they have\nbecome exposed to new threats, while existing ones\n\nhave been exacerbated in a manner threatening grave\nrepercussions.\nAfter the end of the cold war and the end of\ntensions between the two super-Powers, international\npeace became exposed to a new kind of threat, the\nthreat resulting from the disintegration of some States,\nthe collapse of their national structures and the\nvictimization of their people due to internal strife and\nnegative foreign intervention.\nGlobalization, world market, the information and\ncommunications revolution and the emergence of new\nkinds of economic activities all hold the promise of\nunlimited progress, yet they carry with them the\ndangers of widening the development gap between the\ndeveloped and developing world.\nAs for a healthy environment, whole continents\nare suffering from epidemics, environmental\ndegradation, backwardness and the spread of ethnic\nwars as well as the increased tragedies of refugees.\nAfrica is the region most affected by that horrible\ntriangle  armed civil conflicts, poverty and economic\nbackwardness, degraded environment, natural disasters,\ndeadly diseases and epidemics. There is a belt of\ntension encircling the continent and economic\ndifficulties and problems continue. Africa has thus\nreached an untenable situation that requires immediate\nand firm attention in order to help it extricate itself\nfrom that quagmire.\nI must reiterate in this regard that the African\nStates, through the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) and other groupings, are discharging their\nresponsibilities as best they can. They are taking\nnecessary measures and steps to place themselves on\nthe right path towards a better future. Special mention\nshould be made here of the OAU Mechanism for\nconflict resolution, the efforts to strengthen\npeacekeeping capabilities through subregional\ngroupings and the establishment of common markets\nand economic groupings, such as the Common Market\nfor Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\nand the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS). Our continent is moving towards a form\nof unity on the basis of the resolutions of the recent\nLom\u00c8 summit, which will be followed up at the\nupcoming Sirte summit.\nAn agreement was recently concluded in Arusha\non the settlement of the Burundi conflict. A new\nPresident of Somalia, Mr. Abdi Kassim Salad Hassan,\nwas elected after the constructive efforts of the\nGovernment of sisterly Djibouti. There are efforts\nunder way in the Great Lakes region. All these\nexamples prove Africa's ability to deal on its own with\nsome of its problems. Yet it cannot be left alone\nwithout the support of the international community,\nparticularly in the field of peacekeeping and peace-\nmaking. The United Nations must play its full role in\nthat field.\nMeeting the new challenges faced by the\ninternational community and achieving the goal of\nestablishing an effective system of collective security\nfor future generations require, as I mentioned earlier,\nimproving the United Nations performance and\nadapting it to the demands of these goals. In his\nmessage to the Millennium Summit last week,\nPresident Mubarak stressed the need to pay special\nattention to the maintenance of international peace and\nto support efforts for development, poverty elimination\nand narrowing the widening gap between the rich and\nthe poor in our world.\nAllow me to address these priorities and to stress\ntheir linkage to a number of important subjects and\nnecessary steps. First, there is an urgent need to\nstrengthen and reform the United Nations in general.\nThere is a similar need to reform and restructure the\nSecurity Council and to enhance its credibility. We are\ndetermined to continue our contribution to the current\ndialogue on a comprehensive and balanced package\ndeal on the expansion of both the permanent and non-\npermanent membership of the Council. This would\nenable the Council to be more equitably representative.\nIt would also reflect the overwhelming majority of the\ndeveloping countries, members of the Organization.\nWe are fully committed to the positions of the\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in this regard. We reiterate the\nneed for expansion of the Council to be accompanied\nby reform of its working methods and a revision of the\nuse of the veto power, with a view to rationalizing it.\nI wish to stress here what I mentioned earlier \nthat Egypt has a long history of regional and\ninternational contributions. It plays a significant role\non the African, Arab and Islamic levels, as well as in\nthe Middle East and among the developing countries\n19\n\nand emerging economies. In addition, Egypt has made\nmany contributions to support United Nations activities\nand achieve its objectives. It has also contributed to the\nOrganization's peacekeeping operations. All this makes\nEgypt eminently eligible and qualified to shoulder the\nresponsibilities of permanent membership in an\nexpanded Security Council, within the framework\nsuggested by the African heads of State and\nGovernment since 1997.\nSecond, there is an equally urgent need to restore\nthe role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of\npeace, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter,\nespecially when the Security Council fails to discharge\nits primary responsibility in this regard. This would\nensure that any collective actions or measures enjoyed\nthe international legitimacy represented by the\nOrganization. There is a need to further develop United\nNations peacekeeping operations and provide them\nwith a rapid deployment capability. There is also a\nneed for concerted efforts to increase the capacity of\nStates, particularly African States, to participate in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, or those of\nregional and subregional organizations which are\nmandated and financed by the United Nations. Egypt\nwill address these important issues when the General\nAssembly considers the Brahimi report (A/55/305).\nThese considerations must be kept in mind when\nwe address how to develop the conceptual and practical\nframework of peacemaking and peacekeeping. New\nideas, such as humanitarian intervention and the\npreventive deployment of forces, have, since the last\nsession, begun to gain currency. We have called, and\ncontinue to call, for discussion of those ideas with the\nhighest degree of frankness and transparency. Those\nideas impinge on the concept of sovereignty. Some\ntend to belittle the value and importance of sovereignty\nwhen the matter pertains to the sovereignty of others.\nThose very same States tend also to consider it\nsacrosanct and inviolable when the matter pertains to\ntheir own sovereignty.\nThird, the sanctions regime, as one of the\ncomponent parts of the measures taken within the\ncurrent system of collective security, needs a thorough\nreview. Sanctions cannot last indefinitely. They must\nnot cause human suffering to tens of millions of people\nor result in massive and destructive harm to the\neconomic infrastructures or social fabric of States.\nSanctions must not lead to the creation of angry\ngenerations who will continue to be embittered by their\nsuffering, even after these actions are lifted.\nFourth, there is a need to recognize the\nimportance of continued, serious consideration of the\nquestion of disarmament, particularly nuclear\ndisarmament, which is the most destructive and poses\nthe greatest threats. The priority of nuclear\ndisarmament must not be overshadowed by the\nincreased attention paid to small arms, light weapons\nand anti-personnel landmines. This is not to say that we\ndo not recognize the importance of these subjects or\nthe need to deal with them comprehensively and\nappropriately. In this regard, we reaffirm Egypt's\ninitiatives for the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. We welcome\nthe results of the sixth Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the field of nuclear\ndisarmament in general. We welcome in particular the\nConference's recognition of the specificity of the\nsituation in the Middle East and its reaffirmation of the\ncontinued validity and importance of implementing the\nresolutions on the Middle East adopted by the NPT\nReview and Extension Conference in 1995.\nFifth, with the accelerated pace of globalization\nand trade liberalization, the gap between the rich and\npoor countries is widening in a manner that threatens\ngrave dangers. The comparison between patterns of\nproduction and consumption and standards of living in\nthe developing and developed worlds is both stark and\nshocking. Narrowing this gap and correcting this\nimbalance in the international structure is not merely a\nmoral obligation, but is vital. An international\npartnership must be established to achieve this\nobjective.\nThe call for social justice within States must be\naccompanied by a similar call for justice in sharing the\nbenefits of progress, globalization, the information\ntechnology and communications revolution and trade\nliberalization among members of the international\nfamily in the North and the South alike. We truly need\nto give globalization a human face and an equilibrium\nthat will enable it to contribute to bridging that gap.\nUnited Nations literature is replete with studies\non the problems of and obstacles to development and\nthe elimination of poverty. This, however, is no longer\nsufficient. In several international conferences we have\nadopted plans and programmes of action containing\n20\n\nclear commitments to mobilize the financial resources\nnecessary to implement them. Yet implementation has\nnot been at the level of the commitments contained in\nthose documents.\nA few months ago we reviewed progress in the\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\ninternational conferences on population, women and\nsocial development. But what were the results of these\nreviews? What are the ways needed to face the\nobstacles that have impeded progress and made the\nimplementation of the recommendations of those\nconferences fall below our expectations?\nWe have adopted the objective of halving poverty\nin the world by 2015. What is the course charted for\nachieving this objective and what are the commitments\nmade to mobilize the financial resources necessary for\nits achievement? What about the numerous\nprogrammes and initiatives for African development?\nHave their achievements been commensurate with the\nmagnitude of the problems facing the continent? Is it\nnot time for a clear commitment, going beyond the\ncurrent initiatives, to lift the burden of foreign\nindebtedness that is crushing Africa? We need a\ngenuine partnership between the North and the South.\nWe need real and effective support by the donors and\nthe international financial institutions to implement\ndevelopment efforts and attempts to eliminate poverty,\nnot only as a moral value taking the form of freedom\nfrom want, as mentioned in the Secretary-General's\nreport (A/54/2000), but also as a vital objective\nconnected to the establishment of peace and stability.\nSixth, in the same vein, an attempt to place\nresponsibility for achieving development and\neliminating poverty solely or even primarily on the\nshoulders of developing countries is both dangerous\nand short-sighted, because it would undermine the\nconcept of international cooperation, which is one of\nthe cornerstones of the world system, and ignore the\nrepercussions of the widening gap between the rich and\nthe poor in our world. That gap is now 16 times as\nlarge as it was in the 1960s.\nAn attempt is also being made to link\ninternational cooperation and the North's support for\nthe South with concepts and values that in themselves\nwe support but whose new conditionality we reject. I\nam referring here to democracy, good governance and\nhuman rights. Questions of democratic transformation,\nimproved governance and administration, increased\ntransparency and accountability, and promoting respect\nfor human rights cannot be dealt with in isolation from\nthe questions of development, poverty and subsistence,\nfor they too are vitally important subjects. Should not\nthe call for democracy within States be matched by a\nsimilar call for democracy among States and\ninternational organizations? Should not the call for the\nrule of law be accompanied by a similar call for respect\nfor international law, the sovereignty of States and the\nrights of peoples? Can good governance and\nadministration be achieved in the absence of a parallel\neffort for the development of human resources and the\ncapacity-building? Is it sufficient just to pay attention\nto the civil and political rights of people while ignoring\ntheir economic, social and cultural rights, foremost\namong which is the inalienable right to development?\nSeventh, the success of the development efforts\nof the peoples of the world at this stage depends on\ntheir efficient use of the tools of the new age,\nparticularly information technology. The technological\nrevolution has led to a widening of the gap between\nthose who have those tools and those who do not.\nNevertheless, information and knowledge technologies\nare of such a nature as to enable them to contribute to\nnarrowing the gaps between the countries of the world.\nThe attention Egypt pays to these global\nquestions does not take away from the attention it gives\nto regional issues that are extremely sensitive. Among\nthose questions, I would like to concentrate on the\nissues of peace in the Middle East and the situation in\nthe Sudan, which are of the utmost importance to Egypt\nand, without a doubt, to many in the Arab world,\nAfrica and the international community at large.\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict entails vital issues\nrelated to the lives of peoples and to the future of\nnations. Those include recognition of legitimate rights,\nsovereignty over national soil, the inalienable right to\nself-determination, the inadmissibility of the\nacquisition of territory by force and the right of all\nStates to live peacefully within secure borders. All\nthese issues are directly linked to international and\nregional peace and security.\nThe logic that must govern the peace process in\nthe Middle East should not stem from the assumption\nthat one is dealing with a permanent foe or opponent. It\nmust aim instead at turning past animosity into good-\nneighbourliness and normal relations among the\npeoples and the States of the region. What is at stake is\n21\n\nthe security of the region and the security and\nprosperity of future generations, and not short-term\npolitical considerations. We face a clear choice\nbetween either settling the issue in terms of real\nestate  in which one party demands metres, miles or\ntens of miles  thereby keeping alive the seeds of\ntension and conflict, or by seeking through clear\npolitical will to establish a just and lasting peace by\nwhich the rights of all parties are secured and their\nobligations are well defined through necessary\ninternational guarantees. The latter option must be\nbased on international law, something that applies to\nthe Israeli/Palestinian track and to the Syrian/Israeli\ntrack alike.\nThere is no doubt that the overwhelming majority\nof States, communities and individuals support the\nachievement of a just solution that does not favour one\nparty at the expense of the other. Most people would\nopt for peace and justice and would prefer to look\nahead to the future in a positive way. The\noverwhelming majority of the Palestinian and Israeli\npeople also want peace, a peace that is clear and clean\nand not partial, distorted or absent  something that,\nat the end of the day, would be more of a headache than\na concrete peace. In that regard, I would like to say that\nPresident Arafat and the Palestinian people face one of\ntwo choices: either no solution or a bad solution. This\nis a policy that will never garner support or\nappreciation or ever lead to a viable solution.\nAs to the so-called flexibility, which has been at\nthe forefront of commentary lately, it should mean only\nflexibility within the realm of international law and not\noutside it. If we are talking about flexibility on\nJerusalem, that cannot in any way mean accepting\nIsraeli sovereignty over Al-Haram al-Sharif. It could\ninstead mean arrangements for the new Palestinian\nState that would give it sovereignty over all its\nterritories while respecting the holy sites and\nguaranteeing their protection and free access to them.\nThat would assume that, as a full-fledged member of\nthe international community, the sovereign Palestinian\nState would be in charge.\nThe peace process is but a few miles away from\nthe finish line. We hope it will not take many long\nyears for Syria and Palestine to travel those few miles.\nWe also hope that the sponsors of the peace process\nwill be wise and able enough to propose honest\nsolutions to the parties in order to enable the honest\nbroker to lead the negotiations to a certain conclusion.\nAt this juncture, I would like to salute President\nClinton's enthusiasm and tireless efforts in steering the\npeace process during an eleventh-hour attempt to find a\nlasting solution during his Administration.\nIn order to achieve that objective it is essential to\nuphold one guiding principle that cannot be\ncircumvented, namely, full withdrawal from all Syrian\nand Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, in\nreturn for Israel's right to be integrated into the Middle\nEast as a partner with equal rights to security, peace\nand cooperation. That is the essence of resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and of the principle of land for\npeace. Lasting peace and security can be established\nonly on that basis. If Arab territories, or any part of\nthose territories, remain under occupation or if any\nquestion is settled in a manner inconsistent with the\nprinciples of fairness and justice, it would create a time\nbomb that could explode at any time. The desired peace\nand security cannot be fully realized without the\nestablishment of a full-fledged, independent Palestinian\nState.\nThe stability of peace and security in the Middle\nEast is tied to the need for serious consideration of the\nquestion of armaments in the Middle East. Permanently\ndefusing tensions calls for dealing with the problem of\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\ntheir delivery vehicles. This will also contribute\ndirectly to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Peace and stability in the Middle East will not\nbe complete or lasting without the establishment of a\ncomprehensive regional security system that ensures\ncontrol over the quantity and quality of armaments in\nthe region and establishes a zone free from weapons of\nmass destruction, in accordance with President\nMubarak's initiative, which enjoys global\nunderstanding and support.\nThe Sudan is a State of unique character in\nregional relations. It is at once a major component of\nthe Arab world and an integral part of the African\ncommunity. Its stability is also vital for the security\nand stability of the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea and the\nNile basin. The importance Egypt attaches to this\nbrotherly country therefore stems not only from the\nfact that it is Egypt's strategic twin, but because it is a\ncentral factor to the security of a vast and vitally\nimportant region.\nMany efforts have been made, and many\ninitiatives have been presented, to achieve peace in the\n22\n\nSudan, most of which were made in good faith.\nHowever, they all dealt with the situation from a single\nperspective, that of the southern Sudan against the\nnorth.\nConsequently, Egypt and Libya saw the need to\ncomplement those efforts with a comprehensive\nprogramme aimed at achieving broad national\nreconciliation encompassing all the factions and all the\nparties. The objective is to create a new Sudan, where\nstability and harmony prevail within a basic framework\nof unity and territorial integrity, equality among its\ncitizens, and consensual self-determination by all its\ncitizens and component parts. This will bring comfort\nand reassurance to the Sudanese people and to all its\nneighbours.\nThe Egyptian-Libyan initiative has gone a long\nway towards bringing the parties closer. The\ncoordination of this initiative with that of the Inter-\nGovernment Authority on Development (IGAD) is\npossible. Efforts will continue to ensure the convening\nof a conference on national reconciliation to achieve\npeace in that important country.\nThe achievement of peace in the Middle East, the\nHorn of Africa and in the continents of Asia and Africa\nas a whole is a necessary condition for world stability.\nThe situation in Afghanistan, Kashmir, the Caucasus,\nSri Lanka, the continued tragedy of Iraq, and the\nconflicts in Africa and their attendant social and\neconomic problems all give rise to serious concerns\nabout the new world order  about its credibility and\neffectiveness. We must act quickly in order to resolve\nthese problems in a context of international legitimacy\nand within the framework of the United Nations.\nFinally, amid all that, the United Nations stands\nas an expression of the will of the international\ncommunity. The purposes and principles of its Charter\nare a guiding beacon. Let this Millennium Summit and\nAssembly be a new turning point that will put us on the\nright path towards a world of greater security, justice\nand stability, a world that builds upon the achievements\nof the twentieth century and closes the chapter on its\ngrave errors."

        "file_text": "I should like to offer the\napologies of my Minister, who was to have made this\nstatement today. He has had to travel to Winnipeg,\nwhere the future of some of our abducted children will\nbe discussed tomorrow.\nI bring to you, Mr. President, and all Member\nStates of the United Nations fraternal greetings and\nbest wishes for the new millennium from the\nGovernment and people of Uganda. I also bring to you,\nSir, and through you to the fifty-fifth session the\npersonal best wishes of the President of the Republic of\nUganda, His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.\nI should like, at the outset, Sir, to congratulate\nyou on your well-deserved and unanimous election to\npreside over this session of the General Assembly,\nwhich follows in the footsteps of the historic and\nhighly successful Millennium Summit. Your\npredecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, deserves our heartfelt thanks for successfully\npresiding over so many special and regular sessions\nduring his tenure as President of the General Assembly.\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay a very\nspecial tribute to our illustrious Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the exemplary work he has\ncontinued to perform on behalf of the Organization and\nthe peoples of the world. The Secretary-General\ndeserves special recognition by the United Nations\nfamily for his tireless efforts to address the numerous\nchallenges that face the United Nations at the dawn of\nthe new era.\nUganda warmly welcomes the admission of\nTuvalu as the 189th Member of the United Nations.\nFor Uganda, events in Africa, and in particular\ninstability in the Great Lakes region, continue to be of\nthe utmost concern. For this reason, I crave the\nAssembly's indulgence if I devote a portion of my\nstatement to those problems and challenges which\nconfront us in the Great Lakes region.\nAs the international community is fully aware,\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nposes a major threat to the stability of the Great Lakes\nregion and ultimately the entire African continent. That\nconflict has its origins in the massive violation of\nhuman and democratic rights of the people of the\nregion during the long reign of dictators in a number of\ncountries in the region. Evidence shows that when\npeople are oppressed, sooner or later they will rise and\n4\n\ntake up arms against their oppressors. This is precisely\nwhat we are witnessing in the Great Lakes region.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s a number of\ndictatorships were overthrown, in spite of their\ndetermined attempts to save their regimes by resorting\nto the most inhuman methods of clinging to power \u2014\nnamely, resort to genocide. This despicable weapon\nwas not only used in Rwanda in 1994, but has also\nbeen used to a lesser extent in Uganda, Burundi and the\nformer Zaire. The instability we are witnessing today is\nthus caused by the continuing struggle of the peoples\nof the region to proclaim their human and democratic\nrights.\nIn Uganda the people's struggle for fundamental\nchange ended in 1986, resulting in the establishment of\ndemocracy, stability and economic progress which the\npeople of Uganda have enjoyed over the past 14 years.\nUnfortunately, the instability and civil wars in\nneighbouring countries have continued to impact\nnegatively on our attempt to consolidate the results of\nour victory. This has especially been the case when\nremnants of followers of our former dictators have\nattempted to form alliances with dictatorial regimes in\nsome neighbouring countries to take advantage of the\npower vacuum there and establish bases from which to\nlaunch desperate, but ultimately futile, attacks on\nUganda.\nAs the Government of Uganda has stated before,\nat various times it cooperated with a number of\nprogressive forces in the region to help the people of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo free themselves\nfrom one of the longest and most oppressive\ndictatorships in the African continent \u2014 I refer to the\nMobutu dictatorship. In helping the people of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we were also\nhoping to free ourselves from the menace of\ndestabilization, which had become the official policy of\nthe Mobutu regime. That is why in 1997 Uganda found\nits troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nWhen a new regime came to power in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we signed a\nprotocol of cooperation under which Uganda and\nCongolese security forces would cooperate to contain\nthe menace caused by the armed groups organized by\nthe remnants of forces of Uganda's former dictators\nthat were operating from Congolese territory.\nUnfortunately, within a very short period, the new\nregime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo chose\nto turn its back on its former allies and form an alliance\nwith the very people who posed a threat to our security.\nNot only did this regime turn its back against its\nexternal allies, it also turned its back on its internal\nallies, thus provoking a fresh round of civil war in the\ncountry within a year. The result was that a number of\nAfrican countries that had been allies in the struggle\nagainst Mobutu now found themselves sucked into the\nconflict.\nFortunately, these countries soon saw the folly of\narmed confrontation and chose to end the conflict\nthrough negotiations. The result was the Lusaka\nCeasefire Agreement. This Agreement was a major\nbreakthrough in the attempt to establish genuine peace\nin the region because it addressed the problems of\nestablishing a democratic and accountable government\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and catering\nfor the legitimate security concerns of neighbouring\ncountries. The Agreement still offers the best hope of\nestablishing and maintaining peace in the region. For\nthis reason, Uganda has worked hard to have this\nAgreement implemented. On 8 April this year, Uganda\nhosted an important meeting of the Political Committee\nestablished under the Agreement. At that meeting, a\ndisengagement plan was adopted under which all the\nfighting forces in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo would disengage under the supervision of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission (MONUC).\nUnfortunately, it has not been possible to effect\nthe disengagement of forces in accordance with the\nstipulated calendar because one of the signatories,\nnamely, the Government of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, has done everything possible to block the\nimplementation of this disengagement plan, as well as\nseveral other aspects of the Lusaka Agreement. On 14\nAugust this year, an important summit of nine\ncountries in the region plus the leaders of all the rebel\ngroups fighting against the Government of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo took place in\nLusaka to identify the obstacles to implementation of\nthe Ceasefire Agreement. Their conclusion was that the\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nwas largely to blame for the current impasse. The\nprincipal ways in which the Congolese Government has\nprevented the implementation of the ceasefire are\nrefusal to participate in the national dialogue, rejection\nof a distinguished and eminent facilitator who was\nagreed upon as a result of wide consultations and by\nconsensus, restriction of the freedom of movement of\n5\n\nMONUC peace observers, refusal to cooperate with the\nJoint Military Commission and continued violations of\nthe ceasefire.\nThe leaders of the region have expressed their\nstrong concern at the obstructions created by the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to the\nimplementation of the Ceasefire Agreement. If the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo does not heed the\ncalls of regional leaders, there is a serious risk that the\nregion could become embroiled in another large-scale\nwar. We therefore appeal to the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo Government to reconsider its position and\nchoose the path of dialogue, with both its internal and\nexternal opponents, and to abandon the path of military\nconfrontation.\nUganda wishes to reaffirm its full commitment to\nthe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which offers the best\nopportunity for bringing this conflict to an end. Uganda\npledges its full support for all efforts aimed at ending\nthe conflict and appeals to the international community\nto give moral and material backing to the Lusaka peace\nprocess.\nUganda believes that the problems of Burundi are\nessentially political and internal. As Chairman of the\nregional peace initiative on Burundi, President\nMuseveni of Uganda has worked tirelessly in seeking a\nsolution to the problem. In this capacity, he has\nconvened and chaired many regional summits. We\nbelieve that a formula that creates democracy with\nsecurity for all the people of Burundi is possible.\nWe wish to place on record our appreciation to\nthe facilitator of the Burundi peace process, former\nPresident Nelson Mandela, and his predecessor, the late\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere, for their untiring efforts in\nworking towards a peaceful solution to the Burundi\nproblem.\nUganda welcomes the agreement signed on 28\nAugust in Arusha by the parties to the Burundi peace\nprocess. We regret, however, that a few of the parties\ndid not sign the agreement. Uganda would like to\nappeal to them to sign the agreement as soon as\npossible for the sake of the future of the people of\nBurundi and the Great Lakes region. We call upon the\nUnited Nations and the international community to\nprovide the necessary support and resources to enable\nthe agreement to be successfully implemented.\nUganda is committed to the goal of general and\ncomplete disarmament endorsed by the United Nations\nat the first special session on disarmament, way back in\n1978. It is against this background that we note with\nconcern the failure of the Disarmament Commission to\nreach an agreement on the convening of the fourth\nspecial session devoted to disarmament. The holding of\nthat conference is critical for addressing important\nissues related to disarmament. It is a matter of deep\nregret that the Conference on Disarmament has failed\nto agree on an agenda for two years in a row.\nUganda also attaches great importance to the\nOttawa Convention on anti-personnel land mines. We\nsupported the resolution on illicit trafficking in small\narms last year because the proliferation and use of\nsmall arms and light weapons remains a major problem\nin our region. Uganda actively participated in regional\ninitiatives on this matter, which resulted in the\nadoption of the Nairobi Declaration. We look forward\nto the international conference on the problem of small\narms in all its aspects, scheduled to take place in July\n2001.\nThe world has entered the twenty-first century\nwith globalization as the most pervasive economic\nforce to reckon with. Regrettably, the expected benefits\naccruing from the process are not guaranteed for all\ncountries. For some, it has opened opportunities for\nrapid growth and development through increased trade\nand advances in technology. For others, the process has\nled to increasing income disparity and marginalization\nin the global economy. The biggest challenge facing us\nat the dawn of this century, therefore, is to muster the\nnecessary political will to act together and create an\nenabling environment for the successful integration of\nthe poorer countries into the global economy. Uganda\nis of the view that the issue of globalization can and\nshould be seriously addressed multilaterally by the\nUnited Nations and by other international\norganizations. We are confident that with the\ncommitment and goodwill of the major trading nations,\nthe establishment of a rule-based multilateral trading\nsystem that has been institutionalized in the World\nTrade Organization will facilitate the integration of\ndeveloping countries into the global trading system.\nThe challenge of ridding the world of the scourge\nof abject poverty deserves more attention now than\never before because, as more of the world's population\nis now enjoying better living standards, the situation of\nmany others in the developing countries, especially the\n6\n\nleast developed countries, is deteriorating rapidly and\ndangerously. A larger percentage of the world's\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day today than\ndid a decade ago. The Secretary-General's report\nreveals that people living in sub-Saharan Africa are\nalmost as poor today as they were 20 years ago. This is\nan extremely sad commentary on the state of\ndevelopment cooperation. Urgent measures should be\nundertaken to arrest this deterioration of the living\nconditions of the people in the developing countries.\nIn Uganda we believe that significant reductions\nin poverty can be achieved through sustained and\nbroad-based income growth. We further believe that\nthis can be effectively done through modernization of\nthe agricultural sector, which dominates the economy\nand employs the majority of our population. That is\nwhy in the past two years we have been working to\ndevelop a comprehensive set of policies for the\nmodernization of agriculture, as part of the\nGovernment's broader strategy for poverty eradication.\nUganda welcomes and fully endorses the Secretary-\nGeneral's recommendations on specific actions that\nneed to be taken both nationally and at the international\nlevel to reduce the number of people living in extreme\npoverty.\nThe past decade has witnessed an unabated\ndeterioration in the socio-economic conditions of the\nleast developed countries. A quick review of progress\nin the implementation of the Programme of Action for\nthe Least Developed Countries for the 1990s will show\nthat there have been more setbacks than progress.\nWhile the least developed countries have undertaken\nfar-reaching and sometimes painful measures of\nadjustment and reform, the actions by the international\ncommunity have fallen short of their commitments to\nprovide adequate external support to complement their\nefforts. As a result, the least developed countries\ncontinue to suffer from the lack of supportive external\nresources for development, owing to a steady decline in\nthe flow of official development assistance.\nWhile it is true that foreign direct investment\nflows have increased significantly in the past decade,\nthe least developed countries are not yet equipped to\nattract such investment to a significant extent. High\nlevels of external debt have negatively affected their\neconomies, and despite decades of liberalization most\nindustrialized countries still maintain protectionist\nmeasures in their markets, especially for agricultural\nproducts and textiles \u2014 the two sectors in which\ndeveloping countries have a recognized comparative\nadvantage. All these factors have had the combined\neffect of stunting further the economic and social\nprospects of the least developed countries.\nIn this regard, Uganda strongly supports the\nSecretary-General in urging the industrialized countries\nto consider granting duty-free and quota-free access to\nexports from the least developed countries, as a\ndemonstration of their commitment to the integration\nof the least developed countries into the global trading\nsystem. My delegation also urges the General\nAssembly to adopt the recommendations of the tenth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment contained in the Bangkok Consensus and\nPlan of Action for least developed countries. We call\nupon the leading industrialized countries to live up to\ntheir commitments in the context of the agreement they\nreached in 1999 at the Cologne G-8 Summit. We also\ncall for stronger support for relevant United Nations\nbodies such as the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD) to enable effective\nimplementation of their mandates to assist the least\ndeveloped countries.\nWith specific reference to the African continent,\nwhere 33 of the 48 least developed countries are found,\nthe socio-economic situation is much more precarious\ndespite many efforts by many African countries\nindividually and collectively to lay solid foundations\nfor development. The difficulty in achieving positive\nresults in Africa's development has been further\ncomplicated by the severity of Africa's AIDS crisis.\nWe call upon the international community to lend\nsupport to Africa's own efforts to realize the objective\nof the African renaissance, which aims to place the\ncontinent at the forefront of human development and\nprogress. The international community should support\nthe efforts of African countries by fulfilling\ncommitments made in the context of the United\nNations New Agenda for Development of Africa in the\n1990s. These commitments include the reduction of\nAfrican debt, adequate resource flows, provision of\ngreater market access and assistance in diversification\nand capacity-building. In this connection, Uganda\nsupports the proposals made by the Secretary-General\nin his report to this session.\nI reiterate Uganda's commitment to uphold the\nvalues and principles enshrined in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. I pledge our\n7\n\nGovernment's continued adherence to international\nhuman rights Conventions and norms.\nIn pursuit of an international human rights\nregime, it is imperative that we establish effective\ninstitutions and mechanisms for this purpose. Uganda\nwill continue to support and work towards the\nestablishment of a strong International Criminal Court.\nOf particular concern to us is the deterrence and\npunishment of the crime of genocide, which remains a\ncontinuing threat in our region.\nAt the national level, in a bid to implement the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution,\nUgandans voted on 29 June 2000 in a referendum for a\npolitical system of their choice. I take this opportunity\nto thank the international community for its support for\nthe success of the referendum exercise. I am happy to\nreport that the referendum was declared free and fair\nby both local and international observers. This\nexperience convinces us that the referendum proposed\nfor Western Sahara should be conducted as soon as\npossible. It offers the best alternative to the possibility\nof continued armed conflict.\nIn our struggle to end internal conflict,\nParliament enacted the Amnesty Act 2000. Under that\nAct, an Amnesty Commission has now been\nestablished and is operational. The mandate of the\nCommission is to monitor programmes of\ndemobilization, reintegration and resettlement of\nreturnees, coordinate a programme of sensitization of\nthe general public on the amnesty law, consider and\npromote appropriate reconciliation mechanisms in the\naffected areas and promote dialogue and reconciliation\nin the spirit of the Amnesty Act. There is a programme\nof reintegration into society, which involves acquisition\nof skills and a fund to promote self-employment. It is\nour hope that this process will bring to an end internal\nconflict and all human rights violations associated with\nconflict situations.\nIn closing, Uganda believes that as we enter the\nnew century the United Nations should be reformed,\nequipped and provided with the necessary resources to\nimplement effectively and efficiently the mandates the\nGeneral Assembly and other principal organs of the\nOrganization have entrusted to it. In this connection,\nUganda hopes that the long-drawn-out negotiations on\nthe reform of the Security Council will be finalized at\nthe current session of the General Assembly. We are\ncommitted to the position of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) on this matter, and would support Japan and\nGermany as permanent members of an expanded\nSecurity Council, as well as one permanent member\neach from Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\nthis fifth-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am\nconfident that your well-known experience in the fields\nof politics and diplomacy will ensure the success of our\nwork.\nTo your predecessor, Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nI would like to convey my delegation's appreciation of\nhis dynamic and successful leadership of the fifty-\nfourth session.\nI would like also to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the remarkable\ncontribution made by his report, We the peoples,\nwhich provides a solid foundation for our discussions\nand for our common efforts to place this Organization\nincreasingly in the service of our community of\nnations.\nIt is with satisfaction that I extend my warmest\ncongratulations to Tuvalu, a member of the community\nof small island developing States, on its admission to\nthe United Nations.\nDuring the current session of the General\nAssembly, important meetings will take place that will\naddress issues vital to the international community.\nThese issues include financing for development; racism\nand racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\nintolerance; and the development of the least developed\ncountries. These global meetings will certainly\nsignificantly enrich the set of consensus documents\nwhich we have successfully produced, particularly\nduring the 1990s, and which are intended to provide us\nwith essential frameworks for the optimization of an\nupdated international cooperation.\nAs is well known, this resource has not been\nexploited to any great extent. North-South dialogue\ncontinues to be affected by reciprocal accusations\nbetween worlds separated by gross disparities in the\nlevel of well-being.\nThe world needs to be governed well and in a\nspirit of cooperation if we really wish to achieve\ndevelopment, justice and peace in a climate of social\nstability.\nAnd yet, on both the national and international\nlevels, the privileged continue to deny others open\nparticipation and a fair share. Thus, the question of\ngovernance arises at all levels. But at each level, those\nin whose interest it is to maintain the status quo use the\nother level's deficiencies to justify their own inaction.\nIt is a perverse logic to think that our partners' errors\nauthorize us to err as well. This is a pattern of\nbehaviour, and even an assertion, which has been\nportrayed as reflecting a reality of life; how this is to\nbe overcome has yet to be clarified.\nIt will be some time before we see even the\nimmediate results of that great dialogue between world\nleaders, the Millennium Summit. However, we are\nconfident that results will not fail to emerge. At the\n24\n\nhighest level, the meetings between international\nleaders served as a platform for the growing, insistent\naffirmation that we have the know-how and the means\nto solve the problems of our societies and of the\ncommon ground on which we live. What we lack is the\nappropriate implementation of decisions and the\nnecessary will to do so. By this, I mean the political\nwill to accomplish collectively what is necessary and\nsufficient so that we may achieve progress for all\nhumankind, a long-time goal of our ideology and our\ndiscourse.\nAwareness of the need for this political will stem\nfrom the underlying belief that we make up, and are\npart of, an interdependent international community\nwhose essence links the destinies of all to the success\nor failure of a single endeavour.\nMeanwhile, in the blend of competition and\ncooperation that characterizes international relations,\nthe scale is still weighted in favour of a framework of\ninequalities, asymmetries and egotism that increasingly\nimpairs our capacities and our imagination in the effort\nto achieve general progress and well-being.\nThus, a vital question is that of the extent to\nwhich we will see, at the international level, and\nparticularly in the case of those who benefit most from\nthe current situation, a growing belief in the existence\nof true independence and in the urgency of the need for\ncoordination and cooperation commensurate with such\nglobal interdependence.\nAt the same time, we need to view globalization\nnot as it is today  exclusive, fragmented and offering\nopportunities only to a select few  but rather as a\nprocess that will increasingly reveal and establish the\nworld as a single body.\nThe Millennium Summit once again posed the\nquestion of the role of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century. I believe that our universal\nOrganization has an essential role to play as a catalyst\nfor the tangible realization of the concept of\ninternational community inscribed within its Charter\nand as a basis for its political vision. In the world of\ntoday and tomorrow, where events are the result of\naction by a variety of decision makers, the promotion\nof such an endeavour by the United Nations\npresupposes the involvement of all parties\nconcerned  that is, Governments, of course, but also\nparliaments, the general public, organizations of civil\nsociety, the private sector, the media, and so forth. All\nof them can and should be included in this undertaking,\nthe purpose of which is to reveal the convergence\ntranscending the apparent contradictions.\nAs a free, universal association of States, the\nUnited Nations has as its mission, and should make\nitself able, to gather the world's voices and to give\nthem room for dialogue in pursuit of higher platforms\nof understanding. In that regard, the fundamental\nvalues embodied in the Millennium Declaration\nprovide a lasting source of inspiration.\nIn the short term, however, we need a consistent\nset of measures in order to create an enabling\nenvironment for development in which poverty\neradication can be sustainably achieved. The priorities\nto be considered in developing such measures will vary\nto some extent. In the areas of greatest poverty, such as\nthe African continent, it is certainly essential to reverse\nthe decline in public health and to devote the necessary\nresources to improving the quality and expanding the\nscope of public education. In today's world, there can\nbe no development unless the people have reached a\nminimum level of health and education, and unless the\ncountry in question has reached a reasonable level of\ninfrastructure, without which it cannot viably accept\nthe economic investment that it needs.\nFurthermore, countless developing countries\ncontinue to hope for lasting solutions to the core\nproblem of an unsustainable debt burden, solutions to\nreplace the long string of half-measures, always too\nlittle and too late, with which this issue has been\naddressed in the past.\nEven with adequate economic policies, a\nresponsible administration and a productive society,\nStates' capacity to make real, continued progress will\nbe significantly limited if they face restricted access to\ninternational markets and if tariff and non-tariff\nbarriers are imposed on them. Particularly in the case\nof the least developed countries, these constraints may\nmake it impossible for them to integrate into the global\neconomy.\nBefore closing, I wish to express my deepest\nconcern at the form and intensity of the conflicts that\ncontinue to affect the daily lives of various countries\nand their peoples, with disastrous consequences at the\ninternal and regional levels. In that regard, it is with\nthe greatest apprehension that we view the current\nsituation in Sierra Leone, a country of our subregion;\nand we hope that the recently developed measures\n25\n\ninvolving the coordination of efforts by the United\nNations and the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) will help restore to the people of\nSierra Leone the peace and stability to which they are\nentitled.\nCape Verde continues to follow closely the\nsituation in Angola, a country with which we share a\nlong history. Owing to the refusal of UNITA to respect\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and to comply\nwith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the\nhumanitarian drama that affects the Angolan people\nand, in particular, the massive numbers of refugees and\ndisplaced persons, has reached intolerable levels. The\ninternational community should therefore give the\nhighest priority to providing humanitarian assistance to\nAngola.\nIn East Timor, the laudable efforts of the United\nNations augur well for the exercise of direct\nsovereignty and self-determination in the near future.\nHowever, there are signs of continued efforts to disrupt\nthis process. The recent murder of international civil\nservants serving as peacekeepers merits the deepest\ncondemnation of the international community and\nadequate measures by the Security Council.\nThe role of the United Nations, increasingly\nfocused on the value and dignity of human beings,\nrequires each of us -- large and small, rich and poor --\nto wager confidently on the solidarity of our common\nefforts as the touchstone in our collective search for\nsolutions to the problems affecting our planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring you greetings from the\npeople of the Fiji Islands.\nOn their behalf, I also convey our warm\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, along with the\npledge of my delegation to support you and to closely\ncooperate with you in ensuring the success of this\nsession.\nTo the Secretary-General, I would like to express\nthe sincere gratitude of the people of Fiji for all that the\nUnited Nations family is doing every day, in every part\nof the globe, to bring relief to those in need, and to\npromote peace, security and development.\nI would like to take this opportunity to warmly\nwelcome our neighbour and close friend, Tuvalu, as the\nnewest Member of the United Nations. Fiji is very\nproud to see the flag of this very important Pacific\nisland country taking its place alongside the other 188\nMembers of the United Nations. We look forward to\nthe admission in the future of more Pacific island\nStates.\nI address the Assembly today on behalf of the\nInterim Administration in Fiji, which I have been\nentrusted by our President to lead.\nIn the wake of the coup d'\u00c8tat in my country on\n19 May this year, and the political crisis it triggered,\nmy Interim Administration has two very important\ntasks to undertake within the two-year time frame we\nhave set for ourselves.\nFirst, it is to return Fiji to constitutional\ndemocracy and, secondly, it is to stabilize our economy\nand to lay the foundation for a return to sustained\ngrowth and expansion with increased investment.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all\nthose Governments who have shown sympathy and\nunderstanding, who recognize the complexities of the\nsituation in Fiji as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural\nsociety, and who readily accept that solutions to the\npresent political crisis can be developed within Fiji, by\nthe people of Fiji themselves, without external\ninterference in any form.\nWith the end of the cold war and of the dual\ndivision it created in world order, it would seem that a\n2\n\nnew form of imperialism has emerged along with its\ntwin-brother, neo-colonialism. As if the corrosive\ninfluence and impact of their mass culture of\nconsumerism and materialism are not enough, this new\nform of domination is being propagated by the purists\nof the liberal democracies, in the name of good\ngovernance, human rights, accountability and\ntransparency. In themselves, these are important\ngeneral standards to ensure the integrity of the system\nof Government in a country, and the just and fair\ntreatment of its citizens. But what is of concern is that\nwe are being told to apply these standards and values\nof liberal democracy strictly according to their\nstandards, without regard for the particular or complex\ncircumstances in each country.\nOur concern is that some of the fundamental\nprinciples upon which this unique world Organization\nwas founded 55 years ago are being eroded and\nviolated  the principles of respect for national\nsovereignty and of non-interference in the internal\naffairs of an independent State.\nWe appreciate that we now live in a closely inter-\nlinked global community, and we are all part of one\nhumankind; we are children of one divine Creator. We\nmust, therefore, be concerned about each other, about\nour common well being, and common basic standards\nof rights and freedoms.\nThis, however, does not give a country the right\nto impose on another, its standards of democratic\ngovernance and what it perceives or considers to be\nright and acceptable.\nIf, within each of our countries, we believe and\naccept that civilized behaviour among the citizenry can\nonly be one based on mutual respect, mutual\nunderstanding, and a willingness to assist and support\neach other, why is it that some countries today should\nthink that these rules of civilized and respectful\nbehaviour within a country, should not apply in their\ndealings with other members of the international\ncommunity of nations.\nI have raised this point not only because we here\nat the United Nations should be ever watchful of this\ndisturbing negative trend, but also to remind my own\ncountry's friends and neighbours that stridency of\npolitical rhetoric, smart sanctions and threats of more\nsanctions will not really assist us in bringing about a\nspeedy and amicable resolution to our political\nsituation. In fact, the very opposite is true; they have\nonly served to harden attitudes of one community\nagainst the other. I, therefore, make a plea to Members\nof the United Nations to show greater understanding of,\nand sensitivity to, the complexities of the situation in\nFiji.\nWe are a country of many communities and many\ncultures. All have contributed to Fiji's development.\nWe have all accepted each other as citizens and as\ncommunities, and Fiji is our common and permanent\nhome.\nBut we also have peculiar features, which bear\ndirectly on inter-communal relationships within our\nsociety.\nWe have a total population of around 800,000.\nIndigenous Fijians and Rotumans make up 52 per cent\nand are growing at 1.8 per cent every year. The second\nmajor ethnic group is our Indian community. They\nmake up 43 per cent of the population, but with a low\nbirth rate and emigration, this is continuing to decrease\nat 0.3 per cent each year. The other communities in Fiji\nare Europeans, Chinese and Pacific Islanders.\nEthnicity is only one basis of distinction and\ndifference in Fiji. Then there is land ownership. The\nindigenous Fijians and Rotumans own, by custom, 84\nper cent of all land in Fiji. Much of the best of this,\nhowever, is on lease for various purposes, residential,\ncommercial and agricultural, and more than 60 per cent\nof the tenants are members of our Indian community.\nMost of the agricultural leases are sugar cane farming\nleases, and more than 75 per cent of these are held by\nIndian tenants, and most of these tenants have lived on\ntheir leased land for three generations.\nIn our urban areas, the situation is the reverse.\nThe majority of property owners, of businesses, of\nthose in the professions, of those working for a regular\nincome, are non-Fijians and mostly Indians.\nIn religion, more than 57 per cent of the\npopulation, the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans, and\nthe other minority communities, are mostly Christians.\nOn the other hand, the remaining 43 per cent, the\nmembers of the Indian community mostly belong to the\nHindu, Muslim and other faiths.\nThen there are our culture and value systems.\nIndigenous Fijians and Rotumans have a hierarchical\nsocial structure. Traditional hereditary chiefs and\ncommoners alike have their place and role in society\nand are bound together by reciprocal obligations of\n3\n\nloyalty, obedience, and of sharing with, and caring for,\neach other and everyone in the community. Fijians\nvalue their democratic rights as individuals, but as a\ncommunity they know their place in their traditional\nsociety.\nIn our Indian and other communities people are\nmuch more individually based. There is, therefore, a\ngreater consciousness of and emphasis on individual\nrights and freedoms  the right to equality, the\nimportance of education, success in professional life\nand the security of property rights.\nWe all live together side by side in Fiji, yet we\nremain apart, separated by our ethnicity, religion,\ncultural differences and value systems. We\ncommunicate with each other, not through the\nlanguages of our communities, but through the English\nlanguage. With regard to our general standards of\nliving, even though indigenous Fijians and Rotumans\nown 84 per cent of the land in Fiji, they have, on\naverage, the lowest level of household income, and\nthey also lag well behind the other communities in\nalmost every aspect of life in a rapidly expanding\nmarket-based economy.\nI have explained all this to highlight the delicate\nand sensitive nature of our multi-ethnic and\nmulticultural society in Fiji. The crux of our political\ncrisis in Fiji is that the indigenous Fijian and Rotuman\ncommunities felt threatened by certain policies which\nthe non-indigenous leadership of the People's Coalition\nGovernment had implemented following their decisive\nvictory in our national elections in May 1999. It was\nthis fear and anxiety about their future as the world's\nonly indigenous Fijian and Rotuman community of just\nover 420,000 people that led to mass demonstrations\nand ultimately the coup d'\u00c8tat on 19 May this year. It\nalso manifested itself in the mass looting of shops, the\ndestruction of property and threats to people and their\nfamilies. Unfortunately, and tragically, the victims\nwere mainly members of our Indian community.\nIt was in this serious and deteriorating law and\norder situation that the Fiji military forces responded to\na request from our police to take direct control of law\nand order and the protection of citizens. To facilitate\nthis, on 29 May the Fiji military forces abrogated our\n1997 Constitution.\nHowever, as the civilian interim Administration,\nwe have ourselves taken over from the army, and, as I\nhave said, we are firmly committed to returning Fiji to\nconstitutional parliamentary democracy. We intend to\npromulgate a new constitution in August next year.\nGeneral elections will then follow within 12 months.\nThe new constitution is to be prepared by a constitution\ncommission, which we shall appoint early next month.\nIt will be representative of all our communities and\nwill consult widely throughout the country, giving the\npublic at large every opportunity to submit their advice\nand recommendations on the new constitution.\nI should also mention a new initiative I have\ntaken to deal with the inter-ethnic crisis in Fiji: the\nestablishment of a Ministry of National Reconciliation\nand Unity, together with a Council for National\nReconciliation and Unity. It is my sincere hope that the\nCouncil will bring together the representatives of the\nvarious communities in our rich, multicultural society,\nas well as representatives of the various sections of the\nwider community, including employers, trade unions\nand civil society, to discuss and make\nrecommendations on various ways by which we can\npromote greater intercommunal understanding and\ncooperation.\nWhat we have realized is that it is not enough\nsimply to focus attention on the constitution as the\nframework for our different communities in Fiji to live\ntogether peacefully and harmoniously. We need to do\nmore. We have to build and reinforce foundations for\nliving together in all aspects of our lives in our multi-\nethnic and multicultural society. We are making good\nprogress in education, and proposals are now under\nconsideration to broaden the curriculum in schools to\ninclude compulsory study of the Fijian language, Fijian\nculture and the ethno-history and ethno-geography of\nFiji. We also need to encourage and promote more\nsocial interaction and cohesion at the neighbourhood\nand community level. Most important, it is my sincere\nhope that the Council for National Reconciliation and\nUnity will develop a consensus on national leadership\nand power-sharing in Fiji. I believe sincerely that the\nmost enduring foundation for unity in Fiji is one that is\nbuilt in a spirit of give and take, of justice and fairness\nfor all and of responsibility for one another.\nVery recently the United Nations launched a\nDecade, from January 1995 to December 2004, on the\ntheme, Indigenous people: a new partnership, which\nseeks the formation of new relationships, founded on\nmutual respect and understanding between indigenous\npeoples and States and the United Nations. In the\ncontext of Fiji, what we hope to build is a new\n4\n\npartnership between the indigenous Fijian and\nRotuman communities and the other communities, as\nthe basis of living together in our multi-ethnic and\nmulticultural society in the twenty-first century.\nI again assure the international community that\nwithin the two years of our transitional Administration\nwe shall return Fiji to constitutional democracy. A new\nconstitution will address the concerns of indigenous\nFijians and Rotumans about their future. At the same\ntime, however, it will also maintain and protect the\nequal fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens\nand groups, without distinction on the basis of\nethnicity, religion, culture, gender, or economic and\nsocial status.\nIndeed, as the interim Prime Minister in the\ntransitional Administration in Fiji, I am committed to\nbuilding a united Fiji with a multi-ethnic and\nmulticultural society in which all the different\ncommunities can live together in peace, harmony and\nprosperity, in which the aspirations of the Fijians and\nRotumans are realized and the paramountcy of their\ninterests is secure and in which the provision of\nimportant social services, such as education and health,\nto all our communities is a priority, so that the quality\nof life and standard of living of all our people are\ncontinuously improving.\nFiji commends and supports the Brahimi report\n(A/55/305) on peacekeeping. It is a timely and\nthoughtful report which, if implemented, will\nconsiderably enhance the ability of the United Nations\nto carry out its peacekeeping tasks. With regard to\nFiji's continuing participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping activities, I am pleased to confirm our\npositive response to the Secretary-General's request for\na further increase in our troops serving in the United\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon. In that connection, I\ncommend the efforts of all those involved in the\nMiddle East peace process. Fiji earnestly hopes that the\nnegotiations will be successful in resolving\nlongstanding differences and bring about long-term\npeace in the region.\nWe in Fiji have been greatly inspired by the\npositive developments on the Korean peninsula, with\nthe growing rapprochement between the South and the\nNorth. We express the hope that the same spirit of\ngoodwill and readiness to enter into dialogue will also\nspread to the great country of China, between the\nPeople's Republic of China and Taiwan. With regard to\nthe very important country of Japan, I reaffirm Fiji's\nsupport for Japan's admission as a permanent member\nof the Security Council.\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), We\nthe Peoples has inspired the entire United Nations\ncommunity with its vision of a more humane and more\nholistic future for our children and our world. We agree\nentirely that the United Nations should focus not just\non the relationship between and among States, but,\nincreasingly, on the well-being and development of the\npeoples of this world.\nOnce again, I extend my congratulations to you,\nMr. President, and best wishes for a successful\nMillennium Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At\nthe outset, I should like to congratulate the President\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of this\nMillennium Assembly. I also want to congratulate his\npredecessor for his invaluable contribution and his\noutstanding leadership during the fifty-fourth General\nAssembly. In the same vein, I should like to register\nmy delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General\nfor the excellent manner in which he is conducting the\naffairs of the Organization. Let me also take this\nopportunity to express our delight in welcoming the\nRepublic of Tuvalu as the newest member of the\nUnited Nations family.\nTanzania is gratified that the recently ended\nMillennium Summit addressed some of the most\npertinent issues and challenges facing the United\nNations and its Members in the new millennium. Those\nissues include development and poverty eradication;\nthe effects of globalization, including technological\ndisparities; conflict prevention, management and\nresolution; disarmament; and the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\nmalaria and tuberculosis. It was recognized that Africa\nand, particularly, the least developed countries suffer\nmost and hence demand urgent remedial action by the\ninternational community.\nPoverty remains one of the areas of great concern\nin Africa. The number of poor people in our region\nliving on less than one dollar a day is estimated to be\n300 million. That number represents more than\n40 per cent of Africa's total population. Indications are\nthat the number of poor people in the continent is\n8\n\nlikely to increase as Africa's output continues to drop.\nThere is therefore an urgent need for a comprehensive\nstrategy for Africa to address poverty eradication with\nall its ramifications. The strategy should include a\ncompendium of measures aimed at capacity-building in\nthe development process, including social services. The\nimplementation of such a far-reaching strategy for\npoverty eradication would very much depend on the\navailability of resources. Bearing in mind that in 2001\nthe United Nations will convene a High-level\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\nDevelopment, it is our hope that the issue of mobilizing\nresources for the development of Africa will be\nthoroughly addressed.\nOfficial development assistance continues to be\nparticularly critical in supporting development efforts\nin Africa and the least developed countries. It is sad to\nnote that flows of official development assistance have\nfallen to an all-time low of 0.2 per cent, far from the\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national\nproduct of developed countries. My delegation\ntherefore wishes to appeal to our development partners\nto reverse the trend of declining resources and increase\nthe level of official development assistance\ncontributions.\nMany African countries are undertaking painful\nreforms aimed at attracting foreign direct investment.\nHowever, foreign direct investment flows have been\nminimal. Investors should feel encouraged to invest in\nAfrica because the competitive rate of return on foreign\ndirect investment stands at between 24 per cent and\n30 per cent. That rate is higher than those of all\ndeveloped countries, which stand at between\n16 per cent and 18 per cent. We therefore call on\nGovernments and relevant international organizations\nto assist in sensitizing potential international investors\nto the possibility of directing their investments to\nAfrica.\nThe various debt relief initiatives pursued by the\ninternational community have been helpful, but not\nsufficient, in providing a meaningful solution to the\ndebt problem of the developing countries. In some of\nthose countries, external debt service constitutes a\nmajor drain on scarce resources, taking at least\n30 per cent of the national income. In that regard, we\nwelcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\nDebt Initiative to support some of the poor countries in\ntheir efforts to resolve the external debt problem. My\nGovernment appreciates being one of the countries\nwhich have attained eligibility under this scheme. We\ncall upon the institutions concerned to speed up the\nprocess towards our reaching the completion point so\nthat we can fully benefit from HIPC relief.\nCommenting on the HIPC Initiative, my\nPresident, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, has had this\nto say:\n\u201cTanzania welcomes the revisions made to\nthe HIPC Initiative. If implemented in full they\nwill provide additional debt relief, which in turn\nwill facilitate the war on poverty and will\ncontribute to sustainable growth and development\nif managed well. However, if growth is to be\nsustained, adequate levels of external funding\nmust complement our economic reform efforts.\nDebt relief under the HIPC Initiative should also\nnot be a substitute for increased bilateral non-\ndebt-creating aid, and neither should it be\nfinanced through reallocation of committed aid.\u201d\nEven acknowledging the importance of the HIPC\ninitiative, the burden of meeting debt service payments\nwould remain heavy even after debt relief for most of\nthe least developed countries. We therefore call upon\nthe donor community to increase HIPC debt relief and\nto consider additional relief measures, including debt\ncancellation, so that scarce resources will be released\nto cater for economic development and poverty\neradication programmes.\nThe development of the least developed countries\ndepends on improvement of their capacity to produce\ngoods and services. Improvement of terms of trade and\nmarket access for the goods of least developed\ncountries in the developed countries' markets would\nfurther contribute towards poverty eradication efforts.\nIn that regard, we call upon developed countries to\nprovide unhindered market access for goods from\ndeveloping countries, particularly from least developed\ncountries. In the same context, my delegation calls for\nspeedy implementation of the World Trade\nOrganization's Integrated Framework for Trade-related\nTechnical Assistance which will facilitate the\nintegration of least developed countries into the world\ntrading system.\nThe development process of developing countries\nvery much depends on access to technology and on the\nendogenous capacity to develop it. We are encouraged\nthat the Millennium Summit reiterated the need to\nassist developing countries to leapfrog into new\n9\n\ntechnologies in order to close the existing technology\ngap between developed and developing countries,\nespecially least developed countries. It is our sincere\nhope that the Millennium Declaration will be translated\ninto a concrete programme of action to assist\ndeveloping countries to develop the critical\ntechnologies, including information technologies,\nneeded for their development. We therefore call upon\nour development partners and all relevant international\ninstitutions to facilitate the transfer of technology,\nincluding environmentally sound technologies, on\nfavourable terms.\nMy delegation believes that South-South\ncooperation is an important means of realizing some of\nthe objectives of economic development. Tanzania\nfully supports the programme of action adopted last\nApril in Havana, Cuba, at the South Summit.\nTanzania recognizes and fully supports the role of\nwomen in the development process. Here, the\nGovernment has adopted a number of specific\nmeasures aimed at enhancing the participation of\nwomen in decision-making processes, and at bringing\nabout equal access to education and health, and access\nto credit on a preferential basis. In the area of\nrepresentation, for example, the Government has\nincreased the minimum quota of women\nparliamentarians from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The\nGovernment has also passed legislation that\ncriminalizes discriminatory activities against women.\nFurthermore, the Land Act was revised in 1999 to\nenable women to own land, the major means of\nproduction in Tanzania. Tanzania is firmly committed,\ntherefore, to implementing the Beijing Platform for\nAction. We therefore call on the international\ncommunity to support our efforts in this regard.\nSerious pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, malaria\nand tuberculosis are threatening the economic and\nsocial development of developing countries, especially\nAfrican and least developed countries. For example,\nthe scale of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has grown to\nalarming proportions in Africa. The Security Council\nhas recognized this menace as constituting a security\nthreat. Moreover, the Millennium Summit has\nunderscored the urgency of adopting effective action to\ncombat the scourge. Tanzania urges the international\ncommunity to assist developing countries in this\nendeavour, particularly in education and access to\naffordable treatment.\nDisarmament, peace and security continue to be\ncrucial to the aspirations of all humanity, and therefore\nthey constitute a critical challenge of the new\nmillennium. The existence of huge arsenals of nuclear\nweapons poses a major potential threat to world peace\nand security. These weapons continue to represent a\nthreat to the survival of mankind. Tanzania calls for the\ncomplete destruction and elimination of all nuclear\nweapons. The United Nations also needs to urgently\naddress the problem of small arms and light weapons,\nwhich fuel most of the ongoing conflicts in various\nregions of the world. In this context, we strongly\nsupport the convening of the 2001 United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects.\nThe Millennium Summit addressed extensively\nthe conflict situations existing in some countries,\nincluding those of Africa. The Summit reaffirmed the\nexistence of the intrinsic link between peace and\ndevelopment, which requires an integrated approach to\nconflict prevention, management and resolution. While\nsupporting United Nations peace efforts, we note with\nconcern that there has been a slow and an inadequate\nresponse to African conflicts from the United Nations.\nIn Angola, it is with apprehension that we bear\nwitness to the continuing hostilities and the grave\nhumanitarian situation brought about by Jonas Savimbi\nand his organization, UNITA; they have blatantly\nviolated the decisions of the Security Council\nregarding the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. It\nis disturbing that Mr. Savimbi has been able to sustain\nhis insurgency by violating the sanctions imposed\nagainst UNITA by the Security Council. We call upon\nthe international community to continue its support to\nthe Government of Angola.\nOn Burundi, my delegation is pleased to note that\nafter protracted negotiations between the parties\ninvolved in the Burundi conflict, the Burundi peace and\nreconciliation agreement was concluded in Arusha,\nTanzania on 28 August 2000. We welcome the\nagreement and commend the Facilitator, President\nNelson Mandela, for his role in reconciling the parties.\nWe also commend the regional leaders for their efforts\nin support of the Burundi peace process. Although a\nsmall number of parties to the conflict did not sign the\nagreement, efforts were made to ensure that all of them\nwould sign it. As I speak here, most of the parties have\nnow signed. It is our hope that the parties will abide by\nthe terms of the agreement and afford the people of\n10\n\nBurundi the opportunity to realize their aspirations for\npeace and development. We call upon the United\nNations and the international community to extend\nsupport to the agreement.\nAs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\nLusaka Agreement remains the basis for the resolution\nof the conflict in that country. It is unfortunate, though,\nthat there is an impasse in the implementation of the\nAgreement. One of the reasons for the existing\nsituation is the mistrust among the parties. The delay in\nthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has created a\nvacuum that has further contributed to the impasse.\nTanzania supports Security Council resolution 1234\n(1999). We also urge the Security Council to deploy the\npeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo as soon as possible.\nOn Somalia, we welcome the agreement reached\nin Djibouti on the formation of the Government of that\ncountry. In this regard, we congratulate the\nGovernment of Djibouti for its constructive role in the\nreconciliation process.\nConcerning Western Sahara, Tanzania reiterates\nits support for the right to self-determination of the\nSahrawi people and the effort of the United Nations to\norganize and supervise an impartial, free and fair\nreferendum, in accordance with the Settlement Plan for\nWestern Sahara and the relevant Security Council and\nother United Nations resolutions. We urge the United\nNations to conduct, as soon as possible, the referendum\non the basis of the preparations that have so far been\nmade. The lessons of East Timor should not be ignored.\nOn the Middle East, Tanzania continues to\nsupport the cause of the Palestinian people. In this\nregard, we welcome the ongoing peace process aimed\nat achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in\nthat volatile region.\nThere is a direct linkage between conflicts and\nthe incidence of refugees and internally displaced\npersons. In this respect, Tanzania finds itself in the\nvery difficult situation of hosting more than 800,000\nrefugees, most of whom are products of the crisis in the\nGreat Lakes region. This is a huge burden for a poor\ncountry like Tanzania. Besides, refugees pose many\nproblems relating to security and environmental\ndegradation. There is an urgent need for the\ninternational community to increase its support to the\nrefugees, as well as to the refugee-hosting countries. In\nthe same vein, we reiterate our call for international\nburden-sharing and responsibility in refugee situations.\nA definitive solution to the refugee situation evidently\nlies in resolving conflicts so as to enable the\nrepatriation of refugees to their countries of origin.\nOne of the pressing reform issues in the United\nNations is the reform of the Security Council. Among\nthe significant changes of our time is the liberalization\nand democratization of economic and political\nprocesses. The Security Council cannot persist in being\nan exception. Its composition and powers must bear a\nrelationship to the democratic ideals necessary for its\ncontinued relevance and legitimacy. It is our hope that\nthe Council membership will be expanded in both\ncategories and that such expansion should include both\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nFurthermore, Tanzania believes that the capacity\nof the United Nations to effectively carry out its\nmandate is contingent upon the willingness of all\nMember States to support it politically as well as\nfinancially. In this regard, we call upon the Member\nStates to provide it with adequate resources on a timely\nand predictable basis.\nTanzania also welcomes the many reform\nproposals and measures that have been introduced to\nimprove working methods, both at the Secretariat and\nat intergovernmental levels. For that effort to succeed,\nthere has to be consensus among Member States on the\nbest method to manage change in the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, allow me to observe that the\nMillennium Assembly, like the preceding Summit, is an\nact of partnership. We can only hope, therefore, that the\nrenewed enthusiasm and the recommitment to the\nCharter of the United Nations will galvanize our\nenergies and enable us to rise to and fulfil, the hopes\nand aspirations of the Organization and its peoples, as\nespoused in the Millennium Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your well deserved\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits first session of the millennium. Your proven skill\nand vast experience guarantee that you will ably guide\nthe work of this session. I wish also to express our\ngreat friendship for and gratitude to Finland, the\ncountry you so honourably represent, whose close\nfriendship with Nicaragua has earned our sincere\naffection. Let me also thank your predecessor,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the dedicated way in which\nhe guided our work at the fifty-fourth session.\nI wish next to express very special thanks for the\ncontribution made by the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who has prepared a\nvaluable report (A/54/2000) on the role of the\nOrganization in the twenty-first century; the report was\ncentral in stimulating the discussions conducted by our\nheads of State or Government at the Millennium\nSummit \u2014 an unprecedented event that laid the\ngroundwork for giving fresh momentum to the United\nNations.\nThe process of renewing the Organization\nrequires the strengthening of its organs and institutions\nso as to enhance the effectiveness of its endeavours in\nspheres such as the maintenance of international peace\n24\n\nand security, poverty eradication, the strengthening of\nhealth and education programmes and the struggle\nagainst the destruction of the environment. Without a\ndoubt, that depends on us, the States Members of the\nUnited Nations; we must guarantee the Organization the\nresources and other means it needs to fulfil its mandate\nand fully to play its role as a centre for exchange of\nviews and for coordinating the efforts of the world's\npeoples.\nIn that connection, let me reaffirm the need to\nreform the Security Council, an organ that is of vital\nimportance to peace and security. Such reform should\ninclude democratic, equitable geographical\nrepresentation and a better balance between developed\nand developing countries so that the Council will be\nable to respond fully and effectively to the present\nneeds of our peoples and to future challenges facing\nthem in the new millennium. Here, we see the veto as\nanother element of this sensitive issue that should be\naddressed seriously with a view to limiting its\napplication to very specific situations and to possibly\neliminating it. For those reasons, we believe it to be of\nparamount importance to reach consensus on all the\nissues that are inherent in the very structure of the new\ninternational order.\nWe wish also to stress the importance of speedily\nbeginning a process of international discussions aimed\nat attaining greater consensus and effectiveness in\nresolving humanitarian emergencies. In another vein,\nwe believe that we must reaffirm our commitment to\nmaintain and strengthen the universal mission of the\nUnited Nations to ensure that all the world's peoples\nwithout exception enjoy fair representation. This brings\nme to reaffirm before the Assembly how important it is\nto give consideration to the longing of one people to\nparticipate with legitimate representation as a full\nMember of the Organization: I refer here to the\nRepublic of China.\nAnother important matter that the Organization\nshould continue in the new century to address with\ngreater determination is the war against drug\ntrafficking, organized crime and terrorism. Indeed, the\nflow of drugs is rapidly increasing in our countries, and\nin but a few years has become one of the most serious\nof problems, one that directly affects our economic,\npolitical and social life. To address that critical\nsituation, we must give priority to strengthening the\nnational institutions that are mandated to combat this\nscourge, to enacting and updating national legislation,\nand to increasing international cooperation and\ncoordination in this sphere. Here, let me observe that\nNicaragua has strict laws to punish drug traffickers,\nand has established a national drug-control plan under\nwhich institutions work together in a coordinated\nmanner to attain the stated objectives. We are also\nworking constantly towards greater international\ncooperation.\nAt the outset of the new millennium, we see an\nurgent need to deepen and accelerate progress on ways\nand means to achieve world disarmament, especially\nwith respect to weapons whose great destructive\npowers actually threaten life on our planet. We\ntherefore welcomed the outcome of the 2000 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which reaffirmed the\nconviction that full and effective implementation of the\nTreaty and of the non-proliferation regime in all its\naspects plays a vital role in the promotion of\ninternational peace and security.\nSimilarly, we focus special attention on the\nproblem of conventional weapons and on the existence\nof anti-personnel landmines, which also pose a threat\nto human safety and security. We therefore believe it is\na priority to meet the obligations taken on by each\nState under international and regional conventions on\nthese subjects. In Nicaragua, one of the gravest\nconsequences of the armed conflict that was,\nfortunately, overcome in the 1990s is undoubtedly the\npresence of a vast number of anti-personnel landmines\nthroughout our territory, a situation that even today\nclaims numerous innocent victims. Accordingly, my\ncountry, with the support of the international\ncommunity, is making an enormous effort to resolve\nthe problem permanently. Along with mine-clearance\nactivities, we have begun the process of destroying\nmine stockpiles, and have thus far destroyed more than\n40,000 mines, in strict compliance with the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction. Nicaragua reaffirms its\ndetermination to spare no effort in the preparations for\nthe third meeting of States parties to the Ottawa\nConvention, to be held in Nicaragua in September\n2001.\nWe also believe it to be of the utmost importance\nto reaffirm our commitment to tolerance and respect for\ndiversity. In that connection, we support the\npreparatory work for the World Conference against\n25\n\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance.\nIt is essential for the future of the Organization\nand for that of our peoples that we make a greater\neffort always to comply with the purposes that half a\ncentury ago were laid down in the San Francisco\nCharter, especially with respect to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. This can happen only\nwith a firm commitment to non-violence and to the\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes through\nthe procedures established by international law. That is\nthe key element in preventing future conflicts with\ngrave and enduring consequences for mankind.\nFor us, it is a source of satisfaction that one of the\nlast vestiges of the cold war is on the way to a peaceful\nresolution. Here I refer to the dialogue between the two\nKoreas, which has been launched at the highest level\nand which will without doubt mark the beginning of\npromising prospects for the Korean peninsula.\nNicaragua also shares the concern of the\ninternational community at the persistence of certain\nconflicts, particularly on the African continent; these\nhave caused devastating damage to property and the\nloss of countless lives in countries such as Angola, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\nBurundi and the Sudan. It is therefore gratifying that in\nsome of those countries steps have been taken to find a\nsolution to their conflicts. These include the 18 June\nsigning of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement by\nEthiopia and Eritrea, and the implementation of the\nDjibouti peace initiative for Sierra Leone. We also hail\nIsrael's withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the stepped-up\nefforts, since the Camp David summit organized by\nPresident Clinton, to find a peaceful settlement\nbetween Israel and Palestine.\nIn the same vein, my country is convinced of the\nimportance of the principle of the self-determination of\npeoples; we note the urgent need to hold the pending\nreferendum in Western Sahara as soon as possible. To\nthat end, all obstacles to that process must be\novercome. Similarly, my country, convinced of the\nimportance of the principle of the self-determination of\npeoples, makes an appeal regarding the pressing need\nto hold, as soon as possible, the referendum pending on\nWestern Sahara. To that end, all obstacles to the\nprocess must be overcome.\nMuch progress has been made in this century.\nSome of the most important achievements have been in\nthe field of the technology revolution. Consequently\ntoday we have the great responsibility and duty to\nbegin this new millennium by pooling our efforts to\nachieve adequate levels of technology transfer to\ndeveloping countries in order to prevent globalization\nfrom becoming a negative phenomenon that\nexacerbates the marginalization of the poorest\ncountries.\nThe advantages and the disadvantages entailed by\nglobalization require the developing countries to work\ntogether in order to increase their opportunities to\nsuccessfully confront this phenomenon. An example of\nthis is the decision of the Presidents of Guatemala,\nNicaragua and El Salvador to sign a tri-national\nagreement aimed at giving fresh impetus to the Central\nAmerican integration process by providing an\nappropriate political framework for the establishment\nof a regional customs union, a process launched by El\nSalvador and Guatemala and which Nicaragua and\nHonduras have recently joined.\nApart from integration initiatives, continued\nefforts to achieve solidarity through cooperation for\ndevelopment are vitally important. Nonetheless, we\nfeel it must be emphasized that cooperation activities\nmust be accompanied by appropriate management that\noffers favourable conditions for small economies to\nhave access to large international markets, obtaining\nfair prices for their exports of raw materials and\nmanufactured goods. In this respect, we warmly\nwelcome the decision to convene the high-level\nintergovernmental event on financing for development\nin 2001. That event is of paramount importance to the\nefforts being made to achieve the objectives established\nby the Millennium Summit.\nThe strengthening of the multilateral trade system\nis also of great importance, which includes, among\nother things, the prompt and urgent convening of a\nround of trade negotiations within the framework of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in which problems\nare addressed in a comprehensive and integral manner,\nto lead to an effective reduction of tariff and non-tariff\nbarriers. Free trade and the rules governing it should be\nimplemented within the WTO framework so that they\nbenefit all, particularly the poor countries.\nIt is also essential that the most heavily indebted\npoor countries be able to aspire to break the vicious\n26\n\ncircle of poverty. In this regard, as stated by Mr.\nArnoldo Alem\u00e1n Lacayo, President of Nicaragua,\nduring the Millennium Summit,\n\u201cthe unbearable weight of an immense external\ndebt [represents] an insurmountable barrier to\novercoming poverty and unemployment. In this\nrespect, we are pleased to note the interest\nrecently shown by the developed countries and\nmultilateral financial institutions in seeking\nalternatives that would substantially relieve the\nsituation of the heavily indebted poor countries.\nWe hope that this interest will soon be reflected\nin specific and meaningful actions, so that\ncountries such as Nicaragua can break this\nvicious circle of poverty and look towards a\nfuture with greater opportunities and expectations\nfor sustainability and progress.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nAnother important challenge to which we must\ndevote great effort is the conservation of natural\nresources and the global environment; this is vitally\nimportant for the future of humanity, as well as for the\nprevention of and response to natural disasters.\nNicaragua has been cruelly punished by natural\nphenomena; the effects of hurricane Mitch, which\nlashed the Central American region in 1998, and of\nstrong telluric movement shook the eastern part of our\ncountry, causing loss of human life and considerable\nmaterial damage are still fresh. Given that reality,\nNicaragua, with the valuable assistance of the United\nNations Development Programme, became the third\nLatin American country to adopt a modern law to take\nthe necessary measures to establish an integrated\nsystem for disaster prevention and response. Moreover,\ndespite its limited resources, Nicaragua has channelled\ngreat energy into the search for a model of sustainable\ndevelopment and of conservation of its natural\nresources. In that regard, the Government of Nicaragua\nhas established the National Council on Sustainable\nDevelopment, a pluralistic body in which all the main\nsectors of civil society participate, in order to promote\nactively, in accordance with Agenda 21, the\nimplementation of this model of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nOur leaders have had the historic opportunity to\nundertake decisive commitments for the future of\nhumanity. Nicaragua fully shares and reaffirms its\ncommitment to the basic values contained in the\nMillennium Declaration: freedom and equality, so that\nwe may all live decently, without poverty or violence,\nbut rather in good health and with education; equity\nand solidarity, since all peoples of the world have the\nduty to share and to exchange knowledge and\nexperience that tomorrow will be decisive for human\ndevelopment; tolerance and non-violence, since we can\nforge ahead only if people respect each other and if\nStates are always prepared to understand each other\nand resolve their differences through peaceful means;\nand respect for nature, in order to be able to leave to\nour children a future in which they will feel proud and\noptimistic, in which they will walk with their heads\nhigh, confident that they are on the right path.\nToday is the time to sow, so that tomorrow we\nwill be able to harvest. Today is when we must be\naware that we have a shared responsibility, collective\nand individual, to strengthen the United Nations in\norder to be able to build a more just, secure and\nequitable international system for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would\nlike to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis session. I am confident that your vast experience\nand outstanding record of achievements will guarantee\nthe best results for this session. I wish you every\nsuccess in this crucial role. I would also like to extend\nmy thanks to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nRepublic of Namibia, for the productive way in which\nhe managed the affairs of the fifty-fourth session. I also\nwelcome Tuvalu as the new Member of our\nOrganization.\nGlobalization is definitely the most typical\nphenomenon of the upcoming turn of the millennium.\nIt is frequently criticized and at other times is accepted\nuncritically; however, it definitely brings\nunprecedented progress and, at the same time,\nproblems and challenges. The economic boom also has\nanother aspect in the form of large social differences.\nThe environment often suffers from the industrial\nboom. Due to new communication technologies, direct\nhuman contact is forgotten. I could continue in this\nvein.\nThe world community also has to face other\nproblems, which are beginning to display a\ntransregional nature \u2014 for instance, organized crime,\nterrorism and emerging armed conflicts. Who is better\nprepared to tackle all this than the United Nations \u2014\nthe most global institution we have.\nIn my view, the Millennium Summit was the most\nsignificant step on this very demanding road. It spelled\nprogress when compared with similar meetings in the\npast, as this time it dealt with the urgent problems of\ncivilization to a greater extent. Moreover, the\nMillennium Summit managed to draw the attention of\nthe whole world to problems which the United Nations\nconsiders to be of the greatest importance. However, to\nmake progress, a lot still remains to be done.\nTherefore, I will take the liberty of commencing my\ncontribution precisely with the topic of the reform of\nthe United Nations.\nThe report of the Secretary-General, \u201cWe the\nPeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century\u201d (A/54/2000) displays great promise in\nthis direction. The United Nations reform process must\ncontinue. The key point is the reform of the Security\nCouncil. The positions and the opinions of Member\nStates on the crucial issues of Security Council\nreform \u2014 the increase in the number of permanent and\nnon-permanent members and the issue of the veto\nright \u2014 unfortunately still vary greatly, making it very\ndifficult to achieve a substantive outcome in the near\nfuture. The results of the work the Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\n2\n\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\nSecurity Council for the past seven years are not\nencouraging. Despite this, Slovakia will support the\nrenewal of the Working Group's mandate for the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly. We consider\nnext year's session of the Working Group to be crucial\nfor the further advancement of the reform process\nwithin this forum.\nSlovakia has already presented its position\nregarding to the key issues of Security Council reform.\nWe support strengthening its representative character,\neffectiveness and transparency of the decision-making\nprocess and working methods.\nWith regard to the enlargement of the Council, we\nconsider the increase in the number of members in both\ncategories to be justified. However, in our view, the\nnumber of members in both categories does not have to\nnecessarily increase simultaneously. The failure to\nreach an agreement on one category should not prevent\nthe eventual conclusion of an agreement on the\nenlargement of the other. The total number of members\nshould not exceed 25, in order not to jeopardize the\nCouncil's effectiveness and flexibility in immediately\nreacting to crisis situations. The Group of Eastern\nEuropean States, whose membership has more than\ndoubled over the past years, should not be omitted\nfrom the enlargement of the Security Council.\nSince its founding, the United Nations, as the\nworld's universal organization, has under the Charter\nassumed primary responsibility for maintaining\ninternational peace and security. This concept\ncontinues to be fundamental to the United Nations and\nis reinforced every time an international development\nnecessitates a call to our community for rapid\npeacekeeping response.\nThe evolution in the nature of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations \u2014 from performing\ntraditional military functions to the greater need for\nmultidisciplinary approaches, including interim\nadministration and post-conflict peace-building \u2014\nalong with the significant expansion of regional and\ninternational conflicts worldwide and the growing\ndemand for the involvement of the United Nations in\ntheir prevention and settlement, puts the United\nNations potential in this vital area to a challenging test.\nThe need for peacekeeping has never been greater.\nHowever, such international assistance can be effective\nonly if it is based on peacekeeping operations well\nsuited to dealing with all the problems and the needs of\nthe situation to which it is deployed.\nTherefore, we welcome the report of the expert\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations, which we\nconsider to be an important step toward a meaningful\nreform of United Nations peacekeeping activities. The\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) presents a serious challenge\nto various actors involved in meeting the requirements\nof today's peacekeeping operations.\nOne should agree, and recent experience has\nconfirmed, that good intentions in deploying\npeacekeeping operations must be supported by clearly\ndefined and achievable mandates. Only an adequate\nmandate and appropriate resources, both human and\nfinancial, can bring success to and strengthen the\ncredibility of the United Nations in its peacekeeping\nefforts, and not cause more problems. It requires an\nappropriate and responsible approach by key players,\nincluding the Security Council, Member States and the\nUnited Nations Secretariat, in acting promptly on their\nown, as well as effective cooperation to give a rapid\nand decisive response to conflict situations.\nApart from the reform of the Security Council,\nqualitative improvements must be achieved in\nmodernizing and streamlining the responsible\ndepartmental units in the Secretariat to enhance their\nefficiency and the effectiveness of their output as much\nas possible. At the same time, Member States must\nsupport the ability of the Secretariat to carry out the\ntasks we ask it to do, since its ability to act depends on\nthe will of Member States to contribute troops and\nother assistance to potential peacekeeping operations.\nMember States should provide adequately\nprepared troops who are able to fulfil the tasks\nassigned. Simultaneously, peacekeeping operations\nshould, from the very beginning, be provided with\nadequate financial resources to support the wide array\nof mandates. It is therefore equally important to ensure\nthat the financial system providing the funding for\nUnited Nations peacekeeping is stable, equitable and\ntransparent and that there is a flexible mechanism in\nplace with the ability to stabilize finances for current\nand future peacekeeping operations. The revision of the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping scale of assessment over\nthe next few months will provide a genuine opportunity\nfor the General Assembly to take a critical look at the\ncurrent method of assessment and, with the emerging\n3\n\nconsensus of Member States, to take important steps to\nfind a viable solution to this pressing issue.\nI am pleased to announce today our strong\nsupport for revising the financial structure of\npeacekeeping and our readiness to meet our financial\ncommitment under a reformed peacekeeping scale.\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for his significant role in the process\nof United Nations reforms. We welcome his\ncommitment to implement the changes recommended\nin the Brahimi report for which he is responsible. We\nshould do our part and continue our personnel, material\nand financial support to United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions. Slovakia has traditionally been participating\nin peacekeeping operations and, as part of its latest\nactivities, is ready to send an engineering unit to the\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea\nauthorized by the Security Council last Friday.\nDue to the geopolitical position of Slovakia, we\nclosely follow the situation in the Balkans. We are\naware that problems can only be effectively addressed,\nand crises and tension in the region eliminated, when\nall the countries concerned are maximally involved;\nwhen they are willing to collaborate to search for\ncompromises, and are prepared to overlook historical\nfeuds with a view to developing relations in a\ncomplicated region, from both an ethnic and\nnationalistic perspective. We hope that the elections in\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be held in a\npeaceful atmosphere, and that neither of the parties will\nresort to violence. It is necessary that the elections\nabide by the rule of law, and that they be democratic,\nfree and fair. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve\nthe basic objective: the stabilization of the situation in\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the region as\na whole.\nIn the area of disarmament, we welcome the\nconsensus achieved at the sixth Review Conference of\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, which confirmed commitments to\nthe provisions of the Treaty and its strengthened review\nprocess. This positive impulse needs to be efficiently\nutilized in the process of further implementation of the\nTreaty.\nWe also welcome the ongoing preparatory\nprocess for the United Nations Conference on the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects in 2001. The outcome of the Conference\nshould provide us with clear strategies on how to cope\nwith the issue in its complexity.\nSlovakia fully supports respect for the norms of\ninternational law and the execution of international\ntreaties in good faith, in compliance with the principle\nof pacta sunt servanda. The harmonization of\ntraditional theories based on the principle of State\nsovereignty as the basic element of international law\nwith newly developing principles based on global\nrespect and guarantees of fundamental human rights\nand freedoms will be necessary for the future\ndevelopment of international law. New ideas and\nconcepts should be the subject of extensive discussion\nand negotiations between States, resulting in a\nconsensus in the international community, as was the\ncase 55 years ago, when the United Nations Charter\nwas adopted.\nSlovakia supports the early establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court. The results of the\nnegotiations of the Preparatory Commission for the\nInternational Criminal Court, especially the adoption of\nthe draft Rules of Procedures and Evidence and the\nElements of Crimes by consensus last June, are very\nencouraging.\nSlovakia equally supports the work of the United\nNations in the field of combating international\nterrorism. The adoption of the international Convention\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is the\nlatest fruit of the work in this field. Slovakia will sign\nthe Convention by the end of the year 2000.\nIn facing all the challenges of our era the United\nNations must prove its relevance. Slovakia is\nconvinced of the irreplaceable role of the United\nNations in a whole range of global issues, the solution\nof which is practically impossible by Member States\nalone, on an individual or group basis, or at a regional\nlevel. If we want the term globalization to have only\npositive connotations, the endeavour to tackle the\naccumulated problems must become a matter of the\nhighest interest to all of us. I believe that this\nAssembly will contribute to this endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the people and Government of Papua New\nGuinea, I join previous speakers in congratulating you,\nSir, on your election to your prestigious post. Your\nunanimous election as President of the General\nAssembly at the dawn of the new millennium shows\nthe high esteem in which the international community\nholds both you personally and your country, Finland.\nWe are confident that you will guide the historic fifty-\nfifth session to a successful conclusion.\nThe skill with which your predecessor, Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab of Namibia, cooperated to develop the\ntheme of the recent Millennium Summit, and presided\nover the drafting of the outcome document and ensured\nthe smooth management of the Summit earned our\nsincere appreciation for a job very well done. We also\ncongratulate him on his very positive contribution to\nour collective deliberations during the previous year.\nMay I also take this opportunity, through you, Sir,\nto heartily congratulate the heads of State of both\nFinland and Namibia on their magnanimous\nstewardship and successful conclusion of the recent\nunprecedented large assembly of approximately 150\nheads of State and Government in New York, which\npaved the way for the pursuit of our common vision\nand security into the twenty-first century.\nBeyond the millennium celebrations, this is a\ntime for reflection and looking ahead. The Millennium\nSummit took place on the eve of the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. The\nsame anniversary also marks the first quarter century of\nmy country's membership of the United Nations. It is\ntherefore an apt occasion both for reflecting on\nexperience and for looking ahead.\nMy particular focus is on the changing character\nof, need for and potential for international cooperation.\nThe conjunction of the millennium with Papua New\nGuinea's silver anniversary invites us to take a number\nof different time perspectives: the short, medium and\nlong terms. For those of us who have been privileged to\nplay an active part in public life during this period, it\nalso provides the opportunity to compare the ambitions\nwe had 25 years ago with the challenges we face now.\nAs the Secretary-General recently reminded us in\nthe very title of the document (A/54/2000) he prepared\nto guide and stimulate the Millennium Summit, the\nUnited Nations was formed in the name and with the\nobjective of furthering the common purposes of \u201cWe\nthe peoples of the United Nations\u201d. In similar fashion,\nthe Constitution that came into effect when my country\nbecame independent was made and adopted in the\nname of \u201cWe the people of Papua New Guinea\u201d.\n2\n\nAs someone who had the honour of participating\nin making the Papua New Guinea Constitution, I am\nvery mindful of the national goals and directive\nprinciples we set for ourselves at independence. While\nsome have a distinctively national character \u2014 such as\npreserving, developing and building on Papua New\nGuinean ways \u2014 others resemble challenges that the\nUnited Nations faces today. They include such\nuniversal challenges as promoting integral human\ndevelopment, equity and participation, and sustainable\nuse of natural resources and the environment. They\nalso include the challenge of maintaining,\nstrengthening and making mutually beneficial use of\nnational sovereignty and self-reliance.\nBut look at us now. What have we achieved?\nWhat remains to be done? The most striking feature of\ncontemporary Papua New Guinea is the way in which\nwe have had to trim our objectives. Our situation is,\nobviously, not unique, but it certainly warrants the\nmost careful consideration.\nWhen the present Government, led by the Prime\nMinister, The Honourable Sir Mekere Morauta, came to\noffice in the middle of last year, we set ourselves five\nvery carefully defined objectives: to restore integrity to\nState institutions; to stabilize our national currency \u2014\nthe kina \u2014 and the national budget; to remove\nobstacles to investment and growth; and to continue the\nprocess of working for lasting peace in Bougainville by\npeaceful means.\nThe national goals and directive principles\ncontinue to guide our long-term ambitions and plans.\nBut experience and the realities of governance in the\nage of globalization have required us to focus on much\nmore specific, short- and medium-term objectives. We\ncannot blame others \u2014 or even such largely impersonal\nprocesses as economic and technological\nglobalization \u2014 for every aspect of our current\nsituation. Much of the responsibility lies with leaders\nand institutions at home. Both fortunately and\nunfortunately, it is part of the human condition at the\nstart of the twenty-first century that we are not on our\nown. Despite important differences in origins,\nprocesses and outcomes, our situation is not unique.\nMany other developing countries face similar\nchallenges in the short and medium terms.\nInternational cooperation is an important key to\ncollective self-help, both between countries with\nsimilar weaknesses and strengths, and between\ncountries that are different and complementary \u2014\nespecially rich and poor.\nAs regards global cooperation, as a member of\nthe global community Papua New Guinea is able to\ndraw on support from the World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, our\ndevelopment cooperation partners in Europe, and the\nAsia-Pacific countries that have formed themselves\ninto the Friends of Papua New Guinea.\nWhile my delegation has come to New York to\ndiscuss global issues and explore the potential for\nglobal cooperation, Papua New Guinea also\nparticipates in various forms of regional, interregional\nand bilateral cooperation. Papua New Guinea\nrecognizes the value of, and is firmly committed to\nfurther strengthening, global cooperation through\nbodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nMy Government is disappointed that the next\nround of World Trade Organization (WTO)\nnegotiations has been delayed, and calls for them to be\nheld at the earliest possible opportunity.\nAs one of the countries where increasing areas of\nland are already becoming unusable or actually\ndisappearing as a result of rising sea-levels caused by\nclimate change, we believe in the urgent need for full\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\nOn an issue where the very survival of certain\nmembers of the global community is clearly at stake \u2014\nand where global security depends on coordinated\nglobal action \u2014 there must be no backsliding, no\ncompromises, and no special cases allowed because of\ninability or unwillingness to honour global agreements\nfor whatever reason.\nPapua New Guinea is pleased to welcome our\nclose island neighbours and very good friends from\nTuvalu to membership of the United Nations.\nWhat a terrible tragedy it would be if the\ninternational community were to fail them at the very\ntime when they, together with other small island\nStates \u2014 including countries which joined the United\nNations last year \u2014 are assuming the responsibilities\nwhich go with becoming full participants in the\nOrganization's affairs.\nCertain security issues, such as climate change,\nrequire a global approach. So do efforts to limit the\n3\n\nproliferation that would bring about the complete\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nGlobal cooperation is the only means by which\nthe international community can realistically hope to\nachieve the objective which the Secretary-General set\nfor the Millennium Summit of ensuring that\nglobalization becomes a positive force for people,\ninstead of leaving them behind in squalor, especially in\ndeveloping countries.\nHowever, as the Secretary-General also suggested\nin his report (A/54/1) to the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, different regions have different\nproblems. Even similar problems in different settings\nmay require different approaches. Security policies that\nwork in one region may not work in others. The road to\nsuccess can require complementary national, regional\nand global efforts.\nThus, Papua New Guinea is addressing the\nunwelcome spread of small arms and light weapons by\nimposing a complete ban on the issuance of new gun\nlicenses. We support efforts to deal with the spread of\nillegally obtained or held arms through the Pacific\nIslands Forum.\nWe look to the forthcoming United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects to provide a global\nframework and global support for the efforts that\nindividual States and regional organizations are taking\nto deal with the problem within their respective\njurisdictions.\nWhen it comes to the management of ocean\nresources, Papua New Guinea sees regional and\ninterregional cooperation as complementary to\nmeasures designed to ensure the sustainable harvesting\nof fish in national waters.\nWe therefore welcome the agreement recently\nconcluded under the auspices of the Multilateral High-\nlevel Conference on fisheries with the purpose of\nensuring sustainable fishing for tuna and highly\nmigratory species throughout their ranges in the\nWestern and Central Pacific.\nPapua New Guinea would also like to see both\nbroader and deeper cooperation between coastal States\nin other aspects of oceans and ocean-bed management,\nincluding deep-sea mining.\nIn terms of regional cooperation, such\ncooperation is indispensable to dealing successfully\nwith many important global and national issues. But\nregional cooperation can itself have a variety of\ndifferent dimensions and employ different means.\nIn the South Pacific, for example, two of our\nclosest neighbours, Fiji and Solomon Islands, are\nexperiencing internal difficulties that have given rise to\nserious concern on the part of their friends.\nWe do not condone the illegal overthrow of\ndemocratic and constitutional Governments or other\nthreats to the security of the Governments and citizens\nof other States, but, regrettably, and despite repeated\nefforts by previous Papua New Guinea Governments\nand other States, the main intra-regional body engaged\nin promoting regional cooperation in the South Pacific,\nthe Pacific Islands Forum, does not have a mechanism\nfor dealing promptly and effectively with challenges to\nthe security of States in the region.\nIt has, therefore, been unable to arrange\nconsultations, let alone facilitate a coordinated\napproach  to the situations which have arisen following\narmed challenges to the Governments of Fiji and\nSolomon Islands. Some of our neighbours have\nresponded by looking for support outside the region.\nWith the recent addition of six additional Pacific\nmembers to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\ngroup of States party to the Lome Convention, 14\nPacific island States now have access to a very\npractical mechanism for dealing with such situations.\nThe upshot is that, when Ministers and\nAmbassadors from Pacific ACP member States met in\nCotonou, Benin, in June for the signing of the new\nframework agreement between the ACP and the\nEuropean Union, we decided to set up a ministerial\nmission to report on the situations in Fiji and Solomon\nIslands.\nIn doing so, we were mindful of the need for, and\ngrateful for the support of, the European Union.\nThe offer made by the French Minister for\nEconomic Cooperation at the regional forum of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to\nensure that the European Commission would defer\nmaking a final decision on sanctions until the Pacific\nACP Ministerial Mission had reported was especially\nwelcome because of the meaning and support it gave to\nour effort at regional cooperation.\n4\n\nThe imposition of sanctions against a country can\nbe a very blunt instrument indeed, causing innocent\nand powerless people to suffer at the same time as the\npowerful and influential, and sometimes\ndisadvantaging them even more. Even so-called smart\nsanctions can have wide, unintended effects while\nleaving their objects largely unaffected.\nWhen a small group of armed men try to take\nover a Government, imposing sanctions that affect\ninnocent men, women and children can be not only\nineffective but even counter-productive.\nSanctions might leave armed youths unaffected\nand in a position where they are even unable to\nappreciate, or are indifferent to, the wider\nconsequences of their actions.\nThe underlying causes of inter-group tensions in\nSolomon Islands and the events which followed the\nattempted civilian armed coup in Fiji could be difficult\nto identify, and are beyond influence by sanctions.\nIt is, therefore, vital that serious difficulties such\nas those currently affecting Fiji and Solomon Islands\nbe properly studied and carefully addressed.\nSometimes, the people best equipped to\nunderstand such situations and identify underlying\ncauses are neighbours with similar cultures or other\nshared values.\nIn terms of the ACP Ministerial Mission, at the\nrequest of other Pacific ACP States, I have recently had\nthe honour of leading the Pacific ACP Ministerial\nMission to Fiji and Solomon Islands.\nMy colleagues included the Ministers for Foreign\nAffairs from Cook Islands, Mr. Robert Woonton, and\nVanuatu, the Honourable Serge Vohor, as well as the\nMinister for Education from Samoa, the Honourable\nFiame Naomi Mata'afa.\nWith the active support of the Governments of\nboth countries, we followed a crowded itinerary of\nmeetings with the Prime Ministers, ministers and\nofficials in Fiji and Solomon Islands, members of the\nprevious Governments of both countries and business\nand trade union leaders, as well as a wide cross-section\nof other elements of civil society, including women's\norganizations. We were also able to interview victims\nin towns and rural areas, and to examine instances of\ndestruction at first hand.\nMy colleagues and I are currently working on our\nreport. We expect to present it to the European\nCommission, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and other\nACP, EU and joint bodies in October.\nThe commitment made by the French Minister for\nEconomic Cooperation, whose country currently holds\nthe presidency of the EU, means that the region \u2014 or,\nat least, our report \u2014 has been given the opportunity to\ninfluence events. The process on which we have\nembarked is, therefore, more meaningful than any\nexisting alternative. We, the Pacific ACP members,\noffered to share our report with the Pacific Islands\nForum, and the support our initiative has received from\nthe region reflects our commitment to wider\ncooperation, not to mention our unwillingness to\nbecome involved in even the appearance of\ncompetition between rival regional bodies or groups.\nThe initiative has been welcomed and praised,\nboth in the region and further afield. It sets an example\nwhich is worthy of close study both for the precedents\nit sets for cooperation among Pacific ACP States and as\na possible model for similar efforts in other regions.\nWith regard to the Bougainville situation, Fiji and\nSolomon Islands are not the first States in our region to\nexperience serious internal difficulties, though we pray\nnot only that there will be real improvement very soon\nbut that they will be the last States to experience such\ndifficulties.\nAfter more than eight years of armed conflict \u2014\nfrom 1989 to 1997 \u2014 the part of Papua New Guinea\nknown as Bougainville is now at peace. The\nprogressive political settlement is moving ahead. The\nLincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and\nDevelopment on Bougainville commits the parties to\npeace-building on several levels, from weapons\ndisposal and the re-establishment of civil authority,\nthrough reconciliation among former combatants to\nreconstruction of infrastructure, restoration of services,\neconomic and social recovery and early resumption of\nthe kinds of development which are part of the return\nof normalcy.\nThe national Government is committed to such a\nmultidimensional approach. It is the way by which we\nhope to cooperate in building for a lasting peace by\npeaceful means. The priority which the Prime Minister\ngave the Bougainville peace process more than 12\nmonths ago remains in place. Evidence of its\ncontinuing significance can be seen in the initiative he\n5\n\nhas recently taken to meet key Bougainvillean demands\nwithin the framework of the Papua New Guinea\nConstitution.\nThe Government, which took the initiative in\ninviting our neighbours, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand\nand Vanuatu, to set up the neutral, regional Peace\nMonitoring Group (PMG), values the contribution its\nunarmed personnel make to promoting mutual\nconfidence on the ground. The PMG's success can be\njudged from the peaceful way in which it is now\nbeginning to disengage by substantially reducing its\nsize. The process needs greater support from the\nBougainvillean parties so as to avoid the vacuum which\nhas followed the departure of similar peacekeeping\noperations elsewhere, by cooperating in the re-\nestablishment of policing, courts and correctional\ninstitutional services, as well as by strengthening the\ninstitutions at community level that help to maintain\npublic order, dispense justice and uphold the rule of\nlaw.\nAs the initiator of the request for the United\nNations observer mission in Bougainville, and as its\nhost, Papua New Guinea appreciates the support which\nthe Security Council and other organs of the United\nNations provide for the Bougainville peace process. We\nare determined to keep on working for lasting peace by\npeaceful means within a flexible framework which will\nallow Bougainville a high degree of autonomy\nconsistent with the integrity, security and sovereignty\nof the nation.\nWith regard to social and economic issues, as a\ndeveloping country with 25 years of independence,\nPapua New Guinea is experiencing very great difficulty\nin improving national performance as measured by\nhuman development indicators. In some areas, our\nrecord is actually becoming worse. The current\nGovernment's five main objectives are intended to\nfocus attention and effort where they are most needed.\nOur determination to pursue them is already making a\nvery real difference, especially as far as economic\nmanagement and the delivery of Government services\nare concerned.\nStructural adjustment, including quite\nfundamental public sector reform, is one of the key\nmeans of bringing about often long-overdue change.\nWe need the continuing support of our economic\npartners to succeed, including access to markets;\nincreased investment in priority areas, such as\ndownstream processing, which provides increased\nopportunities for productive employment; and aid on\nconcessional terms. The recently concluded partnership\nagreement between the ACP countries and the EU is an\nexample worthy of much wider emulation.\nAs a developing country that achieved\nindependence only a quarter of a century ago, Papua\nNew Guinea is firmly committed to the proper\npreparation for orderly decolonization. Impressed with\nthe progress being made to implement the Noumea\nAccord, we continue to believe very strongly that the\nrights of the indigenous Kanaks of New Caledonia\nmust be respected. Conscious of the consequences of\nother forms of decolonization, we welcome the re-\nemergence of East Timor as an independent entity. We\nlook forward to receiving a delegation later this year to\ndiscuss how we might develop technical and other\nforms of mutually beneficial South-South cooperation.\nMeanwhile, even as we continue to deepen and\nbroaden cooperation with other Pacific island\ncountries, we respect the integrity of our other\nneighbours and continue to benefit from the exchanges\nwhich flow from our status as a special observer at\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nmeetings. In the broader arena of Asia-Pacific\ncooperation, we value our membership of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and\ncontinue to work towards honouring the reciprocal\ncommitments APEC members have made to liberalize\nmarkets. APEC includes some of our closest bilateral\npartners and friends. Common membership, and the\nprocess of developing economic ties with other APEC\neconomies, do not detract from other aspects of Papua\nNew Guinea's foreign relations. They do not affect the\ncommitments we have made to such good friends as the\nPeople's Republic of China. We will not allow them to\ndo so.\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that, 25 years\nafter independence, Papua New Guinea has one of the\nlongest unbroken records of constitutional and\ndemocratic government among countries that have\nbecome independent in the last 50 or so years. We have\nexperienced difficulties, and had some near misses.\nThe stresses and strains which have affected our system\nof Government have tested our strengths. In doing so,\nthey have increased our understanding of countries\nexperiencing serious internal difficulties \u2014 although\nnot our sympathy for those who deliberately violate\ndemocratic principles or established constitutional\n6\n\npractices \u2014 while reinforcing our commitment to good\ngovernance, both at home and abroad.\nApart from the obvious consequences that this\ncommitment has for Papua New Guinea's response to\ncountries experiencing serious internal difficulties,\nincluding our preference for a positive, forward-\nlooking approach and not negative sanctions, it also\nunderlies our support for United Nations reform.\nThe reform must extend from improving\nadministrative performance to making the Security\nCouncil more representative of United Nations\nMembers as a whole. It must, in fact, extend to the\nperformance of United Nations Members themselves,\nespecially when it comes to paying their dues in a\ntimely way and in full.\nThe millennium marks an important turning point\nin the calendar, and, because of my country's silver\nanniversary, in Papua New Guinea's history too. The\nUnited Nations is also at a critical turning point, with\nthe Secretary-General drawing members' attention\nback to the original basis and focus among the people\nthe Organization should serve.\nThe recent review of United Nations peace and\nsecurity activities has produced an excellent report\nwhich challenges us to turn another corner and ensure\nthat the increased responsibilities which the\nOrganization has assumed since the end of the cold war\nhelp to keep and build peace in very different\nconditions.\nI conclude by paying tribute to the vision which\nparticipants in the Millennium Summit have expressed\non our behalf. In doing so, let me add that the real\nchallenge we face is, emphatically, not to make more\nspeeches, but to turn their wise words into practical\nforms of cooperation which help us achieve common\npurposes without sacrificing the diversity which is the\nbasis of our need and ability to engage in global self-\nhelp."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf\nof the United Arab Emirates, our sincere\ncongratulations and regards on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. We are confident that your experience in\ninternational affairs will contribute to the success of\nthis session's proceedings. We also thank your\npredecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which\n16\n\nhe directed the work of the previous session. I would\nalso like to express our appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for\nthe efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United\nNations in maintaining peace, security and stability in\nthe world.\nThe convening of the Millennium Summit a few\ndays ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment\nof the political will of the leaders of the world to deal\neffectively with the problems and challenges that face\nthe international community, such as the proliferation\nof proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing\npoverty and debt, as well as other attendant\ntransnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime,\ninternational terrorism, environmental pollution,\npersistent violations of human rights and the disparities\nresulting from globalization and information\ntechnology.\nThe consequences of these prevailing conditions\nhave, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness\nof the importance of adhering to the principles\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of\nconsolidating the rule of international law through the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the\nprinciple of equality and the right to self-\ndetermination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of\ncooperation and tolerance among the different cultures,\nbeliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for\nachieving the desired security, stability and human\ndevelopment.\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome\nof the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the\nRepublic of Yemen, as an important political and\nhistoric event that will promote confidence-building\nmeasures and good neighbourly relations. At the same\ntime, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to\nfollow the example of those fraternal States and to\nrespond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either\nentering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations\naimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's\noccupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser\nTunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute\nto the International Court of Justice.\nIn this context, we would like to reaffirm that all\nactions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran on those three islands and its\ncontinued construction of military and civilian\ninstallations on them, are illegal measures considered\nnull and void, and do not establish or entail any legal\nrights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In\nfact, they represent a violation of the territorial\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and\ncontravene the principles and purposes of the Charters\nof both the United Nations and the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian\npeaceful intentions in the region.\nMore than a year has elapsed since the Gulf\nCooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial\nCommittee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar,\nwith developing a mechanism for direct negotiations\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of\nthe endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the\nreinforcement of the foundations of peace and security\nin the Arab Gulf region.\nDespite the fact that almost ten years have\nelapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab\nGulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of\nthat War. Consequently, it is imperative that political\nand diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a\npeaceful solution that would lead to ending the human\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we\ninvite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely\nfulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to\nthe release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of\nwar or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti\nproperty, in implementation of the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council. In this regard, we would like to\nunderline the importance of respecting the national\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as\nrefraining from the threat or use of force, in order to\nensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the\nregion.\nThe Middle East peace process recently witnessed\nimportant developments during which major efforts\nwere exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable\nand fair solutions based on the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy and the principle of land for\npeace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible\nand constructive proposals put forward by the\nPalestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just\nsolution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the\nIsraeli Government persisted in its positions of\nprocrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to\n17\n\nabide by the agreements it had concluded with the\nPalestinian side.\nThus, in affirming our position of solidarity with\nthe fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership,\nrepresented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our\ncall to the co-sponsors of the peace process \u2014 in\nparticular the United States of America \u2014 and the\nother active States to continue exerting political and\ndiplomatic efforts that support and promote\nnegotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,\nwith the aim of finding a just and comprehensive\nsettlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this\nsettlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al-\nSharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian\npeople to exercise their legitimate and inalienable\nrights to return to their homeland and to establish their\nown independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital.\nAlso in this context we reaffirm our unceasing\nsupport of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to\nregain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967.\nWe call on the international community to demand that\nIsrael resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the\nbasis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the\ninterest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all\nthe States and peoples of the region.\nThe United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once\nagain fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory,\nexpresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the\nextension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil.\nIn the same vein, we support the demands of\nsisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on\nit be lifted, particularly since it has implemented\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe also express our satisfaction at the outcome of\nthe recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti\nand invite all Somali factions to reinforce national\nunity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and\nsustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the\nregion of the Horn of Africa.\nThe growing number of problems resulting from\nthe continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing\nin some parts of the African continent, the Balkans,\nSouth Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of\nconstant concern for the international community.\nConsequently, we support all regional and international\nefforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful\nmeans, and we emphasize that just and lasting\nresolution of these issues cannot be attained until the\nparties concerned demonstrate the necessary political\nwill to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate\ntheir commitment to implement relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nDespite international unanimity, shown in the\nDisarmament Conference and other international\nforums, regarding the need to limit the spread of\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\nweapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a\nmatter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned\nat this time as some States are striving to outdo each\nother in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in\nparticular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a\nmeans of settling their territorial disputes. Since such\nactions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic\nsecurity balance, at both the regional and international\nlevels, we call upon the States concerned to review\ntheir policies in this respect and to promote the\nestablishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in\nthe Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\nWe also urge the international community to demand\nonce again that the Israeli Government accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand agree to subject its nuclear facilities to\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.\nDespite the multidimensional changes that the\nworld economy is witnessing as a result of the\nderegulation of markets, globalization and modern\ntechnology, the economic and social gap between the\ndeveloped and developing States still exists and is\ngrowing \u2014 thereby exacerbating poverty and\nunemployment, environmental degradation and debt\naccumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium\nSummit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the\ngreat importance our countries attach to these issues.\nThis makes it incumbent on all of us to work\nassiduously on carrying out the commitments and\nundertakings contained therein regarding the creation\nof an environment favourable to development,\nelimination of poverty and free access for the exports\nof the least developed countries to the markets of\nindustrialized countries. I confirm the determination of\nthe United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to\n18\n\nwork towards narrowing the gap between the rich and\nthe poor.\nThe United Arab Emirates continues its sustained\nefforts in support of economic- and social-development\nprojects in many countries of the world, particularly in\nAfrica and Asia, be it through direct participation in\nfinancing such projects or by supporting international\nand regional efforts to attain those goals.\nFinally, the ever-increasing burden of economic,\nsocial and human development, which is the first\nsafeguard of the political stability that we desire,\ndemands that mechanisms for regional and\ninternational cooperation, foremost among which is the\nUnited Nations, be created. Hence, we call for\ncontinued efforts to carry out the structural reform and\ndevelopment of the world Organization, in particular\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly, so that\nthe Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes\nin international relations."

        "file_text": "Finding ourselves in a new\ncentury and in a new millennium, it is natural to review\nwhat we have done right and to meditate also on what\nwe could have done better. The United Nations is the\nforum and the system that allows us to contemplate the\nstatus of the world's development from the widest\npossible perspective.\nLatvia is small, but the success of our democracy\nand the success of our efforts at European integration\nwill have a strong positive effect on the destiny of the\nBaltic Sea region. The success of an Organization like\nthe United Nations can be measured by how its work\nhas affected the lives of individual people in all\ncountries. In the age of globalization the challenge we\n7\n\ncollectively face is to ensure that all can be\nbeneficiaries.\nAs a result of the revolution in information\ntechnology, the world has grown smaller. Nations and\npeople are closer to each other than ever before. This\nunderlines the importance of the principle of\nuniversality. Today the decisions taken in one part of\nthe globe affect people and nations all around the\nworld. This calls for wider representation and, in the\ncase of the United Nations, for the reform of the\nSecurity Council, which needs to be carried out to\nreflect the present political and economic realities.\nTo respond to modern challenges, the United\nNations needs both political will and courage. In this\nregard, I would like to express my appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for his efforts in strengthening and\nmodernizing the Organization through its reforms.\nThe United Nations also needs to be better\nequipped to prevent and manage conflicts.\nUnfortunately, the demand for peacekeeping is still\nhigh. The Member States, both individually and\ncollectively, must do more to meet this demand. Latvia\nhas done its best to make its practical contribution to\npeace and security. During the past year Latvia's\npeacekeepers have been present in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Kosovo as a part of North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization-led forces. In accordance with the\nUnited Nations decision to extend the mandate for the\noperation in Kosovo, Latvia will continue its\nparticipation and will allocate more resources for\npeacekeeping operations in next year's budget.\nAs a future member of the European Union,\nLatvia attaches great importance to the development of\na common European security and defence policy that\nwill increase the European capabilities in conflict\nprevention and crisis management. We are willing to\ncontribute our forces and to participate in European\nUnion operations.\nTo provide the United Nations with proper tools\nfor peacekeeping, the reforms of the scale of\ncontributions must be implemented to reflect the\ncapabilities and responsibilities of every Member State.\nAt the same time, the United Nations must ensure that\nthe resources are spent wisely and operations managed\nproperly. For its part, Latvia is considering a review of\nits contribution to the peacekeeping budget with a view\nto gradually increasing its share.\nHuman rights must remain high on the agenda of\nthe United Nations in the twenty-first century. As a\nmember of the Commission on Human Rights and its\nBureau, Latvia remains strongly committed to the\nstrengthening of the United Nations human rights\nmechanisms. In particular, the role of the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nand its programmes, including the development of\nnational capacities for the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights, should be strengthened.\nLatvia remains committed to the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court. We welcome the\nefforts of its Preparatory Commission in tackling the\ntask of finalizing the texts of the rules of procedure and\nevidence, and the elements of crime, in a timely\nmanner. Those who commit crimes against humanity\nmust not go unpunished.\nFifty years of foreign occupation left us with a\nheavy social, economic and psychological burden.\nFrom the time of our return to independence in 1991,\nLatvia has made every effort to overcome this legacy.\nTo be successful in the new millennium, we need the\nconsolidated input of all our people, regardless of their\noccupation, ethnicity or place of residence. That is why\nthe Latvian Government has elaborated its programme\nof integration of society. This is an experiment and in\nmany ways unique. The integration programme is our\nvision of how our society can function most effectively\non the basis of democracy and respect for human\nrights.\nThis programme complements the integration\nmeasures being implemented through education with\nthe help of the United Nations Development\nProgramme. The programme will increase public\nparticipation and it will reduce differences among the\nvarious regions of Latvia. It is a sign of Latvia's\nreadiness to explore new ways of improving the living\nstandards and the social climate.\nLatvia's international role has grown in the past\ndecade of freedom. Each year we are able to do more\nfor the people of Latvia and the international\ncommunity. With the beginning earlier this year of\ntalks for European Union membership, Latvia entered a\nnew phase in its international relations. This November\nLatvia will assume the presidency of the Council of\nEurope  our first presidency in a pan-European\norganization.\n8\n\nLatvia is determined to participate even more\nactively in the work of the United Nations. Therefore\nLatvia has put forward its candidacy to be a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\nperiod of 2006 to 2007. I believe Latvia is ready to\nassume this high responsibility.\nIt is an honour to present Latvia's perspective\nhere today at the outset of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish all of us a very useful and\nproductive session.\n"

        "file_text": "It was by\nunanimous vote that our Assembly elected our\nPresident to be in charge of our work. Whereas we are\nalready aware of his professional skills and his human\nqualities, may I take the liberty of congratulating him\nand assuring him of the support and the cooperation of\nthe delegation of Chad to assist him in performing this\ndifficult but very inspiring task.\nHis predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof fraternal Namibia, very tactfully and effectively\nguided the work which was entrusted to him during the\nfifty-fourth session. He is now deserving of our\ncongratulations.\nOur words of congratulations and our\nencouragement are likewise addressed to our brother,\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose devotion to the cause of peace\nand development in the world undoubtedly represents a\nguarantee for the success of our Organization.\nLast year during a visit to the headquarters of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme in New York,\nthe President of the Republic of Chad, His Excellency\nMr. Idriss Deby, declared:\n\u201cA new world is being built before our very\neyes. New standards are being set which are\ngiving lasting shape to the behaviours of\nindividuals and relations among States. New\ntechnologies are pressing us forward to even\ngreater progress in those societies which possess\nthem. Those which are closed to change are being\nmarginalized, since they are incapable of making\ntheir ambitions come to life in the context of the\nnew world. This frightening prospect, since it is\nsynonymous with being left behind, is very real\nfor many developing countries. But, I reject this\nprospect for my country.\u201d\nThe President of the Republic is here referring\nspecifically to a world which is in constant change\nbecause of rampant globalization, which has become a\nfact of life that is sometimes highly praised for its\nbenefits and sometimes shunned because of the harm it\ndoes. Meanwhile in Chad, men and women are doing\neverything they can to derive benefit from\nglobalization and to avoid the downside in order not to\nmiss the train of political, economic, social and\ntechnological progress.\nIn other words, faced with the threat that\nglobalization represents to stability, security and\ndevelopment of the weaker, Chad is waging an out and\nout struggle to occupy its proper place in the concert of\nnations.\nYes, the men and women of Chad are struggling\ncourageously and with resolve to emerge from\nobscurantism, from poverty and from domination. The\nresults of their daily struggle speak for themselves\nwhen you look at what has been achieved in the various\n36\n\nareas of national life. Politically, the democratic\nexperiment which began on 1 December 1990 is being\nfurther developed and consolidated. Thus, political\npluralism is functioning while respecting diversity on\nthe basis of consensual and participatory democracy.\nThe various fundamental freedoms which\nunderlie and which breathe life into any democratic\npolitical system are being fully exercised. The freedom\nof expression of the private press, which gives no\nquarter in its criticism of the action of the Government,\nas well as the burgeoning of associations of civil\nsociety, particularly those dealing with human rights,\nyoung people and women, bears witness to the political\ndetermination of the Government of Chad to promote a\nculture of democracy.\nIn this connection, particular attention should be\npaid to strengthening the role of women in public life,\nas well as the rights of and the protection of children.\nLikewise, through the establishment of a supreme\ncourt, a constitutional council and a superior council of\njudges, the final touches have been put on the judicial\ninstitutions that underpin our democratic system.\nFurthermore, I am pleased to recall that the first multi-\nparty elections took place in Chad in 1996 in a climate\nof calm and transparency, as the international observers\nnoted. The next elections will take place in six months.\nIn general, the political authorities in Chad are doing\nall they can to ensure their success.\nI would therefore like to emphasize from this\nrostrum that Chad's attachment to pluralistic\ndemocracy cannot be unseated, because the people of\nChad as a whole are profoundly convinced that this is\nthe only way \u2014 indeed their unique opportunity \u2014 to\nimprove their living conditions. The most recent\nmeetings in Syrte, Libya, and the various declarations\nmade by Chadian political actors are all encouraging\nsigns that, as we would like, this attachment is firm. In\nall events, the Government of Chad welcomes these\nnew arrangements, which are to be seen as part and\nparcel of the policy of outreach that has been\nadvocated by His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby, the\nPresident of the Republic of Chad.\nAfter gaining this hard-won peace and this firm\nattachment to democracy, the Government of Chad\nquite naturally then proceeded \u2014 with the support of\ninternational institutions and Chad's bilateral\npartners \u2014 to tackle the question of economic and\nsocial development. A genuine plan to fight poverty\nhas been created. This plan includes the elaboration of\na national strategy for the reduction of poverty. This\nstrategy has been further strengthened by the fact that\nthe objectives of poverty reduction and economic\ngrowth during the 2000-2002 period have been made\npart of the major, high-priority social and sectoral\nprogrammes that were adopted at the Geneva IV round\ntable on the development of Chad.\nPart of this struggle against poverty is the\nstruggle that the people of Chad have waged to\ncomplete the project for the extraction and export of its\noil. This success was achieved thanks to the\ndetermination of the President of the Republic, His\nExcellency Mr. Idriss Deby \u2014 but also thanks to\nunflagging support of the Bretton Woods institutions\nand of friends and other partners of Chad. Here we\nwould like these supporters to know that the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Chad\nrecognize and are grateful for their assistance.\nChad nevertheless does not see its\ndevelopment \u2014 and even less its security and\nstability \u2014 in an isolated fashion. Therefore Chad is\ndoing everything possible to make its contribution to\ncreating a climate of peace and prosperity in Africa \u2014\nparticularly in Central Africa. The subregion of Central\nAfrica \u2014 despite its immense potential, and perhaps\nbecause of this immense potential, I might add \u2014 now\nappears to be the region of upheaval par excellence, a\nregion characterized by armed conflicts and crises of\nall sorts. Undoubtedly some hotbeds of tension have\nbeen slaked. This is true of the Central African\nRepublic and of the Republic of the Congo, which are\ngradually regaining their stability. But this stability\nremains fragile. The international community therefore\nmust help these countries to consolidate this peace by\nactions in support of reconstruction and assistance.\nTwo other conflicts, unfortunately, persist and\nalso dangerously threaten the subregion. One of these\nis the conflict occurring in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, where the belligerents' failure to respect the\nLusaka Agreement has unfortunately resulted in\nexacerbating the rivalries among the foreign forces in\nthe Congolese territory, further complicating the\nsituation and holding up the effective implementation\nof that Agreement.\nAs far as the Angolan conflict is concerned, it has\ncertainly become even more complex because of its\nduration, the resources that nurture it and all the\n37\n\ninternational complicity that Mr. Jonas Savimbi has\ntaken advantage of. But we must support the efforts of\nthe legitimate and legal Government of Angola, as well\nas the efforts of the international community, so that\nthis long-suffering people can recover the peace and\ntranquillity that they have not known since they\nacceded to independence.\nIn the framework of the United Nations Standing\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in Central\nAfrica, the States of this subregion have not remained\ninactive. They are devoting themselves to exploring\nways and means of establishing peace and tranquillity\nthrough measures designed first and foremost to create\ntrust among themselves.\nThe first of these steps is the possibility offered\nby the periodic meetings of the Committee. These\nprovide an opportunity for political dialogue in the\ninterest of preventive diplomacy. For having created\nthis Committee, the Security Council is deserving of\nour gratitude.\nFurthermore, structures and mechanisms to\npromote peace and stability are gradually being\nestablished. Among others, we might note the\nestablishment of an early-warning mechanism in\nLibreville and of the subregional centre for human\nrights and democracy in Yaound\u00e9. The creation of the\nCouncil for Peace and Security in Central Africa is\nunder way with the signing, by the heads of State or\nGovernment, on 24 February at Malabo, Equatorial\nGuinea, of the protocol regarding this Council and the\nmutual assistance pact.\nIn the area of security there is a plan to organize a\njoint military exercise for the peacekeeping operations\nof the armed forces of the States of the subregion. As\nfor the other contributor to instability \u2014 the\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons \u2014 the\nmember States held a subregional conference on this\ntopic in N'Djamena in October 1999. A number of\nmeasures were advocated; among them, we might\nmention the project of \u201carms for development\u201d, which\nwas initiated by Canada and certain donor countries \u2014\na project that is intended to set up micro-projects to\nhelp those who turn in their arms. For the time being\nthis project involves the areas along the borders of\nCameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad. In\nthis connection, a mission of evaluation visited the\ncountries concerned in July 2000. The initiative is only\nat the conceptual stage, but it is to be hoped that it will\ntake concrete form as soon as possible. I would\ntherefore like to make an appeal to the other partners to\njoin with Canada in order to broaden the scope of these\nprojects to include the entire subregion.\nInstability and insecurity in Central Africa are\nalso among the major causes of refugee flows, a\nphenomenon that has spared no State. Aware as we are\nof the negative effects of this phenomenon, member\nStates took this matter up during a conference that was\nheld last August in Bujumbura. The relevant\nconclusions of this conference deserve to be supported.\nThe political situations in other subregions of the\nAfrican continent also concern us. Certainly there has\nbeen a definite improvement with the consolidation of\ndemocratic institutions, good governance and respect\nfor the fundamental rights of the African people.\nNevertheless, several crises are persisting and must be\na subject of concern for the entire international\ncommunity. Thus in West Africa, Sierra Leone has not\nyet achieved peace, despite the commitments entered\ninto by the parties to the conflict. Chad, for its part,\ngives its total support to the efforts of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\nUnited Nations to seek peace in this embattled country.\nLikewise, we have every confidence in ECOWAS to\nsmooth out the difficulties between Liberia and Guinea.\nWith regard to the conflict between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, His Excellency President Idriss Deby has\npersonally dealt with this matter as current President of\nthe Community of the Sahel and Saharan States by\nsetting up a good offices mission to the leaders of the\ntwo fraternal countries, in support of the mediation by\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nThe Government of Chad is very pleased to see\nthat the two parties have finally reached a peace\nagreement. We encourage them to respect their\nindividual commitments in order to bring lasting peace\nto this part of the African continent.\nRegarding the Somali crisis, Chad welcomes the\nfact that the people of Somalia have awakened to their\ndestiny through the recent conference of national\nreconciliation which was held in Alta, Djibouti, thus\ndemonstrating courage and imagination in their\ndetermination to endow their countries with republican\ninstitutions. The international community must help\nthem and encourage them to build further on this\ninitiative in order to reach total and just peace.\n38\n\nThe presence here of a delegation bearing the\nname of the Republic of Somalia, whose seat has been\nvacant for almost 10 years now, is a matter of pride and\nsatisfaction for the friends and the partners of this\nfraternal people.\nIt is an example that should edify our brothers of\nthe Comoros and Burundi.\nWe should also congratulate the Government of\nDjibouti for their contribution and devotion to the\ncause of peace in the subregion.\nWe believe it is time to lift completely the\nembargo against the Great Socialist People's Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya, because it is no longer justified and\narbitrarily penalizes the fraternal Libyan people and,\nindeed, beyond them the entire subregion.\nChad has not lost sight of the crisis situations\nprevailing in other parts of the world.\nIn the Middle East, it is following with interest\nthe negotiations underway between the Palestinian and\nIsraeli authorities and believes that the time for the\npeace of the worthy has now come. The parties to the\nconflict should seize this historic opportunity and, as\nPresident Clinton said: the world should help them to\ntake the risk of embarking on peace.\nIn Iraq, Chad believes it is urgent to put an end to\nthe embargo whose consequences have been so\ndisastrous for the civilian population, which is\nsuffering the atrocious evils resulting from this unjust\ndecision. Quite clearly any solution should also cover\nthe very pertinent matter of the prisoners from Kuwait\nand other countries.\nThe Korean peninsula is showing encouraging\nsigns of the two fraternal countries drawing closer to\neach other. The historic inter-Korean Summit, which\ntook place between the leaders of these countries last\nJune, has laid the foundation for trusting relationships\nthat are so central for any dialogue.\nThe international community should encourage\nboth of these countries to press on in order to\neventually sign a peace agreement which would pave\nthe way to peaceful coexistence.\nThe inter-Korean dialogue might also arouse\nsome interest on the part of the Taiwan Strait where\ntension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high.\nWhereas economic and trade relations between the two\ncountries are being developed on a regular basis,\npolitical relations are non-existent, despite the fact that\non both sides of the Strait semi-official structures have\nbeen set up which serve as channels of communication\nbetween the People's Republic of China and the\nRepublic of China, Taiwan.\nBoth parties should show political determination\nand imagination in exploring ways and means of\nreducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue. In all\nevents, the international community is duty bound to\nreconsider the whole question of admitting the\nRepublic of China, Taiwan to membership of our\nOrganization, particularly in light of the weight and the\nimportance of the economic role it plays internationally\nand the fact that it is so closely involved in actions for\ndevelopment and the reduction of poverty.\nFor its part, the Government of Chad supports the\nrequest by the Republic of China, Taiwan, to seek\nmembership in the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies.\nI could not conclude my remarks without\nreferring to other ills which undermine and sap all the\ndevelopment efforts of countries like mine. These ills\ninclude indebtedness, protectionist measures in the\nmarkets of the northern countries, deterioration in the\nterms of trade and various kinds of trafficking.\nThose countries which hold the key to the\nsolutions to all these ills, particularly the northern\ncountries, must go beyond simple declarations of\nintention and take concrete steps to relieve countries\nfrom the burden of indebtedness, to throw open their\nmarkets and to pay a fair price for our exports.\nAs if this were not enough, another evil which is\neven more insidious and devastating, has made our task\neven more difficult. The prospects for solution are\nremote indeed and it is to be feared that this will reduce\nto nothing our hopes to relieve our peoples of poverty.\nI refer to the HIV/AIDS pandemic which brings death\nand bereavement to families on a daily basis.\nNot only is it a burden for our meagre financial\nresources, but also on our human resources,\nparticularly young people who are the spearhead of our\nnation.\nWe have the collective responsibility to\neffectively mobilize ways and means to conquer this\nscourge which defies the entire international\ncommunity as a time when there is so much\ntechnological and scientific progress being made.\n39\n\nIn the light of all these challenges, Chad believes\nthat its development should also benefit from the\npolitical and economic integration of Africa, which is\nan important and determinant dimension of this global\nvillage. Therefore we would welcome and salute the\nmajor political acts which have been taken by the\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on 12 July in\nLom\u00e9: I refer to the adoption of the Constituent Act of\nthe African Union.\nThis major historic event, which is the result of a\ncollective commitment on the part of the African\npeoples, is a responsible reply on the part of today's\nAfrica to meet the number of challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century by means of political, economic and social\nintegration.\nThe African Union will create the necessary\nconditions for genuine partnership in irreversible\nglobalization, but a globalization that would not be\nsynonymous with exclusion and the dictatorship of the\nmarketplace. This globalization, we believe, should be\nsynonymous with sharing and openness. It should have\na human face or it will not exist at all.\nBut none of this can be achieved without further\ndemocratization of the United Nations starting with an\nenlargement of the Security Council so that it can be\nmore effective and, particularly, more legitimate.\nIn other words, it is in our interest \u2014 in the\ninterest of us all \u2014 that the Security Council be more\nrepresentative of the international community in whose\nname it claims to act. What we are referring to here is\nthe credibility of its decisions which, unfortunately,\nhave long been used against the weaker with its policy\nof double standards.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government\nand on my own behalf, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI also wish to congratulate, in particular, the\noutgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise\nand dynamic manner in which he carried out his\nmandate. I would also like to express our appreciation\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish\nefforts to make the United Nations an increasingly\neffective instrument, capable of dealing with the\ndemands of our times and finding and implementing\nsolutions for the most pressing problems of the world.\nJust a few days ago, during the Millennium\nSummit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities\nof the United Nations for the twenty-first century and\nexpressed the need to adapt its structure for the\ndemands and challenges of the future. During that\nevent of transcendental importance for the lives of the\npeople of this planet, the indispensable and\nirreplaceable character of the United Nations in\ninternational relations was reaffirmed. Member States\nreiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the\nUnited Nations as a privileged mechanism for\ninternational dialogue and cooperation in the name of\npeace and well-being of all peoples.\nIndeed, given the role of the United Nations as\nguarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is\nurgent that we begin the implementation of actions\naimed at adapting its internal structure to new world\nrealities. This will permit the Organization to deal\nrapidly and effectively with the main problems of the\nworld and avoid having its members resort to solutions\noutside the established framework of its main\norgans  namely, the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council.\nIn recent years, the United Nations sought,\nthrough world summits, to find global solutions with\nbroad international consensus for the many misfortunes\nthat afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of\nthe environment, violations of human rights and\ninadequate social development, among others. Various\nplans of action were outlined. However, the problems\n12\n\nthey sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have\neven become worse.\nA revision of the mechanism for implementing\ndecisions is needed, through a revitalization and\nstrengthening of the United Nations system,\nparticularly that of its principal bodies, such as the\nSecurity Council. From our point of view, that body\nrequires greater internal democracy, and its\ncomposition should reflect the current membership in\nthe Organization and its geographic diversity. We think\nthat, in this way, its decision-making would be faster\nand its performance in the area of peacekeeping and\ninternational security more effective.\nThe persistence of a climate of insecurity and\ninstability in a number of regions of the world cannot\nbe attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems\nfrom weakness in the international security system. A\nreflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for\nexample, in the early warning system and in the\npeacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not\nalways corresponded to the desired objectives, either\nbecause the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not\nsent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are\nnot provided with adequate human, material and\nfinancial resources. Sometimes this is due to the\nambiguity in the mission mandate itself.\nWe recognize that the effectiveness of action in\nthe area of peace and international security does not\ndepend only on United Nations activities. There has to\nbe renewed commitment on the part of each and every\nState. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent\npublication of the Brahimi report.\nIt is our understanding that the adoption of\nmeasures at the national, regional and international\nlevels should be made part of this commitment in order\nto eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In\nthe particular case of the African continent, the\ncontinent most affected by the scourge of war, the\nillicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of\nsupport for wars incited by some rebel groups with the\nobjective of overturning democratically elected\nregimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with\nthe aim of reducing access of these conflict\ndiamonds to the international market. My Government\nsupports these initiatives and will provide any\ncooperation necessary for their implementation.\nAnother serious issue affecting international\nsecurity is the circulation and transfer of small arms\nthat flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups.\nThis takes place with the connivance of certain\nGovernments and networks of transnational organized\ncrime. The lack of international legal instruments\ncapable of controlling transactions of these arms is\nstimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above\nall in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of\nconflicts and making their resolution even more\ndifficult. According to United Nations data, the effects\nof these arms on civil populations are shocking. They\nhave already resulted in more deaths than the two\nworld wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict\ndiamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes\nspecial importance for Angola. It is through the sale of\nillegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas\nSavimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which\nthey then undertook a large-scale military campaign\naimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a\nprocession of death and destruction, and it is the\nprincipal reason for the economic instability in Angola.\nThis scenario is repeating itself in other regions of\nAfrica and the world. For this reason, a solution is\nurgently required.\nThe economic and social development and\nsubsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance can\nonly be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and\nstability. It is in this context that my Government\nestablished, as a priority, the restoration of definitive\npeace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this\nobjective, the general situation in Angola has\nsignificantly improved. It is for this reason that today\nwe are more confident than ever of a future of peace,\ndevelopment and prosperity.\nIndeed, the war has ceased to have the same\nintensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict\nitself is moving progressively towards an end. The\npolitical and military measures undertaken by the\nGovernment have significantly reduced the ability of\nthe rebels to wage war. These measures have also\nallowed the Government to resume control over nearly\nthe entire country.\nMore than 12,000 rebel military personnel have\nabandoned their arms and joined the efforts of\nreconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who\npersist in waging war have less and less space, and\ntheir activities are limited today to isolated armed\nattacks against civilian targets, the objective being to\ndestroy and loot the people's property.\n13\n\nThe military measures undertaken by the\nGovernment represent a necessary and legitimate\nrecourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the\nrebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very\nexistence of the Angolan democratic system. However,\ndespite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the\ntotal control of our national borders and the elimination\nof the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are\nhaving a positive impact in the search for peace, they\ndo not constitute our only option for the resolution of\narmed conflict.\nSimultaneously, we will continue to implement\nother actions aimed at guaranteeing the total\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us\ncontinues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the\nAngolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our\nreadiness to continue to integrate in our society all\nthose who choose to abandon the option of war.\nThe international community, and the United\nNations in particular, still has an active role to play in\nthe process of restoring peace in Angola, through the\ncontinued implementation and strengthening of\nsanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.\nThe recent nomination by the Secretary-General\nof the members of the mechanism to monitor the\napplication of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1295\n(2000), will contribute to greater international\nvigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny\nbases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We\nhope that all Members of the United Nations will\nextend their cooperation to that body.\nThe significant improvement of the situation in\nAngola, however, has not brought an immediate end to\nthe effects of war on the lives of the people. The\nhumanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for\nthat reason we appeal to the international community to\nincrease its assistance to the needy populations.\nThe positive evolution of the situation is not\nlimited to the politico-military field; it has also carried\nover into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues\non the path of economic reforms which have earned the\nconfidence of international financial institutions. This\nprogress translated to the recent signature of an\nagreement with the International Monetary Fund\nrelating to the implementation of a monitored\nprogramme.\nWe hope that the international community will\ncontribute substantially through the investment of\ncapital during the recovery phase of the Angolan\neconomy in supporting stability and growth. Angola\nadopted legislation to protect foreign investment by\nproviding incentives and guarantees.\nThe international situation continues to be\ncharacterized by violence and tension in various parts\nof the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace\nand stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the\ncontinuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for\nstability and development in the central region of\nAfrica. The situation in that neighbouring country,\nwhich shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common\nborder with Angola, remains quite volatile and\ncomplex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if\nappropriate measures are not taken.\nThe resolution of the Congolese conflict must\ncome about, fundamentally, through the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In\nspite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new\nreading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to\nall the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Invading forces should withdraw completely\nfrom Congolese territory and cease immediately their\nsupport for the destabilization of that country.\nThese conditions, in addition to the inter-\nCongolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base\nincluding the unequivocal recognition of the authority\nof the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the\nsuccess of the peace process. Angola reiterates its\ncommitment to continue to make the necessary efforts,\ntogether with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba\nof Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement,\nuntil a way out of the conflict is found.\nIn Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities\ncontinues to delay the pacification of the country.\nAngola supports regional initiatives aimed at\nreactivating the peace process and condemns the\nattacks against United Nations personnel and forces.\nWe support steps aimed at bringing to international\njustice the principal parties responsible for the\natrocities committed against the people of that country.\nIn Somalia, the progress reached at the national\nconference led to the re-establishment of some national\ninstitutions and moved the country closer to peace.\n14\n\nAngola encourages the continuation of these efforts\nand hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able\nto reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the\ninternational community.\nIn the Horn of Africa, the conflict between\nEthiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive\nmovement following the signing of the Cessation of\nHostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two\nparties honour their commitments under the accord and\ncreate conditions for the establishment of good-\nneighbourly relations and cooperation.\nSimilarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding\nthe resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through\nthe implementation of the United Nations peace plan.\nAngola is following with particular attention the\nsituation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and\nsupports the efforts of the Government of that country\nto find a just and fair solution to the land problem that\nwas inherited from the colonial period. In this context,\nwe share and fully support the position expressed by\nthe Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land\nreform in Zimbabwe.\nIn the Middle East, the question of Palestine\nconstitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the\nregion. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination. The resolution\nof this conflict must encompass a political compromise\nbetween the parties involved and the effective\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\nresolutions and other understandings reached.\nLess than a year ago, the people of East Timor\nfinally succeeded in exercising their right to self-\ndetermination. Angola feels pleased and compensated\nby this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the\ncountries that fought in the United Nations and other\ninternational forums for the right of the Timorese\npeople to freely choose their own destiny.\nThe international community, and the United\nNations in particular, which is responsible for the\nmanagement of the transition period, cannot permit the\ncurrent climate of violence, provoked by the militias\nwith the objective of impeding the independence of the\nterritory, to impose itself over the will of a people that\nhas already suffered for decades the scourge of\ncolonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly\ncondemns these acts of violence, which have resulted\nin great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola\nappeals to the Security Council to take appropriate\nsteps to ensure its immediate cessation.\nIn the past two years, the world economy has\nregistered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook\nAsia. The industrial economies and the so-called\nemerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving\nconsiderable rates of growth. However, the present\nworld economic order continues to be marked by sharp\ndistortions between North and South. While the North\nenjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues\nto suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to\nthese ills are restrictive economic measures imposed\nunilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one\nexample  its principal victims are the most\nvulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to\nsupport the lifting of the embargo.\nThe international goal of reducing by one half, by\nthe year 2015, the percentage of the world population\nliving in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts,\nabove all by the wealthiest countries and international\nfinancial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary\nto relieve the burden of external debt, whose service\npayments alone absorb a large part of the financial\nresources of developing countries.\nAt the same time, steps will be necessary to\nattenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite\nthe fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community\nin international economic relations, globalization has\nbenefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped\ncountries. The structural adjustment programmes under\nway in many developing countries should take account\nof real necessities and specifics, because many of the\nmeasures imposed by the international financial\ninstitutions have caused serious difficulties, above all\nof a social nature.\nTo conclude my remarks, I would like to call\nattention to the need to pay more attention to the\neconomic situation of the African continent. This\nshould be done in such a way as to facilitate its\nintegration into the world market, particularly through\nthe transfer of technology and increasing productive\ninvestment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Theo-Ben\nGurirab, on his wise leadership of the fifty-fourth\nGeneral Assembly and his able preparation of the\nMillennium Summit. I would also like to offer the\nincoming President, Harri Holkeri, my best wishes\nupon your assumption of this high office. Your\ncommitment and experience will be invaluable in\nensuring the success of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nItaly fully supports the statement made on behalf\nof the European Union by the current President, French\nForeign Minister Hubert V\u00e9drine, and will make a\ndecided contribution to the objectives he has indicated.\nAllow me to add that it is also in order to step up our\ncommitment to achieving common goals that Italy is\npresenting its candidature for the Security Council for\nthe next biennium.\nThe year 2001 will be the United Nations Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations. By unanimously\nadopting the relevant resolution in its fifty-third\nsession, the General Assembly demonstrated its great\nsensitivity and attention to the profound structural\nchanges under way in our national societies. It thereby\nsent a strong signal on a number of themes that the\nSecretary-General has put forth in his report on the role\nof the Organization in the twenty-first century. These\nthemes cannot fail to include the new face of\ninternational migration, whose gravest aspects include\nillegal immigration and the trampling of human\ndignity.\nDialogue among civilizations should not be\naddressed in the abstract, academically. It demands real\ncontact and a bond between individuals and peoples.\nTo ensure that these contacts and this bond do not\nmutate into tensions and strife, the community of\nStates must try to understand and manage migratory\nphenomena. We must work together to prevent\nmigration flows from plunging into chaos, a chaos for\nwhich the human person ultimately has to pay the\nhighest price.\nMigration needs to be governed by fixed,\ntransparent rules. The source, the rationale of these\nrules is the United Nations, to which the San Francisco\nCharter in Article I, paragraph 3, entrusts the\nfundamental role:\n\u201cTo achieve international cooperation in solving\ninternational problems of an economic, social,\ncultural, or humanitarian character.\u201d\nI submit to you that today migration between or\nwithin continents has become an international problem\nwith an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\ncharacter.\nAny solution to the problems connected with\nmigration must come to terms with the globalization\nprocess. Globalization has reduced distance and time.\nTo an unprecedented degree it has linked countries at\nopposite ends of the earth. There are even those who\nspeak, perhaps not wrongly, of \u201cthe end of geography\u201d.\nThe paradox facing us stems from the real\ndifficulties of globalization extending not only to the\neconomy, finance and information but also to the\nmovements of peoples. Most of these difficulties can\nbe ascribed to the complex transition of many advanced\ncountries to multi-ethnic and multicultural societies.\nHuman beings are not commodities. When\nindividuals move, they preserve their roots, their\nspecificity and their experience, even when they come\ninto permanent contact with societies different from\ntheir own. Hence the need for mutual tolerance, to\nsafeguard our respective customs and traditions.\n9\n\nThe growing dimensions of migration have\nwidened the gap between individual government's\nmanagement capabilities and the individual person's\nability to move, which is heavily influenced by\nprogress in communications. All too often this gap is\nfilled by organized crime, by ruthless criminals who, in\nsome cases, traffic in human beings, in what amounts\nto a modern form of slavery.\nWe need to ask how we can safeguard freedom\nwhile impeding slavery; how we can prevent global\neconomic development from sparking social tensions;\nhow we can ensure that the growing contact between\ndifferent civilizations will produce dialogue rather than\nintolerance. It will take a strong, determined\ncommitment from all of us to draft rules that, if\napplied, can have a positive impact on international\nmigration flows, to the benefit of both home and host\ncountries.\nImproving millions of human lives is the\nfundamental challenge of development: we need a\nclear, explicit and effective commitment to eradicate\npoverty. We must realize that in a globalized world,\nmigration can gradually impoverish areas that are\nalready economically and socially disadvantaged.\nDevelopment assistance initiatives from\nindustrialized countries and non-governmental\norganizations alike cannot defeat misery and poverty,\nunless they are accompanied by an awareness that\nforeign debt is a huge burden for Governments,\nfamilies and individuals. Generous remission of the\npoorest countries' debt is not just an option: I feel it is\na must. This is why the Italian Parliament recently\napproved a law to reduce foreign debt owed to Italy by\na total of $6 billion over the next three years.\nItaly will also play a pro-active role in urging the\nleading actors in the field of development assistance to\nshow determination in preparing the conference on\nless-developed countries scheduled to take place in\nBrussels next May. Moreover, my country confirms its\nsupport for the needs and aspirations of the small-\nisland States and the landlocked countries, as it has\nemphasized in the Economic and Social Council and\nother forums.\nBut debt reduction is not enough. It should be\ncoupled with sound government policies in the\nbeneficiary countries, as part of an integrated strategy\nunderlying a new international social contract. In other\nwords, we must promote a package that combines\nresponsible political, economic and social reforms with\nan opening-up of international markets. The 2001 high-\nlevel intergovernmental meeting on financing for\ndevelopment will provide us with a close opportunity\nto finalize a strategy.\nThe fears that immigration sometimes generates\nshould not lead industrialized countries to build new\nwalls and fences. Such fears reject contact with\ndiversity and make some feel as if they were strangers\nin their own country. A Europe built on fear, for\nexample, would ultimately cast immigrants as the\nimaginary enemy, as a race apart. Any effort to\novercome such negative stereotyping should be\napplauded, such as the Conference against Racism,\nscheduled for 2001 in Pretoria.\nThe European Union has a great capacity to take\nin people, and already has large immigrant\ncommunities. But only now is it developing a common\napproach to immigration. The European Union's\nstrategy relies on cooperation with other countries,\nsince the issue cannot be addressed solely through\nborder patrols and tougher repression of illegal\nimmigration, regardless of the cost.\nFor many years Europe did not have to worry\nabout the long-term consequences of immigration. But\ntoday, with a declining birth rate and an ageing\npopulation, Europe needs a strategy that embraces the\ncomplex process of integrating people from different\nregions of the world.\nThen, there is the tragic, heinous trafficking in\nhuman beings. As the United States Secretary of State\nMadeleine Albright stated in this Assembly, we must\nput a stop to this trafficking, a stop to boats being cast\ninto the sea, filled with sadness and desperation, driven\nby hopes in a promised land. The pictures of these\nillegal crossings have become unbearable. They\nepitomize a state of affairs governed by the black\nmarket, where there is an over-abundance of illegal\nlabour. This new form of piracy would be impossible if\nthose involved knew that they could not count on\ncollusion, safe havens and, all too often, impunity.\nFor example, the Mediterranean Sea, around\nwhich great civilizations have prospered, is being\ncrossed by people who pay ruthless exploiters and\nsometimes become their victims. In many cases, illegal\nimmigrants find it hard to gain access to the rule-of-\nlaw society, and end up being treated as commodities.\n10\n\nAs we know, immigration has various causes:\npoverty, ethnic and religious strife, the repression of\ntotalitarian regimes, and the demands of more affluent\neconomies. Today, as never before, immigration is\ndriven by broadcast images that often distort honest\nhopes for a better life. Moreover, it has reached\nunprecedented proportions. In fact, since the early\neighties the number of countries that receive\nimmigrants has risen from 39 to 67, while the number\nof countries of emigration has risen from 29 to 55. We\nwould be fooling ourselves to think that a phenomenon\nof such proportions could be brought under control\nsolely through bilateral agreements.\nThe European Union has made cooperation\nbetween national Governments a priority since the\nEuropean Council meeting of October 1999. But recent\nexperience points to the need for an approach in which\nonly the United Nations can confer the indispensable\ncharacter of universality.\nItaly has much to share in this regard. Until a few\ndecades ago, large sections of our population were\nforced to seek work in distant lands with different\nlanguages and traditions. Their lives were often marked\nby hardship, want and family separation. This chapter\nof social history had points of light and of darkness,\nbut on the whole it was a source of great moral and\nspiritual wealth.\nStarting in the early 1970s, Italy became a land of\nimmigration, although it could not yet provide full\nemployment for all its people. As a land of both\nemigration and immigration, Italy is well situated to\naddress in a constructive manner global migration\ntoday. Italian domestic law is based on the principle of\n\u201csoft integration\u201d, designed to provide permanent\nresidents with an opportunity that does not force them\nto renounce the rich heritage of their native cultures.\nIt is on these grounds that, here before the\nGeneral Assembly, I urge the United Nations to raise\nthe awareness of the community of States and\nintroduce appropriate instruments. Three instruments,\nin my view. deserve to be coordinated and integrated.\nFirst is assistance to the developing countries;\nassistance in preventing and quelling the tensions that,\nat least in part, give rise to migration flows, as well as\nassistance in easing the integration of their economies\nwith those of the more advanced countries. As we all\nknow, this is a priority that the United Nations is\npursuing through various committees and through the\nenhanced role of the United Nations Development\nProgramme. We must strive to improve the instruments\nalready available to us, responding to the visionary\nproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\nSecondly, as a deterrent to illegal entry, we need\nstricter and more consistent law enforcement. Success\ndepends on effective cooperation between the countries\nof origin, the countries of transit and the countries of\narrival. Such efforts should also aim to prevent the\nspread of pockets of illegality and organized crime by\npromoting greater stability, moral authority and control\nin fledgling democracies. This would be invaluable to\nsecuring the support of public opinion in industrialized\ncountries for cooperation policies.\nThirdly, we need to manage migration so that it is\na source of stability and wealth, to the benefit of all.\nFor this to happen, migration must take place legally. If\neveryone complies with the law, immigrants will be\nwelcomed in their host countries and become fully\nintegrated into society.\nThese three guidelines must be set within a global\nframework. There are plenty of organizations that deal\nwith migration at the international level. Yet while they\nprovide praiseworthy services, their sectorial nature\nmeans that they cannot have the kind of overall vision\nthat only effective coordination can guarantee.\nA solidarity pact, therefore, is needed to find the\nbest and most effective way of balancing the supply of\nand demand for labour, while fully respecting the\ndiversity of the people concerned. The greatest\nchallenge in the age of globalization is to design new\nforms of cooperation between Governments that will\nenable each to see that its interests are reflected in\ninternational policy decisions. The United Nations\ncontinues to be the most natural forum for adopting\nsuch decisions and ensuring their implementation.\nI want to conclude my message today by recalling\nthe words of a great American President, John\nFitzgerald Kennedy. Almost 40 years ago he said,\n\u201cNow the trumpet summons us again ... to\nbear the burden of a long twilight struggle ...\nagainst the common enemies of man: tyranny,\npoverty, disease and war itself.\n\u201cCan we forge against these enemies a\ngrand and global alliance, North and South, East\nand West, that can ensure a more fruitful life for\n\n\nall mankind? Will you join in that historic\neffort?\u201d (Inaugural Address, 20 January 1961)\nThat is what he said, and this is the wish that I\nshould like to make here: that the United Nations,\nthrough its indispensable role, may strengthen its\ncontribution to creating a better and more just world\nwith the unflagging support of its membership."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Lesotho, I extend our most\nsincere congratulations to the President on his election\nto preside over the fifty-fifth session, and wish him\nevery success in the discharge of his duties. We are\nconfident that his personal, diplomatic and leadership\nqualities will guide us through the session, and assure\nhim of our support and cooperation at all times. Let me\nalso pay a well deserved tribute, and express our thanks\nand gratitude, to his predecessor, our colleague,\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia. We thank him\nin particular for his statesmanship, sterling guidance\nand effective organization during the difficult times of\nthe fifty-fourth session.\nWe also remain deeply indebted to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his continued dynamic\nleadership and commitment to our Organization, and\nfor his relentless efforts in achieving the Organization's\ngoals.\nThe admission of a new Member to our\nOrganization is always a moment of joy, and that of\nTuvalu is no exception.\n19\n\nThis, the first session of the General Assembly in\nthe new millennium, offers an opportunity for us to\nreflect on the challenges and threats we face as we\nenter the new century, a century that has ushered in a\nrevolution that future generations will likely\ncharacterize as one that had the greatest impact on\nhuman civilization since the advent of the telegraph,\nradio and television. The world is indeed witnessing a\nrevolution in the information systems and their\nintegration into the lives of men, women and children,\nleading to the term \u201cinformation age \u201c. The information\nage of the twenty-first century is taking root as it\nimpacts on the lives of all sectors of society at both the\nnational and international levels.\nThere can be no doubt that for some information\ntechnology and globalization are beginning to turn\ntheoretical possibilities into fact, as the use of\ncomputers and computer-dependent systems have\nresulted in improvements in basic health conditions and\nincreases in life expectancy, efficiency and\nproductivity, thus offering tremendous economic\npotential and prosperity. Unfortunately, the majority of\nothers who have been left out of that prosperity\ncontinue to live in conditions of extreme poverty,\nremain embroiled in unending conflicts and are\nravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other\ndiseases.\nThe challenge for the United Nations of the\ntwenty-first century is to eliminate those disparities by\nbringing poor countries into the digital age, thus\nmaking them extract value from globalization instead\nof watching globalization extract value from them.\nEducation remains the key for the attainment of these\nobjectives. In fact, our message from Lesotho here is:\neducation, education, education.\nA disturbing phenomenon for the international\ncommunity, and in particular for Africa, is that while\nthe rest of the world is experiencing an increased flow\nof financial resources Africa's development prospects\ncontinue to be hampered by unsustainable debt\nservicing obligations. Just as we have placed poverty\neradication at the centre of economic and social\ndevelopment, it is equally necessary to accord similar\nimportance to the debt problems of developing\ncountries. In our view, that would be a vital\ncontribution to the realization of the goal of halving the\nproportion of people whose income is less than $1 a\nday by 2015.\nLesotho falls into the category of countries that\nare not eligible for debt relief under the existing\nframework. In our Millennium Summit Declaration we\nmade pledges to grant more generous development\nassistance to poor countries that plan to apply their\nresources to poverty reduction and to deal\ncomprehensively with their debt problems. We need to\nconcretize these pledges by adopting measures to\naccelerate debt relief such as the cancellation of the\nofficial debt of those countries and the expansion of the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. This\nwould assist us in ensuring that by 2015 the majority of\nour people have access to safe drinking water, that all\nchildren complete a full course of primary education,\nand that joblessness is reduced among our youth. It\nwould also help us curb the spread of HIV/AIDS and\nassist the children orphaned by this scourge.\nThe Government of Lesotho adopted poverty\nreduction as its highest development priority in its\nsixth and seventh National Development Plans. We\nhave taken firm measures to reduce poverty. Based on\nour democratic dispensation and peaceful environment,\nwe have successfully embarked on an aggressive\ninvestment promotion campaign for job creation. I am\npleased to report that we are experiencing initial\nsuccess in attracting foreign investment.\nWe believe that South-South cooperation is an\nimportant tool for developing and strengthening the\neconomic independence of developing countries. To\nthis end, we in southern Africa have made modest but\nencouraging progress with respect to South-South\ncooperation by accelerating the entry into force of the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\nTrade Protocol, which encompasses deeper economic\ncooperation, cross-border investment and trade, free\nmovement of factors of production, and free movement\nof goods and services.\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries, to be held in Brussels next\nyear, is both timely and crucial. Since this body\nrecognized, some years ago, the least developed\ncountries as the poorest of the developing countries,\nthere has not yet been any improvement in the weak\neconomic situation of those countries, whose numbers\nhave instead increased from 25 in 1971, to 48 in 1997.\nLesotho therefore looks forward to the\nConference, which will review the internal constraints\nto the development of the least developed countries and\n20\n\nthe adequacy of international support measures in the\ncritical areas of official development assistance, debt\nrelief, market access and trade.\nThe High-level International Intergovernmental\nEvent on Financing for Development, to be held in\n2001, will come to naught unless we are resolved to\nundertake it armed with the requisite political\ncommitment and global solidarity to achieve our\ndevelopment goals nationally, regionally and\ninternationally.\nThe Government of Lesotho remains keenly\naware that good environmental management requires\nconcerted efforts from all members of the community.\nTherefore, we have established partnerships at the\ninternational, regional and national levels to address\nthe problems of environmental degradation. We believe\nthat the environment is too important an issue to be left\nin the hands of one Organization. In this regard, we\nlook forward to the process of the 10-year review of\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED), at which we will share our\nexperiences with, and learn from, our counterparts in\nthe international community.\nRegarding the integrated and coordinated\nimplementation of, and follow-up to, the major United\nNations conferences and summits, my delegation\nvalues the review meetings because they offer us the\nopportunity to evaluate our performance and to\nconsider the way forward. They also rekindle our\npolitical commitment to achieving global\ndevelopmental goals. We therefore feel that the review\nprocess should continue in the twenty-first century,\nwith a stronger emphasis on the evaluation of\nachievements and constraints.\nLike globalization of the economy, globalization\nof human rights cannot be avoided. Today human rights\nare well established as the legitimate concern of all\nhumanity. If, as the world agreed in Vienna in 1993,\n\u201cthe promotion and protection of all human rights\nis a legitimate concern of the international\ncommunity\u201d (A/CONF/157/24,chapter III, section\nI, para.4),\nthis calls for a more pragmatic approach in identifying\npertinent situations requiring the protection of\nhumanity, including in situations where a state has\ncollapsed or disintegrated.\nAmong the promising developments as we begin\nthe century is the growing world consensus on the need\nto stop impunity by punishing those responsible for\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, as\nevidenced by the number of signatories and\nratifications to the Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt (ICC). This momentum has rekindled our hope\nfor peace and for an end to the persistence of human\nrights violations. Lesotho's ratification of the ICC\nStatute is a further clear indication of its commitment\nto the protection of human rights and to bringing to\njustice all those who commit gross violations of these\nrights.\nAs we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations Fourth World Conference on Women,\nwe must be reminded that the goal of gender equality is\nfar from being achieved. Despite pessimistic forecasts,\nand despite different evaluations of the achievements\nof the special session on women, the Beijing + 5\nconference's adoption of a final document proposing a\nseries of actions and initiatives in the 12 critical areas\nidentified in Beijing is an indication of the\ninternational community's renewed commitment to\nwomen's rights. Implementation of the norms\nenshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women remains\ncritical for the attainment of the goals set in Beijing.\nAs technology brings the peoples of the world\ncloser together, thus removing political and other\nbarriers, societies continue to be ravaged by racial\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and other forms of\nintolerance, exemplified by \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, racial\nhatred and new forms of slavery. A challenge for the\nUnited Nations is to define goals and global strategies\nfocused on urgent and effective measures to eliminate\nracial discrimination and ethnic conflicts. Lesotho thus\nwelcomes the convening of the World Conference\nagainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\nand Related Intolerance, to be held in South Africa in\n2001. This Conference will offer an opportunity for us\nto develop action-oriented measures to rid the world of\nthese scourges.\nPreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2014 nuclear, chemical and biological \u2014\nremains one of the most important tasks facing\nhumankind in the twenty-first century, as these\nweapons remain a major threat to world peace. The\npursuit of arms reduction and the challenge of\nachieving sustainable disarmament thus remain the\n21\n\nonly bulwark against the use or threat of use of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nWhile we welcome the nuclear-weapon States'\nundertaking to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, their\nfailure to agree to a specific timetable for doing so is\nregrettable. The challenge is to translate these\nundertakings into concrete actions to eliminate all\nnuclear dangers. We thus support the Secretary-\nGeneral's call for a new international conference on\neliminating nuclear dangers as a means of advancing\nour disarmament goals. We also remain convinced of\nthe need and desirability of convening a special session\nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nThanks to the efforts of all actors, both\ngovernmental and non-governmental, the world is\nbeginning to witness tangible results as the production,\ntrade and use of landmines slowly drops, thus lowering\nthe number of casualties. This, however, should not\nlead to any complacency, as evidence of the use of\nmines in some conflict areas, particularly in Africa,\ncontinues to surface. We look forward to a day when\nthe world will be free of these weapons and encourage\nall those who continue to use mines, as well as those\nwho remain outside the Convention banning landmines,\nto heed the rapidly growing international and regional\nmomentum for the ban on those weapons.\nLesotho supports the convening of a United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects in June and July\n2001, as mandated by General Assembly resolution\n54/54. We share the view that the outcome of the\nConference should be a global action plan with specific\ntimetables for the implementation of commitments on\nissues such as codes of conduct, legislative and\nregulatory measures, control, enforcement,\ntransparency, and tracing measures and mechanisms.\nThe proliferation of armed conflicts in Africa\ncontinues to hamper efforts to achieve progress in\neconomic and social development. The lack of political\nwill to find lasting solutions to ongoing conflicts and\nthe emergence of new ones continues to effectively\ncripple the productive activities of those countries as\nwell as further erode the poor social infrastructure that\nexists in many countries. The illicit trade in arms,\ndiamonds and other natural resources, as well as the\ndiversion of resources from development to military\nactivities, continue to fuel these conflicts, thus\nundermining democracy and development.\nThe challenge for Africa remains the management\nand resolution of conflicts, the avoidance of war and\nthe strengthening of democratic institutions. These are\nenormous challenges which require Africa's\ncommitment to stability and the rule of law, but, above\nall, they require strong political will on the part of the\nAfricans themselves and resources from the\ninternational community to reinforce democratic\ngovernment, to deter attempts to overthrow it and even\nto reinstate it where it has been overthrown by illegal\nmeans.\nWe in Lesotho have bitter experience of attempts\nto overthrow a legally and democratically elected\nGovernment. Thanks to our SADC partners, order has\nbeen restored in Lesotho and the Government is\nvigorously pursuing a programme of reconstruction,\nwhich includes the creation of a climate of political\nreconciliation on which the consolidation of\ndemocratic gains and democratic culture can rest. The\nGovernment of Lesotho remains fully committed to\ndeveloping a culture of democracy, good governance,\nobservance of human rights and constitutionality. The\ninternational community's assistance remains\nindispensable to the success of these efforts. We\ntherefore stand solidly behind the position held by the\nOrganization of African Unity, SADC and the\nCommonwealth of disallowing Governments that come\ninto power by illegal means from participating in our\ncouncils. This should include our councils in the\nUnited Nations.\nDespite positive steps being taken by the\nGovernment of Angola to stabilize the situation in that\ncountry, peace continues to elude the people of Angola\nbecause of the non-fulfilment by Jonas Savimbi of the\nLusaka Protocol. We urge the international community\nto observe all Security Council resolutions against\nUNITA and to fully cooperate with the United Nations\nto ensure the effective implementation of sanctions\nagainst UNITA.\nWe appeal to all parties to the Congolese conflict\nto honour their obligations under the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement and to lend their support to the process of\ninternal dialogue under the facilitation of Sir Ketumile\nMasire of Botswana.\nWe support all measures aimed at ending the\nillicit trade in diamonds in Sierra Leone and applaud\nthe Economic Community of West African States for\nits efforts to bring peace to that country. We are\n22\n\ngratified to see the cessation of hostilities between\nEthiopia and Eritrea and call on both parties to that\nconflict to redouble their efforts for a lasting peace. We\nalso urge all armed groups in Burundi to fully and\neffectively participate in the negotiations so as to\nfacilitate the speedy conclusion of a ceasefire\nagreement and a comprehensive peace accord. We look\nforward to the conclusion of the process in Western\nSahara so that the people of that country can freely\ndetermine their own future.\nWe reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to\nexercise their inalienable rights and we urge parties to\nthe Middle East peace process to redouble their efforts\nto find durable peace in the Middle East.\nThe real test for the United Nations in this\ncentury is how far it is prepared to go in addressing all\nthese challenges and how far it will go in turning\npromises into reality, thus enabling the large majority\nof the people of the world to fulfil their potential and\nrealize their aspirations. While we appreciate the\nmagnitude of these challenges, we continue to have\nfaith in the United Nations capacity to solve global\nproblems, its broad universal support and its ability to\nuphold and reaffirm our shared values of peace, equity,\nsocial justice, democracy and human rights.\n\n\n\n\n"

Your vast experience in\ninternational affairs will greatly aid in our deliberations\nduring this fifth-fifth session of the Assembly. We are\nenriched by the presence of our newest Member, the\nRepublic of Tuvalu; we welcome Tuvalu to our United\nNations family with the assurance of Belize's cooperation\nand support.\nThe recently concluded Summit, which produced a\nprogressive and far-reaching resolution, has set the pace for\nour deliberations during this general debate. Although the\ngoals are ambitious, their achievement is crucial to the\nfuture of the United Nations. In his brief address to the\nSummit, my Prime Minister stated:\n\u201cwe are called to a new appointment with history: to\nbring democracy to global governance, to share a\nbetter and more productive future where all can live\nin dignity and peace.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nTogether with the goals put forward in the Declaration, this\nsets before us an agenda for our way forward.\nIn moving forward, we must begin by rededicating\nourselves to upholding the fundamental principles of our\nCharter, principles which seek freedom from fear and want\nin a world where discrimination and hate are eradicated and\nthe right of all people to live peaceful, quality lives is\nrealized.\nThese ideas are as relevant today as they were 55\nyears ago. Despite the many advances we have made, many\nof us continue to allow our differences to lead to conflict,\nwhich results in overwhelming suffering and hinders\nhuman development. We must avoid these costly conflicts,\nfor without peace we cannot grow.\nAt its inception, this institution recognized that peace\nand the elimination of war were essential to human\ndevelopment. Although we seem to have reduced the\nlikelihood of another global conflagration, we continue, at\nthe regional and local levels, to allow our differences to\ndivide us, resulting in overwhelming suffering, which\nfurther hinders progress and development.\nAs a global institution, we must actively work to end\nall conflict. Our peacekeeping efforts must therefore be\nproactive and efficient. Our forces must protect innocent\nwomen and children; provide refuge to those who seek to\npromote principles of democracy; and rise up against rogue\nindividuals and organizations that threaten to undermine\ndemocratic Governments. To achieve this, let us first\ncommit ourselves to reinforcing the preventive capacity of\nthe United Nations peacekeeping forces.\n2\n\nBelize regards peacekeeping operations as an\nimportant component of the United Nations. We agree that\nfor our forces to be effective, they must be well equipped\nand capable of defending themselves. We continue to meet\nthe financial commitments assigned to Belize based on the\nprinciple of capacity to pay. We welcome the recent\nBrahimi report, which is progressive and takes a\ncomprehensive look at our peacekeeping efforts. My\ndelegation supports the recommendations it advances.\nBelize adheres to the principle of the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts, and in this spirit continues to work\nwith Guatemala to arrive at a negotiated and peaceful\nresolution of our differences. Belize will comply with the\nrecently agreed framework established through the\nOrganization of American States.\nFor some time now, this institution has engaged in a\nconversation on development for the future and, more\nspecifically, on globalization. For developing countries,\nglobalization, as it exists today, poses serious concerns that\nseem to fall on the deaf ears of those who continue to push\nus along what is obviously a destructive path. While we\nwelcome the promises of this new economic order, we\ncontinue to fear globalization in its current form, for what\nwe have seen so far is neither responsible nor sustainable. It\nis not sustainable because those who lead the way seek only\nthe advancement of their personal interests.\nThe proponents of globalization advised that market\nliberalization would lead to prosperity. We were\nencouraged to transform our economies and create more\neffective and efficient government. We have tried, and\ncontinue to try, to do so. However, our call for assistance\nwith this transformation has not always been heard.\nHowever, much of what has been asked of most of us, we\nhave done. The fact that today in Central America and the\nCaribbean every nation is legislated by a democratically\nelected Government and that we have opened our borders,\nmarkets and lifestyles to others, demonstrates our\ncommitment to transparency and effective governance.\nIn Belize, we have done our part to ensure equitable\ndevelopment. We enjoy a vibrant and working democracy\nwhere 85 per cent of our voting population exercise their\nfranchise to vote; we have an open economy where all are\nencouraged to participate; and we have formed partnerships\nwith civil society to address social needs and protect our\nprecious environment. We have been responsible, yet all\nwe see of globalization is the threat of the elimination of\nour current economic sustenance. If this is the legacy of\nglobalization, then those of us who have suffered at the\nhands of this new order must ask if globalization today is\nresponsible, if it is good. We continue to believe that it can\nbe.\n(spoke in Spanish)\nIn the current economic order, small economies such\nas ours can aspire to a productive future only if the\narchitects of this new modality provide us with the\nnecessary assistance. Developed countries must commit\nthemselves to a process of globalization that is not only\nfree, but fair. Just as they request the opening up of our\nmarkets, such institutions and the administrators of\nglobalization must be more open, democratic and\nrepresentative. Thus, just as we work with civil society to\nhelp us to deal with our political and social needs, they\nmust work together with the international civil agencies so\nthat the needs of the poorest can be provided for. We will\nnever achieve the objective of just world if poverty\ncontinues to affect our people. The eradication of poverty is\nour moral duty.\n(spoke in English)\nWe agree that true sustainable development cannot\noccur without the protection and preservation of our\nenvironment. This must be a path that combines the efforts\nof all nations. We in Belize understand that we have a\nglobal responsibility to protect our natural resources. That\nis why we are signatories to the Framework Convention on\nClimate Change and are in the process of signing the Kyoto\nProtocol. However, our efforts can be effective only if\nothers are equally committed. We encourage our developed\npartners to continue to honour the commitments they made\nin Rio to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a\ntimely manner. Currently, over 40 per cent of Belizean land\nis under protected status, our precious coral reefs are\nclosely monitored and our tropical rain forests carefully\nmanaged. Together with local non-governmental\norganizations, we are seeking an adequate balance between\nthe protection of our natural resources and the fulfilment of\nthe development needs of our people, while agreeing that\nour environmental protectionism must work in harmony\nwith our developmental needs.\nMuch has been accomplished over the past year. On\nsocial issues, we reaffirmed our commitment to the\ndevelopment of women during the Beijing + 5 conference.\nThe Copenhagen + 5 conference addressed the need for\ngreater social development and, together with our partners\nin the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Belize actively\nparticipated in the Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n3\n\n(NPT). Belize continues to push for an end to the shipping\nof nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea.\nThese successes, however, should not distract us from\nthe suffering and injustices still being endured by millions\nof people. In Africa the situation in Angola, Sierra Leone\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerns us.\nThe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is alarming; we must do\nwhat is necessary to assist those afflicted.\nWe are troubled by the situation in Timor. The\nrecent events, which resulted in the death of United\nNations peacekeeping personnel, were tragic. We also\nlearned of the death of another United Nations official\nin Guinea. We condemn these acts, and join with the\nSecretary-General in expressing our condolences to the\nfamilies of those who gave their lives for the cause of\npeace.\nBelize joins others in support of the Middle East\npeace process. We continue to support the right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination. Likewise, we\ncall upon this Organization to recognize the desire of\nthe 23 million people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan for the opportunity to contribute and participate\nin the work of this Organization and other international\nbodies.\nThe Millennium Declaration, adopted by our\nheads of State and Government, reminds us of our\nresponsibility to protect those fundamental values such\nas freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for\nnature and responsibility. It calls for collective action\nto be undertaken by developed and developing nations\nto advance the cause of peace, protect our children and\npreserve the planet for future generations. These are\ngoals that can be achieved through greater inclusion\nand genuine concern for each other. We must find new\nways of thinking to help us reform these institutions,\nwhich create inequality and therefore divide us. Let us\ncommit ourselves to reducing redundancy, eliminating\nwaste and refining our responsiveness to Member\nneeds, but let us do it quickly.\nThe United Nations is our truest form of global\nrepresentation. It possesses the capacity to elicit the\nbest from all of us. Together, our ability to accomplish\nthese ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration is\npossible. Let us rededicate ourselves to its fulfilment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset allow me to convey to\nMr. Holkeri our congratulations on his election as\nPresident of this session of the General Assembly,\nexpressing our full confidence in him and wishing him\nevery possible success. This session has special\nimportance for Palestine and we hope that during its\nproceedings and under his leadership historic steps will\nbe taken in our favour. I should also like to thank His\nExcellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of the\nfifty-fourth session, a fighter for freedom and a fighter\nfor peace, for his excellent leadership during the course\nof the past year. I would be remiss if I failed to seize\nthe opportunity to express our special thanks to\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\nNations, for his effective leadership and for his special\ninterest in the situation in the Middle East and the\npeace process there.\nAs we meet in the wake of the Millennium\nSummit, it is incumbent upon us to seek to build upon\n22\n\nits outcome beginning with implementing the\nMillennium Declaration and adopting it as a guide for\nour work in the next era. This should be the case not\nonly with regard to globalization and future social and\neconomic issues, but also with regard to one of the\nmain tasks not fully achieved during the past era  \nnamely, the achievement of self-determination by\npeoples under colonial domination and foreign\noccupation. That task will not be fully achieved until\nIsraeli occupation comes to an end and the Palestinian\nState has been established in accordance with\ninternational legitimacy. For us this is the step\nnecessary to place ourselves side by side with other\nmember States on the road to development, democracy\nand prosperity and so that we may be allowed to carry\nour small share of responsibility towards the\ninternational community and its future tasks.\nAs President Yasser Arafat mentioned in his\naddress to the Millennium Summit, the Palestine\nCentral Council met to consider the situation as the\nagreed date between the Palestinian and Israeli sides\nfor reaching a final status agreement, 13 September\n2000, approached; that date was also the deadline of\nthe agreed-upon extension of the five-year interim\nperiod that originally ended on 4 May 1999. The\nPalestine Central Council addressed this situation with\na high level of responsibility towards our people and\ntowards the peace process and took a difficult decision\nseeking a balance between the natural and historic\nrights of the Palestinian people to their State, based on\nthe partition resolution 181 (II) and in accordance with\nthe Declaration of Independence of 1988 and our right\nto establish this State at the end of the interim period,\non the one hand, and preserving what some have called\nthe last chance for the peace process and for reaching\nan agreement between the two sides through an\nadditional extension and the decision to continue the\nnegotiations for the next five or six weeks on the other.\nThe Council thus decided to delay the establishment of\nthe State and at the same time mandated the Executive\nCommittee and the presidency of the Palestine National\nCouncil and the Legislative Council to take the\nnecessary steps in this regard, including completion of\nthe constitutional declaration and laws for presidential\nand parliamentary elections, as well as the submission\nof an application for membership for the State of\nPalestine in the United Nations, followed by a report\non these steps to the Central Council no later than 15\nNovember 2000, the anniversary of the Declaration of\nIndependence.\nThat decision means first and foremost our desire\nand commitment to reach an agreement with the Israeli\nside if that side is truly ready for that. Secondly, it also\nmeans the agreement by the Palestinian side to\npostpone the establishment of the State, not only until\nthe end of the transitional period and its extension, but\nuntil the end of the realistic opportunity for achieving a\npossible final agreement at the present time. We\nbelieve that no one can expect us to go beyond that and\naccept the continuation of the present transitional\nsituation that is impossible to endure. We further\nbelieve that all States, including those that have\nadvised us to postpone, will understand this and will\nthus be ready to provide the necessary support for our\nsteps, including support for the application of Palestine\nfor membership in the United Nations.\nThe assumption of power by the current Israeli\nGovernment was coupled with a chorus of positive\nvoices that led to increased hope for rapid and honest\nimplementation of the agreements signed by the two\nsides aimed at achieving a final agreement in the\nagreed time. We honestly wanted to believe this and\ndealt with that Government positively and with full\ncommitment to the agreements. But the stubborn\nrealities began to impose themselves on the ground,\nregardless of the wishes and the artificial positive\nvoices. The current Government did not implement any\nof the provisions of these agreements except those\nprovisions that the former Government had explicitly\ncommitted itself to in implementation of the Wye River\nMemorandum of October 1998. This Government has\nnot carried out one centimetre of redeployment more\nthan Mr. Netanyahu had committed himself to, and it\nhas also failed to carry out the third redeployment.\nIllegal settlements, which are destructive to the peace\nprocess, have continued, even in Jabal Abu Ghneim,\nwhich was the reason the General Assembly convened\nits tenth emergency special session. A number of other\nillegal measures and practices have also continued,\ncreating a negative and tense climate. Amidst all of\nthat, final status negotiations started and we witnessed\nIsraeli foot-dragging and procrastination that we could\nnot understand and that has led to more doubts and\ntension.\nThen came the Camp David Summit, for which\nthorough preparation was needed before being\nconvened, something that was not accepted by the\nIsraeli side. Despite everything, the Summit\nrepresented a very important opportunity to move into\n23\n\na new, serious phase of negotiations through the\npersonal involvement of President Bill Clinton and his\nSecretary of State and the rest of his team. We highly\nappreciate all the efforts made for the success of the\nSummit. For our part, we spared no effort in the same\ndirection. However, we believe that Israel's lack of\nreadiness to comply with the terms of reference of the\npeace process prevented the success of such efforts.\nIn the wake of the Summit a campaign was\nlaunched by some parties and some biased media\norganizations to absolve the Israeli side of its\nresponsibility and to place undue pressure on the\nPalestinian side. For example, some say that the Israeli\nside progressed from its original positions during the\nnegotiations more than the Palestinian side. That is\nfactually incorrect, in addition to being the wrong\nyardstick to apply. It is incorrect because the\nPalestinian side has progressed from its original\nposition more than the Israeli side, but that happened\nwith the start of the peace process and the acceptance\nof the bases of such a process. The Palestinian side has\naccepted, despite the historic injustice, establishing its\nState in accordance with the partition plan, which gave\nus less than half of mandated Palestine, and has\naccepted as the basis for settlement Security Council\nresolution 242 (1967), which gives us less than a\nquarter of mandated Palestine. Is there a more\nmomentous concession than this? Is it possible to\nforget that and only look at positions taken during the\nCamp David negotiations, regardless of the past?\nIt is also the wrong yardstick to apply because the\nappropriate yardstick should be the closeness of the\nsides to the agreed basis of the peace process and their\ncommitment to Security Council resolution 242 (1967),\nthe implementation of which is the goal of the peace\nprocess, and not the extent of their movement from\noriginal positions, especially if such positions were\nillegal and irrational. Needless to say, the Palestinian\nside has fully adhered to this resolution and has never\nattempted to circumvent it, whereas the Israeli side has\nnever stopped pursuing positions violating that\nresolution and aiming to usurp more and more\nPalestinian land and rights.\nLet us have another look at the positions of the\nparties on some specific issues, so that all may be\naware of the details of the situation. With regard to\nJerusalem, the first kiblah and the third of the holy\nsanctuaries and the cradle of Jesus Christ, the other\nside claims that it made substantial concessions while\nthe Palestinians did not. It also claims that we have not\nshown enough sensitivity towards the holy sites\npertaining to Judaism. All of this is incorrect. The\nsigned agreements state that Jerusalem will be an issue\nfor negotiation, which means the whole of\nJerusalem \u2014 occupied East Jerusalem and West\nJerusalem, which is under de facto Israeli control. For\nour part, we have accepted that West Jerusalem shall be\nunder Israeli sovereignty and become the capital of\nIsrael. We have demanded the end of the occupation of\nEast Jerusalem so that it may come under Palestinian\nsovereignty and be the capital of Palestine. We have\naccepted that the city shall be open, and have accepted\nall kinds of guarantees for freedom of conscience,\nworship and access to all holy places under Palestinian\nsovereignty. In return for such flexibility, Israel is not\nsatisfied with recognized sovereignty over West\nJerusalem, but seeks also to usurp parts of occupied\nEast Jerusalem.\nWith regard to the Jewish holy places, we fully\nrespect their sacredness, and Islam recognizes the three\nmonotheistic religions \u2014 Judaism, Christianity and\nIslam \u2014 and all their prophets. Thus, we have shown\nevery possible flexibility, even with regard to those\nplaces on lands in occupied East Jerusalem, to which\nresolution 242 (1967) is applicable. We have accepted\nthat the Western Wall of Al-Haram Al-Sharif, which is\nknown to the Arabs and Muslims as Al-Buraq Wall and\nto the Israelis and Jews as the Wailing Wall, shall be\nplaced under Israeli control, bearing in mind its\nsacredness to Judaism and consistent with the situation\nsince the British mandate on Palestine. In return for our\nflexibility Israel not only seeks sovereignty over the\nWestern Wall, but further challenges our sovereignty\nover Al-Haram Al-Sharif and seeks to maintain some\nform of sovereignty over it, something that will not be\naccepted by any Palestinian, Arab or Muslim leader,\nnot now and not in the future.\nWe have recently taken a major additional step in\nthis regard by indicating our readiness to accept a\ncertain mechanism for ensuring that no excavations are\nconducted under Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or even our\nreadiness to accept Muslim sovereignty over Al-Haram\nAl-Sharif through the Al-Quds Committee of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). This\nrepresents the utmost that can be done in terms of\ndealing with an Arab and Muslim trust over Palestinian\nland.\n24\n\nWith regard to another important issue, namely,\nPalestinian refugees and their rights, the Palestinian\nside has upheld their rights in accordance with\ninternational law, like any other refugees in the world,\nand in accordance with relevant United Nations\nresolutions, in particular resolution 194 (III), including\ntheir right to return and to compensation. At the same\ntime, we have shown our readiness to accept specific\nimplementation mechanisms to be agreed upon. In\nreturn for our flexibility, Israel refuses to recognize its\nresponsibility for this human tragedy and refuses to\nrecognize the rights of the refugees, including their\nright to return, and wants only to compensate them, and\neven that at the expense of others and not in its\ncapacity as the party that seized their lands and\nproperties. Yesterday the Assembly heard Israel's\nspokesman repeat what has been said, attempting not\nonly to deny Israel's responsibility but also denying the\nindividual property of the refugees, more than 5.5\nmillion dunams of land, legal and full property of\nindividuals. The Acting Foreign Minister attempted to\nput an end to that in an address to the Assembly.\nThe third important issue is that of settlements\nand borders. We have affirmed that settlements are\nillegal and must not be built on Palestinian lands.\nFurthermore, Israel must withdraw to the armistice\nlines of 1949, which are commonly known as the lines\nof 4 June 1967. At the same time, and in order to\nresolve some of the demographic problems illegally\ncreated by Israel, we have shown our readiness to\naccept changes in the border lines on the basis of full\nreciprocity. In return for such flexibility, Israel still\nattempts to appropriate more land and to annex other\nparts of occupied Palestinian territory. However, we\ngenerally feel, or at least hope, that the differences on\nthis and the remaining issues are less sharp than the\ndifferences I indicated regarding the two previous ones,\nand it is hoped this might signify a real change in the\nIsraeli position regarding all issues.\nWe have not lost hope yet. We are still committed\nto the peace process and to serious and continuous\nnegotiations in the coming weeks. Yet this morning we\nwere surprised to hear the spokesman of the Israeli\nGovernment announce that the negotiations are\nsuspended. We hope that the Israeli positions are\ntactical and that the Israeli side will in the final\nanalysis respect its commitment to the bases of the\npeace process. We want an agreement, an agreement\nthat will remove us from the cycle of confrontation and\nthat will carry forward both sides, and the entire region\nand its future generations, to a new era. Such an\nagreement must be balanced, reasonable and based on\ninternational law, the basis of the peace process. This\nrequires a continuation of the necessary efforts and\nunbiased support of the two cosponsors of the peace\nprocess, particularly the United States of America,\nother concerned parties in the region, the European\nUnion and interested parties throughout the world. We\nare ready and look forward to such a historic agreement\nbetween the two States, Palestine and Israel.\nDuring the Millennium Summit much was said\nabout the United Nations and its past and future role.\nWe wish to add that the United Nations is\nindispensable when it comes to the question of\nPalestine and the situation in the Middle East. We have\nalways emphasized the permanent responsibility of the\nUnited Nations for the question of Palestine until it is\neffectively resolved in all its aspects, and while we\nalways called for more United Nations involvement in\nthe Middle East peace process, others have attempted\nto exclude and neutralize it. We are convinced that in\nthe coming decisive period the role of the United\nNations will become more important, no matter what\nthe circumstances. If we were, God forbid, to arrive at\na dead end despite all our strenuous efforts for the\nsuccess of the peace process, then we would come to\nthe United Nations and expect to receive its protection\nand support. We will work to obtain membership and to\ncontribute to the resolutions of the United Nations, the\nestablished committees and the relevant programmes so\nthat all might provide an additional boost for the\nachievement of our people's legitimate rights,\nincluding their right to the establishment of their\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital, after\nsuch a long period of trial and tribulation.\nIf our hope is fulfilled and we are successful in\nreaching a final agreement with our neighbours, then\nwe expect that the need for the United Nations and its\norgans will be greater. The United Nations\nresponsibility in all its forms will continue until the\nend of the implementation period and there will be a\nneed to legitimize some aspects of the agreement and\nperhaps to complement them. There will also be a need\nfor United Nations assistance during the\nimplementation period with regard to many aspects, in\nparticular with regard to Palestinian refugees, including\nthe continuation of the work of the United Nations\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\n25\n\nNear East. We will then propose the specific\nreactivation of the United Nations Conciliation\nCommission for Palestine, which was established by\nresolution 194 (III) and is composed of the United\nStates, France and Turkey, and the use of the records of\nthe Commission related to land ownership in Palestine.\nThese records were updated by the United Nations\nSecretariat, in cooperation with the Committee on the\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\nPeople, and can now be used. In any case, the need for\nthe United Nations will increase, and we call for\npreparedness for that eventuality.\nThere are other aspects of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict that must be resolved in order for a\ncomprehensive peace to be achieved in the region. In\nthis context, we reaffirm the necessity of reactivating\nthe Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process as well as\nthe need for Israel to accept the principle of full\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the\nlines of 4 June 1967. We declare our solidarity with our\nsister country, Syria, and support its just demands,\nincluding Israeli adherence to the terms of reference of\nthe peace process. We also express our great happiness\nat the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. We\ncongratulate the brotherly Lebanese people on the\nliberation of their territories and support their other\ndemands regarding the achievement of peace between\nLebanon and Israel. In this context, we affirm our\nagreement with regard to rejecting the resettlement of\nPalestinian refugees in Lebanon and the need for them\nto return to their homes, and, until then, we expect\nthem to benefit from normal living conditions.\nWith regard to Arab national security and the\nprinciple of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we\nreaffirm the need for Israel to accede to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to put\nall its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. We also support\nattempts aimed at establishing a region free from\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and\nbelieve this to be an essential condition for establishing\na new reality in the region, which we all seek to\nachieve.\nIn the context of the wider Arab region, the\nsuffering of the brotherly Iraqi people is still a source\nof real concern for us all. We call for a speedy end to\ntheir suffering. We also call for the total lifting of\nsanctions imposed on sisterly Libya and brotherly\nSudan. We also call for the peaceful settlement of the\nissue of the three islands between the United Arab\nEmirates and Iran in a way that preserves the rights of\nthe United Arab Emirates in these islands. We also\nexpress our happiness for the recent steps taken in\nSomalia and express our hope that the stability and\nreconciliation process will continue. We reaffirm the\nneed for efforts to be made to resolve problems\neverywhere, including, inter alia, those of Cyprus, of\nthe great African continent, particularly the Horn of\nAfrica, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nof some of the surrounding countries. The resolution of\nsuch problems will represent an important contribution\ntowards placing that continent on the road to\ndevelopment and progress.\nBefore concluding I must once again express our\ndeep thanks to our brothers and friends everywhere,\nparticularly to fraternal Arab countries, Islamic\ncountries and non-aligned countries, as well as to all\nother friends for their principled and continuous\nsupport. Let this year be the year that will bring to an\nend the historical injustice that has befallen our people,\nand let it be the beginning of a new life in the Middle\nEast for all States, peoples and future generations."

        "file_name": "PER_55_2000.txt",
        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to join those who\npreceded me in congratulating you on your\nappointment as President of this last General Assembly\nof the twentieth century. Peru is pleased that a\nrepresentative of Finland, a country everyone knows is\ncommitted to the objectives of the Organization, is\nsteering the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI am convinced that, under your leadership we\nwill achieve the mandates that are necessary to begin to\npursue the vision developed by our Heads of State and\nGovernment at the recent Millennium Summit.\nI should also like to welcome and congratulate\nTuvalu for its incorporation into the United Nations.\nThis will undoubtedly represent an important\ncontribution to the different spheres of work of the\nOrganization.\nThe Millennium Summit has revealed the\nenormous challenges that lie ahead and the\noverwhelming need to forge a new form of\ninternational order that will allow future generations to\nenjoy a world free from the threats of war, poverty,\ninjustice and environmental deterioration and, at the\nsame time, one built on freedom with the participation\nof each of the great cultures that are part of mankind,\nwithout preference or prejudice.\nIt is extremely important that when we are about\nto conclude not just a century but also a millennium on\n31 December, we stop for a moment along the way to\nreflect on the future of international relations. Peru is\ncertainly not a decisive country in the development of\nglobal relations. Nevertheless it would seem that one of\nthe characteristics that appear at the end of the\ntwentieth century and that will certainly be emphasized\nin the twenty-first century is the basic role that all\ncountries of the world, whether large or small, have to\nplay in shaping the international order. And, in this\nsense, the perspective of a country, such as Peru that\nfully shares Western civilization and yet at the same\nhas its own characteristics that are the legacy of ancient\ntimes, may be of interest in carrying out the healthy\nexercise of approaching the subject from a different\nangles.\n24\n\nPeru emphatically reiterates that the global order\nthat must shape the conduct of the different\ninternational actors within the century beginning on l\nJanuary, must be based on the essential principles of\nthe Charter which, contrary to certain beliefs that we\nbelieve to be mistaken, have not only not lost\nrelevance, but are increasingly important for peaceful\ncoexistence, collective security and also for a real\npossibility for the development of all the specific\ngroups that form part of the abstract element that we\ncall mankind.\nMay I emphasize, in particular, the rights that\nrefer to the sovereignty of States, to non-intervention in\ntheir domestic affairs and to the legal equality between\nStates. These basic principles, which were incorporated\nin the Charter in San Francisco, have allowed the\ndevelopment of effective mechanisms of self-control\nand the stabilization of the international system.\nThat is why we must renew our commitment to\nthese rules of international public law, restoring the\nfunctionality that is theirs. Only thus can we ensure\nthat the democratic values that prevail in contemporary\nsociety will apply and be enforced within an\ninternational system whose emerging features appear to\nseek new forms of exclusion.\nThe world today is not the same as the world of\n50 years ago. Change and globalization are constantly\nreshaping reality at a rapid rate and are attempting to\nimpose upon us a new sense of commonality, new\nmorals and a new political ethic that dogmatically and\nin a partisan manner define what is proper and\nimproper.\nFull respect for the international legal order\ntherefore acquires enormous significance since it is the\nonly element that can illuminate the common path,\nreducing arbitrariness and subjectivity. This is also the\nbest way and the most effective mechanism for the full\nprotection of human rights and human freedom, which\nare undoubtedly requirements that no member of the\ninternational community may evade.\nBut this new reality also imposes on us a need for\ncommitment to the principle of shared responsibility.\nThe profound interdependence posed by globalization\nalso assumes a collective determination by all the\nmembers of the United Nations community to combine\ntheir efforts and resources for the resolution of\nproblems that have systemic effects or effects of an\ninternational nature. I refer in particular to the\nachievement of lasting economic growth within the\ndeveloping countries; poverty elimination; confronting\nthe real threats to peace of an international scope;\npublic health problems and endemic illnesses that are\nmainly linked to poverty; finding sufficient financing\nfor development; the digital divide; migration and the\nfree movement of labour; environmental protection and\nconservation; the world drug problem, beyond a purely\nmilitary perspective; the scourge of terrorism and the\nvarious forms of international crime, including money\nlaundering, arms trafficking and international\ntrafficking in people.\nIt is highly important for Peru that each of these\ncommon problems be tackled within the framework of\nthe United Nations and that common, coherent and\ncomprehensive answers be found. We must be capable\nof finding effective solutions with sufficient political\nand financial support. In this context, let me express\nour particular satisfaction over the commitments made\nby the heads of State and Government to focus the\ninternational community's attention in the coming\nyears on poverty reduction, so that by the year 2015\nnearly 600 million people will have overcome their\nstate of chronic poverty.\nSimilarly, I wish to emphasize the imaginative\nand constructive proposal presented by the President of\nPeru, Mr. Alberto Fujimori, at the Millennium Summit,\nto use the money illegally earned by captured drug\ntraffickers to alleviate the foreign debt of the poorest\ncountries and, in general, to utilize those funds to\ncontribute to the fight against poverty in the world.\nThere are undoubtedly many and very difficult\nchallenges that we must face during the next century.\nThis is the time of wealth and technological\ndevelopment, but also the time of struggle against\npoverty. This is the time of globalization, but also the\ntime of the respectful recognition of cultural diversity,\nwhich is an asset as important as, or more important\nthan, biological diversity. This is the time of the\ngreatest use of natural resources by man, but also the\ntime of environmental conservation. This is the time of\nthe universal spread of democracy, but also the time of\ndemocratic respect for the different ways in which\ndemocracy is lived.\nMankind has reached some basic consensuses at\nthis stage of its development. All the peoples of the\nworld share certain values and certain goals, such as\nfreedom, democracy, equality before the law, respect\n25\n\nfor human rights, the need to eliminate poverty, the\ndevelopment of creativity and the need for man to\nalways surpass itself. This has been the contribution of\nmodernity, the contribution of the latest centuries\nconsolidated in the twentieth century. But it is also true\nthat humanity is not made up, fortunately, of a single\nculture. It is also true that these values should find\nconcrete forms of their realization through different\nmentalities, in different latitudes, at different periods in\nthe history of each people. That is why post-modernity,\nthat world of the next century, must know how to\nconserve and deepen the values that are the legacy of\nmodernity and carry forward its goals as much as\npossible. But it must also acknowledge diversity; it\nmust know how to resolve dynamically the dilemma\nbetween unity and multiplicity.\nPerhaps the most complex of all these challenges,\nthe most difficult of all the coincidentiae oppositorum\nthat the twenty-first century will demand is to build an\ninternational system based on a genuine democracy.\nAnd by this I mean a democracy that does not consist\nof imposing a political form in the image of and similar\nto a specific system that is promoted as a model, a\ndemocracy that is not built on the basis of a mere\ncheck-list of institutions that have been taken from a\nspecific democratic experience and turned into\nmandatory universal guidelines. Democracy is the\npractice of diversity and tolerance. It is a recognition\nthat with regard to each subject, including the idea of\ndemocracy itself, there can be different interpretations,\nand none of them is entitled to ban the others. The task\nthat awaits us, then, during the next century is to\nspread and promote democracy but, above all, to\nfurther examine its own meaning to avoid\ncontradictions which would lead to its destruction.\nHow can we spread democracy without\nendangering democracy itself? On the other hand, how\ndo we save diversity and particularity without ending\nup with outdated nationalism? These are the major\nproblems of our time. They are the major dilemmas\nthat will have to be resolved in the twenty-first century.\nAny idea of a crusade, even in the name of\ndemocracy, is undemocratic, because it is intolerant.\nAnd I would almost dare to say that any principle of\nsocial organization that seeks to impose itself\nuniversally has an undemocratic base. Thus,\nparadoxically, the missionary enthusiasm for\ndemocracy ends up affecting the nature of democracy\nitself.\nDemocracy, in fact, implies a delicate and fragile\nbalance between the universal and the singular.\nSingularity should not be sacrificed on the deified altar\nof universality. Singularity should not be dissolved\nwithin a claimed universality, and the singular should\neven less be confused with the universal, assigning an\nabsolute value to what is no more than the historic\nexpression of a culture and of a time.\nThe attempts to apply on an international scale\ndomestic policies and local interpretations of values\nhave always failed. In the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, we witnessed the spectacular collapse of\nSoviet communism, which claimed to be the political\ndoctrine of the future, with which, following Hegel, we\nwould see the end of politics and therefore of history\nand enter into a sort of rebuilt earthly paradise. The\nclaimed communist universality saw the birth within\nitself of particularities and differences. Afterwards it\nhad to face other doctrines and world visions that were\nalien to its principles and values; and contrary to what\ncommunism expected, those different perspectives did\nnot vanish when faced with the presumed Marxist\ntruth. Rather, they won the ideological battle and made\ncommunism and Soviet Russia disappear. I am\nconvinced that the same will happen with any doctrine,\nwhatever its perspective and the values that support it,\nthat claims to lead the world to the end of history.\nThis forces us to rethink certain ideas that are too\nhastily \u2014 and, to my mind, inconsistently \u2014 becoming\ncommonplace. There is a certain scorn towards the idea\nof sovereignty and towards the idea of the cultural\nidentity of peoples, under the pretext of building a\nuniversal society. Nevertheless, I believe that, even\nthough they will need to be transformed and adapted to\na new globalizing outlook, those ideas will continue to\nprevail in the world of the future if we favour a\ngenuinely democratic way of thinking, in which\nfreedom can also exist under cultural and ideological\ndifferences.\nThere is no doubt that there is a crisis in the\nnation-State, because the seemingly essential\nidentification between the State as the political and\njuridical organization of society and the nation as a\ncultural organization is false: multinational States do\nexist. The solution in these cases of disparity between\nthe political and cultural organization is not to abandon\nthe concept of State and sovereignty, letting them be\nabsorbed within one of the supranational, globalizing\nconstructs; rather, it lies in achieving within the State\n26\n\nan acknowledgement and complex integration of\nmulticulturality. It is necessary to articulate diversity at\nboth the State and international levels instead of\nimposing some sort of homogeneity that will always\nfeel like a strait-jacket.\nThe new international order cannot be built by a\nsingle nation, culture or ideology, but by the interaction\nof the different attitudes that make up humanity. From\na genuinely democratic and liberal point of view, we\nmust avoid the temptation of the new dogmatism,\nperversely subtle and with a powerful imperialist\nvocation: the myth of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.\nIn this regard, building a new international order\nfor the twenty-first century does not mean solving a\nmathematical equation or scientifically designing a\nmodel to be applied generically to all the countries of\nthe world in a vain attempt to create a universal\ninternational society. Reality sweeps away all\nabstractions with the wealth of its multiple points of\nview. Moreover, reality is always dynamic and\neffervescent. It is always in a permanent state of\ntransformation, thanks to freedom, the defining\nelement of the human being.\nTherefore, politics, whether domestic or\ninternational, is an art, not a science. A domestic or\ninternational order must be the result of a complex\ninteraction between different, and even opposing,\nelements, just like a work of art. Creating the work of\nart that will be the new international order implies not\ndestroying what is counter to it, but, rather, combining\nit; combining unity with diversity and freedom with\norder. To put it in Nietzschean terms, we have to unite\nthe Apollonian with the Dionysian. To build a purely\nApollonian society is to fall into a new form of\ndogmatism and cultural dictatorship, even though,\nparadoxically, the intention is to establish democracy.\nBuilding a purely Dionysian society means slipping\ninto chaos and therefore destroying the social contract.\nThe society of the future must be capable of\nliving with diversity and expressing different points of\nview, world visions and interpretations of democracy\nitself in order to establish an organization of\nhumankind that creates not a single and homogenous\ninternational society, but an embodiment of the wealth\nof social and cultural diversity in search of peaceful\ncoexistence and reciprocal cooperation without burdens\nor conditions."

        "file_text": "\n\nI would like to say,\nMr. President, that I take special pleasure in seeing you\npreside over this Millennium Assembly session. I wish\nto assure you of my delegation's full support in all your\nendeavours. As one of the Vice-Presidents of the past\nsession, I want to convey my special appreciation to\nmy colleague and your predecessor, the Foreign\nMinister of Namibia, Theo-Ben Gurirab. I would also\nlike to extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General for\npresenting his report \u201cWe the Peoples\u201d to the world\ncommunity.\nAllow me also to convey my delegation's warm\nwelcome to Tuvalu as a new member of the United\nNations.\nIt is both remarkable and profoundly logical that\nin the beginning of the new millennium high\nrepresentatives of almost 200 nations have gathered for\none sole purpose \u2014 to comprehend challenges of the\ncontemporary world. The fact that we all have gathered\nhere, representing all regions of the world, cultures and\nreligions, means that we all share the belief in the\nvalue, viability and potential of the United Nations.\nHeads of State and Government, during the course of\nthe Millennium Summit, have guided us towards\nstrengthening the United Nations, including its central\nrole in peacekeeping and poverty eradication. Our task\nnow is to act upon their guidance.\nGlobalization, the digital revolution and the\ntriumph of free trade have transformed the world into a\nvibrant world economy. Interdependence within the\nworld economy emphasizes collective problems and\nsolutions. Thus, the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and\nmany other international organizations are\nindispensable mechanisms in achieving stable peace, in\nassisting in shaping the course of development, and in\nensuring that the world economy provides benefits for\nall.\nNever has the world been so well off. Yet, never\nhas it been confronted with so many problems on the\nglobal scale. The nature of threats has entirely changed.\nThe phenomena are so complex that they defy easy\ngeneralization. These phenomena comprise extreme\npoverty and marginalization of entire communities;\ngross violations of human rights; ethnic conflicts and\ngenocide; arms proliferation; terrorism; and\nenvironmental degradation.\nNo effort should be spared to free people from\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. The goals\nadopted at the Millennium Summit are challenging.\nAssistance, new trade arrangements, and debt relief\n9\n\nwill hardly constitute a panacea, unless necessary and\nstrong commitments to poverty reduction, economic\nequality, combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and\nsupporting education are reflected, first and foremost,\nin national policies of individual States, and\nconcurrently on the agendas of international\norganizations. Good health, literacy, and education are\ncritical assets for economic development. Human\ncapital, combined with a high level of economic\nequality, good governance, and abiding by the rule of\nlaw can really make a difference. This is the course we\nstrongly uphold if we aim at reducing by half the level\nof extreme poverty by 2015 and achieving sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe realities are that most of the economic\nthinking and ruling is being done within the Bretton\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization or\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OSCE), and a fully coordinated\napproach to the problems of peace and development\nshould be sought between these organizations and\ninstitutions and the United Nations.\nWe have yet to learn how to manage the spin-offs\nof globalization and how best to make use of\ninternational mechanisms to address new forms of\nthreats. Better yet, prevention is preferable to cure. For\nreally effective prevention, a broader definition of\nsecurity is vital and must encompass pressing\neconomic and social problems. The root causes of\nconflicts should be addressed as a fundamental part of\nefforts to establish secure peace and stability.\nShould preventative strategies yield no results,\nthe United Nations must have a truly effective\npeacekeeping capacity at its disposal. Lithuania will\nsupport every effort to fix structural deficiencies within\nthe United Nations and adequately to staff and finance\nrelevant departments. Provided the determination,\nresources, capacity and willingness are available, I\nbelieve, humanitarian catastrophes and crises can be\naverted. Proposals to improve the United Nations\npeacekeeping capacity and performance, especially\nthose contained in the Brahimi report, have been\nwidely endorsed by our leaders. Now we have to work\non it with a view to shifting the historically prevailing\nconception of peacekeeping as an ad hoc job to one of\nthe core functions of the United Nations.\nGreat challenges to the new international way of\ncontaining and resolving ethnic conflicts await in\nAfrica. A prospective strategy could be to encourage\nand assist regional organizations, especially the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States; involve civil\nsociety and the business community; and, most notably,\nenhance the United Nations, especially the Security\nCouncil's capacity to act well in advance, before a\ncrisis gets out of hand. Pledges to contribute to a safer\nworld add up to nothing if mounting demands for\nadequately trained and equipped peacekeepers and\ncivilian policemen, judges and administrators fall on\ndeaf ears. East Timorese, Kosovars and Sierra\nLeoneans are pinning their hopes on us. Failure to\nrespond to them would mean in the end that we do no\nmore than celebrate our own individual security.\nLithuania has always been and remains\ncommitted to building collective security. On the\ninternational level, Lithuania emphasizes active\nparticipation in international organizations and its\nsubstantial contribution to peacekeeping efforts, such\nas its participation in the United Nations standby\narrangements system or, from the very beginning of the\ninternational engagement in the Balkans, making our\ncivilian policemen and military available to the\nmissions in Bosnia and Kosovo. Moreover, additional\ncommitments will promptly follow as more highly\ntrained policemen and troops become available. In this\nregard, I wish to voice our strong desire to place a\nLithuanian part of the joint Lithuanian-Polish\npeacekeeping battalion under the United Nations\nstandby arrangements with a view to joining the Stand-\nby Forces High-Readiness Brigade.\nOn the regional level, we have made membership\nin alliances of democratic nations \u2014 the European\nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014\nour top priority. We regard the OSCE principles,\nincluding a country's right to choose its own security\narrangements, to be of fundamental value to ensuring\npeace and security. We believe that, by taking this way,\nwe will meet our economic, cultural, social and other\nconcerns and enhance European security as a whole.\nOn the subregional level, we stress practical\ncooperative efforts to uphold democratic and economic\ntransformation throughout the region. Over the past\ndecade, our engagement with Poland has turned into a\nclose partnership that has already produced remarkable\nresults. Good bilateral relations with the neighbouring\nstates of Latvia and Estonia have grown into a dynamic\ntrilateral Baltic cooperation, which has expanded into a\n10\n\nbroader Baltic-Nordic cooperation. We also seek to\nfurther develop mutually beneficial good-neighbourly\nrelations with Russia. Joint Lithuanian-Russian\nprojects on cooperation with the Kaliningrad region are\na good example of our pursuit of a foreign policy of\nfriendly relations, which also fully coincides with the\nEuropean Union's Northern Dimension policies\nendorsed at the Feira European Union summit this\nJune.\n\nCooperation requires wisdom and patience. Yet,\nall too often, guns have been a choice of cure for ethnic\nstrife and social or economic collapse. Vigorous and\nurgent efforts are needed to curtail the proliferation of\nsmall arms. We deem it vital for the 2001 United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects to address critical\nissues in the field of transparency, legitimate transfers,\naccountability, enforcement of sanctions and\nobservance of moratoriums. A commitment to the\nelimination of landmines should now be coupled with\nan effort towards putting small arms off limits to\nbelligerent causes.\nAgainst the background of gains in disarmament,\na number of setbacks have made the picture less\nencouraging. We share the profound concerns aroused\nby the abundance of weapons of mass destruction and\nthe proliferation of missiles. I fail to see any way to\ncreate a safer world other than reducing, eliminating\nand outlawing weapons of mass destruction. In the\nwake of the successful outcome of the 2000 Review\nConference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\nLithuania will work with other committed nations to\nachieve unequivocal commitment to nuclear\ndisarmament.\nCertain fundamental values are essential to\ninternational relations. Such are human responsibility\nand human rights. At the Millennium Summit,\nPresident of Lithuania Valdas Adamkus spoke about\nhis belief that\n\u201cin the face of a globalized tomorrow, the United\nNations will increase the scope of its human-\ndimension activities. Human rights should\nbecome a cornerstone of the emerging world\nstructure\u201d. (A/55/PV.5)\nThe concept of the human dimension must be at the\ncentre of all United Nations activities.\nIf we are to address the root causes of conflict,\nwe have to admit that respect for human rights, the\nprotection of minority rights and the institution of\npolitical arrangements in which all groups are\nrepresented are vital. For my region, of particular\ninterest is determining how the international\ncommunity can promote the rights of people coping\nwith the post-communist transition.\nThe limits of human rights applicability are being\nconstantly questioned. The United Nations should\nmove ahead in the search for new and more effective\ninstruments to fend off the challengers of human rights.\nPersons responsible for genocide, crimes against\nhumanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression should\nbe brought to justice. If that is the goal which the\ninternational community is after, an effective\nInternational Criminal Court should start working as\nsoon as possible. For its part, Lithuania will make good\non its commitment to ratify the Rome Statute by the\nend of this year.\nBased on the experience of my own country, I\nwish to stress that increasing the equality of social,\neconomic, educational and political benefits across\ngender has a positive impact on economic\ndevelopment. These issues have been at the forefront of\nthe agendas of all Lithuanian Governments since\nregaining independence, which have worked actively to\nhelp solve the question of equal rights and other\nproblems which women face. One of our achievements\nis the adoption of the Law on Equal Opportunities,\nwhich is the first law of this kind in Central and\nEastern Europe. Being a signatory State to the Second\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women, I call\nfor its early entry into force.\nThe attainment of freedom, security and welfare\nfor people is feasible only by embracing the effects of\nglobalization and not defying them. We have a global\ninstrument readily available for that purpose, yet we\nkeep arriving at the same conclusion: we need a United\nNations with greater capacity and better performance.\nA number of measures have been carried out. The\noutstanding efforts of the Secretary-General cannot be\noverestimated. Lithuania supports the Secretary-\nGeneral's greater emphasis on the United Nations as a\nresults-based Organization. We also endorse the stress\n\n\non better management, mobilization of new resources\nand new forms of partnership. The Security Council\nshould play its part in this regard. The lessons drawn\nfrom the Secretary-General's reports on Srebrenica and\nRwanda have to be paid more than lip service.\nWithin the complex of measured designs for\nrevitalizing the United Nations, our efforts to reform\nthe Security Council occupy a prominent place. The\nSecurity Council would only win if it acquired a new\npower and authority base. I would like to reiterate\nLithuania's position that the Security Council should\nbe increased, both in permanent and non-permanent\nmembership categories, and that the Eastern European\nGroup should be given one additional non-permanent\nmembership seat. In turn, even with a revitalized\nCouncil, cooperation with regional organizations\nshould be strengthened.\nThe reforms, no matter how far-flung, may only\nremain a partial success as long as the United Nations\nis not given necessary resources. The Organization\nneeds a sound and predictable financial footing.\nTherefore, Lithuania strongly supports a\ncomprehensive review of both the regular-budget scale\nand the scale of assessment for peacekeeping\noperations. In the latter case, an ad hoc arrangement of\n1973 has lost its touch with present day economic\nrealities. We need to adjust the United Nations\npeacekeeping scale of assessment methodology to\nbetter reflect the current economic conditions of all\nMember States. I hope that the revision will enjoy\nsupport by all countries of the United Nations and will\nbe carried out in an expeditious manner.\nThe United Nations symbolizes and guards the\nhumankind hope for a better future. Let's make it\nhappen!"

I would also like to\nthank His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of\nNamibia for his work as President of the General\n16\n\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, and to commend\nhim for the guidance he provided throughout the year.\nI would also like to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, for his inspiring contribution to\nthe noble goals of peace, justice, development and the\nstrengthening of our Organization.\nLast week, world leaders gathered here to direct\nthe Organization for the next century. The golden\nthread of the Millennium Summit was concern for the\nwell-being of all human beings and the common\ndetermination to free each and every nation and each\nand every human being from want and fear, to sustain\nthe future of humanity and to renew the United Nations\naccordingly. The common goal of all the discussions\nwas to provide for human security in all its complexity\nand to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality,\nequity, solidarity and tolerance at a global level.\nThe United Nations has the obligation to protect\nthe civilian population, particularly the most\nvulnerable  children, women, the elderly and the\ndisabled  against gross and systematic violations of\nhuman rights and humanitarian law, whether in inter-\nState or intra-State conflicts. The strengthening of\ninternational law is an important element in achieving\nthis goal. Special attention should be given to\nexploring new methods of conflict prevention, as well\nas to making better use of those that have proved to\nhave had good results. We should all be engaged more\ndecisively in building a culture of prevention and\nmodernizing and equipping the United Nations for the\ntask.\nIt is also imperative for the United Nations to\nelaborate a doctrine for humanitarian intervention\nbased on a modern interpretation of the Charter and in\nline with new international relations and norms. We\nlistened with interest to the statements made by the\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nCanada in this Hall on the establishment of an\nindependent international commission on intervention\nand State sovereignty.\nThere is nothing in the Charter that could\npossibly justify crimes against the civilian population.\nNeither is there anything in the Charter that could\npossibly justify the fact that large parts of the world are\nstill living in poverty or that some States are stagnating\ndue to the debt burden, while the rest of the world is\nenjoying a state of well-being. Technological and\neconomic development does bring the world together,\nbut globalization also brings problems closer and\nincreases the mutual responsibility for finding\nsolutions to them.\nAt the Millennium Summit, we adopted a\ncomprehensive and far-reaching Declaration. Leaders\nput before us difficult but achievable goals. Member\nStates should now look carefully into how they can\ncontribute nationally to the implementation of the goals\nat the global level. As a responsible Member of the\nOrganization, Slovenia intends to prepare its plan of\naction for the implementation of the goals set out in the\nMillennium Declaration. I want to take this opportunity\ntoday to mention some of the efforts that we intend to\nmake.\nAs a country that has just joined the donor\ncommunity, Slovenia will look closely at how it can\norganize better in order to extend more assistance to\nthe developing countries and the countries in the\nregion, thus contributing to the goals regarding\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\nWe have just signed the Optional Protocols to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, while the\nNational Assembly is supposed to ratify the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court by the end of the year.\nBoth documents are among the most important building\nblocks for ensuring greater protection for civilians in\nconflict situations. We are looking forward to the early\nfunctioning of the International Criminal Court in order\nto ensure the more effective, equitable and efficient\ndelivery of international justice.\nSlovenia is determined to help in the process of\nstrengthening the Organization as an indispensable\nfoundation for a peaceful, prosperous and just world.\nOnce again, we want to stress the need for the\nenlargement of the Security Council in its permanent\nand elected membership, as well as with regard to the\nreform of its working methods. The credibility of the\nUnited Nations depends on its ability to carry out its\nresponsibilities in full, especially with regard to\nmaintaining peace and security. We therefore welcome\nand commend the report of the Panel on United\nNations Peace Operations and we are looking forward\nto the early implementation of its recommendations.\nIn this context, we believe that the reform of the\nfinancing of United Nations peacekeeping operations is\na necessary condition for a renewed role for the United\nNations in this field. A new scale of assessments that\nmore accurately reflects the capacity to pay should be\n17\n\nadopted during this session. I have the honour to\nannounce that the Government of Slovenia has decided\nto voluntarily relinquish the discount it is no longer\nentitled to with regard to its financial contribution, and\nthat, starting from next year, it is ready to pay its share\nfor peacekeeping operations in full.\nSlovenia is also gradually increasing its\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations  those of\nthe United Nations, as well as regional ones. We are\ncommitted to further increasing our support to these\noperations, not only with military personnel, but also\nwith civilian police and humanitarian personnel.\nThe basic aim of United Nations actions should\nbe to ensure human security, with security being\nphysical, economic and social, rather than legal. We\nnote with satisfaction that the interests of individuals\nare, indeed, rightly at the very centre of the Millennium\nDeclaration. Slovenia will continue to participate in the\ngroup of like-minded countries, which is determined to\ngive full meaning and specific, practical expression to\nthe concept of human security.\nThe problem of the illicit arms flow of small arms\nand light weapons is such that it requires additional\nefforts. We hope that the forthcoming international\nconference on small arms and light weapons will pave\nthe way for regulating and controlling the proliferation\nof unimpeded access to small arms and light\nweapons  the weapons most used in today's armed\nconflicts.\nMember States should also continue to improve\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of mine action\nprogrammes, as well as to strengthen all steps and\nactivities in mine action and mine victim assistance.\nFor its part, Slovenia will continue to support the\nefforts of its International Trust Fund for Demining and\nMine Victim Assistance to extend its activities to the\nwhole region of South-East Europe. The results\nachieved in recent years are promising for the activities\nof the Trust Fund in the future.\nI would also like to briefly address the situation\nin the region of South-East Europe. We are all aware\nthat there will be no self-sustaining peace and stability\nin the region without the full cooperation and\nintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. For\nobvious reasons, this cannot be expected of the current\nregime in Belgrade. The international community must\ncooperate with, support and encourage the forces\nwithin the country that are striving for democracy,\npeace, reconciliation, economic recovery and a return\nto simple normalcy. We share the hopes of seeing the\nnew democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia soon\nas a part of a stable and prosperous South-East Europe.\nWe also share the hopes that this country will soon join\nus in the United Nations, as well as in the other\ninternational and regional organizations, in accordance\nwith the usual procedures and practices for admission\nof new members to these organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First\nof all, Mr. President, permit me to congratulate you on\nyour election to preside over the Assembly's fifty-fifth\nsession, the first of the new millennium. I wish you\nevery success in your presidency, and promise you\nChile's full cooperation as you carry out your\nimportant duties. I would like to express our\nadmiration and affection for the country you represent,\nFinland. My appreciation also goes to the praiseworthy\nefforts of Foreign Minister Gurirab of Namibia during\nthe work of the session that has just come to an end.\nLikewise, we congratulate the Secretary-General on the\nleadership he has demonstrated since taking office. We\nrecognize and value his commitment to the vision of a\nnew United Nations for the twenty-first century. We\nencourage him to continue his efforts to reform the\nOrganization.\nGlobalization is without a doubt the name of our\nera. Today it is pointless to ask ourselves whether we\nwant to participate in globalization. Isolation is not a\nrealistic option. Chile views globalization as an\nunquestionable reality and as a font of opportunity that\nhas brought us very valuable benefits. The opening of\nour economy has enabled us to double the size of our\ngross domestic product within 10 years, compared with\nthe almost 50 years it took to accomplish the previous\ndoubling. Technological advances have helped to bring\nus closer to major world centres.\nGlobalization gives rise to opportunities, but it\ncan also deepen the inequities which have always\ncharacterized the international system. The United\nNations can help to ensure that globalization does not\nresult in exclusion, with the benefits of modernization\nlimited to a lucky few. We must make a firm\ncommitment to developing a new form of international\ncooperation, focused in particular on broadening access\nto the knowledge-based economy.\nThe flows of goods, services, capital, information\nand technology characteristic of globalization tend to\nbypass domestic regulations and escape the control of\nGovernments. This lack of regulation is generally not\ncounterbalanced by other standards or authorities. It is\nup to us to fill this vacuum by using all available\nmultilateral forums.\nAs never before in the history of humanity,\nresolving the daily problems faced by people\nworldwide depends on collective international\ndecision-making. The challenge confronting the United\nNations today is to lend a certain degree of order to\nglobalization; to establish effective institutions and\nrules, so that globalization will serve to advance the\ndevelopment of our peoples; and to ensure that the\nfruits of scientific and technological advances benefit\nall peoples.\nAt the Rio Group's most recent Summit of Heads\nof State or Government, held in Cartagena, Colombia,\nthe countries that make up this regional political\ncoordination body prepared a joint contribution to the\nMillennium Summit, reaffirming the central role of the\nUnited Nations in this new era on which we are\nembarking.\nThe past year has given rise to a mixture of hope\nand concern with regard to peace and security. Chile\nfollowed with particular interest the historic talks held\nbetween the leaders of North and South Korea, from 13\n15\n\nto 15 June of this year. We congratulate the leaders and\nthe peoples of both countries on the progress made at\nthis groundbreaking summit.\nThe conflict in the Middle East has entered what\nseems to be a decisive stage. We are heartened by the\nadvances made this year and encourage the parties to\ncontinue their negotiations in accordance with the\nestablished timetables and relevant Security Council\nresolutions. We are confident that Israel and the\nPalestinian National Authority will find satisfactory\nsolutions to the remaining issues, particularly those\nrelated to Jerusalem. We are also encouraged by\nIsrael's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.\nWe support the Security Council's decisions\nestablishing a massive humanitarian programme for\nIraq  under the 'oil-for-food' formula, and we favour\nan ongoing evaluation of that programme. We urge the\nIraqi Government to cooperate effectively with the new\ninspection agency  the United Nations Monitoring,\nVerification and Inspection Commission  whose\nwork we deem particularly important.\nWe have followed closely developments in the\nBalkans. The seeds of intolerance and 'ethnic\ncleansing' are still present in the region. Chile views\nwith fear the possibility of a new Balkan conflict. Only\nfull respect for democracy and human rights can bring\nabout peace in the region.\nWe are concerned by the conflicts in Africa. We\nare hopeful as to the significant mediating role played\nby regional entities such as the Organization for\nAfrican Unity, especially in the Ethiopia-Eritrea\ndispute, and the Southern African Development\nCommunity. We hope that these efforts, along with\nthose of the United Nations, can bring about peace,\nallowing the continent to fully develop its enormous\npotential.\nWe are pleased to note that the Security Council\nhas directly addressed the scourge of HIV/AIDS in\nAfrica, designating it as an international security issue\nrequiring urgent action. We hope that initiatives will be\nadopted to effectively combat this problem, which casts\nan even greater shadow over the future of the continent\nthan the current armed conflicts.\nWe view with concern the difficulties surrounding\nthe upcoming referendum in the Western Sahara. Chile\nwould like to see the elections take place as soon as\npossible, on the basis of a free and secret ballot and\nadequate voter information. We are concerned about\nthe obstacles that are hindering this undertaking.\nAlthough post-cold-war hopes for a world free of\nnuclear weapons in the near future have been tempered,\nthat goal remains fully valid. I have the honour to\nreport than on 12 July, Chile deposited its instrument of\nratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty  the sixteenth country to do so. We call upon\nall nations to ratify this Treaty as soon as possible in\norder to reach the quorum of 44 countries necessary for\nits entry into force.\nIn our information-based society, the problems\nexperienced by any one country affect the world\ncommunity as a whole. No state can shirk its the\nresponsibility to promote peaceful coexistence within\nand among nations. From the ethical standpoint of our\ncommon humanity, we have viewed with interest the\ndevelopment of the concept of humanitarian\nintervention. Chile continues to abide by the principles\nof non-intervention and the self-determination of\npeoples. But these principles must be linked to other\nprinciples of equal or higher priority, which have\nemerged prominently since the end of the cold war. We\ncannot remain impassive in the face of the\nhumanitarian catastrophes caused by great conflicts.\nThus, we propose that in specific cases, and in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\nconcerted multilateral action be taken to provide rapid\nassistance to those who are suffering. Chile is also an\nenthusiastic participant in the Human Security\nNetwork, in response to an initiative put forward by\nCanada and Norway.\nChile considers it an ethical and political\nimperative of the greatest urgency to expand its\nparticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping\nforces. Since 1999, we have developed an internal legal\nframework that is in closer harmony with international\nrequirements for participation in these operations.\nThose legal modifications have enabled us to\nparticipate in the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor, beginning in February of\nthis year.\nMy country is also willing to discuss a new\npayment scale for the financing of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. We believe that this scale\nmust be adjusted to reflect the current financial\nsituation of Member States.\n16\n\nWe cannot fail to mention the process of Security\nCouncil reform. While some progress has been noted in\ndiscussions of the Council's methods of work and of\nthe degree of transparency required by this body, we\nnote that there have been few, if any, advances toward\nthe expansion of its membership.\nChile feels a certain dismay and fatigue at the\nlack of progress, which is the result of positions that\nappear irreconcilable. The issue of the veto further\ncomplicates this sensitive subject. Until we seriously\naddress the question of limiting the veto with a view to\nits ultimate abolishment, we doubt that the discussions\nundertaken by the Assembly's Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\nCouncil will bear fruit.\nGlobalization is not limited to the economic\nsphere. It also involves the universalization of values\nand principles of our common humanity, and the\nstrengthening of the rights of the individual, which\nhave increasingly become subjects addressed by\ninternational law. The absence of democracy and good\ngovernance, and the people's lack of a voice and\nparticipation in public affairs in States Members of the\nOrganization are of concern to us all. The United\nNations exists for individuals, not for those who\ngovern. Under the imperative of putting people at the\ncentre of all our efforts, we must support and promote\nhuman rights and democratic processes.\nChile was among the countries that worked to\nconvene the Towards a Community of Democracies\nconference held at Warsaw, Poland, last June. More\nthan 100 United Nations Member nations participated\nin that gathering and endorsed its final declaration. We\nare convinced that, as time passes, the community of\ndemocracies will be an increasingly potent moral force\nwithin the United Nations, provided that it maintains\nits high standards and requirements.\nDemocracy is based on justice, both national and\nuniversal. Chile enthusiastically supports the\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court, and\nhopes that all countries will ratify its statute.\nEstablishing a permanent body to exercise criminal\njurisdiction over those accused of crimes that fall\nwithin its purview will discourage the irregular\ndomestic proceedings which have allowed such\nindividuals to enjoy impunity, as well as limiting\njurisdictional disputes among countries.\nAt the World Summit for Social Development,\nheld at Copenhagen in 1995, heads of State or\nGovernment met for the first time in the history of the\nUnited Nations to declare with force and clarity that\nthe chief responsibility of our societies is to improve\nthe quality of life of our populations, particularly for\ntheir most marginalized and dispossessed members.\nThis year, in a special session, the Assembly reviewed\nthe progress made towards fulfilling the Summit's\ncommitments and launched new initiatives on their\ngenuine implementation. That was an important step in\nthe quest to better humanize the process of\nglobalization. We must continue to incorporate the\nobjectives of the social Summit into our national and\nmultilateral policies.\nIn the social sphere, the United Nations has\nrecognized the vital need to promote gender equality.\nChile has worked together with our regional\nneighbours in Latin America and the Caribbean to\nreaffirm the principles and proposals of the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women. We have renewed our\ncommitment to the advancement of women, and have\ndeveloped a new plan to equalize opportunities for men\nand for women. A concrete demonstration of that\ncommitment is the fact that about one third of\nPresident Lagos Escobar's cabinet members are\nwomen.\nWe reiterate Chile's strong support for\npreparations for the General Assembly's 2001 special\nsession to follow up the World Summit for Children.\nWe also attribute special significance to the concern of\nthe United Nations for the rights and welfare of\nindigenous populations and of the elderly.\nChile has volunteered to host the regional\npreparatory meeting for the World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance. We aim to contribute to the\nregional consensus in that area, confirming our very\nfirm commitment to tolerance and respect for diversity.\nEnvironmental protection is an issue that crosses\nnational borders and has become a global concern,\ndriven in part by an emerging international civil\nsociety. Here, international cooperation, under the\nauspices of the United Nations, continues to be an\nurgent necessity. The United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro,\n17\n\nlaid the foundations for agreements on climate change,\nforest conservation and biodiversity. It is very\nimportant that we fulfil and gradually expand those\ncommitments with new agreements and protocols\nensuring the management, protection and conservation\nof our planet's resources. This session, as well as the\nRio + 10 event which will take place in 2002, must\ncontinue to spur commitment to a new ethic of\nenvironmental conservation.\nWe are witnessing the globalization of financial\nmarkets, which significantly affect capital, currency\nand credit flows, as well as the economies of all of\nnations. As recent experience demonstrates, a financial\ncrisis in one corner of the world can rapidly trigger a\ndomino effect, spreading the crisis even to faraway\nnations with no responsibility for or control over the\ncauses of the original disturbance. It is a great injustice\nthat countries that have been prudent and responsible in\nthe management of their domestic economies can be\naffected by problems with which they had nothing to\ndo. It is urgent for us to find ways to impose order and\nstandards of good management on the international\nworld. This does not mean obstructing international\ncapital flows, but rather establishing an appropriate\ninternational framework to address the problems they\nmay cause.\nChile has enthusiastically supported the\ninternational community's progress towards free trade\nthrough deregulation and the elimination of\nprotectionist measures and barriers. The failure of the\n1999 Seattle World Trade Organization (WTO)\nconference was unfortunate. But let us be frank: that\nfailure was not brought about by civil-society\ndemonstrations, but by the lack of agreement among\nthe world's leading commercial Powers. Chile\ncontinues to believe in the urgent necessity of initiating\na new round of multilateral trade negotiations.\nThe United Nations must play a key role in\nbringing about substantive improvements in the\nmanagement of commercial, monetary and financial\nsystems, so that their operations will take into account\nthe needs of all countries. The Economic and Social\nCouncil has done commendable work to coordinate\nUnited Nations activities with those of the Bretton\nWoods institutions. But the General Assembly too has\na critical role to play in this area.\nThe decision to hold a High-level International\nand Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\nDevelopment in 2001 was of groundbreaking\nsignificance, and we must resolve to carry forward the\ncommitments expressed at the Millennium Summit to\nensure the success of that event. That would lead to a\nnew phase in North-South relations, since the political\nlegitimacy arising from a broad multilateral consensus\nwill allow us to design a new financial architecture and\na system of international trade and exchange that\nreflect the legitimate interests of all the world's\npeoples.\nMy country believes that official development\nassistance is still necessary to promote the\ndevelopment of many countries and regions. A\nglobalized world cannot neglect the principle of\nsolidarity, which is an idea so central to the United\nNations tradition. In the same spirit, international\nassistance must be provided to relieve the distressing\nconditions of many countries burdened with\nunsustainable debt, so that they can meet the\nchallenges of development.\nThis year Chile began a new six-year political\nterm, under fully democratic conditions. Our country is\nin complete harmony with the international community.\nWe possess a vibrant civil society, which made its own\ncontributions to our preparation for the Millennium\nSummit. Human rights and the rule of law are\nrespected in Chile. Our courts impart justice with\nrigour and a sense of responsibility. We enjoy a\nvigorous and open economy, and we have resolved to\ncontinue reducing inequalities in our country. We reach\nout to the world from a firm foundation in our own\nregion, Latin America. We are strengthening our\nmultilateral policies, based on open regionalism and on\ncooperation with countries with similar criteria\nthroughout the world.\nWe are confident that this General Assembly\nsession, dedicated to the millennium, will be recorded\nas the one in which we began to address the great\nchallenge of our time: to give order to the forces of\nglobalization and promote the extension of its benefits\nto an ever-increasing number of the inhabitants of our\nplanet. You can rest assured, Mr. President, that Chile's\ndelegation will lend its full support to meeting this\nchallenge."

        "file_text": "First of all I\nwould like to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and wish you every success with\nyour work. I would like to thank Foreign Minister\nGurirab for his dedication in chairing the fifty-fourth\nsession of the General Assembly. I welcome Tuvalu as\nthe one hundred and eighty-ninth member of the United\nNations and congratulate it on its accession. I endorse\nthe statement of my French colleague, Hubert V\u00c8drine,\non behalf of the European Union.\nAt this session of the General Assembly, the first\nin the new millennium, we are asked to determine the\nfuture tasks of the United Nations and which reforms\nare necessary in order to master them. The Millennium\nDeclaration, which we all adopted on 8 September,\nshows us the way forward. The implementation of this\nDeclaration should be a main focus of the consultations\nof this and future sessions of the General Assembly. I\npropose that the Secretary-General make use of the\nopportunity to draw up review reports at the beginning\nof the next session of the General Assembly.\nThere was one issue in particular which\ndominated this debate, namely globalization. It will\nradically change the economy and finances, politics\nand culture everywhere. The question is, will a new\norder which guarantees peace, justice and an equal\nshare in our common progress be established or will a\nnew divide evolve in the world? Will the future of the\nglobalized world manifest its pluralist character in a\nmultilateral order? Only the future can provide the\nanswers to these questions.\nParticularly for developing countries,\nglobalization offers great opportunities. If it\nnevertheless provokes strong opposition, this lies in the\nimbalances of this historical process. Indeed, just under\na decade after the end of the cold war, our world is\ntoday at risk from a new divide, one between the\nwinners and losers of the economic globalization\nprocess. In his impressive Millennium Report, the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, rightly highlights\nthe growing inequalities in the distribution of income,\nresources, investments and access to new technologies.\nIn view of this situation, the international\ncommunity must make every effort in the coming\ndecade to ensure that globalization benefits all peoples.\nIf market forces are not balanced by a political\ncorrective mechanism, it is to be expected that injustice\nin the world will increase further. Those who have been\nhitherto excluded from the advantages of globalization\nmust be included to a greater extent. They must be\ngiven more say in the political decisions made about\nsteering global processes and they must be given an\nopportunity to gain a fairer share in the development of\nthe world economy.\nIn the twenty-first century, we will, more than\never before, need a form of global governance if we are\nto solve global challenges. The United Nations will\nplay a key role here. It is the only organization within\nwhich the injustice between rich and poor can be\novercome and where a reconciliation between peoples\nand regions, global peace and sustainable development\ncan be achieved.\nGreatly strengthening the United Nations capacity\nto act is, therefore, a crucial question for the whole of\n15\n\nhumanity in the twenty-first century. In addition to the\ncrucial reform of the Security Council, this will entail\nthe United Nations entering into creative partnerships\nwith industry and civil society.\nGermany strongly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral's idea for a global compact with major\ncompanies. The German initiative for a resolution in\nthe General Assembly on global partnerships will take\nup this and other issues relating to the globalization\nprocess.\nGlobal poverty is the key problem in North-South\nrelations. It lies at the root of many global risks and\nthreats to peace. The Secretary-General provided\nprecise and stimulating analyses of this in his report.\nThe industrialized nations have a special\nobligation to support the poorest of the poor. With the\nCologne debt initiative launched by Germany, we are\ncombining debt relief with a strategy to combat\npoverty. The 20 poorest developing countries should be\ndebt-free by the end of the year.\nThe least developed countries should be granted\naccess to world markets with the greatest possible\nexemption from duties and quotas. We must, also by\nway of liberalization steps in the World Trade\nOrganization, prevent these countries from being\nsocially excluded even further.\nThis applies in particular to the new economy.\nThe United Nations and its Member States must\nintensify their efforts to make it easier for these\ncountries to use the information and communication\ntechnologies. This is contingent upon initiatives in the\nfield of education, as well as the availability of the\nnecessary resources.\nHowever, how can poor countries ever catch up\neconomically if they are, at the same time, afflicted to a\nmuch greater degree than the North by terrible\ndiseases? The fight against the disastrous spread of the\nAIDS virus, particularly in Africa, must be priority for\nus all. The focus must be on prevention. At the same\ntime, access to medicines must be improved and\nvaccine research must be intensified. The World Bank's\npromising idea of establishing a future fund for the\npurchase of vaccines deserves every support.\nParticularly in the fight against AIDS, new partnerships\nbetween Governments and companies are crucial.\nThe second major issue of this General Assembly\nis peacekeeping. The Secretary-General showed the\nway ahead with the Brahimi report. The\nrecommendations it contains should be examined and\nimplemented as quickly as possible. Germany will play\nits part. Peace missions need a more robust mandate, as\nwell as more personnel and equipment. Member States\nmust do considerably more to ensure the rapid\nsecondment of well-trained troops, police officers and\ncivilian experts. The further development of the police\nconcept is one of the most important tasks in this\nconnection  as the last few months and years have, in\nfact been teaching us.\nThe German Government will offer German\ntraining for civilian peace-mission personnel and offer\ncivilian capacities to the United Nations stand-by\nsystem. In addition, we are drafting a plan for training\ncivilian experts for peace missions, thus creating a pool\nof qualified personnel who can be deployed at short\nnotice.\nThe prevailing form of conflict today is conflict\nwithin States. Therefore the main task of peacekeeping\nmust be to address the internal roots of conflicts. In\naddition to focusing on an improvement in socio-\neconomic conditions, our efforts must focus on\npromoting human rights, democracy and the rule of\nlaw. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, aptly said that the\nhuman rights violations of today are the wars of\ntomorrow.\nNumerous concrete tasks are on the agenda. The\nprotocols relating to the involvement of children in\narmed conflict and to the sale of children, child\nprostitution and child pornography must enter into\nforce as early as possible. The equality of women must\nbe advanced in all spheres. I call upon all states to\nratify quickly the new Optional Protocol to the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women and to abolish all laws\nthat discriminate against women by 2005. The World\nConference against racism, to be held in 2001, must\ntackle all aspects of this issue. Out of a sense of\nresponsibility for our history, our State and our society\nwill stand up firmly against all forms of right-wing\nradicalism, racism and anti-Semitism, both in our own\ncountry and in the world.\nI call upon all States to respect the integrity of the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to sign and\nto ratify it, so that the Court can commence work soon.\nThere can be no exceptions to the Rome Statute.\n16\n\nOne of the greatest dangers facing humanity\nremains the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. The risk of regional arms races,\nparticularly in South Asia, has increased. Further\ndeveloping the international arms-control regime\ntherefore continues to be one of the United Nations key\ntasks. This will require resolute implementation of the\nresults of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. Against this background, President Clinton's\ndecision not to commit now to the development of a\nnational missile defence system is very welcome. The\nAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty must remain as a\ncornerstone of strategic stability and the basis for\nfurther nuclear-disarmament measures.\nIn poor countries the excessive stockpiling of\nsmall arms must be stopped. We must therefore do\neverything we can to achieve tangible progress at the\nUnited Nations small arms conference to be held in\n2001. This presupposes the inclusion of all aspects,\nincluding the legal transfer of production and\nstockpiles.\nRegional cooperation has proved to be an\nextremely effective means of preventing conflicts. The\nUnited Nations can do much to help here. Allow me to\nmention two regions where progress is particularly\nurgent. The triangle between Central Asia, the\nCaucasus and the Middle East is full of destabilizing\nfactors  oil, religious fundamentalism, terrorism,\ndrugs and the nuclear arms race  and this area is\nthreatening to become the crisis region of the century\nahead. A new comprehensive regional process, along\nthe lines of the Helsinki model, which fosters\ncooperation instead of confrontation, could play an\nimportant stabilizing role. Germany is prepared to take\npart in such a process.\nIn Africa, regional approaches have gained in\nsignificance. In the main, however, it is, unfortunately,\ntoo early to talk of effective peacekeeping structures.\nUnfortunately, the efforts on the part of the United\nNations and of the Organization of African Unity to\nresolve the conflicts in the Congo and Sierra Leone\nhave not achieved a breakthrough so far. In the conflict\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea it is to be hoped that the\nceasefire that has finally been concluded will be\nconsolidated and that the United Nations peace mission\nwill be lent the full support of the parties to the\nconflict.\nThe third issue, protection of our natural\nenvironment, will probably become the crucial issue\naffecting our planet. In the course of the twentieth\ncentury the world's population quadrupled, while\nconsumption of energy and raw materials increased\ntenfold. We must end the squandering of natural\nresources and switch to renewable energy sources as\nquickly as possible. This cannot only be a matter for\nindustrialized nations. We are witnessing at this very\nmoment what a burden high oil prices places on poor\ncountries in particular. It must be in the interest of all\nStates to bring about the transition from the oil to the\nhydrogen age as quickly as possible. The most\nimportant thing now is to finally overcome the\ndeadlock in the climate-protection negotiations and to\nensure that the Kyoto Protocol can be implemented by\n2002, 10 years after the Rio Summit.\nAnother key issue for humanity, the future of\ngenetic engineering, can only be mastered within the\nframework of a global consensus. Genetic engineering\nhas the potential to revolutionalize medicine and\nagriculture. At the same time, it raises more ethical and\nhuman rights questions than any other technology. Do\nwe not need clear, binding rules for dealing with such a\npowerful new technology? Why do we not seriously\nconsider within the United Nations creating under\ninternational law a convention that meaningfully\npromotes genetic engineering and safeguards the\nfreedom to research and the findings of this research,\nwhile, at the same time, defining an ethical basis and\nguaranteeing protection against abuse?\nThe Millennium Declaration points the way\nahead. But what help will that be if an increasing\nnumber of Members allow the world's real problems to\nbe dealt with and decided somewhere else? If we do\nnot succeed in adapting the United Nations to deal with\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century and in\nmodernizing it fully, it will be sidelined, with fatal\nconsequences for peace and development, human\nrights, the environment and social progress.\nWe will all, rich and poor, lose out.\nWe must therefore muster the strength to\nresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration. We\nneed a world Organization that is strong and we must\nuse its scarce resources more effectively. An important\nprerequisite for this is that the United Nations be\nplaced finally on a solid financial footing. Together\nwith its European Union partners, Germany has put\n17\n\nforward proposals for a fairer, more balanced scale of\nassessments, which must continue to be based on\nMember States' ability to pay..\nThe Security Council no longer reflects the\npolitical reality of our world at the dawn of the new\nmillennium. We share the Secretary-General's view\nthat this central steering organ of the international\ncommunity must become more representative,\nlegitimate and effective, also involving the developing\ncountries. Last week Chancellor Schroeder reaffirmed\nGermany's willingness to take on more responsibility\nin this connection. I would like to take this opportunity\nto thank my friend and colleague Robin Cook for the\nclear language that he used before the General\nAssembly just a few minutes ago.\nThe General Assembly must structure its work,\ndebate global problems in a more focused fashion than\nhitherto and identify courses of action. The synergetic\npotential between United Nations organizations, for\nexample in the environmental field, must be better used\nand resources pooled to a greater extent by merging\norganizations.\nReform of the United Nations will play a decisive\nrole in ensuring that the twenty-first century is safer\nand more just than the twentieth century. Allow me to\nconclude with a quote from the Secretary-General's\nMillennium Report:\nNo shift in the way we think or act can be\nmore critical than this: we must put people at the\ncentre of everything we do ... Only when that\nbegins to happen will we know that globalization\nis indeed becoming inclusive, allowing everyone\nto share its opportunities.'"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at the\ncurrent session. I am confident that under your able\nguidance our deliberations will yield success. I also\nwish to thank your predecessor for his leadership and\nfor the his exemplary work as President of the\nAssembly during the fifty-fourth session. I also have\nthe honour to extend convey my greetings to the\nSecretary-General and to acknowledge his firm\nleadership and his continuing interest in the search for\npractical and innovative solutions.\nFor Colombia, this session represents a historic\nchallenge: the challenge to forge new relationships\naimed at carrying out the mission agreed upon by heads\nof State or Government at the Millennium Summit.\nThey have defined the parameters of the world in\nwhich we wish to live and the conditions for creating a\nnew international political and economic order. My\ncountry had the honour to submit the Cartagena de\nIndias Declaration (A/54/929), a commitment adopted\nby heads of State of the Rio Group, which enunciates\nthe aspirations of our region and is an exceptional\ncontribution to the future of the United Nations. We\nwill now undertake a careful follow-up of these\ninitiatives so as to translate them into realities for the\nbenefit of humankind.\nPerhaps the dawn of the new millennium will\nenable us to face this challenge with optimism, to\nsignal a break with the legacy of half a century and\nwith the many proposals that have so often met with\nindifference. It represents an opportunity to translate\nour collective aspirations into tangible reality.\nIn large part, our expectations relate to the\nmeaning and scope of globalization. Sweeping\nrevolutions are taking place in the fields of\ntransportation, communication and the electronic\nmedia. Every day we are astonished by advances in\ntechnology and by the discoveries of applied science.\nThe main purpose of the United Nations and of its\nvarious forums and agencies is to channel this\nenormous store of technological and scientific\nknowledge towards the poorest and most vulnerable\nsectors of the population.\nInformation technology is bringing structural\nchange to the international economy and unprecedented\nopportunities to promote creative cultural interaction\namong peoples. But the information revolution can also\nbecome a source of exclusion. We face the risk of\ncreating a new form of illiteracy: cyber-illiteracy. We\nmust bridge the digital divide and convert information\ntechnology into a positive factor for education and\npoverty-reduction so that the information revolution\nmay become truly global. Failure to do so will increase\nthe gap between rich and poor.\nOne of our principal challenges is therefore to\nglobalize globalization and to make it an imperative for\nthe twenty-first century. It is, in other words, to bring\nthe benefits of this process to more regions, nations\nand individuals by democratizing access to new\ntechnologies, eliminating barriers to trade and\ninvestment and recognizing that the resources with\nwhich nature provides us are the common heritage of\nfuture generations.\nHere, preservation of the environment is a key\nelement. We have an obligation to respect nature and to\nbuild a sustainable future. We must put an end to the\ndestruction being caused by the irrational use of natural\nresources and by unsound patterns of consumption and\nproduction. This requires greater political commitment\nto control climate change, eliminate sources of water\npollution and put an end to the loss of our forests. The\nprovision of financial resources and transfer of\nenvironmentally safe technologies are issues still to be\nresolved. The international community must honour the\ncommitments it has assumed in this field before it is\ntoo late.\nFor their part, the United Nations and the\nmultilateral financial institutions must develop a new\nframework to prevent and respond to risks and\neconomic crises. We need a stable, ordered, transparent\nand predictable financial system, one in which we can\nstrengthen our early warning capacity, effectively\ncontrol the volatility of capital flows and ensure\nsufficient liquidity to provide timely support to\ncountries affected by crisis. Another urgent priority is\nto create social protection networks that can be used in\ntimes of financial crisis.\nThe beginning of the millennium is marked also\nby new concerns and threats to peace and security. The\nproliferation and illicit trade in small arms is one of\nthese. The illegal traffic in such arms has reached\n31\n\nunacceptable proportions; its impact has been even\nmore devastating than that of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Despite this, the international community\nis not giving it the importance and priority which this\ngrave problem demands. Urgent and effective measures\nare needed to halt and completely eliminate this illegal\ntrade.\nCountries affected by this phenomenon must not\nremain exposed to the criminal activities of the\nnetworks of arms traffickers who, taking advantage of\nthe absence of monitoring and oversight mechanisms,\nare causing irreparable damage to our societies.\nGovernments have the political and moral\nresponsibility to act decisively against illicit arms\nexports and to bring all the force of the law to bear\nagainst the merchants of death and violence who profit\nfrom this nefarious trade. My country, Colombia, has\npaid a very high price in human lives as a consequence\nof this criminal activity.\nCountries that are exporters of small arms must\nestablish controls on intermediaries and refrain from\nauthorizing sales if there is a risk of improper use.\nThere is a need for greater transparency and for the\nexchange of information on the modalities and routes\nof this trade. We must urgently create mechanisms to\nprovide financial and technical assistance so that\naffected countries will be better able to implement\neffective controls. We have a responsibility to ensure\nthat the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects, to\nbe held in 2001, results in concrete commitments and\neffective action.\nThe global problem of illicit drugs, for its part,\ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats of our\ntime. It is a factor for violence and corruption,\neconomic disruption and impoverishment, erosion of\nthe social fabric and instability in democracies. It is\nalso a cause of alarming environmental disasters.\nNo nation has suffered as tragically as Colombia\nfrom the consequences of this global problem. Every\nday, lives are lost in Colombia through the action of\noutlaw groups whose activities are financed from\nresources obtained from the traffic in drugs. Now,\nwhen all our efforts are focused on the difficult battle\nagainst this problem, we need increased support and\nthe effective solidarity of the international community.\nOnly by accepting and fully implementing the\nprinciple of shared responsibility will humankind be\nable to free itself from the scourge of illicit drugs. We\nask for no more. Let us all assume the cost that is our\nshare to bear in order to wipe this illegal activity from\nthe face of the earth.\nColombia is making extraordinary efforts to\nadvance towards a solution to its internal conflict. It is\na fundamental objective that we will never renounce.\nWe are aware that the building of peace takes time, but\nwe are making steady progress. In the midst of the\ncomplexities of our situation in Colombia, and despite\nthe cruelty of the present conflict, we have made\nprogress in confidence-building, in the dialogue, in the\ndiscussion of the thematic agendas and in the\nparticipation of civil society. We know full well that\nthe achievement of peace requires in-depth action in\nthe economic and social fields that could give real and\nlasting content to these efforts.\nA number of countries have joined in this\nprocess, at the request of the Government. Today,\npeace in Colombia is important for the world. I appeal\nto the international community to reaffirm its solidarity\nand offer its material support to our peace process.\nOne of the most important developments of the\nlast two decades has been the increasing commitment\nto respect for human rights. We have made some\nprogress in defining economic and social rights as an\nindivisible component of so-called traditional rights or\nindividual freedoms. The old objections that prevented\nus from proclaiming the universal validity and\napplication of human rights are gradually losing way\nand States have accepted their responsibility for\nensuring compliance.\nIn recent years, civil conflicts have become a\nmajor expression of violence. International\nhumanitarian law is essential to deal with the\nconsequences of these confrontations. Its enforcement,\nhowever, requires agreement on the minimum rules of\nrespect for the civil population and the interests of\nStates. The key to that enforcement is that\nhumanitarian law  its postulates, norms and\nmechanisms  should be equally applied by all parties\nin conflict.\nThe movements of people, including refugees or\nmigrants, must also be recognized as a priority issue.\nThey are protected by a concrete framework of human\nrights. In a world that promotes the free movement of\ncapital and free trade, it is unacceptable that unjustified\n32\n\nrestrictions continue to be applied to the movement of\npeople.\nThe solution to concrete problems on the\ninternational agenda necessarily requires concerted\naction and multilateralism; Colombia has always been\nand will continue to be firmly committed to it. We\nbelieve that this multilateralism can be supplemented\nby convergent regional initiatives and bilateralism as\npart of an approach to reduce distances and\nimbalances  in other words, a multilateralism that\nserves as a bridge for rapprochement, solidarity and\nshared responsibility, concepts upon which the entire\nbuilding of the contemporary international order must\nbe constructed.\nOur peoples, in whose name the Charter of the\nUnited Nations was conceived, yearn to see how the\nfulfilment of the purposes and functions of the United\nNations can be reflected in the satisfaction of their\nhopes and aspirations. Even though in many respects\nwe are still far from this objective, we must preserve\nthe gains achieved. An attitude of passivity is not\nconvenient for the Organization. This Assembly must\nadopt decisions to reactivate the process of United\nNations reform, on realistic grounds, but without\nfurther delaying the measures that require urgent\nimplementation. There are many initiatives that can be\nrealized without the need for reform of the Charter. The\nonly thing required is the will to show solidarity and to\nmake timely political decisions.\nThe United Nations acts as the world's\nconscience, requiring greater priority in order to meet\nthe needs of the poor countries. Strategies must be\nurgently developed to mobilize funds to remove the\ncauses of underdevelopment. The growing gap between\nthe wealth of the prosperous and the poverty of those\nwho are marginalized from progress is in itself an\nappeal for attention which should be listened to and\nshould lead to the translation of words into deeds.\nIn this connection, we welcome the growing role\nbeing played by non-governmental organizations,\nwhose activities should be accompanied by a proper\ndefinition of their responsibilities. For their part, the\ntransnational corporations, which play such an\nimportant function in the global economy, should give\nserious consideration to the United Nations through\nfinancial support to the Organization, which is in\nurgent need of additional resources. This support could\nwell be channelled towards United Nations poverty-\nreduction programmes.\nThe reform of the Security Council continues to\nbe one of the principal reforms anticipated from the\nexpected adjustment of multilateral political\ninstitutions. But in this area we need a gradual, less\nmaximalist approach. Formulas must be explored to\nensure greater participation of developing countries.\nWe must take effective steps to promote greater\nrepresentativity in the Council, on the understanding\nthat this does not constitute a privilege, but rather a\nresponsibility. Broader regional representation,\nrestrictions on the use of the veto and greater\ntransparency in the decision-making process could\nbring the Security Council closer to a reality that is not\nthe same now in the twenty-first century as it was in\n1945.\nThe election of new members to the Council will\ntake place in a few weeks. Colombia has the support of\nLatin America and the Caribbean to be elected as a\nnon-Permanent Member of this important organ. Once\nour entry is approved by the General Assembly, we will\nassume this responsibility as of 1 January. It will be an\nopportunity to reaffirm Colombia's commitment to, and\nconfidence in, multilateralism and its resolute and\nunconditional commitment to the norms and principles\nof international law. We will also reaffirm our\nconviction that peaceful and negotiated solutions to\ndisputes and respect for international humanitarian law\nby all parties to a conflict are essential in order to build\nfirm and lasting foundations for peace and security. We\nwill promote better functioning of the Council,\nespecially in terms of information and consultation\nwith States that are not part of that organ, and we will\nfoster a more permanent and closer relationship with\nthe General Assembly as the supreme organ of the\nUnited Nations.\nNever before has humankind had the prospect\nlike the one now afforded at the beginning of the new\nmillennium to make steady progress towards peace,\nprogress and international stability. It is an opportunity\nfor the leaders of the world to make a decisive political\nstep in that direction. Let us give our peoples new hope\nthat the change in the millennium will signify not\nmerely a chronological change but also the beginning\nof a true political and social transformation. Only thus\nwill future generations recognize that we had the\ncourage to assume our obligations with responsibility."

        "file_text": "It is a source of great satisfaction for me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, a former Prime Minister of\nFinland, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, which\nfaithfully reflects your personal virtues and diplomatic\nexperience.\nI am also pleased to offer my most sincere\ncongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nNamibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his excellent work\nat the previous session, and in particular for his work to\ncoordinate the preparatory activities for the Millennium\nSummit.\nSpecial mention should be made of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his indefatigable work to\npromote the mandate of this Organization and for his\nvision for strengthening its future activities, set out in\nhis excellent report We, the peoples: the role of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century.\nWith regard to the situation in El Salvador, the\nprocess of implementing the peace agreements has\nbeen an exceptionally arduous and highly complex task\nthat has been made possible by the firm political will\nof the Government; by the willingness of the\nSalvadoran people and all the country's political\nforces; and by national efforts that have enjoyed the\nvaluable cooperation of the international community, in\nparticular the group of friendly countries, which have\nalways remained close to us, and the United Nations,\nwhose verification work has contributed to the success\nof peace in El Salvador and to national reconciliation.\nWe are now entering a new phase of our history\nin which political and economic freedoms prevail. This\nwill ensure the continuity of a broader and deeper\nprocess requiring the cooperation and participation of\nall national sectors and the renewed support of the\ninternational community in consolidating the progress\nachieved and in making further advances towards more\nhumane and supportive forms of co-existence within\nthe framework imposed by our institutions and\ndemocratic Government.\nDuring this phase, we have opened up new\npossibilities and opportunities for all sectors of the\ncountry to benefit from peace in democracy and to\nmeet together the challenge of continuing to work to\nreduce existing disparities in our society, particularly\neconomic and social ones. In this vein, poverty in its\nvarious forms is and always has been a structural\nproblem, of which every country in the world is aware.\nIn our case, we are according it priority attention, not\nonly to ensure that these phenomena do not undermine\nour emerging democracy, which was won by our people\nwith so much pain and blood, but also so that we can\nassign it due support and social context.\nOn this basis, President Francisco Flores of El\nSalvador has focused his government plan on\nincreasing the levels of well-being and progress for all\nSalvadorans. He has concentrated his attention on the\nmost vulnerable and dispossessed sectors in order to\nimprove their quality of life through a policy to\ngenerate employment and job opportunities via\nenhanced productivity, the promotion of trade and\nincreased investments on the basis of shared\nresponsibility. As President Flores has already done in\nthis forum, I would emphasize the fact that the future\nof our nation is in our own hands. Each individual,\ngroup and sector of our society must assume its own\nresponsibilities and duties in order to overcome the\nproblems of and obstacles to the promotion of growth\nand sustainable human development.\nSimilarly, President Flores has emphasized the\nfact that in a globalized and interdependent world,\nsolidarity and international cooperation are vital to\ncomplement the efforts of the developing countries in\norder to face the global challenges jointly and with\ngreater capacity. It must be understood that this does\nnot mean that the international community, and the\nindustrialized countries in particular, are going to solve\nour problems, but rather that they can contribute to the\ncreation of an international environment that provides\nopportunities, including policies that offer greater\naccess to their markets for the products of developing\ncountries, investment opportunities, the transfer of\ntechnology and information, and fulfilling the\ncommitments made to improve development assistance.\nWe know that we are facing an enormous and\ncomplex task, and in this effort we hope that we can\ncontinue to rely on the valuable support of the\nmultilateral institutions and the community of nations,\nwith whom we share interests and problems  in\nparticular the joint mission to preserve and consolidate\npeace after conflicts have come to an end. In this\nregard, as we celebrate the International Year for the\nCulture of Peace, I would like to reiterate the\nimportance that El Salvador attaches to the continuity\nof the efforts focused on strengthening a culture of\npeace, especially on the eve of the International\n16\n\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\nthe Children of the World.\nIn Central America, since 1987, when the\nagreement on the Procedures for the establishment of\na firm and lasting peace in Central America was\nsigned, our peoples have welcomed with hope and have\nsupported national, regional and international\ninitiatives to achieve pacification in the region. These\nefforts culminated in specific agreements that made it\npossible to end the armed conflicts in the affected\ncountries and to carry out profound political and\ninstitutional transformations, which have contributed to\nimproving living conditions for all the peoples in the\nregion.\nAlong the way we have adopted and implemented\nmeasures and mechanisms that, in a general sense, have\nmade it possible to guarantee human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, establishing the base from\nwhich Central America can begin democratic life, free\nfrom armed conflicts and with legitimate and\nsovereignly elected Governments. These Governments,\nin fulfilment of their historical responsibilities, have\nestablished institutions and developed a process of\nconsultation in order to coordinate and harmonize\nefforts to overcome the profound causes of conflicts\nand to avoid retreating from the advances achieved.\nIt is important to reiterate in this forum that the\ncountries of Central America have reaffirmed our\ncommitments to make Central America a region of\npeace, liberty, democracy and development, and in\nparticular to foster gradually and progressively a\nCentral American union. This is the best route for\nensuring a prosperous future for the region and, at the\nsame time, to strengthen our capacity to confront our\nproblems in the best possible way, as well as to take on\nthe new challenges arising from globalization and\ninterdependence.\nThere is no doubt that the progress achieved at\nthe regional level in the coordination and unification of\nthe internal and external policies of the countries of the\nregion represents real proof of the determination of our\nGovernments to make sure that unity prevails over\ndivision. In our opinion there are more reasons that\nunite us than divide us, and we affirm with complete\nconfidence that in a globalized and interdependent\ncontext the viability of Central America will depend on\nthe joint effort to build our common historic future.\nThis is why we must reorient our efforts so that they\nmeet the requirements, aspirations and needs of our\nCentral American people, through specific programmes\nthat provide our people direct and tangible benefits.\nAllow me to speak about other important items on\nthe agenda and in the current international situation\nthat are of interest to the Government of El Salvador.\nA few days ago the Millennium Summit was\nconcluded, and we can say that the results obtained in\nthe deliberations and reflected in the final Declaration\nhave inspired us with hope. In particular we are\nheartened by the commitments made to strengthen\npeace, security and disarmament. Among the most\nnotable of these commitments are to eliminate weapons\nof mass destruction and to fight against transnational\ncrime in all its dimensions, including the global\nproblem of drugs and related crimes, against the illicit\ntrafficking in small arms, and against international\nterrorism.\nWe also are hopeful because of the commitments\non a highly sensitive and worrisome issue for our\ncountries: development and the eradication of poverty,\nand also on the need to develop a multilateral trade and\nfinancial system that is open and equitable and is based\non rules that are predictable and non-discriminatory.\nAnd we are also hopeful because of the commitments\nto make sure that the high-level intergovernmental\nmeeting on financing for development is a success.\nWe should mention as well the decision to reduce\nby half, by the year 2015, the percentage of people on\nthe Earth whose income is less than one dollar a day,\nincluding reducing hunger, and on access to drinking\nwater, promoting equal access to various levels of\neducation and promoting gender equality, reducing\nmaternal mortality and the propagation of diseases\nincluding AIDS, and protecting vulnerable individuals.\nWe would also highlight the commitments made\nto preserve the environment and to intensify efforts to\nreduce the number and effects of natural disasters. We\nwould highlight as well the commitments regarding\nviolations of human rights, democracy and the good\nmanagement of political affairs.\nIn our opinion the issue of the strengthening of\nthe United Nations deserves special attention because\nof the situation that the Organization currently faces\nwith regard to fulfilling its mandate, which has been\napparent during the last 10 years more than at any other\ntime in its history. A crisis of confidence, credibility\n17\n\nand capacity has increased the conviction of the\nmajority of Member States that it is absolutely\nnecessary to introduce substantive changes in the basic\nstructure of the Organization and in its decision-\nmaking processes in order to reflect the realities of the\ncurrent international order, which has greatly changed\nsince the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe international situation today is more\ncomplex, multifaceted and uncertain, blending\nproblems and conflicts that have become permanent\nfixtures on the international agenda, and there are new\nchallenges and threats that transcend national borders.\nThese include phenomena that undermine the security,\nsovereignty and independence of States. Taken\ntogether, these developments provide yet further\njustification for the existence of the United Nations, as\nwell as for the validity of its objectives and principles.\nWe recognize and welcome the changes\nintroduced in the basic functional and administrative\nstructure of the United Nations in order to improve its\nefficiency. Nevertheless, we share the general opinion\nregarding the imperative need to undertake integral\nreform. This reform should include substantial\ntransformations in the principal organs, not only so that\nthe Organization can better fulfil its mandate, but also\nto overcome the contradictions underlying provisions\nin the Charter so that the system will function in a truly\ndemocratic and transparent manner.\nFirst, we must recognize that for many years now\nthe mandate of the Economic and Social Council has\nbeen questioned. Therefore, we believe it is necessary\nto resume negotiations aimed at adopting measures to\nrevitalize one the main functions of the United Nations,\nwhich is the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment. In particular, priority should be granted\nto sustainable development, with special emphasis on\nfighting poverty, the fight against drugs and AIDS, the\nprotection of the environment and respect for human\nrights. All of this is in conformity with the\ncommitments in the Millennium Declaration and\nespecially with the objectives pursued through\npreventive diplomacy. For this purpose, we believe it is\nappropriate to reexamine the initiative to create an\neconomic security council which would be responsible\nfor dealing with development problems.\nSecondly, we believe it is extremely important to\nexamine and evaluate the functions and powers of the\nGeneral Assembly, given that this is an essential organ\nand the most representative body in the structure of the\nOrganization. Nevertheless, its decisions are limited\nand are not binding upon the Member States. As a\nresult efforts must be made to strengthen and broaden\nthe Assembly's competence as a political forum in\norder to ensure the true role that it must play in world\naffairs. In particular the Assembly should be given\ngreater responsibility in the decision-making process.\nThis would not only strengthen the democratization\nand transparency of the actions of the Organization; it\nwould also give the Assembly the legitimacy it requires\nin order to carry out collective action.\nThirdly, the reform of the Security Council is,\nfrom our point of view, one of the biggest challenges\nfacing Member States, for my Government it is a\nmatter of concern that after seven years of negotiations\nwe have not made progress on the substantive points\nrelated to the category, number and privileges of new\nmembers, as well as on the question of the veto, which\nis currently an exclusive privilege of the permanent\nmembers.\nThe differences and the inflexible positions we\nhave seen are unacceptable because they create a\nsituation which, in our view, contributes to the lack of\ncredibility and a loss of confidence in the system of\ncollective security. It is urgent and we cannot postpone\novercoming our differences and granting each other\nconcessions so that we can reach a general, fair and\nequitable agreement in order to achieve the aims of the\nreform and realize the legitimate interests and hopes of\nmost of the countries of the international community.\nEl Salvador joins in the very fair demand,\nexpressed so many times in this forum, to increase the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members to\ninclude industrialized and developing countries,\nfaithfully reflecting the current world configuration.\nThe numbers should reflect the current membership of\nthe Organization with equal responsibilities and due\nrespect for geographic distribution. The use of the veto\nprivilege should be limited to Chapter VII of the\nCharter.\nI would like now to refer to other important\nissues which are part of the Assembly's agenda in the\nnew millennium. These issues have important\nrepercussions for Member States as regards\ninternational peace and security, as well as serious\nconsequences for the future of our Organization.\n18\n\nOn behalf of the people and Government of El\nSalvador, we welcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the\nOrganization. This act confirms the right of people to\nbe represented in this worldwide Organization and\nillustrates the universal nature of the United Nations.\nThe Charter was adopted on behalf of the people\nwho comprise the international community and,\nconsequently, the United Nations cannot, and must not,\nclose the door to any people which expresses its\nsovereign will and desire to be represented in the world\nOrganization.\nMay I refer to the special case which has been\ndiscussed in the Assembly each of the last eight years\nregarding the need to examine the exceptional\ninternational situation of the Republic of China in\nTaiwan with a view to guaranteeing full respect for the\nfundamental rights of its 23 million inhabitants to\nparticipate in the activities of the United Nations.\nWe support the establishment of a working group\nin the Assembly to examine the appropriate place that\nthe Republic of China should have in international\nbodies. We want to make it quite clear that our support\nfor this initiative is not intended as an intervention in\nthe internal affairs of another Member State. Nor does\nit represent opposition to the peaceful reunification of\nthe Chinese people. Rather, it represents the\nrecognition of the right of a people to realize their just\naspirations, a people which exercises democratic rights\nin a country with which we have had excellent relations\nfor more than 50 years.\nEl Salvador participated with great interest in the\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We\nrecognize that, even though the results were not exactly\nwhat we desired, encouraging agreements and\ndecisions were reached in the effort to achieve the\nobjectives of the denuclearization regime which seeks\nto encourage nuclear States to act in good faith, to meet\ntheir international responsibilities and duties and to\ncontinue negotiations aimed at eliminating the threat of\nnuclear war. With these ideas, we join the members of\nthe international community who have expressed their\nfirm support for the proposal by the Secretary-General\nto convene an international conference aimed at\nseeking ways to eliminate the nuclear threat.\nWith regard to conventional weapons, we wish to\nrefer specifically to small arms and light weapons in\nlight of the fact that El Salvador underwent the tragic\nexperience of an armed conflict during the 1980s  a\nconflict that was intense and of long duration precisely\nbecause of the entry and spread of this type of\nweaponry  weaponry which entered our country\nillegally in order to supply the irregular militias.\nHowever, these weapons reached other parts of the\npopulation and resulted in a large number of casualties\nand the phenomenon of displaced persons and refugees\nfrom the areas of conflict. This situation was solved\nafter the signing of the Peace Agreement in 1992.\nNot only do small arms and light weapons affect\nconflicts, be they internal or international, but traffic in\nthese weapons has become a danger for public security\nand a threat to stability, as well as a threat to the\ndemocracy and sovereignty of States, when these\nweapons are used in activities that constitute\ntransnational threats, such as terrorism, drug\ntrafficking, money laundering and international crime.\nFor this reason we firmly support the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held in 200l.\nWith regard to domestic or international conflicts\nthat continue to occupy the attention of the\ninternational community and our Organization, we can\nonly express our concern and regret that agreements\nhave not yet been reached to guarantee peace, despite\nmultilateral efforts. We urge all parties directly\ninvolved in each of the countries in conflict to abandon\ntheir individual or group interests so that through a\nnational effort, political agreements can be reached\nwhich will make it possible for lasting permanent\npeace to be established in conformity with the\naspirations of the peoples.\nMay I also refer to the Middle East. Here we\nbelieve that the recent negotiations at Camp David are\nan important step in the difficult road to peace. We\nhope that it will be possible to achieve stable and\nlasting peace within sure borders for all the peoples of\nthe region.\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the\nMillennium Summit and the Millennium Assembly are\nhistoric events that could mark the beginning of a new\nera in the international order. Indeed, the Millennium\nDeclaration is an ambitious but vital programme to\ncollectively resolve our common problems. Hence, it is\nimperative that the commitments which we have made\nbecome a reality and, in the short term, we should take\nconcrete steps and show political will for their\n19\n\nimplementation. The peoples and Governments of the\ndeveloping world will be watching closely and we shall\ndo our utmost to implement those commitments. From\na realistic point of view they require the decisive\nsupport of the developed world in order to be fully\nimplemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\ncongratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and to\ncommend him for the able leadership he has shown\nsince the beginning of our session. With his wisdom\nand vast experience, there is no doubt that he will\nguide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.\nIn the same vein, I would also like to commend\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the outgoing President, for the\nprofessional and efficient manner in which he\nconducted the affairs of this Assembly.\nLast but by no means least, I pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General for the dynamic and visionary\nmanner in which he has been carrying out his mandate.\nI would also like to seize this opportunity to\ncongratulate him for his forward-looking millennium\nreport, entitled, \u201cWe the peoples: the role of the United\nNations in the twenty-first century\u201d.\nMay I also join previous speakers in\ncongratulating Tuvalu on its admission as the newest\nMember of the United Nations.\nThe Millennium Summit that has just ended was a\nhistoric event that brought together world leaders of the\nhighest political echelon who rededicated themselves\nto the principles of the United Nations. As the\nSummit's political declaration and outcome document\nindicate, our leaders considered the various challenges\nfaced by the United Nations, exchanged views and\nexplored ideas on the role that the Organization is\nexpected to play in the twenty-first century. I am\nconfident that, through concerted efforts, we, the\nservants of the people, will energize our United\nNations to enable it to tackle the challenges of this\ncentury.\nSome of the important issues that were raised\nduring the recently concluded Summit, such as conflict\nresolution, poverty eradication, accessibility to health\ncare and debt relief, to mention only a few, have been\nechoed by many speakers since the general debate\nbegan. An issue that is of particular concern to the\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia and to my\ndelegation is that of conflict situations, particularly\nthose in Africa. I am referring to situations such as\nthose that currently prevail in Angola, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Sierra\nLeone, the Comoros, Somalia, Guinea and Liberia.\nIn Angola, we are concerned about the continuing\ncivil strife and its negative impact on the well-being of\nthe brotherly people of that country. It is an open secret\nthat the intransigence of UNITA is largely responsible\nfor the present state of affairs. We therefore commend\nthe Security Council sanctions Committee on Angola,\nespecially the work done by Ambassador Fowler and\nhis Panel of Experts, to show the way forward on how\nto reduce UNITA's capacity to wage war. We hope that\n29\n\nthe recommendations contained in the Panel's report\nwill be fully and scrupulously implemented, and that\nthis will force UNITA to return to the negotiating table.\nWe are equally alarmed at the volatile situation in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and its\nrepercussions throughout the Great Lakes region. My\ndelegation therefore strongly urges the belligerents,\nsignatories of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, to\nadhere to the Agreement's terms and conditions, with a\nview to accelerating the peace process.\nRegarding Ethiopia and Eritrea, we are heartened\nby the current adherence to the June 2000 ceasefire and\nstrongly urge the two brotherly countries to accelerate\nnegotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement that\nwould hopefully lead to a definitive conclusion of the\nregrettable two-year-long border conflict. In this\nconnection, my delegation strongly supports the speedy\ndeployment of a peacekeeping mission to the disputed\narea.\nSomalia also continues to attract our attention.\nWe therefore commend President Ismail Omar Guelleh\nfor his relentless endeavour to broker the Djibouti\nprocess that culminated in the recent election of\nPresident Abdikassim Salad Hassan. We wish President\nSalad Hassan all the best in his onerous task of forming\na representative Government, a Government of national\nunity, and in the uphill task of rebuilding his war-torn\ncountry. We also appeal to all the Somali factions to\nput their differences aside, to put their country first and\nto join in the concerted effort to achieve the national\nunity that has eluded Somalia since 1991. We all\nwelcome Somalia into the international community\nonce more, as it has now started occupying its seats in\ninternational meetings.\nNearer to home, the volatile situations in the\nbrotherly countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia\ncontinue to be of great concern to us. My delegation,\nhowever, takes heart in the Security Council's decision,\nby its resolution 1317 (2000), to extend the mandate of\nthe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. This,\ntogether with the efforts being deployed by the\nEconomic Community of West African States, will\ndefinitely bring about positive results very soon.\nAt this point, we also want to commend the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom for stepping in\nwith military assistance to bolster the United Nations\ntroops there, showing courage and leadership when it\nwas most needed. Other members of the Security\nCouncil should emulate that example and show\nleadership by example.\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of the\nspecial court for Sierra Leone to try war crimes and\nother atrocities. Our only disappointment is that, unlike\nthe case of other tribunals, funding is based on\nvoluntary contributions. How, then, do we expect the\nSierra Leone special court to function effectively and\nefficiently? Are we serious about the need to eradicate\nthe culture of impunity? We also appreciate the work\nbeing done by the Security Council to ban the trade in\nconflict diamonds.\nAt the national, regional and subregional levels,\nthe Secretary-General's 1998 report (A/52/871) on the\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\nand sustainable development in Africa remains a useful\nguide in our collective efforts to resolve conflicts\naround the continent and at the same time address the\nproblem of development.\nIn addition to that, the Brahimi report on United\nNations peace and security activities is indeed very\ntimely, but we will be doing justice to the report only if\nwe implement the recommendations contained in it and\ndo so as soon as possible.\nApart from the conflicts in Africa, we are also\nclosely monitoring conflict situations in other parts of\nthe world, such as the Middle East, the Korean\npeninsula and the Taiwan Strait. In the Middle East, my\ndelegation strongly supports the peace process and the\nindefatigable efforts of President Bill Clinton to help\nthe parties concerned to reach an agreement\nsatisfactory to all sides. We must always bear in mind,\nhowever, that the relevant Security Council resolutions,\nespecially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\nremain the most credible basis for a just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East.\nIf we unanimously agree that might is not right in\none part of the world, we should apply the same\nprinciple in any other part of the world. I will refer to a\nnumber of situations.\nIn regard to the situation between Kuwait and\nIraq, we in the Gambia have always maintained that the\ninternational community should, as a matter of\nurgency, find ways of alleviating the suffering of the\nIraqi people. But, at the same time, the Iraqi leadership\nmust be accountable for the Kuwaiti prisoners of war\nand missing persons. The families of the prisoners of\n30\n\nwar and missing persons have also been suffering for\ntoo long. Furthermore, we cannot treat lightly the issue\nof the Kuwaiti national archives, still in Iraqi hands.\nThey must be returned, as must all other property\nremoved illegally from Kuwait at the time of the\ninvasion. Let us be fair to the people of Kuwait. They\nlook to the international community for the justice that\nthey so rightly deserve.\nLet justice prevail everywhere. The sanctions\nimposed on Libya have been suspended, but what is\nstopping the Security Council from lifting them\naltogether? Libya has complied with all the conditions\nlaid down by the Security Council. We therefore call on\nthe Council to keep its part of the bargain. Still on the\nsubject of Libya, the Government of the Gambia would\nlike to congratulate President Muammar Al-Qadhafi for\nthe preponderant role that he played to defuse the\nhostage crisis in the Philippines, in the spirit of\ngoodwill and respect for human rights.\nWe also hope that the differences between the\nUnited States of America and the Republic of the\nSudan over the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant will soon\nhave a peaceful solution in the interests of all.\nWe also believe that the people of the Comoros\nshould be listening, too, so that, through the efforts\nthey are making to resolve locally the division existing\nin their country they will reach a definitive solution, in\nthe interests of the continent of Africa as well as of the\ninternational community as a whole, that will make us\nall proud.\nLet me come back to the issue of sanctions, but\nthis time I want to talk about Cuba. The unjust\nsanctions imposed on Cuba for over 30 years should be\nlifted, as called for by many people of good will\naround the world, including some lawmakers here in\nthe United States who believe that such sanctions are\nof another age and are not conducive to good-\nneighbourliness and international cooperation. It is our\nfervent hope that common sense will soon prevail so\nthat at long last we will see the normalization of\nrelations between the United States and Cuba, two\nneighbours, two great countries that have a lot to offer\nto their peoples and to the rest of the world.\nIt is in this spirit that my delegation hails the\nthaw in relations between North and South Korea\nsignalled by the June 2000 Summit in Pyongyang\nbetween Presidents Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung. We\nencourage the two brotherly countries to continue on\nthe path of reconciliation, which we hope will lead to\nthe eventual reunification of the two Koreas.\nMeanwhile, we are here yet again to reason with\nthe Assembly about the pressing need to reconsider its\nposition with regard to the case of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan. At this moment, when we the United\nNations are at a crossroads, when history is in the\nmaking, when we are talking about inclusiveness,\nuniversality, globalization, democratization \u2014 and the\nlist goes on \u2014 it defies logic that a country of 23\nmillion people, with all that they have to offer to the\nrest of mankind, is continuously barred from\nparticipating in the work and activities of the United\nNations. The Republic of China has a national flag,\nnational ceremonies and systems that are recognized all\nover the world. It is also one of the most advanced in\nthe field of technology and electronics, agriculture and\nmedicine.\nHere is a country relatively small in size, but in\nterms of social, economic, financial, cultural,\ntechnological and scientific achievements, the Republic\nof China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckoned\nwith, a formidable powerhouse. This country has\nalways espoused everything that our Organization\nstands for: its purposes and principles, its aims and\nobjectives, its shared values and dreams. The Republic\nof China is not discouraged. We must in the spirit of\ndemocracy and justice allow it to hoist its flag as an\nindependent nation in this edifice of the United\nNations.\nIt is my delegation's firm belief that this historic\noccasion of the Millennium Summit is the time to\nembrace opportunities, make progress on issues that\ndivide us, move forward and look to the future with\nconfidence, rather than living in the past, burying our\nheads in the sand or turning the other way. If we look\nclosely at the documents prepared for the Millennium\nSummit \u2014 whether the one introduced by the\nSecretary-General or the working draft prepared by the\nGeneral Assembly President \u2014 it will be seen that on\nalmost all the issues raised in these important\ndocuments the Republic of China has much to offer.\nLet us take human rights, democracy and good\ngovernance. It will be recalled that on 18 March this\nyear, the Republic of China held its second presidential\nelection. Nearly 12.8 million people, approximately 83\nper cent of all eligible voters in Taiwan, participated in\nthe election, vigorously contested by candidates from\n31\n\nall political parties. The opposition won the election,\nwhich resulted in an unprecedented transition of power\nfrom one political party to another, in an orderly and\npeaceful process. After that result the country still\nseeks to be a part of this house.\nIn the area of development and poverty\neradication, we have witnessed on a number of\noccasions how the Republic of China has, through its\nInternational Economic Cooperation and Development\nFund, been collaborating with such agencies as the\nAsian Development Bank, the Central American Bank\nfor Economic Integration and the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development to support\ndevelopment projects around the world.\nAs for the crucial sector of information and\ncommunications technology and the revolution in this\nfield, it is an open secret that the Republic of China is\nin the vanguard. We will be talking a great deal about\nthe growing digital divide. We have to bridge this\ndivide, and it goes without saying that one of the major\npillars of this bridge is the Republic of China.\nHow, then, can this country be excluded from the\nUnited Nations family? Furthermore, in this era of\nglobalization and liberalization, it is impossible to\nunderstand how a leading trading nation like the\nRepublic of China could be excluded from playing its\nrightful role in the comity of nations. The Republic of\nChina is one of the most successful examples of\neconomic development in the twentieth century and is\nnow the world's nineteenth largest economy in terms of\ngross domestic product and the fourteenth most\nimportant trading nation. And, yes, it possesses the\nthird largest amount of foreign reserves in the world.\nWhat is even more praiseworthy is that the\nRepublic of China has over the years sent more than\n10,000 experts to train technicians in countries all over\nthe world, especially in developing countries. In\naddition, it has also been providing disaster relief\naround the world amounting to billions of dollars. This\ncountry continues to respond promptly and positively\nto United Nations appeals for emergency relief and\nrehabilitation for countries suffering from natural\ndisasters and wars.\nIt will also be useful and helpful to talk about\ncross-strait relations just to show that the door to\ndialogue is not completely shut between the Republic\nof China and the People's Republic of China. In fact\nsince 1987 more than 12 million visits have been\narranged and 100 million letters and phone calls\nexchanged. Last year alone some 2 million visits were\nexchanged. We note with a sense of great satisfaction\nthat cross-strait trade totalled $27 billion. These figures\nspeak volumes. This is why we believe that we should\nnot only take note of, but also support, the conciliatory\ngestures of the Republic of China towards the People's\nRepublic of China, especially the request for a summit\nto pursue cross-strait reconciliation efforts without\nspecifying any preconditions, format or location. The\nnewly elected President of the Republic of China even\nwent further, by expressing the hope that the leaders of\nthe Republic of China and the People's Republic of\nChina would respect the free choice of the people on\nboth sides and work together to resolve the question of\na future one China.\nWhile working to achieve that goal, we, the\nUnited Nations, should help the process by considering\nhow both sides of the Taiwan Strait can participate at\nthe same time in the United Nations. We are confident\nthat, as was the case with the former East Germany and\nthe former West Germany, parallel representation of\ndivided nations in the United Nations \u2014 in addition to\ncontributing to regional peace and security \u2014 can lead\nto their peaceful unification.\nOther than conflict situations in the world,\npoverty eradication is a matter that is close to our\nheart. Indeed, as we begin the twenty-first century,\npoverty remains our number one challenge to\nsustainable human development. In this connection, I\nwould like to mention that about three weeks ago the\nGambia launched the 1998 National Household Poverty\nSurvey and the 1999-2000 Participatory Assessment\nNational Summary reports. The poverty survey\nrevealed that households engaged in farming and the\ninformal sectors record the highest poverty incidence,\nat 80 per cent and 85 per cent respectively. Some of the\ncauses identified were low crop yields, inaccessibility\nto credit, low rainfall, poor soil fertility,\nunemployment, insufficient food, lack of income for\nbasic needs, poor health and lack of education. We\nintend to address these causes within the framework of\nThe Gambia's Vision 2020, our national blueprint for\nsocio-economic development. The President of the\nRepublic of The Gambia has thus reinforced the use of\ntractors and mechanized ploughing and modern\nagriculture techniques in order to increase the\nproduction of rice, groundnuts and other agricultural\ncommodities, in an effort to achieve self-sufficiency.\n32\n\nEfforts to eradicate poverty should also include a\nhealth component. Indeed, as the World Bank rightly\nputs it, a major acceleration of growth is unlikely\nwithout a dramatic improvement in human capital,\nparticularly public health. This is why my delegation\nfinds the concept of the Global Alliance for Vaccines\nand Immunization very attractive indeed, especially in\nits strategic objectives. Let me at this juncture\ncommend the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for\nits generous contribution towards the delivery of\nvaccines in the poorest countries and for supporting\nresearch with a view to developing vaccines.\nReferring specifically to research in the area of\nmalaria, I am proud to state that the Medical Research\nCouncil in the Gambia has always enjoyed the support\nand encouragement of my Government. The Medical\nResearch Council has over the years accumulated a lot\nof experience and expertise. I am sure that the Global\nAlliance can make use of such experience and expertise\nin carrying out its own mandate.\nFor us in West Africa, the eradication of malaria\nis among our highest priorities. We, particularly the\nGambia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of\nGuinea, have been meeting at the subregional level to\ngive effect to the World Health Organization's Roll\nBack Malaria strategy and to develop other preventive\nand curative remedies for implementation at the\nnational level.\nThe recent breakthrough in human science\nthrough the successful decoding of the human genome,\nand the bright prospects for genome science, will allow\nfor the development of vaccines and medicines as\nremedies for deadly diseases all over the world. What\nis even more amazing about that major scientific\nbreakthrough is its reaffirmation of our common\nhumanity. The language of the book of life is in fact the\nsame for all peoples, irrespective of race, religion or\nregion.\nIn efforts to make the world a better place for\nhumankind, we also need to adopt a fresher approach\nregarding economic development issues, such as the\ndebt burden and trade access, official development\nassistance and financing for development, to mention\nonly a few. As one of the least developed countries, the\nGambia looks forward to the forthcoming Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\nto be held in March 2001. My delegation fully supports\nthe Secretary-General's proposal to urge industrialized\ncountries to consider granting duty-free and quota-free\naccess for essentially all exports from least developed\ncountries.\nI must add that in addressing the specific\nproblems of least developed countries, extra efforts\nshould be made to tackle the excruciating debt burden\nacross the board, rather than limiting the approach to a\nselect number of countries as provided for under the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative. We note, sadly, that the international\ncommunity's effort to resolve Africa's external debt\nproblems continues to fall short of the desired results.\nThe adoption of the HIPC initiative by the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund, while\ncomplementing global efforts, also falls short of the\nexpected target: complete cancellation of the debt stock\nof all developing countries is what should happen.\nUnless that is done, the debt burden will continue to\nhave a negative impact on the availability of adequate\nresources to finance Africa's economic recovery and\nsocial development.\nThe task of peace-building and peacemaking at\nthe national and international levels and the other tasks\nwithin the United Nations mandate are facilitated\nbecause we are fortunate to have an organization such\nas the United Nations to provide the framework for\nsuch efforts. As the Secretary-General aptly puts it in\nhis \u201cWe the peoples\u201d report, the United Nations is\n\u201cthe only body of its kind with universal\nmembership and comprehensive scope, and\nencompassing so many areas of human\nendeavour. These features make it a uniquely\nuseful forum \u2014 for sharing information,\nconducting negotiations, elaborating norms and\nvoicing expectations, coordinating the behaviour\nof States and other actors, and pursuing common\nplans of action.\u201d (A/54/2000, para. 8)\nRegrettably, the Organization has not always been\nin a position to carry out its peacekeeping and other\nimportant roles effectively. This is due mainly to a\ndearth of financial resources. Therefore, if it is to\nassume the important role the founding fathers\nassigned it in the first place, that of meeting the needs\nof the world's peoples, we the Member States have to\nprovide it with the necessary financial and other\nresources. The United Nations is expected to play an\neven greater role in the twenty-first century.\n33\n\nQuite apart from providing the Organization with\nthe necessary resources, there will be a need to carry\nout some reforms, especially of the Security Council.\nWe must begin by making its membership more\nreflective of present-day realities. Any reform of the\nSecurity Council must first and foremost address the\nserious anomaly which excludes Africa from the\npresent permanent membership category. This must be\ncorrected; Africa must be given a minimum of two\npermanent seats if and when the Council is ever\nreformed. In an organization like ours, the right of veto\nis a rebellion against democracy. For the five\npermanent members of the Security Council to\nunderstand the present situation as being unfair will be\na mark of their sense of equity and justice. We will\nthen know that they too want a Council based on\nmutual respect and fraternal cooperation in the service\nof humanity at large.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once\nagain that the United Nations is the best legacy that the\nfounding fathers could have left for the peoples of the\nworld. It has served us reasonably well for the past 55\nyears, nations big and small, rich and poor. It can serve\nus even better in the twenty-first century provided that\nwe have the political will to strengthen the\nOrganization so that it can carry on with the difficult\nbut not impossible task of making this world a better\nplace for all nations. That is the hope of my country.\nWe are certain that all together we will be able to\nachieve it.\nWe should remain optimistic, because we know\nthat, as Professor Pierre-Henri Simon was wont to say\nin his lectures at the Sorbonne, life begins on the other\nside of despair. The United Nations was created in the\nmidst of despair as a haven of hope, peace, progress\nand justice for all. It should also be, for all of us, in\njustice and in truth, an asylum from the cruelty and\npain of the outside world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset,\nallow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you,\nSir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. It is without doubt a\nfitting recognition of your rich personal experience as\nwell as Finland's role in world affairs.\nThe Millennium Summit has made it clear that, in\nthe words of the Secretary-General,\n\u201cthe United Nations remains as much in demand\nas in need of change.\u201d (Global Governance 4\n(1998), p. 123)\nThis is a formidable challenge, but also an opportunity,\nand the cost of not rising to the new calls of the next\nmillennium can be dangerous.\nI cannot but recall that many ideas on\nglobalization and governance generated and debated at\nthe current session echo the concept of \u201cmanagement\nof interdependencies\u201d, put forward by our President,\n12\n\nMr. Eduard Shevardnadze, at the forty-seventh session\nin 1992. With this in mind, let me address some of\nthose important issues from our standpoint.\nThe end of totalitarian regimes set in motion a\nwhole host of progressive changes within and among\ncountries. However, we are still struggling with the\nadverse legacies of totalitarianism. The experience of\nthe post-cold-war era clearly demonstrates that intra-\nState conflicts have become a major threat to\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-\nGeneral's report to the Millennium Summit called for\nreshaping of the United Nations approach to\npeacekeeping to meet the challenges of this new global\nthreat. This very idea is particularly topical for the\nregion I represent. As my colleague, the Foreign\nMinister of Germany, said: \u201cthe triangle between\nCentral Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East\u201d being\n\u201cfull of destabilizing factors \u2026 is threatening to\nbecome the crisis region of the century ahead.\u201d\n() Therefore, this region merits closer\nattention by the international community.\nIn this context, I also endorse the appeal by the\nAustrian Foreign Minister, in her capacity as\nChairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for enhanced\npolitical awareness by the world community of these\nunresolved or potential conflicts and security risks,\nwhich she said\n\u201care often outside the spotlight of broader public\nattention, but nevertheless have a highly\ndestabilizing impact on the region and\nbeyond.\u201d()\nPeriodic failures of United Nations peace efforts,\nmanifested, for instance, in the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of\nthe predominantly Georgian population during the\ntragic developments in Abkhazia, Georgia, highlighted\nall the flaws of selective peacekeeping. Well-\nintentioned United Nations efforts have sometimes\nbeen delayed and ineffective in conflicts which the\nworld community regards as peripheral. I believe that\nwe should make every effort to prevent conflicts\nbecoming \u201cfrozen\u201d.\nConsequently, we support the Secretary-General's\nproposal aimed at implementing necessary changes to\nincrease the effectiveness of United Nations peace\nefforts in general. I cannot help but call for the more\nfrequent and firm application of the United Nations\npeace-enforcement mechanisms envisioned in Chapter\nVII of the Charter, in particular those for coping with\nprotracted conflicts.\nThe Charter calls for the consent of the parties\ninvolved when launching peacekeeping operations or\nrenewing their mandate. However, peacekeeping\npractices often play into the hands of separatists trying\nto maintain the status quo. We believe that the United\nNations should intensify its efforts to balance the\ninterests of all sides with the dynamics of the peace\nprocess and the comprehensive resolution of conflicts.\nMoreover, we welcome the further enhancement of the\nUnited Nations standby arrangement system and the\nimprovement of the Organization's rapid-deployment\ncapabilities.\nGeorgia also expresses its agreement with the\nUnited States initiative to reconsider the scale of\nassessments and the reallocation of the cost of United\nNations peacekeeping. In the context of increasing the\neffectiveness of United Nations peace operations, this\ninitiative is of great significance.\nIn addition, complex conflicts, such as that in\nAbkhazia, Georgia, which has left hundreds of\nthousands of internally displaced persons deprived of\nthe right to return to their permanent places of\nresidence, must be addressed within a multifaceted\nframework, which entails social and economic\napproaches, along with political ones.\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for the\ninvaluable assistance it provides to the refugees and\ninternally displaced persons in Georgia. I also express\nour special appreciation for the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme assistance programmes in\nGeorgia, particularly those aimed at improving the\nliving conditions of the internally displaced persons\nand increasing their self-reliance.\nI am stressing the issue of peacekeeping as it is\ndirectly related to the most sensitive problem for my\ncountry in the past seven years, since it fell victim to\naggressive separatism in Abkhazia, Georgia. I reiterate\nthat a peaceful resolution of this conflict is the only\nacceptable option for the Georgian Government. In this\nrespect, I extend our gratitude to the United Nations\nand to the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General\nfor their efforts in support of the peace process. But we\nshould also admit that so far we have failed to achieve\nany tangible results here.\n13\n\nRecently, within the United Nations framework\nand in accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolution, a document on the distribution of\nconstitutional competences between Tbilisi and\nSokhumi has been drafted. We support this initiative\nand find it difficult to understand what stands in the\nway of its timely endorsement. We are convinced that\nsubmission of the document for consideration by the\nSecurity Council should not be delayed; its\nendorsement by the Security Council as a basis for\npolitical negotiations will create a sound ground for\nadvancing the peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia.\nFurthermore, I reiterate that about 300,000\npredominantly Georgian refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons from that conflict zone are still being\nsubjected to the continuous violation of their rights and\ndifficult living conditions. The return of the internally\ndisplaced persons to their rightful places of residence is\ncontinuously hampered by the Abkhaz side, with\nblatant disregard for internationally recognized norms,\nas well as for a number of Security Council resolutions.\nWe strongly believe that there is an urgent need for the\nSecurity Council to address those issues in a timely\nmanner.\nIt has become apparent that at times the United\nNations is not capable of handling conflicts on its own.\nI strongly believe that the key to more effective United\nNations peace policies in our region lies in closer\ncollaboration and synchronized action with such\nregional organizations as the OSCE and other European\nstructures. Regrettably, the reality remains different.\nHaving established that \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d was\ntaking place in Abkhazia, Georgia, the OSCE called for\nthe dispatch of a fact-finding mission to push forward\nthe peace process. However, the United Nations\nremains reluctant to accept the OSCE findings. While it\nis struggling with a variety of approaches, the \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d of the Georgian population in Abkhazia\ncontinues. There is therefore a great need to ensure\nconcerted action by the United Nations and regional\norganizations in the process of conflict management\nand resolution.\nThe dilemma of humanitarian intervention could\nbe described as being inherent to the transition from an\ninternational to a global \u2014 and, hence, more human-\ncentred \u2014 world. It has put in a new light the\ncorrelation between human rights and security. We are\nstrong proponents of a value-based, universal global\norder. Therefore, we are confident that the international\ncommunity should focus on establishing within this\nOrganization strong and efficient preventive\nmechanisms, mechanisms to prevent gross and\nsystematic violations of human rights, in order to\nreduce the likelihood of \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d,\nan extreme measure. We believe that the International\nCriminal Court will play an indispensable role in this\nrespect as a deterrent and as a preventive mechanism.\nThe dilemma of \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d is also\ndirectly related to United Nations reform, in regard to\nadapting the existing decision-making mechanism to\nthe timely and effective use of force.\nI believe that the primary purpose of the United\nNations as a guarantor of international peace cannot be\nsustained without also securing democracy on the\nglobal level. To set the developing world on the path to\nprosperity, United Nations activities should encompass\npurposeful financial, economic and political measures\naimed at encouraging the democratic development of\nthe newly independent States, which would secure\ngood governance, the rule of law, the protection of\nhuman rights and predictable administration. Secure\ndemocratic development, not merely security of\ndemocracies, is the main challenge to be addressed in\nthe course of shaping the global world.\nWith regard to our region, in the context of\nsupport to the new and restored democracies, we\nconsider the initiative of Azerbaijan, Georgia,\nMoldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan to establish an open\ngrouping, known as GUUAM, to be of particular\nimportance. Additional impetus to the manifold\ncooperation within the grouping was given by the\nmeeting of the heads of the GUUAM States during the\nMillennium Summit here in New York.\nSometimes in newly established democracies a\nprotracted process towards material welfare calls\ndemocratic values into question. One of the most\nburdensome problems in this respect is debt\naccommodation. I am confident that it is imperative to\nrelease poor and developing countries from this\nconstraint. Writing off the debts will generate a\nstronger impetus, and create the opportunity for these\nStates to firmly remain on the chosen course of\ndemocracy.\nWe also believe that the all-encompassing process\nof globalization urgently calls for a dialogue of\ncivilizations as a means of addressing the challenges of\n14\n\nthe new millennium, as reaffirmed by the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) round table that preceded the\nMillennium Summit. I confirm Georgia's readiness,\nexpressed by President Eduard Shevardnadze, to play\nan active role in facilitating such a dialogue.\nMuch has changed in the 55-year history of the\nOrganization, and today the world community is faced\nwith a new type of challenge requiring novel\napproaches. In the past decade, there have been\nrepeated calls for Security Council expansion. We\nsupport the principle of expanding both permanent and\nnon-permanent membership in the Council by\ndeveloped as well as developing countries to ensure\nadequate regional representation. We believe that the\nseat of a non-permanent member should be allocated\nfor the Group of Eastern European States, the number\nof which has considerably increased. We are firm\nsupporters of permanent membership for Germany and\nJapan and hope this issue will find its resolution before\nlong.\nGeorgia welcomes the increased transparency in\nthe Security Council deliberations. We think that each\nMember State should be permitted to participate in the\ninformal meetings of the Council, when the issues\ndiscussed are of concern to them.\nTime and again United Nations actions have been\nineffective due to protracted decision-making and lack\nof consensus in the Security Council. Therefore, the\nreform of the Security Council should encompass its\ndecision-making procedure, including the veto rights as\nwell.\nFinally, I would reiterate that the challenges of\nthe next millennium are myriad and complex. And it is\ncrystal-clear that only united can we address the\ndifficulties of the future and overcome the dividing\nbarriers in shaping a new, global world order. I wish to\nall of us success in this endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I will deliver this statement\non behalf of Mr. Erkki Tuomioja, the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Finland.\nThe heads of State and Government have just\ncompleted the largest-ever United Nations gathering,\nthe Millennium Summit. They adopted a forward-\nlooking and ambitious Millennium Declaration. This,\ntogether with the Secretary-General's report for the\nSummit, sets a demanding agenda for the United\nNations for the new millennium. A new spirit was\nkindled in the Summit. We need to keep that spirit alive\nin the Assembly, which now has the responsibility to\nstart the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nThe President of Finland made a statement on the\nneed for the United Nations to be relevant for the\nMember States and their people. I should like to\nelaborate on some of her ideas a little further, fully\nsupporting the statement made by the French Foreign\nMinister, Mr. V\u00c8drine, on behalf of the European\nUnion.\nOne of the most inspiring concepts that the\nSecretary-General has advocated is the culture of\nprevention. If we want the United Nations to be\nrelevant, we must equip it with the means to be one\nstep ahead of developments. Successful prevention\nrequires a profound understanding of underlying\ncauses. By understanding these causes, we can\nestablish an early warning system that allows us to act\nin time, before the conflicts erupt.\nOne of the root causes of conflicts is poverty. As\nalmost half of the world's population still have to make\ndo with less than $2 dollars a day, and struggle for\nexistence, conflicts can flare up easily. Poverty is also\nan affront to human dignity. Trying to halve the\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty requires\ncommon efforts. Democracy and respect for human\nrights are important preconditions for all development\nand for poverty eradication to be sustained. Without\ndemocratic decision-making, respect for the rule of\nlaw, human rights and fundamental freedoms, gender\nequality and good governance, it is unrealistic to\nexpect sustainable results in poverty reduction.\nDemand for respect for human rights will\ncontinue to shape the destiny of humankind in the\nfuture. One of the greatest achievements of the United\nNations has been the codification of a core set of\nhuman rights standards. Governments have the\nobligation to implement these standards. The United\nNations is the only global organization primarily\nmandated to ensure respect for human rights. It should\ndevote more attention and resources to the full\nrealization and enjoyment of these rights universally.\nGlobalization is not only an unavoidable process\nbut also something which is on the whole beneficial for\nhuman development. Globalization today is not merely\na continuation of the familiar process of\ninternationalization of trade, market integration and\ngrowing interdependence. In these processes, we\nencounter the phenomenon of quantity changing into\nquality. The development of new technologies greatly\nmultiplies the effects, both positive and negative, of\nglobalization. I believe that the great majority of the\nworld's population have benefited from globalization.\nSome have certainly made vast profits from it. As such,\nthis is not to be deplored; but, at the same time, too\nmany people are losers in the same process. Many\nmore fear the potential threats and losses they perceive\nas negative effects of globalization. Still more are\nanxious as to whether global processes are under\ncontrol any longer. For these reasons, it is of the utmost\nimportance for us to be able to face the challenges of\nglobalization and to counter many of its negative\neffects.\n\nThe United Nations, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nas well as other international actors, must join forces in\nadopting and implementing the common rules needed\nto harness the positive power of globalization. Trade\nliberalization and trade rules under the auspices of the\nWTO should be implemented in such a way that they\nbenefit all, particularly the poorest, as well as\nsafeguard our common environment.\nOne aspect of managing globalization is the need\nto enhance stability, transparency and responsible\nbehaviour in international financial markets. We must\ncounter disturbances caused, for example, by short-\nterm speculative capital movements. Initiatives such as\ncurrency transaction taxes, the so-called Tobin tax,\ndeserve careful consideration. If, as some studies\nindicate, such a tax is unworkable, it is all the more\nimportant to propose and adopt other means and\ninstruments to achieve the same aims.\n19\n\nOne of the most recent challenges is the digital\ndivide created by the revolution in information and\ncommunication technology. Computerization and\nInternet literacy are not an end as such. They should\nserve the purposes of development: education, literacy,\nhealth care, empowerment and inclusion. By closing\nthe digital gap, we help developing countries join the\nknowledge-based global economy. In the long run, the\ndigital revolution has the greatest potential for the\ndeveloping countries. Information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) will make technological leap-\nfrogging possible for developing countries.\nThe global agenda set in the United Nations\nconferences and summits in the 1990s addressed many\nsuch basic needs of human life which need common\nattention in the process of globalization. Progress was\nmade on human rights, gender equality, population,\nsocial development, sustainable development, drugs,\nenvironmental issues and many others. In the new\nmillennium, we must focus on the accelerated\nimplementation of the plans of action adopted at these\nconferences. Still, our agenda keeps growing. Children,\nHIV/AIDS, racism and racial discrimination, financing\nfor development, least developed countries as well as\nsustainable development and the environment require\nmore profound attention from the world community.\nEven with these issues, I am afraid that our agenda is\nnot exhausted. The growing agenda poses valid\ndemands of coherence on the United Nations system\nand its work, as well as on the Member States.\nNo matter how well we implement the global\nagenda and no matter how much we resort to\npreventive actions, we have to have improved means to\nsolve crises and conflicts as peacefully and rapidly as\npossible. Finland welcomes the Secretary-General's\ninitiative to take a critical look at the United Nations\npeace operations by a Panel of eminent persons. The\nBrahimi report suggests a comprehensive reform of\npeace operations. We need a detailed discussion on the\nreport without delay. There are lessons to be learned\nfor the United Nations and its Member States. We\nshould particularly learn from the failures so as not to\nrepeat them, but we also must learn from successes and\nsee what works.\nWe need to address the whole continuum of peace\noperations from the standpoint of prevention. It is most\nimportant to try to prevent crises from erupting.\nPrevention is an important element during a crisis as\nwe try to stop its escalation. Prevention continues after\ncrises in post-conflict peace-building, as we need to\nminimize their consequences and their duration, not to\nspeak of their repetition. Kosovo is a prime example of\nthis.\nI am stating the obvious when I say that the\nUnited Nations needs a rapid-reaction capability,\nqualified and experienced personnel to perform the\noperations, as well as the money to pay for them. This\nwould make it easier to address an increased demand\nfor United Nations peacekeeping.\nThe critical approach taken in the Brahimi report\nshould also be extended to other fields and activities of\nthe United Nations in order to attain efficiency within\nthe Organization. Reorganization and prioritization\nwould free both human and financial resources for the\ncore areas of our responsibilities.\nThere have been positive developments in some\ncrises that have long been on the United Nations\nagenda. A most encouraging example is the\nrapprochement in the Korean peninsula. Finland\nwelcomes the positive development to bring peace,\nstability and reunification to the Korean peninsula and\nencourages the two parties to advance the process of\ndialogue. Finland also welcomes the withdrawal of\nIsraeli troops from southern Lebanon in accordance\nwith Security Council resolution 425 (1978). We hope\nthis leads to a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\nthe Middle East.\nThe nation-building process in East Timor has\nstarted successfully. I hope that the present transition\nperiod will soon lead to full independence for East\nTimor. Recent incidents in West Timor against United\nNations personnel, however, jeopardize the progress\nand the capabilities of the United Nations system to\nhelp. We also strongly support the Secretary-General's\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the\nCyprus problem.\nDevelopments in Africa have not been\nencouraging. I regret deeply that the safety and security\nof United Nations personnel have not been guaranteed\nin all United Nations operations, such as that in Sierra\nLeone. However, Eritrea and Ethiopia have reached an\nagreement and international monitoring can start. I am\nhappy to announce that Finland will participate in the\nUnited Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nThe continuum of multidimensional crises must\nbe prevented, managed and solved with appropriate\n20\n\nmultidimensional means. Addressing them requires\ncooperation among different organizations, such as the\nUnited Nations, the European Union, the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and the Organization of American\nStates, to mention but a few. The complexity of crises\nhas shown that no single organization is capable of\ndealing with all aspects of a crisis  military, civilian\nand humanitarian. Sad experiences, for example from\nthe Balkans, remind us that many weaknesses still exist\nin the conflict-prevention and management capabilities\nof the international community. A clearer division of\nlabour between the organizations is needed. They must\nconcentrate on what they can do best, following the\nprinciple of comparative advantage. Complementarity\nand cooperation are the friends, and rivalry the enemy,\nof any operation.\nCoherent action is needed to address the\nsituations, bearing in mind the comprehensive concept\nof security. I stress the need to enhance our civilian\ncrisis-management capabilities in all relevant fields.\nComplex crises need expertise in the fields of civilian\npolice, the rule of law, human rights, justice, electoral\nassistance, institution-building, economic reconstruction\nand rehabilitation, as well as impartial media. As stated\nin the Brahimi report, doctrinal shifts and more\nthorough strategic planning are needed at the United\nNations to address complex and often intrastate\nconflicts.\nPeace and security are indivisible. Disarmament\nis a part of comprehensive and integrated action in\npreventing conflicts and in promoting a global dialogue\non peace and stability. Arms control agreements,\nincluding the Treaty between the United States of\nAmerica and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\non the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems,\nremain a cornerstone of international security. The\nsuccessful outcome of the Review Conference of the\nStates Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) created a new momentum in\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must be\nratified by all. We hope for a swift entry into force of\nthe START II Treaty and we are looking forward to the\ncommencement of the START III negotiations.\nOne of the main concerns is the regional arms\nrace. We need to ensure that the few countries\nremaining outside the NPT regime do not develop\nweapons of mass destruction. Also, conventional arms,\nand in particular anti-personnel landmines, small arms\nand light weapons, remain a concern in regional and\ninternal conflicts. The United Nations Conference on\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nAll Its Aspects should aim at achieving significant\nresults in adopting a comprehensive approach\nintegrating security and development.\nEnhanced international action is also needed in\nhumanitarian demining, particularly in post-conflict\nsituations where civilian populations continue to be\nvictims of anti-personnel landmines.\nI wish to join the Secretary-General's call on all\nStates to sign and ratify the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) at the earliest\npossible date. It is important now to build on what has\nbeen achieved in and after the Rome Conference and to\nsecure the early establishment of the ICC, fully\nrespecting the integrity of its Statute. More and more\nStates, including my own, are approaching the stage of\nratification of the Rome Statute. We are confident that,\nin the long run, all States will recognize the benefits of\na permanent International Criminal Court.\nTerrorism is an evil we must combat decisively\nand effectively so that everyone can live and travel\nfreely in the world without having to fear crime and\nkidnappings. We have negotiated 12 major anti-\nterrorism conventions within the United Nations\nframework that make it clear that terrorist acts are\ncriminal and can never be justified by any ends. This\nobviously also applies to the means used to combat\nterrorism.\nFinland welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to offer an opportunity to sign any treaty or\nconvention of which the Secretary-General is the\ndepositary. In this connection, I should also like to\nmake reference to the Tampere Convention on the\nProvision of Telecommunication Resources for\nDisaster Mitigation and Relief Operations. As the host\ncountry of the relevant conference, Finland would like\nto encourage all States to sign and ratify the\nConvention in order to bring it into force as soon as\npossible.\nThe purposes enshrined in the Charter and the\nnew challenges the United Nations is facing require\nunwavering support for the United Nations and for\nmultilateralism from its Member States. The United\nNations is an expression of the will of its Member\n21\n\nStates to deliberate and act multilaterally. There are\nmany reasons why multilateralism is the preferred, as\nwell as perhaps the only sustainable, way to deal with\nproblems. It involves all the actors that are needed for\nthe long-term solution of conflicts. It provides the\ntransparency that modern conflict resolution requires.\nIt strengthens respect for international law in general.\nLast but not least, it diminishes the possibility that\nforce will be used unnecessarily or disproportionately.\nA tendency towards unilateralism would only\nreopen old divisions or create new ones. The United\nNations is a stronghold of multilateralism, and it\nshould be used to safeguard the primacy of multilateral\naction. In this respect, we must ensure that the United\nNations is able to act effectively when the need arises.\nThe role and ability of the Secretary-General must be\nenhanced to enable the Organization to act when it is\notherwise threatened with paralysis.\nIn this context, I want to make it clear that the\ncrisis management capacity under construction in the\nEuropean Union will be at the service of the\ninternational community. It is not intended for\nunilateral interventionism. The Union will contribute to\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the\nprinciples and objectives of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe Charter on\nEuropean Security.\nFor this kind of a multilateralism to work, United\nNations finances must be put on a sound, sustainable\nand equitable basis. This is crucial for its strength and\ncredibility. Charter obligations related to the payment\nof contributions must be fulfilled by all, on time, in full\nand without conditions.\nCooperation between the United Nations,\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations has\nbeen very successful, and it must be intensified and\nfacilitated. It has to be extended to cover the whole of\ncivil society. Present challenges are too heavy for the\nUnited Nations to carry alone. I commend the\nSecretary-General for his several initiatives in this\nrespect. In particular, I would mention his Global\nCompact initiative, which seeks to engage corporations\nin the promotion of equitable labour standards, respect\nfor human rights and the protection of the environment.\nCooperation with civil society is a necessity for the\nnew millennium. Strong partnerships are needed to\nmeet the challenges posed every day in the present\nworld. This trend should be strengthened and\nencouraged."

        "file_text": "It\ngives me pleasure at the outset of the fifty-fifth session\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations to\nconvey to His Excellency our sincerest congratulation\nfor his election to the presidency of this session. His\nelection to this important position reflects the respect\nof the international community for him personally, as\nwell as the appreciation of the Member States for the\npositive role played by his country, Finland, in the\ninternational arena. I am confident that his presidency\nof this session will contribute effectively to our efforts\nto achieve the objectives towards which the\ninternational community aspires under the present,\ndelicate international circumstances.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to express our\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nForeign Minister of Namibia and president of the\nprevious session of the United Nations General\nAssembly, who managed the affairs of the session with\ngreat competence and experience and who deserves our\ncompliments and appreciation.\nI am also pleased to express my thanks and\nappreciation to His Excellency, the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ncontinuous and tireless efforts to achieve peace and\nenhance security and stability in our contemporary\nworld, as well as for the competence and ability he has\ndemonstrated in leading the affairs of this\nOrganization, relying on his rich and exceptional\nexperience in the international arena. In particular, I\nwish to commend His Excellency for his sincere and\nextensive efforts in organizing the Millennium Summit,\nwhich, God willing, will contribute to achieving\nfruitful results with positive effect on our peoples and\nnations while ushering in a new century full of\nchallenges and opportunities.\nOn this occasion, I wish to welcome the Republic\nof Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations,\nhoping that its membership will enhance the\neffectiveness of the Organization and its noble\nobjectives.\nThe present session of the General Assembly has\nfollowed immediately the Millennium Summit, a\nunique historical event. World leaders met in a\ndignified gathering that exemplified the unity of the\nhuman race and their collective endeavour to live in\npeace, security and prosperity. That Summit\nrepresented a valuable opportunity to reflect on and to\ndiscuss whatever might lead to a better life for\nhumanity. The world leaders pledged in the final\nDeclaration of the Summit to exert all possible efforts\nto achieve peace, security and disarmament and\neradicate poverty and disease. They affirmed the\nsovereign equality of nations, respect for their\nterritorial integrity and political independence, and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. The\nSummit also provided a valuable opportunity to\n12\n\nevaluate the course of this Organization throughout its\nhistory, which has been full of opportunities and\nchallenges, so as to enable it to achieve its declared\nprinciples and purposes.\nIn this regard, a thorough and candid evaluation\nof the role of the United Nations was presented by His\nRoyal Highness Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz, the\nCrown Prince and the head of the Saudi delegation to\nthe Millennium Summit. He discussed the challenges\nand problems that have impeded the United Nations\nfrom achieving the goals and objectives to which the\nhuman community aspires.\nHis Royal Highness presented a number of ideas\nand notions that represent a valuable contribution to\nefforts aimed at promoting and vitalizing the role of the\nUnited Nations. He mentioned the importance of\nlinkage between modernizing the Organization's\nmechanisms and the nature of the issues it confronts.\nThe effects of these reforms should consider the\nviability and performance of United Nations bodies in\na way that enables the United Nations it to fulfil its\nrequired role in dealing effectively with the new\ndevelopments in modern international relations.\nOne of the most apparent features of the new\nworld order is the emerging phenomenon of\nglobalization, which, as a developed framework for\ninternational relations, has occupied a large portion of\nthe current political thought of nations. We view\nglobalization as a phenomenon that should reflect the\nnatural closeness between nations aimed at achieving\nsocial justice, overall development, equality among\nnations, and broadening the scope of cooperation in a\nmanner that serves the issues of peace and security and\nstability throughout the world. However, and I read\nhere from a statement by His Royal Highness Prince\nAbdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz at the Millennium Summit:\n\u201cWe hope that the United Nations will\nsupport us in standing against a globalization that\nresults in the hegemony of the strong over the\nweak, increases the causes of the oppression and\nexploitation of nations, and fosters injustice and\ninequality in international relations. We\nparticularly warn of the ramifications of\nunbridled globalization and its use as an umbrella\nto violate the sovereignty of States and interfere\nwith their internal affairs under a variety of\npretexts especially from the angle of human\nrights issues.\u201d\nThe United Nations call for a civilized dialogue\nand declaring 2001 a year for Dialogue among\nCivilizations comes at an appropriate time as a\ncivilized response to those who propagate the themes\nand doctrines of conflict and inevitable clash of\ncivilizations. A dialogue among civilizations\nrepresents, in fact, a constructive beginning towards\nachieving globalization in its positive sense and its\nhuman aspect, something to which all peoples and\nnations aspire. A dialogue among civilizations would\ncontribute to strengthening the values and principles of\nunderstanding and cooperation among cultures and\ncivilizations. It will further promote respect for other\nreligious beliefs and the cultural legacies of other\nnations in a way that consolidates the principles of\npeaceful coexistence and proliferates the culture of\npeace and tolerance.\nDeviation from the values and principles of\njustice, equality and non-compliance with the rules of\ninternational legitimacy in resolving differences and\ndisputes through peaceful means has led to the\nproliferation of wars and armed conflicts in many parts\nof the world. This has caused painful humanitarian\nsuffering that continues to arouse the conscience of the\nworld community. In our region, Israel continues to\ntake intransigent positions and to reject the\nrequirements for peace. This became evident during the\nrecent talks at Camp David where the Israeli side\ninsisted on maintaining positions that are diametrically\nopposed to the principles of peace that were agreed to\nin Madrid and to what was stated in United Nations\nresolutions with respect to the status of Al-Quds Al-\nSharif. Both the final communiqu\u00e9 of the Al-Quds\nCommittee, which convened recently in Agadir,\nMorocco, and the resolution of the Council of the Arab\nLeague, adopted at its 114th session, reaffirmed the\nunshakeable Arab and Islamic positions with respect to\nthe issue of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. It also reaffirmed the\nimpossibility of attaining a durable and comprehensive\npeace without reaching a just solution to this problem\nin a way that preserves Arab and Muslim rights, in\naccordance with United Nations resolutions, and that\nrespects complete Palestinian sovereignty over Al-\nQuds Al-Sharif.\nIsrael is making a big mistake if it believes that\nthe peace process can proceed without total respect for\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinians to return to\ntheir homeland and establish their own independent\nState with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Al-Quds\n13\n\nAl-Sharif is an integral part of the occupied territories\nand is subject to Security Council resolution 242\n(1967). Moreover, a comprehensive peace cannot be\nachieved without Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\nSyrian Golan to the 4 June 1967 line.\nWe continue to feel for the suffering of the\nfraternal Iraqi people as a result of the continuing\nrefusal of their Government to abide fully by United\nNations resolutions, which would allow for the lifting\nof the sanctions. In reiterating its concern over the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, the Government of the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia proposed an initiative that\nwould allow Iraq to import all the materials and goods\nit needed \u2014 except those that fall within the context of\nmilitary items that threaten Iraq's neighbours. If such\nan initiative had been accepted, the needs of the Iraqi\npeople would have been met and their suffering\nalleviated. However, the Iraqi Government was swift in\nrejecting this gesture, and thus it has prolonged the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We once again express the\nhope that the Iraqi Government will act quickly to\ncomply with Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)\nand the mandate of the United Nations Monitoring,\nVerification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC)\nand of other international committees concerned with\nthe release and repatriation of all Kuwaiti and Saudi\nprisoners, as well as with the return of Kuwaiti\nproperty. We once again reiterate the need to respect\nIraq's independence, unity and territorial integrity.\nWe also strongly desire the removal of the causes\nof tension in the Gulf region. Accordingly, we hope\nthat the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran\nwill cooperate with the efforts of the tripartite\ncommittee, which has been entrusted with creating a\nconducive climate for direct negotiations between the\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\nin order to reach an amicable and acceptable solution\nto the issue of the three islands.\nAs regards Somalia, my country welcomed the\noutcome of the national reconciliation conference,\nwhich took place in the town of Arta in Djibouti and\nwhich included the election of President Abdikassin\nSalad Hassan. We hope that the other Somali factions\nwill join the reconciliation efforts aimed at promoting\nnational accord and at achieving unity and stability in\nSomalia.\nIn Afghanistan fierce fighting continues and is\ndenying Afghanistan and its people the fruits of\nliberation from foreign occupation.\nThe Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu and\nKashmir remains a source of tension between the two\nneighbouring countries. We call on both sides to\nexercise the utmost restraint and to solve the conflict\nthrough negotiations, in accordance with United\nNations resolutions, which give the people of Jammu\nand Kashmir the right to self-determination.\nThe continuation of these disputes and armed\nconflicts \u2014 which have claimed the lives of millions,\ndepleted huge quantities of resources and caused\ndestruction and serious damage to the environment \u2014\nmakes it incumbent upon the international community\nto make every possible effort to put an end to these\nconflicts and to find peaceful solutions to them. In this\nregard, we look to the United Nations to make greater\nefforts to reaffirm its role as a peacemaker and not just\na peacekeeper. It has become evident that working to\nprevent conflicts from erupting is more effective and\nless costly than concentrating on peacekeeping.\nIn this respect and in compliance with the\nprinciple of resolving conflicts through peaceful\nmeans, our region witnessed two important events that\nmarked a positive sign in relations between nations. In\nJune 2000, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the\nRepublic of Yemen signed the Jeddah agreement\nestablishing final and permanent, international land and\nsea borders. This ended more than 60 years of border\ndisputes. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also\nconcluded an agreement with the State of Kuwait for\nthe demarcation of the shallow seas adjacent to the\nformer neutral zone between the two countries.\nThe issue of disarmament is of great concern to\nmy country, and we call for greater efforts in this area,\nespecially as regards weapons of mass destruction. The\npresence of these weapons represents a great danger to\ninternational peace and security. We hope that the\nnuclear States will fulfil the pledges they made at the\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and adhere\nto the commitment to eradicate their nuclear arsenals.\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is\nvery concerned about Israel's refusal to accede to the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and about its decision to keep\nits nuclear programme outside the scope of\ninternational controls. Israel's refusal to adhere to the\n14\n\ninternational will and to become part of this Treaty has\naborted all efforts exerted by the peoples and countries\nof the Middle East to live in a region free from all\nweapons of mass destruction. Israel is the only country\nin the region that has yet to accede to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, a fact that has disrupted the\nbalance of security and threatened peace in the region.\nIt is this imperative to stress the need to increase\nthe effectiveness of the Non-Proliferation Treaty by\nmaking it universal and mandatory.\nCooperation on social and political issues has\nbecome a necessity that cannot be avoided or\nneglected. The economic and social problems of the\ndeveloping countries make it incumbent upon us all to\npromote policies that can alleviate the effects of these\nproblems, which in most cases exacerbate tension\nwithin and among nations. We believe that the\ndeveloped countries have an obligation to assist in\ncombating poverty, food scarcities, drought and\nfamine.\nIt is unrealistic to apply the concept of\nglobalization only as a means to liberalize the\nmarkets \u2014 removing restrictions \u2014 without also\ndrafting a framework for action that stresses the need\nto consider the economic situation in many of the\ndeveloping countries and to assist them in moving to a\nstage where they can participate in development. It is\ntherefore important for the industrialized and\ntechnically advanced countries to help those\ndeveloping nations without subjecting them to selective\npolicies in technology transfer. Moreover, globalization\nshould be a two-way street that requires the developed,\nindustrialized nations to liberalize their markets and\nopen them up to products from developing nations.\nWe are truly objective when dealing with\nenvironmental issues. We support conducting serious\nand informed studies based on evidence, studies that\ntake into consideration the process of development in\nthe developing countries. In this regard, we call upon\nall States to abide by Agenda 21 and urge the\nindustrialized States to honour their international\ncommitments regarding the transfer of environmentally\nfriendly technology to the developing countries.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasise that we\nare facing enormous challenges in the new era, which\nmakes it incumbent upon all of us to strive to achieve\nthe maximum possible level of cooperation and\nsolidarity. This is not confined to political and military\nchallenges, but also includes new waves of challenges\nthat result from the contemporary way of life with all\nits problems and complications and cannot be solved or\nmanaged except through organized collective efforts.\nOur firm belief in the important role of the United\nNations in dealing with current issues and in\nfacilitating appropriate international cooperation to\naddress and contain these problems, makes us more\ndetermined than ever to support this Organization and\nhelp consolidate its constructive role.\nIt is my wish that we enter the new millennium\nwith stronger determination and commitment to our\ncollective goal to establish a secure world where values\ntriumph and justice, equality and peace prevail.\nAllah says in the Holy Koran:\n\u201cHelp ye one another in righteousness and piety\nbut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.\u201d\n(The Holy Koran, V:2)\nMay peace and the blessing of Allah be upon you,\nSir."

        "file_text": "The current political\ndebate is taking place against the background that is\nnot quite usual. This Hall just heard statements by the\nparticipants in the Millennium Summit. Unprecedented\nround tables have just been conducted. The last several\ndays have brought unusual hectic activity to the United\nNations and the city that hosts the headquarters of our\nOrganization.\nThe most spectacular thing, however, is that the\nSummit has triggered an intellectual burst, an\nexplosion of collective thinking. Apparently, this has\nbeen predetermined by a special quality of this\nparticular moment in time, as we find ourselves at the\nthreshold not just of a new century, but of a new\nmillennium. Our acquisitive mind tries to look forward\nas far as possible and aspires to see there, against all\nodds, a better future. Such is the predominant human\ntrait  to look forward with optimism.\nOur past experience, however, warns us against\nexcessive euphoria and illusions. We realize that the\nworld is still full of threats, and our common impulse is\nto understand these threats and their causes and to find\nways to overcome them collectively.\nThis is what I felt during the days I spent at the\nSummit. I am probably not the only one who thinks the\nsame way. But let us hope that the intellectual tide\ngenerated by the Summit will not just die down in the\nhumdrum of everyday life, but will force us to get\ndown to business in order to make our planet a safe and\nprosperous place.\nAs we approach the new millennium, we surely\nwant to take a fresh look at the road we have travelled\nso far. At the threshold of a new century, we are in a\nposition to say that our most important achievement is\nthat the world has become freer. I believe that the key\nword explaining the substance of the changes that are\ntaking place today should be the word renewal. By our\ndefinition, it means an absolutely new era of relations\nbetween nations, free of the vestiges of the past:\npressure and diktat. It should be a triumph of the\nprinciple of genuine democracy and justice when all\nStates have equal rights and obligations, irrespective of\ntheir economic and political differences.\nThe renewal of international relations should be\nguided by the understanding that we live now in a\nglobal and interdependent world whose overriding\nprinciple is global partnership. The United Nations\nSecretary-General has rightly proclaimed a three-\npronged task: freedom from fear, freedom from want\nand saving the human environment, precisely in the\ncontext of globalization. It is also true that\nglobalization should not overshadow the problems and\nconcerns of the ordinary man. Our efforts will be futile\nif we do not address the issues we face today in this\nlogical sequence.\nLet me dwell on the three main components of\nour common goal: making the world a safe, free and\nprosperous place.\nWhile recognizing that global security and\nstability increasingly depend on economic,\nenvironmental and humanitarian aspects of\ndevelopment, we should not belittle the importance of\nthe military and political dimension of security. A\nfundamental issue of the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction continues to be a matter of our\ncommon concern. International instruments in this\nfield, first of all the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention\nhave not yet gained universal support and, thus, cannot\nbe fully effective. The situation with regard to the Anti-\n12\n\nBallistic Missile Treaty is also a cause for concern. We\ncall on all countries to radically change this state of\naffairs and to support the Secretary-General's proposal\nto hold an international conference to find ways to\navert the nuclear threat.\nKazakhstan, having been the epicentre of cold-\nwar nuclear confrontation and having resolutely\nresisted the temptation to turn into a nuclear power\nafter it gained independence, has every right to raise\nthis issue with vigour.\nAs for Kazakhstan, it continues to contribute to\nefforts to ensure global security. Fully respecting its\nobligations under the above-mentioned international\ninstruments, Kazakhstan has been consistently\npromoting its initiatives with regard to the Conference\non Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in\nAsia (CICA) and the establishment of a nuclear-free\nzone in Central Asia. We are convinced that the CICA\ninitiative has a rational kernel, and we call on the\nUnited Nations and the Asian States to continue their\nsupport of the CICA process in the interests of Asian\nand global security.\nWe should be no less and, probably, more\nconcerned by new threats: international terrorism,\nextremism, illegal trafficking in arms and drugs, and\norganized crime. Our newly independent State has\ncome into direct contact with these threats. We are\nseriously alarmed by the situation in Central Asia and\nview the conflict in Afghanistan, the bandit groups'\ninfiltrations in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and the\nsituation in Chechnya in Russia as links in one and the\nsame chain. Members have heard our neighbours -\nUzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - talking here\nabout the same thing.\nI want to emphasize again that the way we see it,\nthe root of the evil is the prolonged war in Afghanistan,\nand we urge the Security Council to seriously address\nthe problem in that country on a long-term basis.\nWithout addressing it, it would be na\u00d4ve to hope for the\nelimination of the threat to stability in our region and,\nthus, in the whole world. At the same time, we believe\nthat the key to the solution of the Afghan problem is in\nthe economic revival of Afghanistan. Our common\nexperience points to the futility of palliative measures\nand attempts to bring the conflicting sides to the\nnegotiation table without a clear economic plan. There\nshould be a comprehensive plan for the economic\nrehabilitation of Afghanistan which, together with\neconomic measures, should incorporate the fight\nagainst the production of drugs, illegal arms trade,\nterrorism and extremism, and should take into account\nthe specificity of the ethnic and religious situation in\nAfghanistan. Of course, adequate financial resources\nshould bolster this comprehensive approach. The price\nof peace and human life is worth it.\nI would like now to look at the threat to the\nstability in our region through the prism of the Caspian\nSea. The Caspian treasure-trove has turned now into\nthe centre of attention. The interests of many States,\nnot just of our region, converge there. The recent\ndiscovery in Kazakhstan's part of the Caspian Sea of\nthe Kashagan oilfield, which is the largest one in the\nlast 30 years, with forecasted reserves of 7 billion\ntonnes of high-quality oil, confirms once again that the\npotential of the Caspian Sea is enormous. It is our\ngenuine desire and intention to see that this gift of God\nserves the interests of peace and prosperity.\nGlobalization involves a new level of interaction\nand interdependence of States. However, along with the\nobvious benefits, globalization entails the danger of a\nlopsided distribution of these benefits, both at the inter-\nState and intra-State levels.\nA widening gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries is a burning issue. In fact, this\ngap is getting bigger, and debates are underway as to\nthe forms of involvement of both groups of countries in\nthe processes of globalization, particularly from the\npoint of view of the solution of the problems facing the\ndeveloping countries.\nThe situation with regard to the future of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides a good\nexample of the differences in appraising the\nglobalization phenomenon. This organization, uniting\nsome 140 States, has become a trade and economic\ncounterpart of the United Nations. It should be said,\nhowever, that the WTO has to be thoroughly reformed\nin order to really liberalize and democratize trade\nrelations. It should not be a controlling and selectively\ndiscriminating body of world trade policy.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions also have to be\nreformed. We believe that the most important goals in\nreforming them are to ensure their openness and\ndemocratization, competence and adequacy and to\nimprove cooperation with the United Nations. We share\nthe criticism of the International Monetary Fund\nregarding its arm-twisting policy when loans are\n13\n\nconditioned on many political factors that have nothing\nto do with the actual economic situation.\nIn the context of the role of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions in the world, I would like to mention the\nissue of the integration into the world economy of the\neconomies in transition. The role and importance of\nthis group of countries, which includes my own, in the\nworld economy and politics will grow. I stress that it is\nimportant for Kazakhstan to continue constructive\ncooperation with the agencies of the United Nations\nfamily, as well as with the Bretton Woods institutions\nand other international organizations, in promoting\neconomic reforms in my country.\nKazakhstan continues to give priority attention to\nthe development of the transit transport system in the\nStates of Central Asia and in neighbouring developing\ncountries. We think it is important to actively pursue\nthe improvement of existing programmes and the\ndevelopment of new ones designed to raise the\nefficiency of the present transit system in Central Asia.\nOur landlocked country, and the region as a whole,\nshould have secure multiple access to the world\nmarket. This is a matter of strengthening our\nsovereignty and independence.\nEnvironmental issues  particularly the\nmanagement of transboundary water resources,\nenvironmental pollution and the greenhouse effect \nlong ago moved from the social and economic plane to\nthe political one, and have acquired truly global\nsignificance. All countries face the problems of\nprotecting the environment. Yet the effect on the\nenvironment experienced by developing countries and\neconomies in transition is immeasurably much greater.\nEconomic growth has increased the pressure on all the\nnatural resources of our planet. The problem of lack of\nnatural resources and their depletion creates serious\neconomic problems and poverty. Economic\ndevelopment cannot stop. However, it should follow a\ndifferent path. It should cease to destroy the\nenvironment so aggressively. It is because of the\nunderestimation of environmental factors that\nKazakhstan today faces such ecological disasters as\nthose involving the Aral and Caspian Seas and the\nformer Semipalatinsk testing ground.\nThere have been many cases in history of nations\nand States being in conflict over the lack of drinking\nwater and water for irrigation. Thousands and\nthousands of people have often had to pull up their\nroots because of problems with water. Reducing the\nnumber of people without access to safe water is as\nvital today as ever. Kazakhstan calls for every country\nto adopt, under bilateral and multilateral treaties,\nlegislative and administrative measures with regard to\ntransboundary water resources and their management.\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for\nEurope and the United Nations Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific have devised a\njoint Special Programme for the Economies of Central\nAsia (SPECA), which encompasses all priority issues\nfacing the region: development of the transit transport\ncapacity and multiple pipeline systems; the\nmanagement of energy and water resources;\nenvironmental protection; and technological growth.\nSuch a comprehensive approach promotes better\nregional cooperation in Central Asia and the\nintegration of its considerable potential into the world\neconomy. It serves common interests. We therefore\nurge the international donor community to actively\ncontribute to the SPECA programmes and to promote\nthe economic and democratic growth of Kazakhstan\nand other newly independent States in Central Asia.\nThe three-pronged goal of global development,\nwhich I mentioned at the beginning of my statement,\nwould be unattainable without an effective common\ntool. Such a took we see in the United Nations, and we\nare convinced that there is no alternative to our\nOrganization. But the next century and the new, highly\ncomplex tasks we face will demand a radically renewed\nOrganization free from the stereotypes of the past. This\nmatter is in our hands. We should support the genuine\ndesire of the Secretary-General to drastically revamp\nour Organization.\nWe believe that it is important to start from the\nhead  that is, the Security Council. The debates on\nthat subject have gone on far too long. Shall we\ncontinue to mark time, or shall we take a responsible\ncollective decision? We stand for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council, in both categories of membership, on\nthe basis of equitable geographic representation and\nrespect for the sovereign equality of all United Nations\nMember States. Kazakhstan supports the inclusion of\nGermany and Japan, as well as major developing\ncountries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, as\npermanent members of the Security Council, and also\nsupports an increase in the number of non-permanent\nmembers.\n14\n\nWe believe that the peacemaking capacity of the\nUnited Nations should also be strengthened\nconsiderably, and we support the conclusions of the\nreport (A/55/305) by the Brahimi Panel. As for\nKazakhstan, it is forming peacekeeping forces through\nits participation in the Central Asian battalion,\ncomposed of three States of Central Asia, and through\nthe creation of its own Kazakhstan battalion.\nThere is no doubt that the financial capacity of\nthe United Nations should be commensurate with the\nnew tasks that the Organization is asked to perform.\nAll Member States should meet their financial\nobligations under the United Nations Charter. In spite\nof its temporary economic difficulties, Kazakhstan is\nstriving to do just that and is taking practical steps in\nthat direction. As to the scale of assessments and its\nmethodology, we have always believed, and continue to\nbelieve, that the main criterion should be a country's\nreal capacity to pay.\nWe have set ambitious tasks for ourselves. Are\nwe up to them? I am absolutely sure that we are, if we\njoin our efforts. In fact, there is no other way. Such is\nthe imperative of a new era, such are the aspirations of\nour nations.\nI thank the Assembly for its attention and wish it\nsuccess in its endeavour to build a safer and better\nworld in the next century."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my delegation's\nsatisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at this fifty-fifth session. You may\ncount on my delegation's support.\nI should also like to pay an unqualified tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the\nquality of the work accomplished during his term of\noffice, and to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\na great African of whom we are all proud, for his\ncommitment to strengthening the universal role and the\ncredibility of our Organization.\nThe United Nations family is growing day by day,\nfor which we all rejoice. That is why my delegation\nwelcomes the Republic of Tuvalu.\nBefore addressing the situation prevailing in my\ncountry, I wish to share some of our concerns about the\ninternational situation.\nThe challenges of the third millennium are not\nnew. They have been broadly outlined by the\nSecretary-General in his report, entitled \u201cWe the\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century\u201d. For the delegation of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire,\ngiven the difficulties facing the international\ncommunity, the issue is above all the need to draw up\nnew solutions in adhering to carefully established\npriorities.\nAs the Secretary-General stresses in his\nmillennium report,\n\u201cthe 1 billion people living in developed\ncountries earn 60 per cent of the world's income,\nwhile the 3.5 billion people in low-income\ncountries earn less than 20 per cent\u201d. (A/54/2000,\npara. 69)\nFurthermore, the technological progress that has been\nachieved in computer science and communications,\nwhich we welcome, has unfortunately also created a\ndigital gap that has further marginalized the poor\ncountries.\nIf, for the time being, we acknowledge the\nadvantages of globalization, it does seem to us that it is\nnot taking sufficient account of the concerns of\ndeveloping countries, particularly those in Africa. In\nfact, the rate of Africa's participation in international\n27\n\ntrade is still below two per cent. In sub-Saharan Africa,\nparticularly, the degree of poverty is almost the same as\nit was 20 years ago. This is why we would earnestly\nappeal for Africa's integration and involvement in\nthose efforts to build a new architecture of the world\neconomy. Poverty and deprivation, which are the daily\nlot of peoples in the developing countries, are further\nexacerbated by the debt burden on their economies.\nIn the particular case of my country, I would like\nto emphasize that, even under the current difficult\ncircumstances, my Government continues to allocate\n52 per cent of its budgetary earnings to paying off its\nexternal debt, and, quite naturally, this is to the\ndetriment of the priority programmes relating to health,\neducation and food self-sufficiency. Adding to this, we\nmust not overlook inflation and speculation, which lead\nto fluctuations in our commodity prices.\nIn addition to our main preoccupation, which is\ncombating poverty, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire believes that to\nresolve conflicts, preventive diplomacy must be\nstrengthened and seen as a complementary dimension\nto peacekeeping operations in the field. The conflicts\nthat beset the world have meant that peacekeeping\noperations, which have become more and more\ncomplex, are now in the forefront of United Nations\nactivities. Preparing for, organizing, setting up in the\nfield and financing these operations requires\nconsiderable effort and considerable means. Those\nconducted in recent years throughout the world,\nparticularly in Africa, have unfortunately not had the\nresults we had hoped for. The experience of the \u201cBlue\nHelmets\u201d in Sierra Leone is illustrative of this.\nWe hope that the excellent report of Ambassador\nBrahimi, who has put forward new guidelines for\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in the twenty-\nfirst century, will be given the attention by States\nMembers that they deserve, so that acting on these\nrecommendations will endow our Organization with the\nmeans it needs to play the role which it should in\npreserving international peace and security.\nWe very much welcome the conclusions of\nBeijing Plus Five and the commitments which have\nbeen entered into in order to bring about the\nadvancement of women. We are convinced that these\ncommitments will make it possible for women to fully\nexercise all their rights and to finally achieve full and\ncomplete equality. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which was actively\ninvolved in the work of this important meeting,\ncommits itself, for its part, to working for the\nimplementation of the targets set.\nMay I, at this juncture in my statement, refer to\nthe question of the much-needed structural reform of\nthe United Nations, particularly that of the Security\nCouncil. In these new circumstances, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nwould like to reaffirm the position held by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which is\nclaiming two permanent seats and two new non-\npermanent seats in the Council.\nTo return to matters in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and the\nsituation prevailing there, I would like to recall that on\n24 December 1999, my country underwent its first\nexperience of an institutional change taking place apart\nfrom the balloting boxes. In fact, on the day before\nthat, a military mutiny, on the part of soldiers who were\nclaiming better living conditions, resulted in the\ntoppling of the existing constitutional order. This\nunexpected speeding up of events in my country\naroused, and continues to arouse, major concern within\nthe international community, a concern and an anxiety\nwhich points to the interest that the international\ncommunity attaches to my country. Up until now, C\u00f4te\nd'Ivoire, considered as a haven of peace and an oasis\nof stability, and recognized as a driving force in the\neconomy of the subregion, particularly of those\ncountries that constitute the West African Economic\nand Monetary Union, has been playing an important\nand irreplaceable part as a regulatory force in West\nAfrica. The millions of our brothers who have come\nfrom countries in the subregion, and who live in my\ncountry, are substantially responsible for generating the\nmoney circulating in their countries of origin. If this\ncountry, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, were to implode, it would have\nunforeseen consequences for the process of solidarity\nand sharing.\nOn 23 July, the Ivorian people expressed\nthemselves through a referendum on the new draft\nconstitution and electoral code placed before it by the\ntransitional Government. It should be recalled that the\nmilitary arm was involved neither in the drafting of the\nnew constitution nor in that of the new electoral code.\nThe political parties, social and professional\norganizations, the administrative regions of the\ncountry, religious organizations, women's and youth\nassociations and non-governmental organizations \u2014 in\nother words, civil society \u2014 were those who, through\ntheir freely appointed representatives, drafted and\nsubmitted to the Government these new fundamental\n28\n\ntexts that the Government, in turn, simply placed\nbefore the populace for its approval.\nThis consultation, the transparency of which was\nvery much heralded by the international community,\nwas characterized by a massive turn-out of the\nelectorate of 86.23 per cent. We believe that this result\nshould, in itself, be enough to put an end to the\ndiscussions and speculations that preceded and\nfollowed the referendum, the tone of which, in many\nrespects, was not to the liking of the people of the C\u00f4te\nd'Ivoire and their friends.\nWe welcome the efforts made by the United\nNations, the European Union, the OAU and the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) in order to try and bring about common\nground among the political circles in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and\nto support the transitional process. Therefore, the\ninternational community should be reassured that the\npeople of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire will, on 22 October of this\nyear, express their wishes through fair and transparent\nelections for candidates whose eligibility has been\nestablished by the Constitutional Chamber of the\nSupreme Court.\nTo spend time today still talking about the\nrequirements for eligibility, as contained in the texts\nthat have been adopted, would be an attempt\ntantamount to trying to perpetuate a discussion whose\nfate has already been definitely, once and for all, sealed\nby the people of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nTrained in the school of the founding father of\nmodern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-\nBoigny, the apostle of peace, and belonging as we do to\na subregion that has been beset by conflicts, some of\nwhich have taken place at the very gates of Ivorian\nterritory, the people of C\u00f4te of d'Ivoire are only too\nwell aware of the importance of peace. The people are\ndetermined to preserve peace without backsliding or\ncompromise.\nMy country is not xenophobic, nor is it a place of\nexclusion. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is still the only country in the\nworld where foreigners account for more than 40 per\ncent of the total population. The problems of all kinds\nthat arise from this unparalleled immigration \u2014 social,\neconomic and even political \u2014 are real. The country is\naddressing and coping with them as best it can. We do\nnot wish our brothers and sisters, who are living on\nvery good terms with the Ivorian population, to leave.\nIn this respect, we are very proud of being the\nmost integrationist country of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States and we intend to\nremain so. That is why we believe that the desire of the\nIvorian people to offer one single political post, that of\nPresident of the Republic, to a citizen of established\nbackground should not serve as a pretext for spreading\nmalicious rumours about our country and its people.\nIn this connection, we are counting on the\nunderstanding and support of the international\ncommunity to help us successfully through this\ntransition and, within our self-imposed schedule, to\nachieve the state of constitutional normality that our\npeople so earnestly desires.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate\nMr. Holkeri on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. At the same time, I\nwould like to express our appreciation to the President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the results achieved during\nhis presidency.\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express our\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\nefficient and relevant leadership of the Organization.\nThe Republic of Macedonia will continue actively to\ncontribute to the realization of the goals of the United\nNations.\nI also welcome the admission of Tuvalu to the\nUnited Nations, wishing it success in its contribution to\nUnited Nations activities and expressing our wish to\nestablish diplomatic relations. At the same time, the\nRepublic of Macedonia expresses its readiness and\ncalls for the acceleration of the process of establishing\ndiplomatic relations with all other States Members of\nthe United Nations with which we have not yet done\nso.\nIn the region where the Republic of Macedonia is\nlocated, the situation has to some extent improved after\nthe huge humanitarian crisis that took place in Kosovo.\nThe heavy consequences of the crisis, which posed a\nserious threat to the stability and security of the\nBalkans and more widely in Europe, have not been\nfully overcome.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has and will have in\nthe future a vital role to play for peace and stability in\nSouth-East Europe and beyond. The risks confronting\nthe Republic of Macedonia were enormous. The\nMacedonian Government and our citizens have done\neverything within their capacity to respond to the\nproblems. However, as was the case in the previous\ncrises that occurred in the Balkans and during the\nKosovo conflict last year as well, as one of the\ncountries that most directly felt and bore the brunt of\nthe damage, the Republic of Macedonia has shown and\nconfirmed its long-term commitment to acting as a\nfactor for peace and stability in the region. The\nGovernment, even in such conditions, persisted in its\npolicy to preserve the stability of the Macedonian State\nand at the same time to reaffirm its capability to\nrespond to all challenges and risks confronting it, in\nparticular in the economic and social fields.\nOne of the main priorities of the foreign policy of\nthe Republic of Macedonia is to further improve good-\nneighbourly relations with all its neighbours. This\ncommitment has been confirmed through a number of\nour initiatives, resulting in more advanced and\ndeveloped relations in bilateral cooperation and\nintensified cooperation within the framework of a\nnumber of regional initiatives. My country is aware\nthat stability and prosperity, in the medium and long\nterms, can be ensured only if stability is spread\nthroughout South-East Europe, with intensive mutual\ncommunications and good-neighbourly cooperation\namong all States of the region.\nMy country has managed, with almost all its\nneighbours \u2014 Greece, Albania and Bulgaria, but not\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with which we\ncontinue to negotiate the demarcation of our common\nborder \u2014 to have outstanding relations and to develop\ncooperation in many areas of common interest. We\nhave significantly improved relations with our southern\nneighbour, Greece. We continue to hold talks on our\ndifferences over the name of my country, under the\nauspices of the Secretary-General, expressing our will\nand interest in resolving this issue as soon as possible,\ntaking into account the reality and dignity of the\ncountry and all its citizens.\n22\n\nDespite the huge expectations and initial support,\nthe project that is most expected to contribute to the\nlasting stabilization of the region \u2014 the Stability\nPact \u2014 has not managed to ensure the implementation\nof a large number of ideas and plans that have been\nsubmitted and accepted. The Pact, a significant\nexample of the joint engagement and functioning of a\nlarge number of international organizations and States,\nis intended to hasten the revitalization of the countries\nof South-East Europe and their integration into\nEuropean structures. I appeal to all participants\nengaged in this process, especially the donors and the\nwider international community, to make the utmost\nefforts to speed its urgent and timely implementation\nthrough the accelerated and full realization of these\nprojects. This will provide for the economic prosperity\nof the countries of South-East Europe and strengthen\ndemocratic processes, respect for human rights and\nstability in the region. The implementation of the Pact\nconstitutes a natural upgrading of our activities within\nthe context of regional initiatives to promote good-\nneighbourly relations and the possibility of the\nrealization of the foreign policy priorities of my\ncountry: its full integration into the European and\nEuro-Atlantic structures.\nIn addition to its foreign policy activities, the\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia is fully\ncommitted to carrying out fundamental reforms based\non European standards \u2014 political, economic and\ndemocratic \u2014 with maximum respect for human rights,\nincluding minority rights. The Government of my\ncountry is continuously working on the improvement\nof inter-ethnic relations. A law on higher education\nwas recently adopted that paves the way for private\nhigher education in minority languages. Therefore, as a\nresult of our commitment, concrete steps and\nachievements, by the end of this year my country will\nbe the first in the region to conclude the Stabilization\nand Association Agreement with the European Union.\nThe efforts of the international community to\nstabilize the region, to which the Republic of\nMacedonia has contributed widely, are beginning to\nshow results. Despite the limitations, it should be taken\ninto consideration that the seriousness and complexity\nof the situation in Kosovo, and in the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia as a whole, mean that the consequences\nof this situation cannot be alleviated with the speed\ndesired by all of us, especially by the countries of the\nregion.\nIn regard to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nour view is that its democratization is one of the key\nfactors for the comprehensive stabilization of the\nsituation in the region. Our joint efforts should be\ndirected at support for the democratic forces in that\ncountry and at joint actions to start the democratic\nprocess, followed by the provision of opportunities for\neconomic prosperity. It is important to reassess the\noverall effects of the sanctions, which should not be\ndirected at the citizens. We hope that the upcoming\nelections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be\nfair and democratic, in accordance with European and\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nstandards, and be a step towards that country's\ndemocratization.\nRegarding the situation in the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, I would like, in my capacity as Chairman\nof the South-East European Cooperation Process, to\ninform the Assembly about the joint declaration\nrecently adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the\nparticipating States in New York. In the declaration we,\nthe Foreign Ministers, expressed our concern about the\nlatest developments in the situation in the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia as regards the upcoming\npresidential and parliamentary elections, and confirmed\nour support for the democratic forces in that country\nand for its efforts to start the democratic process.\nAll of this might contribute to the integration of\nthat country into the international community and to its\nparticipation in the work of international organizations,\nfollowing the path that all the other successor States of\nthe former Yugoslavia have taken. Furthermore, the\nresolution of the succession issue of the former\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the basis\nof the equality of all successors \u2014 as acknowledged by\nthe decisions of the European Union/United Nations\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, as\nwell as by the relevant Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions \u2014 is a prerequisite for stability\nand peace in the region.\nConcerning the issue of succession, I would like\nto point out that during the Millennium Summit and\nMillennium Assembly, the four successor States have\nonce again reaffirmed their joint position and proposed\nto work more intensively to settle this issue.\nFurthermore, I would like to express our support\nfor the stability and the reform processes undertaken in\nMontenegro and for the efforts of the democratically\n23\n\nelected Government there to continue pursuing\neconomic and democratic development. We also\nsupport that Government's greater involvement in the\nwork of international bodies and organizations and in\nother regional cooperation processes.\nThe consistent position of my country, which was\nstated well before the outbreak of the Kosovo crisis\nand adoption of the Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999), was to support a peaceful and political solution\nto the Kosovo crisis through substantial autonomy in\nthe framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nrespect for the human rights of all living in Kosovo,\nrespect for the inviolability of the existing borders and,\nfinally, the economic reconstruction and stabilization\nof Kosovo and of the region.\nWe support the activities of the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the\nKosovo Force (KFOR). We are convinced of the need\nto build democratic institutions and a multi-ethnic\nsociety in Kosovo, and to find a model of civil society\nthat does away with any propensity to create ethnically\ncleansed territories. The local elections in Kosovo are\nof paramount importance for its future.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is concerned about\nthe reported violence and the increased number of\ninter-ethnic incidents and tensions in Kosovo. We\nconsider that KFOR should strengthen its border\ncontrol activities, with the aim of preventing violence\nfrom spilling over into the neighbouring countries,\nincluding my country. I am stressing this because there\nhave been several serious incidents at the border of the\nRepublic of Macedonia.\nIn the hope that the developments in Kosovo will\nbe the last serious challenge in the Balkans, we will\nhave to defend together more successfully democratic\nprinciples and values and develop long-term preventive\nstrategies. Regional stability can be provided only by\neconomic prosperity, democracy and respect for human\nrights and the rights of national minorities, as well as\nthrough intensive regional and bilateral cooperation.\nHowever, the most serious guarantee for the security of\nthe region and its transformation into an area of\ndemocracy, development, stability and cooperation\nremains the early integration and full-fledged\nmembership of the countries from the region in the\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO).\nThis year's Millennium Assembly presents a\ngenuine opportunity to analyse the work of our\nOrganization and to evaluate its efficiency in resolving\nissues of international interest. We all hope that the\ndirections for future development will also be\nunderscored, with the aim of further promoting the\nachieved results and practices.\nOne of the main characteristics of the modern\nworld is that now more than ever there is a great deal\nof interdependence. This represents a new challenge,\nand at the same time is a new feature of international\nrelations. Moreover, when everybody is talking about\nthe enormous significance of the ever more important\nmultilateral character of the international scene and\nabout globalization, the question of the equal\nparticipation of all the world's actors is being raised.\nThat is, at issue is the official representation of the\nvoices of all peoples. In this regard, I would like to\nexpress our support for the efforts of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan to become integrated into the\ninternational community, taking into consideration the\ninterests of that country and also its significant\ncontribution to international cooperation and the\nsolidarity it has shown. It is in the interest of our\nOrganization that the 23 million people of the Republic\nof China participate in its activities.\nThe negative effects of crises, threats to peace,\nsecurity and economic development, and the pollution\nof the environment are felt globally. In accordance with\nthe new situation in international relations, needs and\nvisions, an obvious demand exists to strengthen the\nrole of the United Nations. Our Organization can\nsuccessfully carry out its activities only if the Member\nStates fully contribute to their realization.\nIn order to allow the Organization to be able to\nplay a successful role in the twenty-first century, it is\nnecessary to adequately reform it. We welcome the\nefforts made by the Secretary-General thus far to this\neffect, and at the same time we would like to urge him\nand the Member States to continue. Furthermore, I\nwould like to underline that the reform of the United\nNations will be successful only if strengthening the\nrole of the General Assembly follows the reform of the\nSecurity Council. In our view, it is necessary to\nincrease the number of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council on the basis of the\nnew reality in international relations. These new\nmembers should come from both the developing and\ndeveloped countries.\n24\n\nWhat needs to be done so that the United Nations\ncan adequately respond to the challenges of this\ncentury? The Millennium Summit offered part of the\nanswer. The adopted Millennium Summit Declaration\ncreates obligations for all Member States in their future\nendeavours. We share the opinion that, although the\nDeclaration is a political document, it is first of all an\naction plan of our Organization for the period to come.\nStressing the importance of the adopted document, I\nwould like to urge the General Assembly to begin\nimplementing it. In these efforts, the Republic of\nMacedonia will actively contribute.\nThe Republic of Macedonia will also continue to\ncontribute to the strengthening of international peace\nand security. I emphasize that part of our contribution\nto the realization of the issues will be elaborated under\nthe three agenda items as a follow-up to the resolutions\nsubmitted by the Republic of Macedonia.\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity worldwide will continue to be the priority of\nour Organization in the twenty-first century. As the\nSecretary-General stated in his report, the world, and\nour Organization in particular, will be faced with the\nneed to be fully involved in conflict prevention,\nconflict resolution and the development of the affected\nStates. Therefore, prevention should become one of the\nprimary instruments of our Organization. In regard to\nour contribution to prevention activities and policy, I\nwould like to inform the Assembly that in the Republic\nof Macedonia an international centre for conflict\nprevention and resolution is being established.\nOf great importance to stability and security, in\nour view, is the control of small arms and light\nweapons, which pose a large threat to peace in many\nregions of the world. In that connection, the United\nNations, in cooperation with other regional\norganizations, such as the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), can have a\nserious impact on preventing the proliferation of small\narms and light weapons.\nWe urge the international community to take\nstrong measures in its efforts to stop arms trafficking,\nespecially of small arms and light weapons. In that\nrespect, we hope that that the international conference\non this issue, which will take place next year, will\ncontribute to more efficient actions.\nAmong the reasons for the eruption of a large\nnumber of local conflicts worldwide are economic and\nsocial factors. Globalization, apart from its positive\neffects, has a number of negative implications for the\nsmall and least developed economies. Financial\nresources for development are necessary; realistically,\nthe United Nations is not able to provide them. We\nsupport the appeal for the necessary voluntary\ncontributions from Member States, but also the idea of\ninvolving other participants, such as international\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and other\nbodies. In this respect, we welcome next year's\ninternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment. I underline that writing off the debts, or\npart of them, of countries affected by objective external\ninfluences would have a very positive impact. It would\nalso help to diminish global poverty and\nunemployment and aid the overall economic\ndevelopment of the indebted countries.\nThe General Assembly is the proper place for\nevaluating achievements in the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and freedoms. There has\nbeen an impressive development of international\nhuman rights law in the last 50 years. Today we can\nproudly state that the United Nations, with the adoption\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nother instruments, succeeded in affirming the\ninternational consensus \u2014 that human dignity is to be\nthe basic standard and the main goal for all people and\nnations.\nLast year we marked the tenth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\nand next year there will be a world summit on this\nissue. I take this opportunity to announce the intention\nof the Republic of Macedonia to sign in the very near\nfuture the two Optional Protocols to the Convention,\nthe first on the involvement of children in armed\nconflict and the second on the sale of children, child\nprostitution and child pornography.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to single out a\nfew issues to which my Government attaches crucial\nimportance: first the situation in Africa, both political\nand economic; secondly, the Middle East peace\nprocess; thirdly, the financial situation of our\nOrganization \u2014 all Member States should fulfil their\nobligations; and, finally peacekeeping operations,\nwhich contribute to the affirmation of our Organization\non a global scale. This is the right moment for their\n25\n\nrestructuring and strengthening on the basis of the\nreport (A/55/305) prepared by the Brahimi Panel.\nMany challenges await us in the twenty-first\ncentury. Our obligation is to make the world a better\nand happier place to live in. In the realization of that\naim, the United Nations has a significant place and\nrole. The significance and existence of our universal\nOrganization lies in its skilfulness in adapting to real\nsituations and future challenges.\nWe expect this year's Millennium Assembly to\ncontribute to the realization of this aim. I assure the\nAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia's contribution\nto its successful fulfilment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But\nthey also left us tasks to be completed relating to\nproblems such as racism, xenophobia, an arsenal of\nweapons of various magnitudes and the effects of a\nculture of violence and destruction. This is why we\nfirmly support the consolidation of the peace process in\nthe Middle East. We welcome the constructive dialogue\nlaunched by the two Koreas in an effort to normalize\n22\n\ntheir relations, as we welcome peaceful solutions for\nany divided society.\nAs regards globalization, we must tackle not only\nthe economic aspect, but also social well-being.\nEducation is a passport to the future, but only if the\neducation provided is the same for all, and not just for\na minority, and only if education is life-affirming and\npromotes change so as to teach all human beings on the\nearth to live together.\nFor this purpose, as the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  has\npointed out, we must learn to know, we must learn to\ndo, we must learn to be. In this area, we believe that\nthe Economic and Social Council of our Organization\nmust promote and pursue its initiative for greater\ndissemination of technological information, as\nproposed by its members during the high-level segment\nthis year. It must try to prevent disparities in\ntechnological development that benefit only\nindustrialized countries.\nMillions of human beings are noting with\namazement that there exist realities very different from\ntheir own harsh conditions. When they try to travel to\nthat fantastic world, to that dream of hope, they find\nout that borders do exist and that they are free only to\ncontinue dreaming.\nGlobalization is a coin with two faces. On the one\nhand, it creates wealth, benefits, possibilities, but on\nthe other, poverty, problems, inequity and even new\nforms of exclusion. Instead, globalization should create\nfor the benefit of all a world without any exclusions.\nOur responsibility is to bring about the globalization of\nthe development of the human being.\nHonduras is participating in the Central American\nintegration process. We see this as a way of having a\ngreater presence and being more active in this\nglobalized world. This is why we actively support the\nstrengthening of the institutional process of Central\nAmerican integration.\nDespite the advances that occurred in the past\nmillennium, the terms of trade continue to work against\nthe development of many of our countries. The\nincrease in oil prices has a devastating effect on the\nweakest economies, and, paradoxically, the more we\nincrease production, the more we open our doors to\ninternational trade and eliminate barriers, the more\nobstacles we encounter to gaining access to\ninternational markets. This creates a crisis for our\nexport capacity. Trade globalization must produce\nbenefits in both directions.\nIn addition to the asymmetries and disparities to\nwhich I have referred, there are also threats of different\ntypes that no State, however powerful or strong, can\nsuccessfully confront in isolation. The report of the\nSecretary-General to the Millennium Summit attached\nas much importance to the topic of the environment as\nit did to peace and development. This demonstrates that\nin the year 2000 we recognize that, in addition to\nachieving peace and economic development, we must\ntake care of our environment. If we do not, the future\nof humanity will continue to be threatened. Every day\nwe are increasingly threatened by the lack of drinking\nwater, desertification, the destruction of the ozone\nlayer and climate change. These processes have\nproduced an increase in natural disasters. Honduras,\nmy country, was the victim of a disaster of catastrophic\nproportions. This is why we attach such priority to\ncaring for the environment and to education on how to\npromote and preserve it.\nThe need to control the production of greenhouse\ngases, the widening of the hole in the ozone layer, the\ndrop in oxygen production, the pollution of fresh and\nsalt water, the extinction of thousands of species  all\nthese form part of that greater concern that we must\nconfront jointly.\nSimilarly, terrorism, organized crime and drug\ntrafficking can be combated effectively only if we act\njointly and in coordination. If we do not, we will be\njointly responsible as accomplices in the destruction of\nthe hopes of the future youth and children.\nOur Organization should make a greater effort to\novercome the disparity between abundance and want,\nof which very concrete examples abound. For instance,\ntoday hundreds of thousands of medicines are\nproduced, but the millions of human beings affected by\nHIV/AIDS need access to these medicines if their pain\nis to be relieved. It is truly horrifying that the world\nproduces thousands of metric tons more food than is\nneeded to feed its population, and yet people are dying\nof hunger and malnutrition. The poverty and hunger of\nmillions of human beings is an insult to humanity and\nan affront to the dignity of individuals. Here there is\nroom for improved coordination.\nOur Organization continues its important efforts\nto prevent world conflicts. There have been many\n23\n\nachievements in implementing machinery for world\norder and peace, including peacekeeping activities and\nthe work of the international tribunals. We have also\nseen progress in disarmament, particularly in terms of\nweapons of mass destruction. Aware of its international\nresponsibilities, Honduras, to the extent that its\nresources permit, has also contributed to international\npeace and security, participating in the missions in\nHaiti and Western Sahara.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) has also acted as a partner in the development\nprocess in many countries around the world. It has\nworked with national Governments, with society and\nlocal communities. UNDP is a trustworthy, active\npartner in the elaboration and implementation of\nmedium- and long-term national strategies to\ncontribute to the reduction of poverty. The Executive\nBoard meeting of UNDP, held yesterday, was very\nsuccessful in advancing UNDP reform. Honduras is\nactively participating in this process.\nThe world of bipolar confrontation is no longer,\nand the era of cooperation is under way. Nevertheless,\nour Organization is still leaving out States that have\ncontributed to development, that represent millions of\nbeings and that participate actively in the world\neconomy. For these and other reasons, which we have\noften cited in this General Assembly and in other\ninternational forums, these States should be\nparticipating in our debates and decisions. One such\nState is the Republic of China.\nAt the dawning of the new millennium we must\nstrengthen our membership, expand our representation\nof peoples and nations and ensure fairer and more\nbalanced representation in the discussions and\ndecisions of the Security Council. To this end,\nHonduras believes that the Security Council should\nmake room for important development partners and\nrepresentatives of the developing world, on the basis of\nequitable geographical representation and with the\nconsensus of the existing regional groups.\nWe also believe that the right to exercise the veto\npresently enjoyed by a limited number of States should\nbe confined to specific topics and circumstances, so\nthat it is not used merely to protect vested interests.\nThe new vision we have of a renewed United\nNations requires that our Organization become more\ncompetent, more agile and more responsible; that it be\nbetter administered, with a healthy financial system;\nand that it produce more tangible results for the\npeoples of the world. This is why we support the\nresults of the Working Group of the General Assembly\nand believe that reforming and expanding the Council\nmust be based on the broadest possible consensus and\nbe in keeping with fair and equitable geographical\nrepresentation, by which developing countries will be\nable to make substantial contributions to the decision-\nmaking process so as to solidify world peace and\nsecurity.\nOur Organization must engage in self-criticism\nand be the first to propose changes to its working\nmethods. Thematic dialogues designed to produce\nconsensus and plans of action should replace the long,\ncostly world conferences, the concrete results of which\nare not always easy to see. These lofty conferences\nshould be replaced by a genuine debate in the General\nAssembly, and the procedures should be simplified so\nas to save the Organization the large sums that we are\npresently wasting because of duplication of efforts.\nI conclude by referring to the Millennium Summit\nheld just last week. I would like to recall the idea of the\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, Mr. Carlos\nFlores, that the United Nations can and must work to\nbring about the required coexistence of the poor and\nthe rich, the large and the small, by means of a\nplatform of sovereign equality and human solidarity.\nAnd our President said,\n`More than a world pained by poverty and\ninequity for the overwhelming majority, the world\nshould be the sum of its peoples with at least their\nbasic needs and essential requirements met."

        "file_text": "First let me warmly\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election, which is doubly\nsignificant, as few Prime Ministers have held the post\nof President of the General Assembly. Your unique\npractical experience in both domestic and international\naffairs will stand us in good stead as we try to reform\nthe United Nations. I also thank your distinguished\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the excellent\nwork he has done and for ushering the United Nations\nsuccessfully into the new millennium.\nAs a fellow small State, Singapore is also\ndelighted to extend a warm welcome to Tuvalu, the\nUnited Nations newest Member. We hope that Tuvalu\nwill also join the Forum of Small States.\nAs the text of my speech has been circulated, in\nthe interest of saving time I will not read the entire\ntext.\nThe recently concluded Millennium Summit\nconfirmed that the United Nations, whatever its\nimperfections, remains an indispensable organization.\nThe overriding theme of the speeches in plenary\nmeetings was the need for the United Nations to be\nrevitalized and better equipped to deal with the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Our immediate\nchallenge is to respond with concrete follow-up. This\nmay be stating the obvious but doing it will not be easy\nnor is it assured. The United Nations record of\nimplementation, it must be conceded, has not always\ninspired confidence.\nIn his report to the Millennium Summit, the\nSecretary-General drew attention to a 1999 Gallup poll\nof some 57,000 individuals in 60 countries. One\nconclusion was that, globally, less than half of those\ninterviewed judged the performance of the United\nNations to be satisfactory. We need to reflect on this.\nBut it is also an unfortunate fact that the United\nNations has not usually got credit for what it has done\nsuccessfully, while continuing to attract criticism for\nwhat it has not yet done. Thus, a critical political\nfactor \u2014 hitherto inadequately addressed \u2014 is how to\nmanage expectations.\nManaging expectations is a key to success. The\nwindow of opportunity opened for the United Nations\nby the end of the cold war was perhaps squandered by\nan overly ambitious agenda, leading almost inevitably\nto disillusionment. We should not repeat this mistake\nafter the Millennium Summit. To resolutely implement\nthe Summit's results, we must not only accurately\nidentify them, but engage in a realistic assessment of\nwhat is and is not possible. Otherwise, we risk\nundermining the political will and support needed for\nthe United Nations to be effective.\nThe United Nations serves two essential functions\nfor our community of nations. It provides all of us with\na valuable instrument to advance our common interests,\nincluding the setting of norms for relations between\nnations and on human rights. It also provides each of\nus with an important avenue to advance or defend our\nnational interests. There is no necessary contradiction\nbetween these two functions. That which is in the\ninterest of humanity ought to be in our individual\nnational interests. But the practical problem is in\nidentifying what is common and reconciling different\nnational interests.\nThe twentieth century has seen a creative tension\nbetween two apparently contradictory sets of ideals:\nthe sovereignty of nation States and the progressive\nelaboration of international law and organization.\nSovereignty implies the right of each State to\ndetermine for itself its own rules. Yet today States\ninteract within a web of complex relationships,\ninternational institutions and regimes, covering an\never-widening range of matters, which implies a\nserious limitation of sovereignty. We live with this\napparent contradiction every day.\nBut we do not have to choose between the two\nideals of absolute sovereignty or absolute international\nlaw and organization. The real question is how to strike\nan appropriate balance to move forward.\nIt was therefore timely for the Secretary-General\nto convene the Millennium Summit. We now have a\nbroad consensus on what to do to meet the challenges\nof the twenty-first century.\nThe question then is: how do we proceed from\nhere. Taking a narrower but more focused approach\nmay be the only practical solution to many seemingly\nintractable issues. But I do not underestimate the\ncomplexities of putting this into practice. Let me\nillustrate the complexities with reference to two of the\ncore functions of the United Nations: development and\nsecurity.\n14\n\nOn development, earlier calls for a new\ninternational economic order fell on deaf ears. The\nstalemate in North-South negotiations over the last\nthree decades or so was the direct consequence of the\nresistance on the part of certain developed countries to\nadmit the necessity of changing the functioning of the\nworld economy.\nHowever, I believe that resistance can be more\neasily overcome and the urgent remedial action that is\nneeded may be easier to take if there is a mind-set shift\nby both developing and developed countries. The\ncandid debate the leaders had at the recent interactive\nround table discussions saw a common\nacknowledgement that both the North and the South\nmust find collective solutions to the problems of\ndevelopment. There was agreement that developing\ncountries must be given help to build up capacity to\nbenefit from the forces of globalization. The developed\neconomies have also pointed out that they too face\nserious problems that can be attributed to the pressures\nof globalization. But there can be no doubt that the\nproblems of the South are of a far greater magnitude\nand deserve far more attention. Domestic problems at\nhome should not give the North any excuse to ignore\ntheir important international obligations.\nToday, it is commonly accepted that no country,\nwhatever its development status, can afford to opt out\nof the global economy or go it alone. The issue for all\nis to develop the national capacity to take advantage of\nthe benefits of globalization while mitigating its\ndownsides.\nThe United Nations is now in its fourth\ndevelopment decade. A new discipline for both\ndeveloped and developing countries is needed if the\nresults are to be less disappointing than the first three.\nThe issue for the United Nations is to help the\ndeveloping countries acquire the capabilities to deal\nwith the pressures of globalization and to plug it.\nIn this process, difficult domestic structural\nchanges will be necessary to ensure that policies and\ninstitutions meet international best practices. These\nstandards are today largely Western, but can and ought\nto be internationally negotiated. And it is imperative\nthat the developed countries avoid a sterile \u201cone-size-\nfits-all\u201d prescription. As suggested by the Secretary-\nGeneral, the United Nations can play a mediating role\nin the negotiations so that it will not be undertaken on\nthe basis of categories biased towards zero-sum\nsolutions. Instead, the United Nations can help develop\n\u201cwin-win\u201d solutions for both developed and developing\ncountries.\nHowever, the United Nations cannot work in\nisolation. The United Nations has a role to play to\nensure that the international financial institutions like\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and\nthe World Trade Organization coordinate their efforts\nand work as one team. No other institution is better\nplaced than the United Nations to do this. The United\nNations is the natural forum for regular dialogues\namong the multilateral organizations to coordinate\nprogrammes that would help developing nations build\ncapacity. The United Nations could also help make the\ndecision-making processes of these organizations more\ntransparent, consultative and inclusive.\nTurning next to security, the end of the cold war\nhas obviously not meant the end to international\nconflict. In the eleven years since the end of 1989,\nwhen the Berlin Wall fell, the Security Council\nauthorized some 40 peacekeeping operations. But in\nthe preceding 42 years, it had authorized only 17. It has\nbeen estimated that the total cumulative amount of the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping budget from 1948 to\n1989 was $3 billion. But since 1989, it has escalated to\nabout $18 billion. Not only have the numbers and the\ncosts of peacekeeping operations risen sharply, but\ntheir scope has also changed. Of the 40 peacekeeping\noperations authorized since 1989, only five were\nclearly in response to clear inter-State conflicts.\nThroughout history we have witnessed oppressive\ninternal conflicts and human rights atrocities\nperpetuated by a State against its own people. The\ndifference today is that with the advent of technology,\ninstant communication through television, the Internet\nand the role of non-governmental organizations, these\nconflicts and atrocities are made known to the whole\nworld instantaneously. Very few are regarded as purely\nlocal or regional situations. Most are regarded as\ninternationalized. This galvanizing of public outrage\nleads to expectations that the international community\nmust act. Often this increases the pressures on the\nUnited Nations and the Security Council to take\ninterventionist actions, severely testing the United\nNations capacity and stretching its resources. The\ndilemma is: how can the United Nations be responsive\nto these pressures if its Members are unwilling to give\nit the required resources. And if the United Nations\n15\n\ntries to be selective, how can it prevent itself from\nbeing accused of practising double standards?\nIn 1995 Professor Paul Kennedy of Yale\nUniversity, who headed a team of scholars retained by\nthe United Nations Secretariat to study the future of the\nOrganization, concluded that Member States faced an\nurgent decision: either to reduce their demands on the\nUnited Nations, thereby giving it a decent chance to\ncarry on at a lower level of activity within existing\nresources, or to expand available resources so that the\nUnited Nations could meet what Professor Kennedy\nsaw as inexorably growing demands from Member\nStates unable to cope with the technological pace,\npopulation growth and environmental pressures of the\ntwenty-first century. He concluded that, in the light of\nglobal circumstances, opting for expanded resources\nwould be the wiser choice.\nThere is now a growing consensus that it is\nimportant to ensure that the United Nations has\nadequate resources for its current and future\npeacekeeping activities. Discussions on how this can\nbest be effected are already under way and Singapore\nsupports them. Nevertheless, let us not forget that\nevery prudent accounting must deal squarely with how\ndecisions are made on peacekeeping operations. We\nhave to be honest here. There is no level playing field.\nMost of the time, most decisions are in reality made by\nthe permanent members of the Security Council. The\nrest of us have to pay our dues, but have a minimal say\nin the decisions.\nHence, when we review the current peacekeeping\nscale of assessments, we hope that the Security Council\nwill also review its current decision-making\nprocedures.\nRecent developments in Africa serve as a\nsobering reminder of the need to undertake an urgent\noverhaul of United Nations peacekeeping. The Security\nCouncil met at the level of heads of State and\nGovernment during the Millennium Summit to discuss\nthe need to ensure an effective role for it in maintaining\ninternational peace and security, particularly in Africa.\nSadly, apart from a general description, the Security\nCouncil summit did not produce any new concrete\nproposals for or commitments to further action. The\nCouncil could and I believe should do better than this.\nFortunately, the Brahimi Panel has come up with\na set of concrete recommendations, which when put in\nplace will significantly revamp United Nations\npeacekeeping. In a nutshell, the Panel advocated that\nshould the United Nations decide to send a\npeacekeeping force to uphold peace, the peacekeepers\nmust be rapidly deployed with a credible deterrence,\nand be authorized, with robust mandates, to carry out\ntheir mission and defend themselves. Only then can the\ntragedies of past peacekeeping operations be avoided.\nWhat this entails is that United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions must be given the necessary resources,\nincluding better trained and better equipped\npeacekeepers, and receive better support from United\nNations Headquarters \u2014 in particular, an enlarged\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. In turn,\nMember States must have the political will to support\nthe United Nations politically, financially and\noperationally.\nI think I have said enough to underscore the point\nthat a focused approach is not necessarily an easier or\nless complex one, but I believe that it is the only\npractical way forward.\nThe Secretary-General's report to the Millennium\nSummit was designed as a guide to action, and it\nshould be actively used as such and not simply praised\nand then forgotten. We took the first step at the\nMillennium Summit by endorsing and adopting many\nof the proposals of the report in the form of a\nMillennium Declaration. The real challenge now is to\nfulfil the ambitious and wide-ranging promises that we\nhave made to the world.\nWhere are the material, financial and human\nresources to come from to fulfil our promises? The\nUnited Nations Secretariat and agencies by themselves\nobviously do not have them. The United Nations\ncannot do everything on its own. As the millennium\nreport makes clear, the necessary long-term effort to\ndeliver the solution will have to be shared \u2014 shared\namong national Governments, the United Nations,\nother international institutions and other important\nactors, such as corporations and non-governmental\norganizations. Then, and only then, will there be any\nchance of success.\nThe Millennium Summit has provided a good\nbasis on which to begin the process of practical\nnegotiations that will lead to real solutions, rather than\npolitical posturing, which will only complicate already\ncomplex issues. We must start somewhere. I suggest\nthat we start here and now.\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me great delight and honour to address the\nGeneral Assembly's first session of the new\nmillennium. I would like to begin by conveying my\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of this historic session, the success of\nwhich is ensured, I believe, by the experience and\nwisdom you bring to this noble work. I would also like\nto pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, whose dedication and\nleadership enabled the fifty-fourth session to lay the\ngroundwork for the Millennium Assembly.\nI also take this opportunity to warmly welcome\nthe admission of Tuvalu to the United Nations.\nTwo weeks ago world leaders, including my\nPresident, gathered in this very place to rally the\npolitical will of the international community to meet\nthe challenges of the new millennium. Their meeting of\nminds here in this Hall of peace, as summed up in the\nMillennium Declaration, reaffirmed the role of the\nUnited Nations as the embodiment of humankind's\naspiration to greater peace and prosperity, to be\nstrengthened and fulfilled through the efforts of all\nMember States.\nIt is only right that the new millennium should\nstart with the beginning of the end of the confrontation\nand conflicts handed down from the past era. Such a\nstart has been made on the Korean peninsula with the\nfirst South-North Korean summit meeting in June. As a\nresult, inter-Korean relations have taken a definite turn\nfor the better. The whole world stands to benefit from\nthe liquidation of the final legacy of the cold war that\nthe summit appears to have set in motion on the Korean\npeninsula.\nDuring the June summit the two leaders engaged\nin an extensive discussion on peace on the Korean\npeninsula, South-North economic cooperation and the\nfuture of the Korean people. At the end, they\nannounced a five-point joint declaration committing\nthe top leaders of the two sides to steering inter-Korean\nrelations away from tension and enmity towards\nreconciliation, peaceful coexistence and co-prosperity\nand eventual unification.\nThe summit is being followed up with inter-\nKorean ministerial meetings to work out concrete steps\nto implement the summit agreements. Some steps have\nalready been taken, such as the reopening of the liaison\noffices at the truce village of Panmunjom and several\nsociocultural exchange programmes. Some are in the\nmaking \u2014 the work to reconnect the railroad between\nthe two sides and the negotiation of the necessary legal\ninstruments for full-scale economic exchanges, such as\nagreements on investment guarantees, avoidance of\ndouble taxation, settlement procedures and dispute\narbitration. The third ministerial round is to be held\nlater this month on Cheju island of South Korea.\nIn the latest development the two sides have\nagreed on a return visit to the South by Chairman Kim\nJong Il at an early date. Furthermore, in a key move for\ntension reduction, a South-North defence ministers'\nmeeting is to be held on 25 and 26 September, also on\nCheju island.\nEach of these developments stirs the hearts and\nminds of the Korean people. But none would match the\nprofound emotions that were aroused in mid-August by\nthe exchange of visits in Seoul and Pyongyang by\nfamilies that have suffered the unprecedented\nhumanitarian plight of remaining separated for half a\ncentury. It was a limited exchange involving only 100\nindividuals from each side, out of an estimated 10\n5\n\nmillion members of families torn apart by the national\ndivision. But further exchanges are in the planning, as\nare more lasting solutions to their plight.\nAs dramatic and hopeful as the June summit and\nthe inter-Korean developments since then have been,\nonly the first steps have been taken in the long process\nof ending the cold war and establishing a lasting peace\non the Korean peninsula. We sincerely seek the abiding\ninterest and support of the international community to\nsee us through. In this regard, I should like to express\nmy Government's wholehearted appreciation of the\nstatement by the Co-Chairpersons of the Millennium\nSummit welcoming the inter-Korean summit and the\nfollow-up measures.\nAt the dawn of a new millennium the United\nNations has yet to resolve the old problems of violent\nconflicts that are worsening in both scope and nature.\nIn many parts of the world, countless lives continue to\nbe lost in armed conflicts, insurgencies and ethnic\nviolence at regional, subregional, and intra-national\nlevels. We, as Member States, have to rally a stronger\npolitical will to prevent a repetition of these tragedies\nthat have happened or are happening in Rwanda,\nKosovo, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo.\nIt is particularly deplorable that United Nations\npersonnel in the field are under growing, violent attack.\nWe urge all parties concerned to guarantee the safety\nand security of the peacekeeping, humanitarian and\nother United Nations personnel. In this regard we\nwelcome the Brahimi report as providing a useful basis\nfor improving the effectiveness of the peacekeeping\noperations activities with an adequate mandate and\nresources.\nMy Government remains fully committed to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. Last year, in\nsupport of the democratic aspiration of a people, the\nRepublic of Korea sent an infantry battalion to East\nTimor. Furthermore, with the economy regaining a\ngrowth momentum, we are taking steps to fulfil our\npledge of an increase in our contribution to the\npeacekeeping operations budget. This is an expression\nof our firm belief that in the twenty-first century the\nUnited Nations should be better prepared and more\nwilling to fulfil its responsibility for international\npeace and security.\nMany leaders at the Millennium Summit spoke of\nthe double-edged nature of the globalizing world,\nwhich brings unprecedented opportunities for\neconomic growth on the one hand, while it further\nwidens the disparities between the developed and\ndeveloping countries, on the other. Aggravated by the\ndigital divide of the information age, the wealth gap\ncan become a source of unrest and instability in the\nworld.\nThe Republic of Korea has actively taken on the\nchallenges of globalization. At home we have turned\nthe recent economic crisis into an opportunity to gear\nup for the knowledge-based economy of the global\ninformation age. We knew that we must emerge from\nthe crisis not simply as we were before the crisis but in\na new form fit to thrive in the age of information\nindustries and borderless competition. Thus, bold\nreforms have been under way to rid the economy of\npast inefficiencies and to accelerate liberalization and\nmarket opening. Active Government assistance has\nbeen rendered to small and medium-venture businesses\nin the information sector, as well as to educating the\npeople in computer literacy.\nGovernment policies have combined with the\nintellectual vigour and adventurous spirit of the Korean\npeople to produce the world's fastest growing Internet\npopulation   an estimated 20 million users by the end\nof the year out of a population of 43 million, almost 50\nper cent of our entire population. While actively\npromoting the information age, we have also given\nspecial attention and care to those pockets of society\nthat would fall further behind without help. Our efforts\nin this area have been built around the concept of\n\u201cproductive welfare\u201d, which aims at enabling the\nsocially weak and enhancing the living standards of all.\nA key operative term is human resources development,\nwhich offers training and education to all who are\nwilling to work.\nWe believe that the same concept of enabling the\nweak to develop their capacities should be applied in\ninternational development assistance. Thus, on the\noccasion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) Forum on Shared Prosperity and Harmony in\nSeoul in March this year, our President, Kim Dae-jung,\nurged donors to support the developing countries in\ntheir efforts to set up information centres which would\nprovide communities with access to the Internet and\nother conveniences of the information age. I am very\nhappy that the proposal is entirely consistent with the\nSecretary-General's initiative on the United Nations\nInformation Technology Service (UNITeS). In addition,\n6\n\nmy Government is increasing its assistance for human\nresources development in the developing economies\nthrough the dispatch of experts and invitations to\ntrainees in the information and telecommunication\nfields. In particular, in collaboration with the United\nNations, we have offered training opportunities to\nexperts from African countries in export promotion.\nWe will continue to strengthen cooperation with the\nUnited Nations to address the mounting challenges that\nAfrica faces.\nShared values and ideals make for the strongest\nof the bonds that enable nations to work together\nbeyond differences in history, ethnicity and socio-\neconomic development. In this regard, the spread of\ndemocracy and its values in the post-cold-war era has\ngreatly enriched the grounds for the global community\nto build a world of durable peace and prosperity and of\ndignity for all human beings. While upholding human\nrights and democratic values at home, democracies\nshould cooperate to promote their universality in the\nglobal community. Thus, the Republic of Korea was\nhappy to serve as a co-convenor for the first\ninternational conference of the Community of\nDemocracies in Warsaw last June, and we are honoured\nthat Korea will host the second international\nconference of the Community of Democracies in\nOctober 2002.\nMeanwhile, to strengthen democracy at home, my\nGovernment has continued the endeavour to improve\nhuman rights laws and practices. At present we are in\nthe process of enacting a comprehensive human rights\nlaw, which will give birth to a national human rights\ncommission. The commission will work to improve\ninstitutional arrangements for the promotion of human\nrights and to raise public awareness. We are also\nmaking significant progress in enhancing the rights of\nwomen and children as well as workers. Particularly\nnoteworthy is the creation of the Ministry of Women,\ndue within this year, to advance gender equality.\nAs the new millennium opens, the challenges\nfacing the United Nations are multifaceted and ever-\ndiversifying. I have mentioned a few. There are many\nmore issues, such as disarmament and sustainable\ndevelopment, that are equally important. However, the\nresources of the global body remain limited. Ongoing\nreform is required to enable the United Nations to meet\nthe challenges with greater efficiency and\neffectiveness. Thanks to the Secretary-General's\ninitiative, considerable achievements have been made\nto streamline the Organization, but there are still areas\nwhere creative input is called for. Security Council\nreform is one of those areas. We believe that\nrepresentativeness, transparency and effectiveness must\nbe the guiding terms in the debate for a comprehensive\nreform of the Council.\nWe do not need new concepts to describe the\nchallenges of the new millennium. They are still the\nproblems of peace and prosperity and the right of\nhuman beings to live with dignity. However,\nglobalization has increased the intensity of the\nproblems as well as the chances for their resolution.\nTherefore, the role of the United Nations must also be\nconsolidated. The Government of the Republic of\nKorea is prepared to play an active role commensurate\nwith its abilities to accomplish the common goals of\nthe global community. I sincerely hope that this body\nwill lead the way in putting the lofty spirit of the\nMillennium Declaration into action. In the process, my\ncountry, the Republic of Korea, heartened by the\nenhanced hope for its peaceful and prosperous future,\nwill play an active part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I stand here today as\nIsrael's messenger of peace. The establishment of the\nState of Israel was the fulfilment of the dream of a\npeople forced into exile 2,000 years ago. The\ndestruction of the Second Temple and the dissolution\nof Jewish statehood were the result of our failure as a\nnation to assume the proper political course, to opt for\naccommodation with reality instead of engaging in\nmessianic hallucinations. Our punishment was very\nsevere indeed, but maybe it can serve as a lesson to\nthose nations and leaders who today may be tragically\nled to believe that the dangerous inertia of romantic\nmythology and unrealistic dreams is preferable to the\nbanality of a wise and prudent political course.\nMost revolts are uprisings against a system.\nZionism was a revolt against destiny. It is this\nexpression of our re-encounter with the world of\npolitical realities that eventually led us to the\nrestoration of Jewish statehood in 1948. Tragically,\nhowever, historical and geopolitical circumstances\nhave put us in a prolonged, bitter conflict with the\nPalestinian people.\nIt was thanks to the leadership of Prime Minister\nRabin and Chairman Arafat that, seven years ago,\nPalestinians and Israelis were put on a track leading to\npeace and reconciliation. We have been engaged in the\npast seven years, but more intensely in the last year, in\na major effort, unprecedented in both scope and depth,\nto resolve this 100-year-old conflict. This negotiating\nprocess, and it alone, should be the foundation of a\npeace agreement.\nAt this point, I would like to address my\ncolleagues from the Arab and Muslim world. I hope\nthat my words will convince them of the Israeli\nGovernment's sincere intentions to achieve a\ncomprehensive peace based on respect, dignity and\nfairness, which will end the Middle East conflict and\nbest serve the vital interests of the entire region.\nThe Jewish people have no quarrel with Islam.\nOn the contrary, we have the deepest respect for that\ngreat Islamic civilization under whose wings Jewish\nhistory \u2014 from Al-Andalus to Turkey, from Egypt to\nIraq, from the Jewish quarters of Tangier to Aleppo in\nSyria \u2014 has known some of its finest hours and most\nglorious cultural achievements. But even at the height\nof the \u201cGolden Age\u201d, in the midst of the delights and\nwonders of Muslim Spain, our people never abandoned\ntheir dream of and yearning for Jerusalem, as expressed\nin the words of the poet Yehuda Halevi more than 800\nyears ago:\n\u201cMy heart is in the East, and I am in the furthest\nreaches of the West. To thee my soul yearns from\nthe depth of the West.\u201d\nWe are a small nation decimated by holocaust and\ndispersion, but our heritage is rich. It was from our\neternal capital, Jerusalem \u2014 which, according to a\nMuslim source,\n\u201cin the days of the people of Israel, was an area\nlarger than Cairo and Baghdad\u201d \u2014\nthat the message of monotheism was projected to\nhumanity. The Jewish holy sites and shrines in\nJerusalem are the very heart of the Jewish faith,\nidentity and history. For the past 2,000 years, Jews\nhave turned towards Temple Mount in prayer three\ntimes a day.\n\u201cIf I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand\nforget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the\nroof of my mouth if I do not recall thee\u201d,\nthey pledged in joy and in sorrow.\nFor the past 30 years, Israel has consistently\ndemonstrated its commitment to freedom of religion\n10\n\nand worship in Jerusalem. Heads of the various\nreligious denominations in Jerusalem will attest to the\nfact that the city has never been so open to all\nbelievers. During the last month of Ramadan, a record\nnumber, unheard of in the annals of Islam in Jerusalem,\nof more than 400,000 Muslim worshippers attended\nFriday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\nI note this as an example of the deep respect\nwhich Israel has for Islam and its followers. Just as we\ndo not question the sincerity of the sentiments of others\ntowards their holy sites in Jerusalem, we expect that\nothers will not question the Jewish people's deep, awe-\ninspired attachment to Jerusalem and its holy sites,\nfrom which we will never again be parted.\nPoliticians need not distort God's intentions for\nthe sake of negotiations. How refreshing it is that a\ngreat number of Muslim scholars should attest to the\nfact that, as the Supreme Court Judge Mujir el-din al-\nHanbali wrote in his History of Jerusalem and Hebron,\n\u201cDavid reigned for 40 years and before he died he\npassed the monarchy on to his son Solomon and\ntold him to build the beit al-miqdas \u2014  the\nTemple\u201d.\nThe expression beit al-miqdas \u2014  that is, the House of\nthe Temple \u2014 became in many Muslim sources a\nsynonym of the word \u201cJerusalem\u201d.\nIt is a travesty of historical truth to present the\nPalestinian refugee problem as the result of mass\nexpulsion. There is no denying, however, that once the\nJews \u2014 who for thousands of years waited with\nhumility for their redemption \u2014 made their re-\nencounter with history as a sovereign nation, they had\nto assume the inherent immorality of war. The\nsuffering of the civilian population will always be a\nburden on the conscience of any nation at war. The\nArab-Israeli conflict has no monopoly on this maxim.\nClearly, the Palestinian refugees were victims of the\nArab-Israeli conflict. Israel, however, can assume\nneither political nor moral responsibility for this\ntragedy that was the direct result of the all-out\nonslaught against reborn Israel \u2014 an onslaught\nlaunched by the Arab armies in 1948. The Palestinian\nrefugee problem was born as the land was bisected by\nthe sword \u2014 not by design, Jewish or Arab. The\nproblem was largely the inevitable by-product of Arab\nand Jewish fears and the protracted bitter fighting.\nWe believe that, once established, it is the\nPalestinian State that should provide for the vindication\nof the Palestinian claim for the right of return. The\nnotion is preposterous that a nation should create a\nState only in order to gather its exiles in a\nneighbouring State. Israel, however, has expressed its\nwillingness to actively participate in any international\neffort and fund aimed at providing the financial\nfoundations for the resolution of the refugee problem.\nOut of humanitarian considerations, Israel may also\naccept a small and limited number of refugees within a\nscheme of family reunification.\nLet there be no doubt. The peace process is not\nthe objective, we need not sanctify the process. Peace,\nnot the process, is the objective. Peace is not about\nmore conventions, summits and resolutions; it is about\nthe future of our children, and about the seemingly\nunattractive banalities of building the mechanisms of\ncohabitation.\nTo the Palestinians we say: we need to\ndisentangle ourselves from this seemingly insoluble\nconundrum. We know that unless your and our wounds\nare healed, peace \u2014 not only the political peace but\nalso that of the mind and the conscience \u2014 will not be\ncomplete. Yet, at the same time we realize that the total\nsatisfaction of our respective dreams or presumed\nrights will lead us to perdition. Hence it is incumbent\non us to devise realistic ways to heal without opening\nnew wounds, to dignify our existence as free peoples\nwithout putting into jeopardy the collective existence\nof each other. Peace is not about twisting each other's\narms; it is about defining a common interest. I believe\nthat such an ideal compromise is not impossible to\nachieve, while banishing the sword from this land of\nGod.\nPeace has not materialized in full yet, but I\nbelieve that we are moving in the right direction. In the\npast year the Government of Prime Minister Ehud\nBarak has made bold, courageous and unprecedented\nmoves towards peace. At Camp David we have\ncontemplated ideas and explored concepts relating to\nthe most sensitive and supposedly intractable issues.\nOur sense is that breakthrough is possible, just as\nfailure may lead to breakdown. We have turned the sea\nthat separated us into a river. But, do we have the\ncourage and the determination to cross it?\nI know I may not sound too objective by\nvouching for Prime Minister Barak. But, I have come\n\n\nhere with the power of conviction that no Prime\nMinister before him \u2014 and let no illusions be\nharboured, no Prime Minister after him \u2014 will touch as\nhe has the outer limits of his options as an Israeli and a\nJew.\nI do not underestimate the dilemmas facing\nChairman Arafat. He is the great leader of the\nPalestinian people, and I know that the decision is not\neasy for him either. But this is the destiny of leaders: to\nalways be prophets without honour. They should not\nexpect the applause of their constituencies, what really\nmatters is the judgement of future generations. I call\nupon our Palestinian partners to realize that history has\nbrought us to a moment of truth and decision from\nwhich we are not allowed to escape empty-handed\nwithout inflicting severe punishments on our own\npeoples.\nIsrael aspires to achieve a comprehensive peace\nin the region and help move it into the future. Twenty\none years ago we signed a cornerstone peace treaty\nwith Egypt, followed by a peace treaty with Jordan and\nan incipient but promising process of normalization\nwith the Maghreb and Gulf States. Eighteen years of\nIsraeli military presence in Lebanon have been\nterminated by the Barak Government, in close\ncooperation with the United Nations, and thanks\nespecially to the efforts and dedication of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan. We have also delved into the\npossibilities of reaching peace with Syria. We hope that\ntalks with Syria will resume as soon as possible and\nthat a fair and equitable agreement can be achieved.\nIsrael is determined to pursue peace and take the\ncalculated risks attached to it. But Israel will not\ncompromise \u2014 not now and not ever \u2014 on those\nsecurity and national interests that we deem vital.\nWhile building our peace with the Palestinians we\ncannot ignore security concerns inherent in the fact that\npeace with the Palestinians is not our last peace. We\nstill have a dispute pending with Syria, and we are still\nexposed to the most serious regional threats emanating\nfrom revolutionary powers in the area.\nPeace requires the active involvement of the\ninternational community. The critical role played by\nthe United States, and especially the relentless\ndedication and unequivocal commitment of President\nBill Clinton, has been massive and constructive. Once\nagain the United States has proven to be the\nindispensable nation. We have also seen the European\nUnion rising to the task, and we commend the role of\nthe French Presidency and that of other key European\nGovernments. Peace needs the advice of the\ninternational community and it will need that support\nto cement peace once it is achieved.\nWe expect also to work closely with the Egyptian\nGovernment for the cause of regional peace. I believe\nthat it is also important that Russia and the Arab world\nexpress their opinions that now is the time to make\nhistorical decisions. Time is an elusive and perishable\ncommodity. We are all running out of it.\nWe are open to developing wide spaces of\ncooperation with our Palestinian neighbours and indeed\nwith all the countries of the Middle East, with dignity\nand mutuality. But, we do not intend to impose our\nexperience on anybody, nor is it our intention to assert\nour economic or technological presence amidst those of\nour neighbours who do not want it. The leaders and the\nelites throughout the Middle East do not need our\nadvice to know what are the real challenges ahead of us\nall: modernizing the economy and combating disease,\nhunger, poverty and illiteracy. Indeed, small islands of\nexcellence notwithstanding, the Middle East is in grave\ndanger of being on the wrong side of the digital divide.\nIn his inaugural speech in 1961, the late President\nKennedy invited his generation to join him in a\nstruggle:\n\u201cNow the trumpet summons us again \u2014 not as a\ncall to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a\ncall to battle, though embattled we are \u2014 but a\ncall to bear the burden of a long twilight\nstruggle, ... a struggle against the common\nenemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and\nwar itself.\u201d\nNothing will make us happier than joining hands\nwith our Arab neighbours with dignity and mutuality in\nthis most noble of struggles.\nThe Middle East is not tranquil yet. It is still\nreplete with armed conflicts, political hostilities and\nanimosities. Israel believes that regional arrangements\nare crucial for arms control. A step-by-step approach,\ncommensurate with progress towards comprehensive\npeace, is the right approach.\nWe are concerned by the expanding stockpiles of\nconventional weapons in the region, as well as by\nattempts made by Iran and Iraq to acquire and develop\n12\n\nnon-conventional weapons, and by an increasing\nmissile threat.\nIsrael attaches great importance to the eventual\nestablishment of a zone free of weapons of mass\ndestruction in the region. In order to reach that goal,\ndirect negotiations between all States of the region\nmust be held.\nLast year saw a turnaround in Israel's relations\nwith the United Nations. After years of anomaly, Israel\nwas temporarily admitted to the Western European and\nOther Group (WEOG) in New York. We hope that\nIsrael's admission to the Western Group in\ninternational organizations based outside New York\nwill soon be secured.\nThe United Nations, and indeed most of its\nMember States, played a major role in demanding that\nIran treat fairly the 13 Jews falsely accused, convicted\nand sentenced for ludicrous charges of espionage. It is\nin such instances that the international community has\nthe opportunity to express its discontent and exert\npressure on countries that break the norms of\nbehaviour.\nOn the issue of the reform of the Security\nCouncil, is our opinion that the Security Council\nshould faithfully reflect the present geopolitical\npicture, a picture that has changed beyond recognition\nsince the last enlargement of the Council in 1965. We\nsubscribe to the view that the right of veto \u2014 a safety\nnet against the possible arbitrariness of the General\nAssembly \u2014 should remain in the hands of a limited\nnumber of States.\nAllow me a final reflection on the Israeli-\nPalestinian dilemma.\nThe tragedy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nstemmed from discrepant historical rhythms. The\nhistory of our modern national movement has been\ncharacterized by realistic responses to objective\nhistorical conditions. The Palestinians have\nconsistently fought for the solutions of yesterday \u2014\nthose they had rejected a generation or two earlier. This\npersistent attempt to turn back the clock of history lies\nat the root of many of the misfortunes that have\nbefallen the peoples of the region. Now it is time for all\nof us to overcome dire memories and look forward.\nNeither the physical nor the rhetorical war of images\nwill bring us any closer to peace and reconciliation. No\none has a monopoly on the mythology of suffering and\natrocities. In this tragic dispute we have all committed\nacts of violence that we ought not to be proud of. To\nthe Palestinians we say, we are excited by the prospects\nto overcome the troubled history of our relations in\norder to shape our dreams of peace. Let us then join\nhands in asking the world, which has been watching,\nperplexed at, and sometimes even fuelling our wars, to\nmobilize its resources for the benefit of our peoples.\nAnd, let us be full partners in this international effort to\nlay down the foundations of the Middle East of the\nfuture. The creative energies of our peoples should at\nlong last be put to work in the service of peace, for as\nthe wisest of kings, King Solomon, the builder of the\nTemple in Jerusalem, wrote thousands of years ago,\nthere is:\n\u201cA time for slaying and a time for healing ... a\ntime for war and a time for peace\u201d. (The Holy\nBible, Ecclesiastes 3:3-8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\nconvey the apologies of the Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof Vanuatu, The Honourable Serge Vohor, who is\nunable to be here on this historic occasion due to most\npressing commitments at home. I am therefore very\ndeeply honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of\nthe delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu.\nAt the outset I wish to congratulate Mr. Harri\nHolkeri on his election to this historic session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that\nwith his vast experience and diplomatic skills, he will\nguide this Assembly to a successful conclusion. I\nwould also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto his predecessor, who so ably guided the fifty-fourth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAllow me also to congratulate Tuvalu as the\nnewest Member of our family of nations. As a small\nisland State, and, more significantly, a member of the\nSouth Pacific region, Vanuatu is very pleased to\nwelcome Tuvalu. Vanuatu certainly hopes a further\nincrease in the Pacific island membership would be a\npositive step in the region's economic and political\ndevelopment as we embark on the twenty-first century.\nSmall island States, including Vanuatu, are\ncontinuously confronted by difficult and challenging\nissues, which must be addressed at this summit. For the\nPacific region, its key features are its immense\ngeographic spread, its small land and population base\nand limited natural resources, and its vulnerability to\neconomic and natural shocks, which inevitably have an\nimpact on its physical infrastructure and economic\ndevelopment. Dependence has been on a few fragile\ncommodity markets and fickle tourist income.\nOne of our greatest challenges is education for\nall. The Human Poverty Index of the Pacific Island\n26\n\nCountries shows Vanuatu as the third last of the least\ndeveloped countries. Vanuatu shares the view that the\nkey to development and success is education. As a\nsignatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\nand the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women, Vanuatu is committed\nto this cause. However, limited financial and human\nresources continue to hinder development in this area.\nVanuatu welcomes the initiative taken by the\nSecretary-General, in his address to the Dakar World\nEducation Forum, held in April 2000, to build a global\npartnership for girls' education. Vanuatu will be\npleased to be part of this global initiative. At the same\ntime, Vanuatu fully supports the view that involving\nwomen as central players in development provides\nbenefits in the areas of nutrition, health, and savings\nand reinvestment at the family, community, and,\nultimately, national level. Nevertheless, the challenge\nof ensuring education for all at all levels is an\nambitious objective that will require external\nassistance. The education and training of the\npopulation, including women, must therefore be an\nimportant goal of the Assembly.\nOne of the great obstacles to our economic\ndevelopment, including our foreign investment\nportfolio, has always been the relatively high cost of\npublic utilities, in particular the energy sector, which is\nlargely dependent on traditional oil-based systems. The\ncost of importing oil products and petroleum-derived\ngas is currently about 90 per cent of our combined\ndomestic exports. Our economy cannot afford this\ntrend in the long run.\nWe believe that with access to the new and\nrelevant technology available in the developed\ncountries today, the Republic of Vanuatu and other\nsmall island nations can develop integrated renewable\nenergy systems and hydrogen fuels if our potential\nwind- and sun-related and geothermal and\nhydroelectricity resources can be fully utilized.\nAccess to financial and technical resources from\nthe developed countries can assist countries like the\nRepublic of Vanuatu in moving in the right direction\nand thereby positively contribute to our common\nobjective of creating a healthier and more environment-\nfriendly economic development.\nThe emergence of new information technology\ntoday underlines the strong linkage between the\nconcepts of knowledge and power. While\ncommunications and business transactions through the\nInternet and other modern electronic means have now\nbecome routine within the circles of the rich and the\npowerful, the large majority of the world's population,\nwhich lives in the poor developing countries, has very\nlittle or no knowledge about \u2014 let alone any access\nto \u2014 this new and revolutionary way of doing day-to-\nday business.\nIn this new millennium, the new information\ntechnology must be made accessible and affordable to\nthe people living in the most remote areas of the\ndeveloping nations in order to facilitate their access to\nbetter education, better health services and give them\ngreater access to world markets and business\nopportunities. This is a great challenge, but one that we\nmust face together, and proudly. That is why we have\nthe United Nations.\nLast month the national Parliament of Vanuatu\npassed two laws in this area \u2014 the Electronic\nTransactions Act and the E-Business Act. We hope\nthat, through the support of relevant United Nations\nagencies and bilateral development partners, we will be\nable to fully implement these new laws for the benefit\nof our small island nation and its people, in particular\nin the rural and remote areas.\nIn his statement to the Millennium Summit, my\nPrime Minister highlighted the need for the\nindustrialized countries immediately to ratify\ninternational treaties on the protection and sustainable\nmanagement of our natural environment and resources,\nwhich are vital to the very survival of millions of\ncitizens of small island States. Environmental\ndegradation poses a serious threat to the small island\nStates, which are threatened by the rising sea level. We\ncontinue to urge countries to adopt and ratify the Kyoto\nProtocol as soon as possible. As a signatory to the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, Vanuatu is\nin the process of adding its signature to the Protocol.\nWe cannot let this opportunity pass without\nexpressing our serious concern about the great\ndifficulties a least developed country such as the\nRepublic of Vanuatu is facing with regard to its\napplication to join the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), because some powerful countries, in particular\nthe United States of America, refuse to recognize our\nconstant call for special consideration. Vanuatu has\nbeen in the complex process of accession for five and a\nhalf years. The negotiations we were engaged in until\n27\n\nlast October with a number of major bilateral and\nmultilateral players, such as the European Union,\nJapan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and\nSwitzerland, have been completed in a spirit of\nunderstanding and appreciation of Vanuatu's\ncircumstances.\nThe United States continues to place heavy and\nunreasonable demands on us, which we cannot accept.\nWe consider those demands absurd, because the United\nStates is among our least significant trading partners.\nWe believe that Vanuatu has become the innocent\nvictim of global trade disputes between the big players.\nWhile we have always supported the principle of\nfree international trade, we expect the new regime to be\nmore realistic and more flexible, to allow ample time\nfor the small and least developed countries to adjust to\nthe new rules. After all, the WTO cannot be considered\nas a truly global trade regime without the adhesion of\nall independent countries, including small island\nStates.\nIt is no secret, as the Vanuatu Prime Minister\nclearly stated at the recent G-77 Summit in Havana,\nthat the conditions being imposed on us for joining the\nWTO are simply beyond our capacity to consider in the\nshort to medium term. Unless the powerful countries\nreview their positions and conditions with regard to our\napplication, then the Republic of Vanuatu will have no\nother choice but to reconsider its original application to\njoin the WTO.\nOn a related issue, we would also like to take this\nopportunity to register our most sincere recognition to\nall the Governments in the Pacific and other regions for\ntheir consistent support for Vanuatu's status as a least\ndeveloped country. We continue to maintain our strong\nbelief that the United Nations criteria for assessing\nleast developed country status must be fully reviewed\nand must take into account new indices, such as the\nEnvironmental Vulnerability Index, and the long-term\nimpacts of such natural disasters as cyclones, tsunamis\nand others on countries' social and economic\nadvancement.\nEnhancing the role of the peacekeeping forces of\nthe United Nations must also be a priority for this\nAssembly. It is in this spirit that Vanuatu commends\nthe Brahimi report on peacekeeping, believing that,\nonce implemented, it will allow the United Nations to\ncarry out its peacekeeping operations effectively. At\nthis juncture, I am proud to say that, in spite of our\nmeagre resources, Vanuatu is participating, for the first\ntime in its 20-year history as an independent nation, in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in East Timor\nand Bosnia. Prior to this attainment, Vanuatu also\nserved in some regional peace-monitoring missions.\nIn his statement to the Millennium Summit, the\nPrime Minister of Vanuatu touched on an important\nissue: the principle of self-determination and the\nrelated question of West Papua. The case of West\nPapua has always been high on Vanuatu's agenda. In\n1984, the late Prime Minister and father of our\nindependence, Walter Hadye Lini, said:\n\u201cWe may not have the resources to support\ntheir struggle, but we can remember them in our\neveryday prayers. For when we talk about their\nstruggle, we must always use the name that was\nvery dear to them: West Papua.\u201d\nThe United Nations must be consistent in its\ndecisions concerning the recognition and respect of the\nfundamental right to self-determination of the people\nof West Papua. The truth surrounding the so-called act\nof free choice must be exposed to the Melanesian\nsisters and brothers of West Papua and to the rest of the\ninternational community. Saddest of all was General\nAssembly resolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969 on West\nPapua. How can the United Nations continue to ignore\nthe cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?\nThis year marks the end of the International\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It is only\nappropriate that the United Nations should reconsider\nand revisit the decisions taken at that time. Following\nthe tragedy in East Timor, Vanuatu believes that it is\nnot too late for the international community to act to\nhalt a similar tragedy in West Papua. In this context,\nVanuatu would like to strongly request that the issue of\nWest Papua be placed for discussion on the agenda of\nthe Committee of 24. Any move to oppose this will\nmost certainly undermine the credibility of the United\nNations and its decisions on this special case. Over the\npast few decades, the United Nations has positively\ncontributed to the process of decolonization. We must\nnot allow this opportunity to pass.\nOn the question of reform, we agree that any\nreforms should include the Security Council in order to\nmake it more democratic and transparent. The\nmembership of the Security Council should be enlarged\nnot only to enhance geographic representation, but also\nin response to the aspirations felt at all levels of the\n28\n\nworld community and to the voice of the least\ndeveloped countries and small island States.\nVanuatu would like to congratulate all those\ncountries that recognize the need for a proper\nevaluation and assessment of the crisis situations in Fiji\nand the Solomon Islands prior to taking punitive\nmeasures, if any. We in the Republic of Vanuatu\nbelieve that traditional economic and other forms of\nsanctions against individual countries in times of crisis\nshould be fully reviewed in this new millennium. In\nthis respect, the delegation of Vanuatu would like to\nexpress its sincere appreciation to Sir John Kaputin,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea,\nwho so ably led the Pacific ministerial mission of the\nAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States to Fiji and\nthe Solomon Islands in order to carefully assess the\nsituation in the two countries. The mission was also\ncomprised of the Foreign Minister of the Cook Islands,\nMr. Robert Woonton; the Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof Vanuatu; and the Minister of Education of Samoa,\nMs. Fiame Naomi Mata'afa.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\ncommend Mr. Laisenia Qarase, Prime Minister and\nMinister for National Reconciliation and Unity in the\nInterim Administration of the Republic of the Fiji\nIslands, for his eloquent statement on the situation in\nFiji. We would also like to extend our appreciation to\nMr. Danny Philip, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nSolomon Islands, for his comprehensive statement.\nWe have made visionary statements. Now is the\ntime for us to translate these into action. We have\ncalled for a more efficient, responsive and effective\nUnited Nations. We must muster the good will to\nresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration and\nto rededicate ourselves to upholding the fundamental\nprinciples of the United Nations. Let us not lose sight\nof these goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We pledge our full\nsupport and our assistance in the work ahead. Permit\nme also to pay tribute to the work of your predecessor,\nwho took us through a challenging fifty-fourth session.\nAs the new Foreign Minister of Saint Kitts and\nNevis, I am deeply honoured to be addressing the\nAssembly at this historic moment of increasing\nexpectations at the national level. At the same time, we\nsalute the dawn of this millennium with consternation\nin the face of the unprecedented challenges that\nconfront us.\nThe United Nations has matured in the past five\ndecades, but we recognize that this is an institution\nwhere maturity cannot be measured in days or decades.\nThe maturity of which I speak should be measured by\nthe quality of our commitment and the depth of our\nvision.\nThe phenomenon of globalization has been\ncharacterized by growth in the level of trade, increased\nflows of capital, and advanced technology. Although\nwe do not question this reality, we are cognizant of the\ninherent challenges and inequalities of globalization\nresulting from our varied levels of development. Small\nisland developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis\nhave yet to access a significant share of the vaunted\nbenefits that globalization has brought in its wake. We\ncontinue to bear a disproportionate share of its costs\nwhile experiencing continuous marginalization due to\nour small size and to the volatility of financial flows.\nWe urge the United Nations to influence\ndeveloped countries to improve market conditions for\nexports from small developing States, which are\n2\n\nespecially vulnerable. We are inclined to ask the\npertinent question: Why is globalization, with all its\ninherent benefits, not improving the lot of the poor\namong us?\nIt is evident that globalization is creating new\nscenarios on our landscape; as these new situations\nemerge, we must develop new strategies to remain\nrelevant. What is critical, therefore, is the need for\nincreased cooperation among Member States in our\nefforts to secure our various interests.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would like to stress the\nimperative of giving the United Nations the political\nimpetus necessary to address the inequalities\ncharacterizing inter-State relations. This Organization,\nwith its tradition of democracy, should resolve the\nanomalies created by globalization. We welcome the\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General intended to\nensure that this multifaceted phenomenon will work to\nthe advantage of small island developing States. We\nintend to persevere in our efforts to adopt the requisite\nmacroeconomic policies. However, effective\ngovernance and cooperation at the global level must\ncomplement our democratic will and our political will\nat the national level.\nWe should commit ourselves to strengthening the\nUnited Nations as the multilateral institution which\nprovides a forum of inclusion. We shall also persist in\nour efforts to ensure the development of mechanisms\nand modalities to make possible equitable results. In\nparticular, we urge the use of a vulnerability index to\nbe factored into any assessment of small island States\nby the United Nations and by international\ndevelopment and financial institutions.\nAs for globalization and governance, Saint Kitts\nand Nevis is concerned by the recent action taken by\nthe financial action task force of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\ncountries, which has sought to put pressure on the\nalready weakened economies of several Caribbean\nStates, including Saint Kitts and Nevis. In recent times,\nmany of us, in our efforts to diversify our economies,\nhave undertaken to build a strong financial service\nsector. But sadly, as I speak, my people find\nthemselves, along with the collective populations of\nfour other Caribbean neighbours, assaulted through\nnegative advisories.\nWe urge the United Nations, through the\nSecretary-General, to impress upon OECD countries\nthat unilateral attempts to effect multilateral solutions\nin their own self-interest weaken the democratic fibre\nof international relations. We urge, therefore, that any\ndiscussion on the development strategies of countries\nlarge or small must be raised to the level of inclusive\ndiscussions or multilateral forums.\nWe would like to emphasize that there is no harm\nin a competitive, well regulated, supervised financial\nservice sector. However, a unilateral challenge to the\nsovereign rights of States to implement legal tax\nregimes is an unwarranted attack on the integrity of\nthose States. We believe that the development of the\nfinancial services sector holds valuable opportunities\nfor small developing countries. We understand also the\nneed for due diligence and for appropriate checks and\nbalances to frustrate and deter money laundering.\nThe coupling of the financial services sector and\nmoney laundering without distinguishing between the\ntwo does grave injustice to a legitimate economic\nenterprise. Saint Kitts and Nevis is committed to\nensuring that no individual or entity abuses our\nfinancial services sector for illicit purposes. To that\nend, we have enacted legislation and have established a\nfinancial intelligence unit. We will be vigilant and will\ncontinue to take the necessary steps to keep this sector\nfree from abuse. Members can thus see that we are\naware of the difference, and that we are committed to\nensuring that our jurisdiction complies with\ninternational standards.\nThe convening earlier this year of the special\nsession on the World Summit for Social Development\nallowed us to focus attention on the human face of\npoverty, which is overlooked by globalization. While\nwe, as developing countries, continue to adopt a\nproactive approach to our social development agenda,\nthe United Nations, through its specialized agencies,\nshould continue to support national poverty reduction\nprogrammes so as to promote favourable economic and\nfinancial opportunities for all young people.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, therefore, regards as\ncritical the meeting on financing for development,\nscheduled for the year 2001. We hope that it will\nprovide the appropriate opportunity to adopt measures\nto strengthen the international financial system; this\ncould ensure long-term access to resources and\ntechnical assistance.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral's initiative for the establishment of a disaster\n3\n\nresponse programme that would complement the\nresilience of our people to contribute to effective and\ntimely reconstruction efforts. However, the impact\nfrom man-made disasters is even more devastating. The\nfrequent passage through our waters of shipments of\ntoxic and hazardous waste poses a serious threat to our\nfragile ecosystems. We urge the United Nations to\nassume a greater role in mobilizing support within the\ninternational community to implement this policy. We\nhave to take action to avert the threat of pollution from\nship-generated waste, as well as accidental release of\nhazardous and noxious substances.\nWe regard the progress achieved in promoting\nwomen in development as vital to the global agenda of\nhuman rights. Hence, St. Kitts and Nevis welcomed the\nconvening this year of the special session on the status\nof women, which allowed Member States to review and\nassess the progress made since the Beijing Declaration\nand Plan of Action.\nMy Government is currently implementing a new\ngender management system and has introduced\nmeasures to ensure that the national budget and\ndevelopment programmes are more gender sensitive.\nWe are committed to strengthening and promoting the\nmainstreaming of a gender perspective at all levels.\nThere has been much debate about the critical\nrole of information technology in bridging the global\ndigital divide. We welcome the Secretary-General's\nproposal for a United Nations Information Technology\nService, which could go a long way towards our efforts\nto sustain our future through capacity-building.\nIn the Group of 77 Summit convened earlier this\nyear, the developing countries committed to\nstrengthening South-South cooperation through the\ntransfer of knowledge and technology. St. Kitts and\nNevis intends to forge ahead on the information super-\nhighway. My Government has embarked on a\nprogramme to make each child in St. Kitts and Nevis\ncomputer literate by the year 2005. We encourage\ndeveloped countries to use the availability of\nappropriate technologies, not only to generate wealth\nfor themselves but also to advance the economic and\nsocial well being of the citizens of the world. In the\nwords of Dr. Martin Luther King,\n\u201cThrough our scientific genius we have made the\nworld a neighbourhood; now, through our moral\nand spiritual development, we must make it a\nbrotherhood\u201d.\nThe plethora of issues on the United Nations\nagenda is complex and involved. Indeed, these\nchallenges sometimes even exceed the capacity of\nindividual States. Therefore, we need to harness the\ncollaborative energies of States and non-State actors to\ncope with the fundamental changes in the world. This\nOrganization should be guided by the foresight of\nPresident Truman who, in reference to the Charter,\nstated,\n\u201cThe Charter will be expanded and improved as\ntime goes on. Changing world conditions will\nrequire readjustments\u201d.\nChange is the only constant. St. Kitts and Nevis\nencourages Member States to recognize the importance\nof change as we embrace the true concept of\ndemocracy within the Security Council. The\nundemocratic structure and lack of fairness within the\nSecurity Council threaten to undermine Member\nStates' commitment and trust in the Organization.\nEven as we forge ahead into a new millennium,\nwe still are witnessing some of the most gruesome\nforms of man's inhumanity. War and other inter-State\nconflict still litter the landscape of many societies\nthroughout the world. We must continue to support\npeacekeeping operations to ensure that the rhetoric of\nviolence is silenced. The concepts of peace-making and\npeacekeeping must also be complemented by the\nimperatives of development. Once we have established\npeace, we must also lay the foundation to support\nlasting peace.\nWe welcome and congratulate the State of\nTuvalu, admitted at the opening of this fifty-fifth\nregular session. As a vulnerable small island Caribbean\ndeveloping State, St. Kitts and Nevis is pleased to\nwelcome another vulnerable small State from the\nPacific, convinced that it is seized of its obligations to\nuphold the principles of the Charter.\nIn addition, St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates its call\nfor discussion of the Chinese people on Taiwan. Again,\nwe  emphasize that our policy seeks to promote respect\nfor the sovereignty of States. However, as we reflect on\nthe mission of this institution, we deem it appropriate\nto consider the invaluable contribution of the 23\nmillion Chinese people on Taiwan who can add great\nsubstance to international discourse.\nThis Millennium Assembly affords us the\nopportunity to reflect on the Secretary-General's\n4\n\nreport, which focuses on the world's people and the\nUnited Nations role in ensuring their well-being.\nWe welcome the importance attributed to peace\nand security on the agenda of the United Nations and\nwelcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as the\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. We further\napplaud the decision to declare the decade beginning in\n2001 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace\nand Non-violence for the Children of the World. Our\nchildren are our future; the new millennium belongs to\nthem. It behooves us to dissipate the ominous clouds\non the horizon of their dreams so they can awaken to a\nworld free of fear.\nThe experts contend that there is an obvious\ncorrelation between the persistence of poverty and poor\nhealth.\nThe statistical reports on HIV/AIDS paint a\nsinister picture. Saint Kitts and Nevis is disturbed by\nthe rapid increase in the number of persons infected\nwith the HIV/AIDS virus and its economic and social\nconsequences for growth in developing countries. This\ndisease does not recognize national boundaries and\nthreatens to undermine future economic and social\ndevelopment in many of our nations. We look forward\nto a United Nations special session on HIV/AIDS to\nintensify and better coordinate our approaches at the\ninternational level.\nDespite all its shortcomings, the United Nations\nhas a critical role to play in the international system.\nWithout the United Nations, many small States like\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would lose a champion of\ncollective interests. That is unacceptable. One of the\nmost valuable gifts to humanity in the last millennium\nhas been the United Nations. We must therefore\ncommit ourselves to preserving it."

        "file_text": "We are\nliving at a decisive moment in the history of\nhumankind. More than half a century after the creation\nof the United Nations, on the threshold of a new\nmillennium that was supposed to herald an era of peace\namong men, solidarity among nations and greater well-\nbeing for the poorest people, we are confronted instead\nby the most serious and complex economic, social,\npolitical and environmental crisis in the history of the\nhuman race.\nThe expectations of peace, stability and\ncooperation that the end of the cold war triggered\nthroughout the world are far from becoming a reality.\nThe emergence of a unipolar world in which a single\nsuper-Power is capable of militarily controlling the\ninternational scene, far from meaning greater security\nfor our peoples, has ushered in a new stage in which\nthe hegemonism of that sole super-Power prevails \u2014\ndirect or covert interventionism under the guise of\nmultilateral actions, insecurity for the small countries,\nselfishness as a behavioural pattern in international\nrelations and the attempt to disregard the principles of\nequality among States, national sovereignty, self-\ndetermination, non-intervention, the non-threat or the\nuse of force and the settlement of disputes through\npeaceful means \u2014 principles that have constituted the\ncornerstone of the United Nations.\nWe are also living in a world characterized by the\nexploitation and the horrendous destitution of over l.3\nbillion human beings, who, while suffering on a daily\nbasis and without giving up the hope of a better life for\ntheir children, wonder if we will still have sufficient\nreasons to reaffirm faith in the fundamental rights of\nman and in the dignity and value of the human person,\nas proclaimed more than five decades ago by the\nfounders of the United Nations.\nThe attempts at imposing by force and under\npressure the so-called right of humanitarian\nintervention are at present the greatest threat to\ninternational peace and security. We all know that the\nsmall group of developed countries \u2014 led by the\nUnited States and its allies with powerful forces \u2014 that\nattempt to impose this perilous concept in the\ndiscussions and decisions of our Organization, do not\nhave to fear the consequences of recognizing such a\nright in international relations. They are not, as we are,\nthe Euro-Atlantic rim, defined by the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) as the probable scene for\ntheir acts of aggression, and the new strategic doctrine\nof this alliance is not aimed at them, but at us, the poor\ncountries.\nActions geared at fragmenting countries and\nnations, at recolonizing territories and re-establishing\nzones of influence must cease. The recent precedent of\nunleashing deadly wars against defenceless\npopulations, without even consulting the Security\nCouncil, is not only a flagrant violation of the Charter,\nbut it is also once again dragging the world into\nsituations like those that once took over 40 million\nlives in a single war.\nHow many other wars against small, poor\ncountries must be waged before we understand the\nneed to respect the Charter and engage in a deep\ndemocratization process in international relations?\nIs it possible that those who now buttress with\nthreatening language their attempts at interfering in the\ndomestic affairs of other countries have fallen for the\nidea that the serious problems of underdevelopment,\nthe after-effects of colonialism, hunger, disease and the\nconsequences of the constant pillaging of the third\nworld countries \u2014 the real cause of current conflicts \u2014\ncan be resolved through use of smart bombs?\n19\n\nIs it not really paradoxical that Western\nPowers \u2014 while developing new, ever more\nsophisticated killing devices \u2014 intend to prevent poor\ncountries from using conventional light weaponry that\nis essential to nations that, like Cuba, live under the\npermanent threat of military aggression? Enough of\nthis hypocrisy and Pharisaic behaviour. The world will\nbe really safer if total, complete disarmament takes\nplace, including, especially, nuclear disarmament.\nThere has to come a day when light weaponry will be\neliminated, when other types of deadlier and more\ndangerous conventional arms \u2014 the much more\ndangerous and deadlier arms owned by a handful of\ndeveloped countries \u2014 must also be disposed of \u2014 the\nsooner the better. Yes, mines must be eliminated, but\nthe threats of aggression against poor countries must be\neliminated long before that.\nWill our planet, by any chance, be safer if the\nUnited States finally deploys its hallucinating, costly\nanti-missile defence system, through which that\ncountry's rulers deceive their own people by promising\nthem protection against missiles when nobody knows\nreally from where they could be launched?\nWhy does not the United Nations, instead of\ntamely following the hazardous death game with the\nWestern Powers, focus its attention on the so-much\ntrumpeted yet unfulfilled purpose of setting aside a\nportion of the nearly US$ 800 billion, currently used on\nmilitary expenses, to promote development and try to\nsave the victims of the silent war that, year after year,\nthrough disease and starvation, kills more than 11\nmillion third-world children under 5 years of age?\nIn any case, peace will not be possible if there is\nno development for the over one hundred third-world\ncountries that are presently observing, as stone guests,\nthe irresponsible squandering of the wealthy, selfish\nconsumer societies that insatiably eat up our children's\nfuture. Setting out to halve in 15 years the number of\npoor people that we now have is undoubtedly a\nremarkable endeavour, but how will the other half\njudge our goal if they are doomed to live as indigents\nall their lives?\nWhat has become of the right to development that\nwas once so solemnly proclaimed by this very General\nAssembly? Don't you think, dear colleagues, that the\ntime has come for us to calmly and firmly set out to\nrescue the issue of the right to development as a United\nNations priority? Isn't it precisely now \u2014 when nobody\nargues anymore about the resounding failure of the\nneo-liberal policies that the International Monetary\nFund and the World Bank imposed on third-world\ncountries with a fundamentalist stubbornness to the\nbenefit of transnational companies \u2014 that our peoples,\nunited in a great alliance for the most basic rights, must\nseize the opportunity to demand that a more\noutstanding, decisive role in these affairs be played by\nthe United Nations Economic and Social Council and\nthis General Assembly?\nWhy should we continue to allow international\ncooperation to virtually disappear, just now when it is\nmost needed? Are we entitled to continue discussing,\nyear after year, without any concrete outcome, the right\nto development, which our people are demanding,\nwhile we watch, scattered and disoriented, as the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank\ncontinue to strip the Organization of the prerogatives\nbestowed upon it by the Charter? Those who have\nimposed such devastating decisions as those leading to\nthe unbridled privatization of the national resources of\nthird world countries and the indiscriminate\nliberalization of the capital account \u2014 thereby\nfacilitating the outflow of the scarce foreign currencies\nfrom poor countries that, because of expediency or\nfear, have not been able to fight for the rights of their\npeoples \u2014 will be held to account by their children and\nby history.\nThe Millennium Summit, which ended with\npositive results, demonstrated once again that the\ndevastating effects of imposing a neo-liberal model in a\nglobalized world are hitting third world countries\nparticularly hard. The socio-economic situation of such\ncountries \u2014 especially those in Africa \u2014 is virtually\nuntenable. Likewise, it made it clear that unilateralism\nand duress have no place in a world in which solidarity\nand cooperation are the only possible means to achieve\nsalvation for all.\nIn the wake of the Summit, no doubts remain:\nnow is the time to act, to adopt concrete measures in\norder to fight the poverty and underdevelopment\ncurrently afflicting the majority of the people of the\nworld. Cuba, a poor country that nonetheless has a\nlarge store of human capital, has already started to take\naction. Deeds, not words, are what we need today.\nTwo years ago, we put in place a comprehensive\nhealth-care plan under which almost 2,000 Cuban\nhealth workers are rendering services, free of charge, in\n20\n\n16 countries of Central America, the Caribbean and\nsub-Saharan Africa. Now, given the urgent appeal of\nthe African countries, we would like to reiterate the\noffer that President Fidel Castro made to the United\nNations, the World Health Organization and the\ndeveloped countries during the Millennium Summit to\ncooperate with Africa in the fight against AIDS and\nother terrible diseases currently threatening to wipe out\nan entire continent. Cuba is ready to supply up to 3,000\nadditional Cuban doctors and paramedics for such an\nundertaking in sub-Saharan Africa. They would also\ncontribute to the training of African health workers in\nthe field. But it is essential for the industrialized\ncountries to do their share and to supply the necessary\nmedicines and materials for the programme. Africa is\nwaiting for us. Cuba stands ready. It is now up to the\ndeveloped countries.\nDemocracy within countries is a goal that is being\nsought. That is certainly commendable if the diversity\nof cultures, identities, historical experiences, national\nrealities and political models, and the right of each\npeople to adopt, with complete independence, the\nsystem that it deems most appropriate, are properly\nrespected. But is there truly any democracy in\ninternational relations at present? Unfortunately there\nis not.\nIn order to attain it, let us put an end to\nhegemonism, foster development, replace selfishness\nwith cooperation and, finally, respect the purposes and\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. We must put an\nend, right now, to the arrogance of the few if we do not\nwant the hopes for a world of justice and peace for all\nto crumble.\nIn order to attain it, let us ensure that the United\nNations truly contributes to building solidarity among\nnations and not to the domination of a few over the\noverwhelming majority. Let us face up to the attempt\nof some to put pressure on the United Nations through\nthe non-payment of agreed contributions. Let us reject\nthe use of the United Nations to impose a new colonial\norder. Let us demand that the Security Council act as\nthe representative of all, not as the servant of one. Let\nus prevent it from arrogating to itself powers that it\ndoes not have, thereby violating the United Nations\nCharter and operating without due transparency while\nit decides upon matters of life or death.\nDemocratizing the United Nations and its\nSecurity Council requires, as indispensable measures,\nthe abolition of the vexing and anachronistic veto\nprivilege; an increase in the number of Council\nmembers in proportion to the fourfold increase in the\nnumber of States Members of the Organization; the\napplication of the principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation to the composition of that body, as with\nall others; and the fulfilment of its obligation, as\nenshrined in the Charter but ignored in practice, of\nreporting to the General Assembly.\nLet us be realistic. Security Council reform is \u2014 I\nwill not mince words \u2014 as far away today as it ever\nwas. We should recognize that after seven years of\nfruitless efforts we have managed to agree only that it\nis necessary to increase the number of members of the\nCouncil. At this point, therefore, we believe that we\nshould at least work to effect a proportional increase in\nthe total number of Council members, both permanent\nand non-permanent, ensuring adequate representation\nfor third world countries, as strongly reiterated by the\nMillennium Summit. How could the Security Council\nbe expanded without the inclusion of a reasonable\nnumber of permanent members from the third world?\nForty years ago, on behalf of Cuba, the leader of\na triumphant revolution proclaimed from this very\nrostrum the dreams of hope and social justice for which\nthe Cuban people had struggled for almost a century.\nMost of the States now represented in this Assembly\nwere colonies at that time. There was no talk then \u2014 as\nthere is today \u2014 about saving Africa, while it was\nbeing ruthlessly pillaged. The time had not yet arrived\nwhen hundreds of thousands of Cubans would go to\nAfrican lands to struggle for the real rights of its\npeople, against apartheid, disease and illiteracy.\nThat was the moment when the United States\nGovernment set out to overthrow the Cuban revolution,\nwhich, committed to social justice and true\nindependence for its people, threatened, through its\nethics, its morality and its example, the secular\ndomination that the United States had exercised over\nthe entire western hemisphere. That was the moment\nwhen the economic, trade and financial blockade was\nimplemented against Cuba \u2014 a blockade that, in the\ncourse of a harsh 40-year-old economic war, has\nengendered such shameful pieces of legislation as the\nTorricelli and Helms-Burton Acts. It has to do with the\nblockade that this very General Assembly has rejected\nfor eight consecutive years and which is still in force\ndespite worldwide rejection and the obvious\ndisapproval of the people of the United States.\n21\n\nIn these four decades, our people have resisted\nacts ranging from political pressures and attempts at\ndiplomatic isolation to the most insidious lying\ncampaigns, from subversion and terrorism to\nassassination attempts on its main leaders, from\nbiological warfare to the most ruthless blockade and\neconomic war and from the promotion of armed bands\nto military invasion and the threat of nuclear\nextermination. Today, on behalf of that same generous\nand courageous people, we can once again say to our\nthird world brothers and to all those who anywhere in\nthe world defend our right to life and development that\nrevolutionary socialist Cuba will never cease to\nstruggle for everyone's dreams.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his\nunanimous election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I am confident that,\nunder his able and wise guidance, this session will\nsuccessfully accomplish its tasks.\nI would also like to express appreciation and\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\nNamibia, for the effectiveness with which he directed\nthe work of the last session.\nI also take this opportunity to extend\ncongratulations to the Republic of Tuvalu on becoming\nthe latest Member of the United Nations.\nWe shall not forget to express our thanks and\nappreciation to our Secretary-General, not only for his\ntireless efforts to ensure respect for the values,\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,\nbut also for his far-sighted and thought-provoking\nmillennium report.\nThe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly is\nmeeting in the wake of the Millennium Summit, whose\nDeclaration embodies three fundamental messages.\nFirst, it reaffirms that the ideals and goals of the United\nNations are still sacred to humanity and that the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nare as valid today as they were in the past. Secondly, it\nreminds us that the lofty principles enshrined in the\nUnited Nations Charter require us to continuously\nstrengthen the United Nations and to make the\nnecessary adjustments and changes to enable it to meet\nthe challenges of justice, peace and security, poverty\nand disease, socio-economic development, the\ninequities of the global economy and the protection of\nthe environment. Thirdly, respect for the ideals and\nobservance of the purposes and principles of the United\nNations remain the essential keys to the creation of a\npeaceful, prosperous and humane new world order. To\nthis end, the Declaration enjoins us to be loyal to these\ncommon ideals, goals, values and principles. It reminds\nus that each State has a responsibility to act not only by\nitself, but also within a regional system, to give the\nloyalty that is due to these values, goals, purposes and\nprinciples.\nIn this connection, I wish to join others before me\nwho have reminded us of the urgent need to reform the\nUnited Nations, including in particular the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly, with a view to\nenabling the Organization to reflect the realities of the\ntimes and to empower it to meet effectively and\nefficiently the challenges of the day and the future.\nI wish to reaffirm the commitment of the people\nand the Government of the State of Eritrea to the noble\nideals and values, as well as the purposes and\n18\n\nprinciples, of the United Nations. Having made\nsupreme sacrifices and paid dearly, during a 30-year\nstruggle for independence and membership in the\ninternational community, Eritreans appreciate how\nessential the United Nations and its Charter are to their\nwell-being and prosperity. Having fully experienced\nthe horrors of a long war and the benefits of a short\npeace, they recognize the need for the peaceful and just\nsettlement of disputes and for cooperation for mutual\nbenefit in the long human struggle to create an\ninternational order based on justice and equality.\nTo this end, Eritrean foreign policy has been\npremised on the assumption that the threat or use of\nforce can never be an instrument of foreign policy, and\nthat even in a clear case self-defence it must be used\nonly after all available methods of peacefully resolving\ndisputes have been exhausted \u2014 and then only with\nextreme caution.\nIt is for this reason \u2014 and because Eritrea has\nsuffered from the non-application by the United\nNations itself of the principles of its own Charter and\nthe decisions of the General Assembly \u2014 that, upon\nindependence, Eritrea decided to make the ideals,\nvalues, purposes and principles of the United Nations\nCharter the cornerstone of its foreign policy. By its\nmembership, it had also hoped to play an active role in\npromoting the principle of the universality of\nmembership in the United Nations and in promoting\nthe achievement of fair and equitable regional and\ninternational orders.\nEritrea is also fully aware of its responsibilities as\na littoral State of a strategic international thoroughfare\nand has committed itself to contributing its share to the\nstability and security of the region, as well as to the\ncreation of a zone of peace and cooperation in the\nregion. To this end, it has made every effort to foster an\natmosphere that will enhance cooperation among the\nlittoral States of both sides of the Red Sea and promote\ndevelopment and mutual prosperity. It has also played a\nmajor role in the transformation of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nfrom a simple natural disaster-control mechanism to a\nvibrant regional organization which will promote peace\nand cooperation among its member States, as well as\nadvance economic and social cooperation for\ndevelopment. The recent meeting of the ever-\nexpanding Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, in\nAsmara, our capital, is a testimony to Eritrea's\ncommitment to the consolidation of the unity of and the\nbroadening and deepening of cooperative relations\nbetween African countries. This commitment will for\never be firm.\nIn spite of its victimization, Eritrea had decided\nto forget the past and to start with a clean slate as it\nevolved a vision, and set its priorities, for the future. It\nestablished good relations with all its neighbours on\nthe basis of the United Nations and Organization of\nAfrican Unity Charters and the principle of good-\nneighbourliness. It assumed that there would not be any\nterritorial disputes with its neighbours, since its\ncolonial borders were clearly defined and recognized\nand had been accepted at independence by all its\nneighbours. It had no reason to assume that its\nindependence would be threatened by any State, near\nor far, any more than it had any reason to assume that it\nhad the right to use force to expand at the expense of\nits neighbours. Its sole ambition as a new member of\nthe international community was to make up for lost\ntime in development.\nIn spite of all its commitments and goodwill,\nhowever, Eritrea has, during its brief seven years of\nformal independence, been tested by and had to defend\nitself against political pressures, threats and actual\nattempts which endangered not only its sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity, but also its hard-won\nindependence. True, Eritrea may not be the only new\ncountry in history that has been so tested. Yet it must\nbe the only Member of the United Nations whose\nterritorial integrity \u2014 indeed, its very existence as a\nsovereign, independent State \u2014 has been threatened\nand is still being threatened at the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt goes without saying that this struggle to\npreserve its independence has been detrimental to the\nnation-building and development efforts of the new\nState. Yet throughout this time, Eritrea has never\nwavered in its commitment to the peaceful resolution\nof the disputes. Indeed, it has solved two of its\nproblems peacefully on a bilateral basis and a third\nthrough international arbitration.\nIt was perhaps during the last two years that\nEritrea's independence, sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity were most severely tested. What was labelled\na border dispute proved to be a serious attempt to\nreverse history and to recolonize Eritrea \u2014 or, failing\nthat, to truncate it, to Finlandize it, and to turn it into a\nsatellite State. This attempt was thwarted by the united\n19\n\neffort of Eritreans at home and abroad. However, the\nattempt exacted its cost: the systematic and wilful\ndestruction of much of the economic and social\ninfrastructure of the country and the deliberate, brutal\nviolation of the human rights of Eritreans, including\nthe terrorizing and brutalizing of the population in the\noccupied territories.\nEritrea is convinced that there is no alternative to\nthe solution of conflicts by peaceful means and on the\nbasis of the Charters of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the existing\nprinciples of international law.\nFrom the beginning of the conflict, Eritrea has\nrepeatedly declared that war can never be an option to\nresolve conflicts, that neither of the parties can settle\nthe conflict by imposing its will and creating facts on\nthe ground and then hope to achieve durable and\nmeaningful peace. It is a clear manifestation of its\ncommitment to peace and the rule of law that Eritrea\nstill remains committed to a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict, notwithstanding the occupation of large tracts\nof its territory, the displacement of hundreds of\nthousands of its people, the continued brutalization and\nterrorization of the people in occupied territory and the\nfeverish war preparations for yet another attempt\nagainst its territorial integrity. It has already taken bold\nmeasures, shown flexibility and made important\nconcessions, however unpalatable they may have been,\nin the hope of achieving a just peace and in spite of the\nattempts that are being made to destroy the OAU peace\nproposals. Again, Eritrea pledges that it will continue\nto do its utmost to reach a comprehensive and\nconclusive agreement peacefully.\nYet, the fate of peace hinges on three critical\nfactors. First, the search for peace is a shared\nresponsibility. It cannot be left to only one of the\nparties. Secondly, peace can be made certain only when\nit is anchored on the values, ideals and principles of the\nCharter, which have been emphatically reconfirmed by\nthe Millennium Declaration. Among these is respect for\nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof States. Thirdly, peace can be achieved only with the\nfaithful implementation of agreements accepted by\nparties to a conflict. We invite all concerned to join\nEritrea in extending full cooperation to the OAU\nFacilitators, in making a genuine and unequivocal\ncommitment to the OAU peace process and in being\nfaithful to the letter and spirit of the provisions of the\nOAU peace documents, in particular the Framework\nAgreement and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.\nAt this juncture, I wish to seize this opportunity\nto renew our appreciation and gratitude to His\nExcellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika for his\nunwavering commitment to the peaceful resolution of\nthe conflict, and to his personal envoy, His Excellency\nAhmed Ouyahia, for the wisdom and skill with which\nhe led the indirect talks. We also extend our\nappreciation to the international community, including\nthe Government of the United States of America and\nthe European Union, as well as other African\ngovernments, for their tireless efforts towards the\nachievement of a peaceful resolution and for the\npositive contribution they made to ensure the signing\nof the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in\nAlgiers on 18 June 2000. We request them to persist in\ntheir noble endeavour until a genuine and just peace is\nreally achieved.\nFinally, the Government of the State of Eritrea\nnotes with great appreciation the effort that has been\nexerted, and the commitments made, by the United\nNations to ensure an early, comprehensive settlement\nof the conflict. In this connection, I wish to draw the\nattention of the Security Council to the urgent necessity\nof deploying the peacekeeping force authorized by its\nresolution 1320 (2000) as quickly as possible in order\nto forestall any avoidable obstacles that may threaten,\nor even destroy, the gains that have been achieved at\ngreat cost and much effort by so many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I am\nparticularly pleased to extend, through you, Mr. Acting\nPresident, my warmest congratulations on the occasion\nof the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri as President of the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations. May I also convey my congratulations\nto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of the fifty-fourth\nsession, for his eminent leadership and successful\nsteering of the work of that session. Equal\ncongratulations go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nfor his admirable and untiring efforts made on behalf of\npeace and development in the world. I would also like\nto take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu into the\nOrganization and to convey the sincere congratulations\nof the Cambodian delegation. Tuvalu's presence among\nus will add a new credit to our Organization.\nThe political platform for economic development,\nlaunched by the Royal Government of Cambodia since\nits formation in 1998, after many decades of civil war\nand tragedy, and in spite of enormous difficulties and\nobstacles, has scored good results with regular growth,\nthus paving the way for a solid foundation for long-\nterm economic growth and sustainable development in\nCambodia.\nThe achievements of 1999, and of the first six\nmonths of this year, are encouraging for the future of\nCambodia. The Kingdom of Cambodia, with its\nprofound belief that the value of democracy and human\nrights should be in harmony with cultural peculiarities,\ntraditions, and level of development, considers human\nrights to be one of the foundations of the system of\ngovernment. The Royal Government of Cambodia, at\npresent, is making great efforts towards the\nreinforcement of democratic pluralism and the rule of\nlaw.\nThe recently held Millennium Summit on the role\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century has,\nthrough its Millennium Declaration, defined great\nguidelines on this universal institution's policies and\nreforms, designed to overcome problems facing our\nplanet in the third millennium. The shared reflection of\nour leaders is testimony to the aspirations of all peoples\nthroughout the world for a more equitable international\nenvironment in the face of rapid globalization and its\neffects on the economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment of all nations.\nOn the question of the Security Council, the\nRoyal Government of Cambodia believes, as do many\nMember States, that it is very important for the\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of today's world.\nThis can be achieved by expanding the permanent and\nnon-permanent membership of the Council to the\ndeveloping countries and to those countries that have\nconcretely contributed to sharing the burden of United\nNations operations. Only through overall reform and\nenlargement will the Security Council be able to\nmaintain its effectiveness and legitimacy in this new\nmillennium. In this regard, Cambodia strongly supports\nJapan's and India's permanent membership in this core\nbody of the United Nations.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia observes with great\ninterest the situation in the Middle East. We urge both\nsides to make greater efforts in order to achieve lasting\npeace in this suffering region. The Kingdom of\nCambodia reaffirms its total support for a fair,\nequitable, durable, and global settlement based on the\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and on the\napplication of the agreed-upon peace accords, so that\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people will be\nrecognized by all.\nIn spite of the consequences of the financial crisis\nin 1997 and 1998, Asia is on the road to recovery and\nAsia's economic growth has ever since been recorded.\nThe thirty-third Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting held this past\nJuly in Bangkok bears witness once more to the\nexemplary solidarity between member States to\nintegrate their economies and to further advance their\nmultiform cooperation.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is very pleased with\nthe inter-Korean summit meeting in Pyongyang last\nJune, which we consider as an important landmark in\nthe relationship between the two brotherly nations, and\nwhich has enormously contributed to the maintenance\nof peace and stability in its region as well as in the\nwhole world and to the peaceful reunification of Korea.\n(spoke in French)\n25\n\nWe are witnessing, today, the growing\nphenomenon of globalization. There are no States that\ncan avoid its immense impact on our daily life.\nHowever, the process of globalization is not a\nsufficient answer to the quest of the developing\ncountries to reach progress and development for better\nliving conditions of their people. It is clear that the\nimpact of globalization benefits, primarily, States\nhaving strong economies and advanced technology,\nwhile leaving the least developed countries with little,\nif any, means to cope with such reality.\nThe developing countries, especially the least\ndeveloped countries, that cannot catch up with\nglobalization's speed will be left behind. The rich\ncountries will get richer and more developed, and the\npoor countries will get poorer and poorer.\nTherefore, the Royal Government of Cambodia\ncalls all Member States of the United Nations to unite\ntheir efforts and resources to make sure that the\nbenefits of globalization are expanded more equally\namong the international community and to maximize\nthe positive impact of this phenomenon in order to\nenable the least developed countries to follow the trend\nof globalization.\nAnother aspect of finance for development is the\ncrushing burden of debt that weighs on the developing\ncountries. Debt places a heavy burden on the\ndevelopment process of many developing countries.\nUnfortunately, the debt strategies that have been\nimplemented so far have not proved capable of solving\nthis problem.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia appreciates\nthe initiative taken by some nations in agreeing to\nsolve the intolerable debt burden of the least developed\ncountries. However, the results are currently far from\nbeing sufficient. That is why we appeal for these\ninitiatives to be adopted by some other members of the\ninternational community, enabling more poor countries\nto benefit from these human and just actions.\nCambodia sincerely hopes that the Millennium\nSummit, which has just successfully concluded, will\nbring about the imperative reform of the United\nNations. The reform of this important world body will\npositively respond to the reality of the world today, and\nwould be able, I hope, to establish a new mechanism to\nsave the developing countries from becoming victims\nof globalization, even as other countries derive greater\nand greater benefit.\nIn this context, as the United Nations has been\ncalled upon by the Millennium Summit to play a more\ndecisive role in ensuring that the development of\nnations is more equitable, it is necessary that this world\ninstitution possess the means to support its actions.\nAlso, it is an imperative requirement to establish a new\nmechanism of relations between the United Nations\nand the international financial institution.\n Moreover, it is necessary to have a new order of\ninternational relations in view of the rapid phenomenon\nof globalization, so as to reduce the ever-increasing\nunjust gap between the rich and poor countries. I am\nconvinced that this is not a matter of generosity, but a\nmatter of human security, as well as the security of the\nentire international community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\nassociate myself with previous speakers in\ncongratulating Mr. Holkeri on his election to preside\nover the General Assembly at this historic session. It is\na tribute to his distinguished political experience and to\nthe invaluable contributions made by his country,\nFinland, to the work of our Organization.\nI should also like to extend my appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign\nMinister of Namibia, for the excellent manner in which\nhe discharged his responsibilities during the fiftyfourth session.\nI would also like to pay a special tribute to our\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, for the inspirational\nleadership and the moral authority he has brought to\nour Organization. His report to the Millennium\nSummit, \u201cWe the peoples\u201d, will remain a powerful and\nluminous beacon as we strive to make the world a more\njust and peaceful place for future generations and the\nUnited Nations a more effective, efficient and\nresponsive Organization in the new millennium.\nExactly 35 years ago today, Maldives was\nadmitted to the United Nations. We were proud to take\na seat in this world body, which has seen steady growth\nin its membership, activities and influence. Today, we\nare pleased to welcome to our midst the island nation\nof Tuvalu. We look forward to working with Tuvalu in\nfurthering the cause of small island nations for a more\neconomically humane and socially just world that is\nenvironmentally sustainable in the future.\nWars, hunger and famine have marred much of\nthe twentieth century. Terrorism, drugs and the spread\nof HIV/AIDS threaten to destroy the peace and\nprosperity of our future generations. Economic\ninequality and social injustice have tended to increase,\n16\n\ndespite many laudable efforts to the contrary. As\ntechnological advances bring untold riches and\nopportunities to many, many more continue to live in\ndeprivation, their lives becoming increasingly\nmarginalized in a fast-changing world.\nOnly a few days back, the Millennium Summit\nbrought together the largest-ever gathering of world\nleaders in human history. It was not only a historic\noccasion but also one that rekindled the hopes and\naspirations of the world's peoples. The Millennium\nDeclaration adopted at the Summit charts out a future\nvision for the world in which \u201cthe peoples\u201d have\nrightfully been given pride of place in our efforts to\nreshape the future of humanity. As my President,\nPresident Abdul Gayoom, stated at the Millennium\nSummit, \u201cThe gap between expectation and result must\nbe eliminated\u201d (A/55/PV.3) in the new millennium.\nThe leaders of the world have recognized the\ndangers posed to the future of humanity. They have\npledged themselves to a better world \u2014 a world that is\nmore just, a world in which every human being can live\nin dignity, a world that rejoices in its diversity of races,\nreligions and culture. They have pledged to strengthen\nthe United Nations so that it may have the resources\nand capability to deliver the dreams of \u201cwe the\npeoples\u201d of the world. It now remains for us to\ntranslate these words into deeds, rhetoric to reality.\nAction must begin now.\nFor over two decades, Maldives has managed to\nmake significant economic and social progress. We are\nindeed proud of what we have achieved with the\nlimited resources at our disposal. A stable political\nenvironment, a supportive international community and\nthe creativity of our people have combined to help our\neconomic growth. However, this does not reduce in any\nway the vulnerability of our economy. We continue to\nhave a small and narrow economic base comprising\nfisheries and tourism, both of which are extremely\nsusceptible to external forces that are often beyond our\ncontrol. Indeed, the precarious nature of our economy\nis readily evidenced whenever the price of tuna plunges\nin the international market. Similarly, any downturn in\nthe economy of major tourist markets or regional\ninstability casts a long shadow on our tourist industry.\nWe do not want to wear the least developed\ncountry label for ever. As a small but proud nation, we,\ntoo, would like to be a self-reliant country. National\npride, unfortunately, does not feed our population or\neducate our children. It is for these reasons that during\nthe Economic and Social Council meeting in July this\nyear, Maldives argued against its removal from the list\nof least developed countries, which would undoubtedly\npull the rug from underneath our feet. Indeed, our\nsuccesses in national development to date have been\nhighly dependent on the concessional finance and\ndevelopmental assistance we have enjoyed as a least\ndeveloped country. The withdrawal of access to such\nconcessional assistance at this crucial stage of our\ndevelopment would seriously cripple our\ndevelopmental efforts. Our economy will slide\nbackwards if we lose preferential access to markets.\nOur debt burden will become unsustainable.\nWe take some comfort in the decision made by\nthe Economic and Social Council to defer the\nconsideration of the recommendation to graduate\nMaldives from the list of least developed countries.\nThe structural impediments facing our developmental\nefforts are so formidable that the country's graduation\nat this stage is not justified. Our geophysical\nfragmentation, combined with remoteness from major\nmarkets, accentuates our vulnerabilities, many of\nwhich are unique. Maldives is not simply an island\nnation; it is a nation of islands. In fact, we have over\n1,100 small, low-lying islands. Our population is\nscattered over 198 islands, each of which needs to be\nprovided with adequate administrative and socioeconomic infrastructure. Poor and porous soil\nconditions prohibit most agricultural production, while\navenues for economic diversification are extremely\nlimited. Transport and communication costs are\nprohibitive. That is why we have appealed to the\ninternational community to take a closer look at our\nsituation and re-examine the issue of our graduation\nfrom the list of least developed countries. We hope the\ninternational community will understand and support\nour cause.\nSince the adoption of the Barbados Programme of\nAction, the small island developing States have been\nwaiting for the international community to meet the\npledges made at the Conference on small island\ndeveloping States, while their economic and ecological\nchallenges have increased manifold. We therefore are\nhappy that the world leaders at the Millennium Summit\nhave once again highlighted the special needs of small\nisland developing States, including the necessity of\ndeveloping a vulnerability index that can truly capture\nthe unique features of these States. The leaders have\n17\n\nalso resolved to implement rapidly and in full the\nBarbados Programme of Action and the outcome of the\ntwenty-second special session of the General\nAssembly. These are welcome developments which we\nhope will soon be translated into action by the\ninternational community.\nAllow me to stress the importance of the early\ncompletion of the vulnerability index called for by this\nAssembly. In developing this index, we believe, the\ninternational community should take into account not\nonly those factors that are similar among the island\nStates but also those that are unique to particular island\nStates. For example, while some may be prone to\ncyclones and hurricanes, others may be more affected\nby beach erosion or coral bleaching.\nMaldives has consistently voiced its concerns\nover the negative impact of environmental degradation\non small island States. We welcomed the adoption of\nthe Kyoto Protocol. Unfortunately, the slow pace of its\nratification by the international community continues\nto endanger many small island developing States. It is\nindeed regrettable that to date only 23 countries have\nratified the Protocol.\nWe are, however, heartened by the fact that the\nMillennium Declaration calls upon the international\ncommunity to expedite the early ratification of the\nKyoto Protocol to ensure its entry into force by the\ntenth anniversary of United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in 2002. We call upon\nthe United Nations to take a leading role in making the\nrelevant resolve of our leaders at the Summit a reality.\nAs the President of the Maldives, speaking at the\nMillennium Summit, declared,\n\u201cHumanity's quest for progress must be\nsustainable. We have no right to destroy the Earth.\nEcological damage must be stopped. Global warming\nmust be curbed. All low-lying countries must be\nsaved.\u201d (A/55/PV.3)\nThe protection and security of small States\ncontinue to constitute an issue of critical concern to my\ncountry. Among the 189 Members that compose the\nUnited Nations today, many are small countries which\nrequire protection from a variety of threats to their\nsecurity. The Maldives believes that within the sphere\nof international peace and security, which has always\nremained a high priority on the United Nations agenda,\nthe security of small States should continue to receive\nspecial consideration as a political and moral\nobligation of the international community. The interest\nand concern of the United Nations on this issue should\nnot be allowed to diminish, even in the future.\nGlobalization is today a reality. No country, large\nor small, can swim against the tide of globalization and\nthe digital revolution that is reshaping the modern\nworld. Globalization must benefit all countries. Its\ncosts must be shared evenly by all countries. The least\ndeveloped countries must be granted duty-free and\nquota-free access to the markets of developed countries\nfor their exports. They deserve debt relief, including\ndebt cancellation, in return for demonstrable\ncommitments to poverty reduction. Development\nassistance needs to be increased. We remain hopeful\nthat the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries, to be held next year, will usher\nin a new era of development for the least developed\ncountries.\nDuring the course of last year, the United Nations\nwas able to record some important achievements. The\nfollow-up sessions to the world conferences on women\nand on social development reaffirmed the goals of\ncreating a more just and tolerant society. Modest but\nsignificant progress was achieved by the Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons towards freeing the\nworld from the scourge of nuclear arms. Efforts\ntowards the establishment of an International Criminal\nCourt are moving ahead. A valuable framework for\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping operations\nhas been laid out by the Brahimi report (A/55/305).\nYet many shortcomings and frustrations continue\nto plague the world community. Conflicts based on\nethnic arrogance rage on. Poverty persists at a level\nthat is morally repugnant. The spread of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic needs to be urgently addressed. International\npeace and security continue to be threatened by\nterrorism and drug trafficking cartels operating within\nand across borders.\nA comprehensive and permanent peace settlement\nin the Middle East continues to elude us. This is\ndisappointing. We would like to reiterate our full\nsupport for the cause of the Palestinian people and to\nencourage the sponsors of the peace process in the\nMiddle East to continue to pursue their efforts towards\nachieving a lasting peace in the region.\nThe situation in the Gulf continues to trouble us.\nPeace, progress and security in that region can never be\n18\n\nachieved unless settlements on all unresolved issues\nare complied with fully by all the parties concerned in\nconformity with the relevant United Nations\nresolutions. We would like to reaffirm our unwavering\nsupport for the independence, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait. As I mentioned before,\nwe continue to believe that the United Nations has an\nobligation to uphold the security and territorial\nintegrity of all Member States, including small States.\nThe Maldives firmly believes that the myriad\nchallenges facing the world today can be effectively\naddressed only in a multilateral framework in which\nthe United Nations must play the central role. Despite\nthe many shortcomings it may have, the United Nations\nremains the only truly universal organization where\nglobal issues can be addressed. We believe that an\nincreasingly interdependent world calls for a\nstrengthened multilateral system with an effective\ninternational legal regime that is respected by all\nnations. It is with this conviction that the Maldives has\nbecome a State party to a number of international\nconventions and treaties, including the eight\nconventions and treaties to which we became party\nduring the Millennium Summit, taking advantage of the\nopportunity offered by the Secretary-General.\nWe fully support the steps being taken by the\nSecretary-General in the process of reforming our\nOrganization. While there has been much progress,\nmore remains to be done. Reform of the Security\nCouncil to reflect the political reality of the modern\nworld is essential if the United Nations is to remain a\ncredible and effective organization, enjoying the\nconfidence of the peoples of the world. Reform of the\nUnited Nations must aim at enhancing the legitimacy\nof the Organization, making the United Nations more\ndemocratic and transparent, and reinforcing the ability\nof the United Nations to uphold equality among\nnations.\nAt the Millennium Summit, our leaders\nilluminated the way forward. It now remains for us to\nmove forward in concert, for the benefit of the peoples\nof the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating the President on behalf of my delegation\non his unanimous election to lead the fifty-fifth regular\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that\nhis able leadership and vast diplomatic experience will\nsteer the business of this session of the General\nAssembly to the desired outcome. I also wish to\nexpress my delegation\u2019s gratitude to his predecessor,\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, for the able\nmanner in which he presided over the work of our\nprevious session. I commend the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose commitment in shaping the\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the new\nmillennium has won the respect and admiration of\nmany. I particularly commend him for his selfless\ndedication to duty and encourage him to continue\nserving the international community with the same\nzeal.\nThe proliferation of conflicts in Africa continues\nto pose serious threats to peace, security and stability.\nConflicts have had a negative impact on the continent\u2019s\ndevelopment capacity and continue to undermine\nefforts to improve the living standards of our peoples.\nThey have caused considerable destruction and loss of\nlives, generated millions of refugees and displaced\npersons and exacerbated famine conditions in areas\nsuch as the southern Sudan and the Horn of Africa.\nAfrica recognizes the primary role of the United\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. It also recognizes the need for cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\nin peacekeeping and peace-building. Such efforts have\nyielded positive results in some countries. However,\nthere are others, such as the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, where the United Nations has been slow to\nact.\nPositive regional initiatives have been recorded in\nthe cessation of armed hostilities between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, under the auspices of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU). We commend the parties for the\nmaturity they have demonstrated. We urge both parties\nto the conflict to uphold the ceasefire while working\ntowards a final negotiated settlement of that dispute.\nThe United Nations is urged to speedily discharge its\nduty along that common border.\nThe establishment last month of a Transitional\nNational Assembly and the election of the President of\nthe Republic of Somalia was indeed a momentous\noccasion. I pay tribute to President Ismail Omar\nGuelleh of Djibouti for his mediation efforts and his\nsteadfast commitment to the cause of peace in Somalia.\nI call upon the international community to continue\nproviding support and humanitarian assistance to the\nSomali nation. I also hope that the recently concluded\naccord on Burundi will bring to an end the seven-year-\nold civil war and enable the people of that country to\nredirect their efforts towards reconstruction and\ndevelopment.\nThe recent unfortunate experience in Sierra\nLeone calls for a review of peacekeeping operations,\nparticularly with regard to the safety, commissioning\nand deployment of troops. Kenya supports the recent\ninitiative aimed at curbing the trade in illicit diamonds,\nwhich fuels and sustains conflicts in Africa. Kenya\nwelcomes the decision by the Security Council\nauthorizing the establishment of an international\ncriminal court to try those responsible for atrocities\ncommitted in the civil war in Sierra Leone. It should\nsignal to the rebels there and elsewhere that the\ninternational community will not tolerate acts against\nhumanity.\nTurning to disarmament and international\nsecurity, we are disappointed that the Conference on\nDisarmament for the second year running has not\nundertaken any substantive work. This situation is\nparticularly disturbing, since the Conference is the sole\nmultilateral disarmament negotiating forum.\nThe Conference has for a considerable period of\ntime been expected to conduct serious negotiations on\na fissile material cut-off treaty and a treaty on nuclear\ndisarmament. This Assembly has in various resolutions\nurged the Conference on Disarmament to undertake\nsuch negotiations. During its fifty-fourth session, for\ninstance, the General Assembly passed four resolutions\nwhich, inter alia, called on the Conference to get down\nto serious work.\nThe lack of progress at the Conference is due to\nthe reluctance of key nuclear-weapon States to submit\nthemselves to negotiate in good faith, despite their\nobligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nWe still expect the nuclear-weapon States to honour\ntheir commitment to undertake genuine nuclear\ndisarmament, which they renewed during the 2000\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty. Failure\nof the Conference on Disarmament will send the wrong\nsignal to non-nuclear-weapon States and might well\nencourage those with nuclear ambitions to join that\nclub. After the end of the cold war, there is no longer\nany justification for maintaining nuclear arsenals, if\nthere ever was one. Kenya calls on the nuclear\ncountries to preserve outer space as a nuclear-free\nzone.\nThe serious security problem posed by the\nproliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is a\nmatter of grave concern to Kenya. We hosted in March\nthis year the Great Lakes Region and Horn of Africa\nConference on the proliferation of illicit small arms\nand light weapons. The Conference, attended by 10\nStates of the region, adopted the Nairobi Declaration,\nwhich calls for greater cooperation and information-\nsharing between law enforcement and border control\nofficials of States in our region, as well as the\nstrengthening and/or adoption of national laws and\ncontrol mechanisms governing civilian possession of\narms, and urges source countries to regulate weapons\nand arms transactions through strict licensing. The\nNairobi Conference was an important initiative. Kenya\nis in the process of organizing a follow-up meeting\nlater this year.\nIn the same vein, I should like to express our full\nsupport for the International Conference on the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects, scheduled for 2001. We hope that that\nConference will adequately address our concerns.\nA consequence of conflicts and the proliferation\nof illicit small arms and light weapons has been the\nmassive movement of refugees across borders. Kenya\ncontinues to host a large number of such refugees. This\nhas put a heavy strain on our own scarce national\nresources.\nI am happy to note that the Government of Kenya\nis in the process of finalizing the Refugee Bill 2000 in\norder to address the refugee phenomenon. The Bill is a\nresult of joint efforts between the Government of\nKenya, the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees and other stakeholders. It will provide\nrefugees with a better legal framework in which to live\nand exercise their rights. Kenya would like to see an\nend to the disparity in the treatment of refugees\nglobally. We have noted with concern the bewildering\ninconsistency in the responses to the refugee problems\nin other parts of the world compared with those in\nAfrica. We hope that in future the international\ncommunity will respond in a fair and consistent manner\nto refugee crises in all parts of the world.\nThe promotion of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is firmly on the international agenda. In\nKenya the Government effort is geared towards\nenhancing public awareness of existing rights and\nfreedoms. In this regard, the Government has prepared\na bill seeking to establish an independent human rights\ncommission to monitor and protect human rights. That\ncommission would also advise the Government on its\ninternational obligations on the protection and\npromotion of human rights.\nDuring the last session of the Assembly I\ncommended the High Commissioner for Human Rights\nfor adopting a proactive approach to human rights\nissues. We continue to stress that human rights should\nbe addressed in a global context through a dialogue-\nbased approach. In this way, we will realize wider\nacceptance and observance of human rights.\nThe rise in transnational networks of crime,\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism is another\nmatter of grave concern to us. The effects of the\nAugust 1998 terrorist bombing in Nairobi are still\nevident in our economy and in the lives of Kenyans.\nWe have undertaken measures to contain this menace\nby establishing special policing units and strict control\nof movement on border areas and other national entry\npoints. We are also collaborating with international\nsecurity agencies, such as Interpol, and have signed\nextradition treaties with a number of States. We call for\nconcerted efforts to adopt effective international\nmeasures to eradicate the growing and dangerous links\nbetween terrorist groups, drug traffickers and armed\ncriminal groups. The struggle against terrorism can\nonly succeed if there is cooperation between all\ncountries to track down and apprehend wanted\nterrorists.\nKenya supports the initiative to restructure and\nrevitalize the United Nations in the economic, social\nand related fields. We stress that the promotion of\ndevelopment should remain a central priority of the\nOrganization.\nThe process of reforming the Economic and\nSocial Council should be expedited by organizing its\nwork throughout the year and reinforcing its role in\nproviding overall policy guidance for operational\ndevelopment programmes and funds.\nKenya supports the implementation of policies\nthat foster economic growth in developing countries in\norder to bridge the widening gap between rich and\npoor. My delegation urges the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions to ensure the facilitation of\nstronger and more equitable international multilateral\ndevelopment cooperation designed to address the\ngrowing problems in economic development.\nWe are all aware of the challenging task of\neradicating poverty consistent with the overall\nobjectives and strategies agreed in the Copenhagen\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action adopted at\nthe World Summit for Social Development and with the\noutcome of the Millennium Summit. Kenya supports\nand continues to implement the Copenhagen\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action. This\ncommitment is manifested in our Government\u2019s\ndetermination to establish a firm policy and\ninstitutional framework for mainstreaming the poverty\neradication agenda. The formulation of the National\nPoverty Eradication Plan is a step towards focusing\nnational policies and operational priorities on the poor,\nas well as providing an enabling environment for them\nto participate in economic and social development.\nFurther, the Government of Kenya has developed\nan interim poverty reduction strategy paper, which has\nbeen prepared in consultation with all stakeholders.\nThe strategy paper outlines measures designed to\nimprove economic performance, while identifying key\nactions to reduce the prevalence of poverty.\nThe above measures are part of the Kenya\nGovernment\u2019s strategy to restore economic growth\nwhile maintaining economic stability. Economic\nreforms are gaining momentum and are expected to\nlead to a progressive increase in real per capita growth.\nCurrently, the country is facing a severe drought, the\nworst in our country\u2019s history. This is having a\ndebilitating effect on our economy. We appreciate the\nassistance received so far from the international\ncommunity and seek continued support to deal with the\nsituation.\nGlobalization poses enormous challenges to\ndeveloping countries, and ours is no exception. Kenya\nwelcomes initiatives that protect the weaker States\nfrom the adverse effects of globalization. The ability of\nAfrican countries to participate effectively, exercise\ntheir rights and meet their obligations in the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) is an important determinant\nin their integration into the international trading\nsystem. My delegation is concerned about the growing\nprotectionism manifested in attempts to support a new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations within the\ncontext of the WTO. Kenya is firmly opposed to the\nintroduction of new protectionist barriers to trade\ncamouflaged as labour, health and environmental\nstandards.\nAt the same time, we urge the implementation of\nspecial and differential provisions in respect of\ndeveloping and least developed countries because of\ntheir low levels of industrialization and the vulnerable\nnature of their economies.\nThe increased globalization of financial markets\nand capital flows poses new challenges for the\nmobilization of adequate resources. Kenya shares the\nconcerns of developing countries over the general\ndecline in official development assistance and the free\nflow of foreign direct investment to developing\ncountries. Portfolio investment, which tends to be\nvolatile and unpredictable, as experienced during the\n1997 financial crisis, is a source of financial instability.\nWe support the creation of a new international financial\narchitecture for a more stable financial system. The\nglobal market environment poses enormous challenges,\nand there is an urgent need for supportive international\npolicies that will ensure the financial system\u2019s efficient\nfunctioning.\nThe slow progress in Africa\u2019s attainment of\nsustainable economic growth is linked to the failure to\nmobilize resources. This has been aggravated by\ninternal conflicts and the prevalence of diseases such as\nmalaria and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which in\nthemselves have a causal relationship with poverty and\ndeprivation. My country, in collaboration with\ninternational agencies, is zealously pursuing scientific\nresearch to find a cure for malaria and the HIV/AIDS\npandemic. We call upon the international community to\nsupport our research efforts to find a cure for these\ndiseases, which continue to ravage millions. Kenya\nwishes to stress the need to ensure the easy availability\nof existing drugs to those already afflicted.\nGiven that information technologies are important\nprerequisites for development, the developed countries\nshould direct resources to accelerate the development\nof information technology in Africa. In this regard,\nKenya welcomes the Okinawa Charter initiative of the\nG-8 countries and looks forward to the implementation\nof its aims.\nMy delegation notes the commitment made by the\nG-8 to speed up the pace of implementation of the\nenhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative, in line with the targets agreed at the Cologne\nSummit. However, the initiative suffers from a lack of\ncommitment to implementation and should be reviewed\nwith a view to being speeded up. We share the\nconcerns, expressed by the leaders from developing\ncountries who attended the Okinawa G-8 Summit, on\nthe impact of the debt burden to poverty alleviation\nefforts. Debt repayment in sub-Saharan Africa is to the\ndetriment of health, education and other essential\nservices. Kenya urges creditor countries to honour\npledges for debt relief and increase balance of payment\nsupport to developing countries.\nKenya attaches special importance to South-\nSouth cooperation. It is in recognition of the important\nrole of economic cooperation among developing\ncountries that we continue actively to pursue economic\nintegration with countries in our own subregion. The\nrelationship between regional and subregional\neconomic groupings is seen within the framework of\n\nthe African Economic Community, which Kenya fully\nsupports.\nThe institutions established in 1945 are overdue\nfor an overhaul. The world political, economic and\nsecurity landscape has changed, and so must these\ninstitutions. The United Nations must become a truly\nuniversal Organization, democratic and representative\nof the many diverse interests. Its organs should reflect\nthis rich diversity, with effective representation and\nparticipation at all levels of decision-making. The\nGeneral Assembly has to reassert its role within the\nOrganization. The Security Council must also reflect\nthe principle of equitable geographical representation\nand the realities of our times. Kenya seeks to have\npermanent seats on the Security Council allotted for\nAfrica, to be filled by African countries on a rotational\nbasis and on the same footing as existing permanent\nseats. The transformation of institutions dealing with\nother issues is equally overdue if we are to re-energize\nthe efficacy and effectiveness of the United Nations, as\ncalled for in the Millennium Declaration.\nKenya appreciates the increased utilization of the\nUnited Nations Office at Nairobi. We are nevertheless\ndissatisfied with the level of involvement with\nenvironment and human settlement issues. There is a\nhuge, under-utilized capacity in the Nairobi offices. It\nshould be noted also that the Nairobi Declaration\nadopted by Member States in February 1997 declared\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\nto be the principal body in the field of environment.\nKenya is therefore totally opposed to the creation of\nnew institutions with similar concerns and calls upon\nthe international community to strengthen the role of\nUNEP and the United Nations Centre for Human\nSettlements (Habitat) in Nairobi.\nIn conclusion, Kenya fully embraces the spirit of\nthe Millennium Declaration, with a pledge to make its\nmodest contribution in the general service of a happier\nfamily of nations."
