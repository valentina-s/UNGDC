        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tIt is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you. Sir, in the name of the delegation of Afghanistan, on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are extremely happy to see that this year the work of the General Assembly will be directed by an eminent son of Latin America, a continent whose people have always stood steadfastly at the forefront of the struggle for freedom and emancipation. Their long history has always demonstrated their determination to associate themselves with all progressive forces for building a world free of discrimination and injustice. Added to these qualities of Latin America, your personal qualifications and your vast experience and knowledge confirm us in our belief that under your guidance this session of the General Assembly will fulfil its great responsibilities.\n2.\tI should like also to extend the sincere felicitations of the delegation of Afghanistan to Mr. Trepczynski of Poland, who skilfully guided the work of the General Assembly during its past session.\n3.\tIt is with great pleasure that we welcome the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and greet them in the family of nations. We have traditional friendly ties and relations with the great German people. The history of our relationship is one of close co-operation in the economic and cultural spheres. We are confident that their joining the United Nations contributes to the strengthening of this Organization and peace and security in the world. They have already set an example in the field of international relations by their policy of peace and conciliation. In fact their admission will enhance this spirit in the world Organization.\n4.\tI wish also to extend the congratulations of the Afghan delegation to the delegation of the Bahamas on its admission to membership in the United Nations. The admission of the Bahamas exemplifies a triumph of the will of people in the process of self-determination, a cause which Afghanistan has consistently supported in all parts of the world.\n5.\tMy Government welcomes the independence of Guinea- Bissau and declares that it has been recognized by Afghanistan. The sacrifices endured by the people of Guinea-Bissau in their protracted fight against colonialism have not been in vain. It is a source of gratification for us to witness today the great victory achieved by the liberation movements in Guinea-Bissau in establishing their independence and in freeing their country from alien domination. We wish the people of Guinea-Bissau success and prosperity.\n6.\tOn 17 July 1973, a great fundamental, institutional change took place in Afghanistan. The monarchy was abolished and a republic was proclaimed. The objectives of the newly created republic, supported by the genuine aspirations and democratic traditions of the Afghan people, are to promote the material and spiritual development of its people and to create a new society founded on justice and equality for all citizens without any discrimination, to allow all Afghans to participate fully and responsibly in the affairs of their country, and to curb the forces that have hitherto hampered the realization of these aspirations. The Republic aims at establishing a trustworthy security within the country that would permit sound and positive economic, social and cultural reforms, and pave the way for political, economic and cultural advancement. This requires the mobilization of all available resources and energy in all fields in the interest of the people.\n7.\tTherefore, the new order has the full and sincere support of the majority of the people. As soon as a new constitution is promulgated, one that will reflect the true aspirations of the people and will extend democratic rights and liberties for the progress and evolution of society, elections will be held in accordance with its provisions, based on the principles of democracy.\n8.\tTo overcome economic backwardness, the Government is determined to take new measures as rapidly as possible to bring about basic changes, to create a national economy through effective planning based on modern science and technology and founded on the principle of full sovereignty over its natural resources. Great importance is attached to the encouragement of national industries, handicrafts and arts and to their protection against competitive foreign products.\n9.\tSince ours is mainly an agricultural country, the new regime, as a major step in its programme to bring about fundamental progress, will institute land reforms in the interests of the majority of the people.\n10.\tIn the social field, the situation is in no way compatible with contemporary conditions in the world. Therefore, new programmes for social reform are contemplated, particularly for improving working conditions and the standard of living. A progressive and democratic labour law will be sought to secure the protection of the individual and social rights of industrial and agricultural workers. New and effective steps will be taken for creating equal opportunities for Afghan women in all spheres of life: economic, social, political and cultural.\n11.\tThe founder of the Republic, Mohammad Daoud, in his statement of 23 August 1973, said:\n\\\"It is evident that economic and social progress are closely linked with fundamental reforms and the establishment of a true democracy. . . . Therefore, Afghanistan, keeping in view the changes in the world, should have a progressive domestic policy.\\\"\n12.\tIn the international sphere, Afghanistan will remain a peaceful country and will consistently follow the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries pursuing different social systems, and will firmly continue its policy of non-alignment and non-participation in any blocs or military pacts. It will maintain its adherence to and respect for the Charter of the United Nations. It will seek the strengthening of amicable relations with all peace-loving countries in the economic, technical and cultural fields.\n13.\tThe new Government attaches the utmost importance to maintaining and creating relations based on the principles of justice, mutual respect and neighbourliness with countries with which we share the same region. The good neighbourly ties of friendship with our neighbour to the north, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, are unfaltering. We have friendly and sincere relations with our other neighbour; the People's Republic of China. We have always had neighbourly relations with Iran. I sincerely reciprocate the friendly remarks of the Foreign Minister of Iran in his statement in connexion with the relations between our two countries. With regard to our relations with Pakistan, I must say that, regrettably, our political differences regarding the issue of Pakhtunistan and the restoration and respect of the inalienable rights of our Pakhtun and Baluchi brothers, remain unsolved.\n14.\tThe question of Pakhtunistan, which has emanated from a refusal of Pakistan to recognize the legitimate demands of over 7 million people separated by the military force of a colonial Power from their fatherland. Afghanistan, is a national issue. We shall seriously endeavour to find a peaceful and just solution of this problem. A just solution is one that would conform to the best interests of Afghanistan and Pakistan in bringing peace and progress to the entire region. We believe that any solution should be sought on the basis of the will of the people and on international justice.\n15.\tWe have strong traditional .bonds of friendship with India and Bangladesh. We are desirous of strengthening further these bonds in the interest of mutual co-operation and permanent peace in the region.\n16.\tIn the wider sphere of international relations, the Republic of Afghanistan will adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and will continue its unfailing support of its aims and objectives.\n17.\tWe shall pursue our policy of political, economic and cultural co-operation with the third world. We are most desirous of following our policy of mutual respect and friendliness with all nations of the world, big or small, near or far, east or west, without discrimination against anyone.\n18.\tThe situation in the Middle East is a great source of concern to Afghanistan. The most strategic region of the world is still in a state of war. The resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly remain unheeded. All peace efforts to head off a conflict have virtually come to a standstill. The creeping paralysis of the mandatory resolutions of the Security Council \u2014 and not only with respect to the Middle East, but also concerning vital decisions taken on Rhodesia, the Portuguese colonies and the situation in South Africa \u2014 is eating away at the very foundations of the United Nations as the custodian of both the rule of law and the goal of peace. Peace efforts, particularly those made by the non-aligned nations, have been vetoed and the prestige of the United Nations is threatened even as a symbol of international morality.\n19.\tThe occupation of the Arab territories by Israel and the toleration of the acquisition of land by force does not imply the toleration of injustice to the Arabs alone, but threatens the very security of all small countries in all regions of the world. It is inconceivable to expect any peace in' the Middle East unless the Israeli forces are withdrawn from the occupied Arab territories.\n20.\tIt is true that nothing really effective in peace-keeping can be achieved without, the unanimity of the big Powers. But it is most difficult to understand the position of some big Powers that demur from implementing and enforcing the very decisions for which they have voted. The resolution on the Middle East unanimously adopted on 22 November 1967 [Security Council resolution 242 (1967)] is a classic case of this ambivalence.\n21.\tOur position on the question of the Middle East and our full support of the Arab cause and the aspirations of the people of Palestine for the restoration of their undeniable rights has been made clear on all occasions and in all international gatherings.\n22.\tAt the last summit conference of non-aligned nations,  we called for the strongest measures to be taken in connexion with the implementation of the Security Council resolution, including the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people as a basic prerequisite for the establishment of a lasting peace in the area. We emphasized the necessity of the individual and collective measures to be taken against Israel, not only by the non-aligned nations but by all Member States of the United Nations, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Here, in this Assembly, we emphasize once again that the unanimous recommendations of the non-aligned nations should be endorsed by all Member States.\n23.\tThere is no need for us to explain at length the policy pursued by my Government with regard to the elimination of colonialism and the securing of the right of peoples everywhere to self-determination and independence. This policy is well known. We shall always remain at the vanguard of the struggle against alien domination and colonialism.\n24.\tColonialism comprises all forms of alien domination, and not only that which is referred to as Western colonialism. The classical form of Western colonialism is perhaps gradually drawing to an end, but, regrettably, the domination of certain peoples and territories, quite often by countries which themselves have suffered from colonial occupation, continues. This state of affairs creates tensions and causes concern and anxiety. The imperialistic designs of Western Powers during the heyday of their colonial advance created artificial frontiers without regard to the rights of the peoples.\n25.\tThese legacies of the colonial era persist in some regions, impeding the development of a better understanding among nations. Vestiges of Western colonialism should be terminated without the tensions that would hamper friendly relations among countries and peoples.\n26.\tThe apparent failure of the United Nations to implement its own resolutions concerning the elimination of the colonial administration of Portugal and to put an end to the inhuman and repressive policies of apartheid in South Africa, as well as to the illegal racist minority regime of Southern Rhodesia, can be construed only as a disturbing example of non-co-operation by certain countries with the United Nations, countries that are Members of this Organization.\n27.\tMy delegation reiterates its support for the right of the people of Angola and Mozambique, as we did in the case of Guinea-Bissau, to sell-determination and independence, and shares the view that the continuation of the policies of apartheid by the Government of South Africa and its extension to Namibia has now reached a point which can no longer be tolerated by the international community. We fully support the aspirations of the liberation movements in the defence and restoration of their undeniable rights.\n28.\tA basic characteristic of the present international situation is a relaxation of power politics in some areas and persisting crises and manifestations of power politics in others. While we welcome the positive tendencies manifested in relations between certain big Powers, we cannot at all dismiss lightly the concern of the small countries of the world. Evidently there seems to be an inclination towards bypassing the United Nations, in which the small nations form the majority of the membership and represent the interests of the majority of the people of the world. From our point of view, detente, like peace, is indivisible.\n29.\tWe were very impressed by the statement of Mr. Walter Scheel, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, in which he said that \\\"universality also means universality of obligations\\\" [2119th meeting, para. 154] and that \\\"detente, is not meant to be exclusive...\\\" [ibid., para. 157]. It is evident that peace will remain precarious without the full participation of all countries in all matters of world peace and security.\n30.\tWe have arrived at the right time to expect and urge the international community to direct its efforts towards complete disarmament. We welcome the success of the various stages of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. We wish to see the machinery of the United Nations' fully used in all matters of disarmament and to see this session of the General Assembly make a decision as to the date and venue of the World Disarmament Conference. We hope that the present session of the General Assembly will prohibit nuclear tests in all environments and pay special attention to the question of nuclear disarmament.\n31.\tBut we are no less concerned about the stockpiling of conventional arms and the flow of such arms to other regions. There is no doubt that the security of smaller \u2014  particularly non-aligned \u2014 countries is threatened by conventional armaments. In our region the balance of power is already seriously threatened by important stockpiles of conventional weapons that can be acquired only by countries with privileged geographical or political positions, by countries which belong to a military alliance, or by countries which have acquired financial strength.\n32.\tI had that situation in mind when I stated at the summit Conference of non-aligned countries in Algiers that the recent acquisition of enormous quantities of sophisticated conventional armaments is a matter of grave concern to us. The political declaration of the summit Conference of non-aligned nations noted this with concern. It noted: \\\"that the flow of conventional arms to non-nuclear States, which is a threat to the security of non-aligned countries and which gives rise to tension in some regions, is continuing\\\" [A/9330, p. 17]. And then the summit Conference demanded that an end be put to the flow of such armaments.\n33.\tReferring to one of the items that has been proposed for discussion at this session, I should like to say that the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the item proposed by the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during his statement in the general debate [2126th meeting, para. 131]. The item I am \nreferring to is entitled: \\\"Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries\\\" [item 102]. We note with satisfaction the timeliness of the Soviet Union's initiative and hope that it will be supported by all peace- loving and progressive countries and that meaningful measures will be taken in this regard by the General Assembly.\n34.\tRegarding the economic situation, we shall take the opportunity to deal with most of the questions related to it when they come before the Second Committee. Here I shall mention only that the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade and the unsatisfactory application of the recommendations adopted at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], together with the disappointing results of the years that have elapsed since the coming into force of the Second United Nations Development Decade, means that the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] cannot be viewed without profound anxiety. We note with regret that the attitude of some of the developed countries has not in any way been conducive to an international economic order in compliance with the target set for the International Development Strategy. The burden of heavy external debts on the economies of developing countries is increasing while the flow of external assistance is decreasing in proportion to the growing needs of the developing countries. Meanwhile, the arms race, as I mentioned before, continues to absorb large sums of capital.\n35.\tWe support the very important decisions unanimously made in Algiers, with special emphasis on the essentiality of giving more consideration to the group of countries referred to as the least developed. The Conference of non-aligned nations adopted a resolution with respect to special measures in favour of these countries [see A/9330, p. 81]. In that resolution the Conference recommended that international economic action should be given top priority and that top priority should be given also to the urgent implementation of the programmes adopted by UNCTAD at its third session and by other international organizations, especially in the area of trade, and that efforts should be exerted towards formulating and implementing new measures in all fields. It also requested the speedy implementation of the various resolutions and decisions adopted by the United Nations and its related agencies, as well as the continued review of the implementation of the measures.\n36.\tAnother resolution was adopted which I would like particularly to mention, with respect to the special-measures related to the particular needs of land-locked developing countries [see A/9330, p. 77]. In that resolution it was recommended that a set of special provisions should be urgently considered and implemented in order to ensure the right of land-locked developing countries to free access to and from the sea, and to provide the international assistance necessary to remedy their special situations.\n37.\tIt is our hope that the subject of these resolutions will be given urgent attention and consideration at this session.\n38.\tIn conclusion, Mr. President, the Afghan delegation places itself at your disposal and at the disposal of all members of the Assembly for co-operation in the work ahead. We look forward to the realization of our wish for a successful twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly under your guidance."

        "file_text": "\ufeff Mr. President, may the first words spoken by the delegation of the Republic of Uruguay be words of congratulations and greetings to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, a distinguished Ecuadorian and, as such, a member of our Latin American family.\n2.\tI am happy to emphasize Mr. Benites' outstanding personal and intellectual qualities, a certain guarantee that he will conduct our deliberations with wisdom. May I also be permitted, as a Uruguayan, to recall with sincere friendship for him and for his country, our sister nation, the valuable mission he discharged in my country as Ambassador of Ecuador, and also to recall the permanent ties that link him to Uruguay, which is a symbol of the relations between our two countries.\n3.\tMay I also extend a greeting to the representative of Poland, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, who guided the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with dignity and great skill.\n4.\tMy country warmly welcomes the entry into the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This event constitutes a historic step along the road to peace and understanding. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas has now joined our Organization. We extend to it a cordial welcome to this forum and to the work of our Latin American regional group. Thus does the process towards full universality in the United Nations continue.\n5.\tEach session of the General Assembly is an inevitable confrontation between the magnitude of our ideals and reality, which at times is difficult to mould to our hopes. This repeated and dramatic experience, however, is not interpreted by Uruguay as a sign of ultimate failure but rather as proof of the very nature of this complex task to which the answer is clear: we must multiply our efforts, confirm our commitment to the purposes of the Charter and work untiringly to achieve them.\n6.\tConsistent with this view I wish, on behalf of my Government, to express our faith in the principles that gave life to our Organization and our permanent devotion to their promotion.\n7.\tMy country, to the extent of its possibilities, has contributed with perseverance and good faith to the building of a world governed by law. The observations we all make about the flaws and shortcomings of the system do not discourage us. Rather, such failings show, by their imperfections and through their consequences, the need for a legal order in force for all, a legal order that will link the community of nations, that will offer the climate of security necessary for effective political independence and economic and social development, that will offer essential guarantees to small nations and will remove the shadows of arbitrariness.\n8.\tVery often the flaws in the law have been covered by the makeshift device of an ad hoc political arrangement applied to specific situations: barely to close the deepest gap and to staunch the most serious wounds resulting from that disruption. Although that is valuable, we must study the matter further and not only cure the disease but try to prevent it, not only treat those who are ill but try to improve their health and make them well. That is why I venture to suggest that this sporadic political arrangement be applied now in a permanent manner and on a priority basis to arrive at the true enforcement of international law. The more Utopian it appears, the more necessary it is to achieve it in order to discipline the chaotic reality, which is sometimes unjust and violent, and bring it into line with the law.\n9.\tThis effort, so vital for our Organization and, even, I would say, the very raison d'etre of our Organization, must be included in the contemporary context which over the past 28 years has displayed certain definite characteristics. The birth of a number of new independent States throughout the world, the complex structure of relations between the great Powers, the multiplication of plans for political, economic and social organization in the different countries, the opening of prospects for a single mankind, however diverse it may be in its manifestations. At the same time, research and scientific reflection, the requirements of the \n\neconomy, and the progress of technology lead irrevocably to an interdependent world and, whether we like it or not, to a united world through an indestructible network of links and relations. It is in this perspective that our action takes place.\n10.\tMany steps have been taken in our search for roads towards an integrating synthesis of this diversity without harming it. That must continue on the strength of the principle that we shall not dissolve what is different, but shall rather seek out the common points. In a word, this is the need to develop solidarity among peoples and to organize it, identifying and recognizing common interests in relation to universal questions.\n11.\tEfforts along these lines are to be found in fields such as peace and security, natural resources, the human environment, health, communications, trade, finance, the strategy for development, and so many others. Here, despite natural discrepancies, little by little we see a progressive acceptance of principles and behaviour reflecting the consensus of the international community and representing, as it were, the common denominator of common interests. To apply development along these lines is to work for peace and solidarity.\n12.\tThe existence of this process of convergence, impelled by both ethical and philosophical needs, as also by material demands derived from the nature of things, does not, however, preclude the survival of anachronistic trends inserted in the process itself, which sometimes make use of it but which, more often, seek to impose some form of political domination or covert machinations designed to impose an ideology. In these trends and forms of conduct, the violence of the struggle for power suffered so long by mankind persists and overwhelms the small nations, through insidious infiltration of their institutions or the outbreak of terrorist cruelty or open aggression.\n13.\tIn the face of this, Uruguay reaffirms once again its respect for the various paths chosen by each of the\n-members of this community to organize its political, economic and social life and structures. We recognize the important contribution made by different cultures to the common patrimony, enriching it through new perspectives in what has been called the \\\"dialogue of civilizations\\\".\n14.\tFor our part we are faithful to the pattern we have chosen and will continue to be so. Within the simplicity and . modesty of our own customs, we proclaim with pride our fidelity to our own way of being, our national traditions, and the political, economic and social forms that we have freely established for ourselves. That is why, while we confirm our absolute respect for the choice of other nations, we demand equal respect for ourselves, not only in the shape of outer forms, but also in the very, substance of international conduct.\n15.\tResolution 2625 (XXV) takes up these principles. I believe that its permanent and scrupulous observance is indispensable if we are to make possible international co-operation and even coexistence itself under international law. Only thus can the plurality of patterns that are merged in the different political societies cease to be a factor of divergence and tensions and become an enriching element for constructive world co-operation.\n16.\tMy country will give of its best in this undertaking to build up co-operation among nations, but at the same time will be watchful of its national individuality in the face of any possible intention, whether overt or covert, to subvert its character.\n17.\tAt the same time, together with observing these political rules, we must go deeply into world processes in many areas to prevent the very dynamics of such processes extended throughout the world from changing the characteristics of the small nations.\n18.\tWe maintain as a principle that the construction of world co-operation and technology shall not be based even involuntarily on the elimination of national idiosyncrasies. The challenge we confront, therefore, is twofold: to organize constructive co-operation in a multiple world, and to eliminate from that process any aspect of a policy of power, of influences, interventions, and diktats, in order that each country may be authentically free in an interdependent and united world.\n19.\tIn the light of these perspectives, Uruguay will advocate and live a united nationalism in keeping with its history and integrated with the present reality of the world, while being ready to participate in the building up of an international community marked by peace, justice and co-operation. When I say \\\"united nationalism\\\" I want strongly to affirm the values of the nationalism of my country, of its own peculiar forms and characteristics and to make a strong affirmation of the values that are our own, of our sovereign right to govern ourselves freely and to choose our own patterns of development and national solutions.\n20.\tBut, at the same time, when I speak of \\\"united nationalism\\\" I wish to express our indeclinable universal vocation and the feeling that we belong to a single mankind, to which we are integrated in spirit, within which we enjoy the same rights and obligations and to which we are united by our natural patterns, and associated by the interdependence of economies and technology.\n21.\tThus we wish to participate in the universal task and contribute to the effective establishment of solidarity. That is why we share and shall continue to share in a brotherly manner the common endeavours of the human species and will participate in the task of building a united and more co-operative world. We shall do so, however, with our own and unchangeable national personality.\n22.\tI have drawn on these reflections concerning the philosophy behind the participation of Uruguay in the Organization in order to explain from this high rostrum the spirit that guides us in this solemn moment in history in which we open a new era of authentic national and popular development. These principles which we have chosen freely to guide our destiny are combined with those of the Charter; they are the manifestation of the creative will of our people; they represent the practical expression of a multiple world, and guarantee from the point of view of the international community our constructive desire to participate in the task of co-operation.\n23.\tThat is why, in renewing our expressions of adherence to the universal objectives of the Charter, we do so today with the new vitality derived from a process of profound national affirmation and with an international vocation which is in keeping with our history.\n24.\tWe trust that militancy in solidarity represents the path to a better international community. But there is no doubt that this positive road cannot be followed to the end if when we begin it we do not simultaneously open up actions designed to face the main negative questions affecting world peace and security.\n25.\tIt will be difficult to build a renewed world in solidarity unless we are able to apply a similar spirit to our daily and immediate endeavours-if we cannot duly harmonize our short-term interests with the demands of those same interests considered from the long-term view.\n26.\tWith this criterion we shall approach consideration of the main items on the agenda.\n27.\tOne of the main questions before us is that of disarmament. In our condition as a peaceful country we have worked towards that goal, advocating that the conference on disarmament be open to all States. We regret the meagre results achieved. It is necessary for States to strengthen their will to make progress in this area. Undoubtedly, the permanent members of the Security Council have in their hands the possibility of creating appropriate conditions so that the international community may benefit in a climate of security from a policy of disarmament.\n28.\tWe also wish, with pleasure, to point to the opening in Helsinki of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a valuable effort at relaxing tension. Similarly, we are happy to point to the progress towards peace made by the United States and the Soviet Union in their talks on the limitation of strategic armaments. Although we recognize the practical difficulties of the process, we insist on the need for it. The construction of new plans for co-operation throughout the world and prospects of a more just organization of the economy are delayed by the pressure of existing armaments.\n29.\tUruguay have mentioned its permanent desire for nuclear energy to become an instrument for a task of civilization. Hence, we have subscribed to the Treaty on the N\u2122-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons /see resolution 2373 (XXII)j, and in this spirit we have given life to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which, for the first time in history, establishes a denuclearized zone covering a surface of 8 million square kilometres with a population of about 200 million inhabitants. With this contribution by Latin America, one of its greatest contributions to peace, we claim today the support of all States which may become parties to that Treaty, and specially to its two additional protocols.\n30.\tMoreover, I feel it opportune to recall her? General Assembly resolution 2934 (XXVII), proposed last year by 14 Latin American countries and approved by a large majority, in which we reiterated, once again, the condemnation of all nuclear weapons tests. We believe that there is already a universal awareness of the need for absolute prohibition, and we deplore the fact that the appeals made so far have not yet been heeded.\n31.\tWith regard to the painful question of the Middle East, Uruguay, which has no material or political interest except that of co-operating with the nations involved, hopes that steps will be taken soon and in an effective manner to alleviate tension first, and later to arrive at permanent formulas ensuring peace on the basis of law.\n32.\tWith a conciliatory outlook towards opposing views and a realistic view of just and balanced solutions, we come again this year to the General Assembly.\n33.\tIt is our desire-and we shall fight for this constantly-to support formulas that may bring us close to the objective. We hope that a more understanding climate will prevail. We hope that the effort of the international community will concentrate on the basic purpose of applying international law and that other aspects not directly connected with the question will be left out of the discussion.\n34.\tUruguay is happy to see the efforts made by the United Nations, as well as bilateral efforts, in the hope that both may lead to a final settlement and complement each other. Our delegation is prepared to co-operate, within the context of the Charter, towards a negotiated solution allowing for the establishment of peace in the area, fully in keeping with international law and with all other aspects of the problem.\n35.\tAs regards human rights our position is that we must accentuate the effective protection of these rights, whose recognition has been made general but whose application is still imperfect. For this reason we insist again on the creation of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and we believe that this kind of mechanism can be instituted with the agreement of all our States, become a true promoter of peace and prepare the advent of a system based not only on a declaration of rights but on a legal statute governing, through the sentences of tribunals, the international protection organized by law.\n36.\tThere is no doubt that, together with the instruments we have mentioned we must create an international climate that is in keeping with the peaceful coexistence of all States. In fact, it is well known that external factors which sometimes unlawfully affect internal affairs in many countries are hotbeds of imbalance and tension, change the structure of the coexistence within communities and thus create negative conditions for the preservation of human rights.\n37.\tWe have arrived at similar conclusions as to the need to strengthen international security. Since the creation of the Permanent Court of International Justice over 50 years ago, Uruguay agreed unreservedly to take its problems to that high jurisdiction, and still maintains those principles today in the firm conviction that at this stage of the development of the international community perhaps the greatest shortcoming lies in our disregarding the essential past of any system of law, which is the judiciary.\n38.\tOur submission to such a norm is the best way of living up to the principle of the legal equality of States, and the day we see that jurisdiction consolidated and become an unconditional and automatic power we shall have finally created an authentic international order.\n39.\tFaithful to these convictions, my Government hopes to solve international disputes with a clear bent towards peaceful solutions and reaffirms its allegiance to the tribunals of international justice.\n40.\tMy Government wishes to express, with regard to international terrorism, its decision to support, as it did in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism which finished its work a few weeks ago, the adoption of specific measure allowing for the prevention and condemnation of this growing mode of violence whose inhuman methods create a climate of insecurity and danger and provoke the loss of innocent lives.\n41.\tWe believe that no pretext can be invoked to delay this absolute obligation, and although the study of the ultimate causes of terrorism deserves analysis and reflection, we must avoid a situation in which any delay in energetically condemning and repressing these acts would be interpreted as a demonstration of weakness or of dangerous tolerance. This would encourage the perpetrators of such acts to continue them.\n42.\tEver since its inception, the United Nations has followed a clear policy designed to lead to decolonization and to combat the manifestations of racial segregation. Uruguay has lent, and will continue to lend, its militant support to this trend, which is why we must today deplore the persistence of such practices. We cannot say we have exhausted all peaceful means of solving these problems, and therefore we must multiply efforts to achieve constructive dialogue within the framework of the United Nations in order to speed up the process and avoid painful confrontations.\n%\n43.\tThe economic and social growth of nations has frequently been conceived and practised as competition, as a pitiless struggle for better possibilities, which has led to a lack of morality in certain economic and trade practices, at the expense of the weaker developing nations. This has taken place due to the lack of balanced rules of conduct that would temper the rigours of confrontations that only impair justice. This situation has encouraged the concept of class struggle on the international level, among categories of countries.\n44.\tMy Government cannot go along with such a concept, nor can we accept the dialectics of hatred and opposition. We affirm, instead, the responsibility of all nations in the struggle for development and the establishment of more just-trade relations. It is a common, responsibility that flows from international solidarity and from the indivisible unity in present-day world economy. This is a responsibility that does not involve identical duties for each nation; rather, each must assume the contribution that each must give in order to ensure the public wealth. As Pope Paul VI declared in paragraph 86 (b) of Gaudium et Spes, \\\"As for the advanced nations, they have a very heavy obligation to help the developing peoples. . .\\\".\n45.\tThe developing countries themselves, however, must take a hand in their own evolution, for nothing can be effective unless it is the product of one's own efforts. Thus my Government attaches special importance to the establishment of international machinery and norms which will allow the efforts of the developing nations to burgeon freely. Each one must determine its own course and its own procedures and machinery. The international community will merely have to make sure that the common undertaking is based on justice. Hence Uruguay supported, during the meetings of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], the Mexican initiative for a charter of economic rights and duties of States.\n46.\tToday the atmosphere is conducive to an undertaking of the required profound changes in the international economy along those lines. But the monetary system has reached a critical moment where a revision is called for, and the needs and requirements of the developing nations must be heeded. In this respect, it is indispensable that the means of international payment should be such that development can be financed adequately, and that there be a monetary reordering that will take into account the interests of all nations, and not only one group of them. At the same time, in the financial field, the international community must recognize the very serious situation created by foreign debt on the less developed nations.\n47.\tInternational finance cannot be used as a means to strangle the progress of the more backward nations, nor can it give exaggerated remuneration to the advanced nations. A policy of balance must be created that will ensure economic dynamism all over the world, in keeping with the diversity of situations and the degree of progress of each nation. Only thus will the requirements of solidarity be met.\n48.\tThe work of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has formally begun in Tokyo, and the figures are extremely enlightening that have emerged: they show a loss being suffered by the developing countries, despite the fact that world trade as a whole has grown. This indicates that the greatest benefits flowing from that increase are concentrated in the most highly developed nations.. We must therefore deduce that general non-discriminatory preferences have not produced the hoped for effect, both because of the limitations those preferences imply as far as products, stability and quotas are concerned, and because of the failure on the part of some nations to put those policies into practice. By the same token, we must also point out the protectionist policies of certain developed countries towards their own agricultural production in sectors that arc usually the main source of income for many of the more backward nations.\n49.\tWe would hope that this new series of GATT negotiations will produce operative results leading to a true opening up to our nations of a substantially increased participation in world trade. This requires a new ordering of trade patterns to include increased participation by the developing nations. We believe that GATT and UNCTAD must work together so that all nations may join in more dynamic international trade relations.\n50.\tAs Uruguay has reiterated elsewhere:\n\\\"The defence of permanent sovereignty over the natural resources of each nation meets one of the most obvious requirements of international justice and- is in keeping with the efforts of the developing countries to shake off economic dependency and to raise the standards of living of their peoples.\\\"\n51.\tBut together with trade and financial resources, fully exploited natural resources are just so many other fields where development can take place. The effective utilization of all these economic factors is the condition for progress. Therefore, the international community is in duty bound to regulate those processes with justice, and, considering the inequalities that exist among nations, to mobilize every possible effort to ensure that development is a true common undertaking.\n52.\tThat is why my Government attaches enormous importance to the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. I appreciate the value of all the efforts that have been made, but I must stress the need for obtaining more immediate practical results and a more prompt implementation of the principles that we recognize as underlying our own system. The peoples of the world are looking to our deliberations with the expectation of greater executive ability. Everywhere, we are confronted by a public opinion that is increasingly well-informed and, therefore, more critical, specific and demanding in its expectations. The challenge lies in activating the achieving capacity of our community and in thus turning into deeds our good intentions.\n53.\tWe admire with amazement the prodigies of science and technology; we recognize in their accomplishments positive conquests for our peoples. But at the same time, we must warn against the risk that surrounds this progress, which, at its furious pace, threatens to reduce the individual to a mere component part in a process that 'is measured only by its efficiency and economic benefit. This does not mean, of course, that we think that we must abjure the marvels of applied science; but it does bespeak the international community's need to recognize fully the existence of this question and to live up to its responsibilities in order to create a civilization that will be in keeping with the material needs of human welfare.\n54.\tWe are approaching the point, I believe, where we will have more firmly to direct our development strategy towards what must be the true destination of progress. This is the moment of truth, when we must inscribe in the very heart of the computer a single, supreme human objective and multiply it thus as the only purpose and target of our efforts.\n55.\tWith that prospect in mind, mere economic indicators can de deceptive as far as the facts of development are concerned, to the extent that they set aside the higher values of the spirit and the very quality of life, the type or condition of existence, and welfare in its widest sense. We aspire to an international community that will re-embrace these concepts and, even at the risk of shattering the clear-cut starkness of statistical tables, introduce the notion of the quality of life, replacing growth and economic development with growth and human development - replacing it with net national welfare, as it has been called.\n56.\tThe subject of the environment is a true challenge to all countries, requiring a new effort on their part to co-ordinate their energies; and therefore we must all take an attitude consistent with protection of the atmosphere. My country has made specific efforts in this respect, but it. is the industrial countries that have the greatest responsibility in this united effort. We can hardly consider that preservation of the environment can be at the expense of the development of the least developed countries, which are only now beginning, timidly, to take their first tottering steps on the industrial and technological scene.\n57.\tThe institutions and machinery of the law of the sea must be restructured in order to ensure a dynamic and effective harmonization of the interests involved. We must appropriately order their legal protection and achieve a correlative distribution of responsibilities flowing therefrom, and do so on the basis of international justice, peace and security.\n58.\tThe General Assembly responded to this need by creating the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, entrusting it with the task of preparing for a conference on the law of the sea.\n59.\tBut Uruguay is concerned over the fact that this work has not progressed as we had hoped or foreseen. Consequently, we deem it necessary that this General Assembly adopt the necessary decisions that will allow for a further preparatory stage to be undertaken so that we can be reasonably assured of positive results without necessarily postponing its convening unduly. Such a preparatory stage must, we believe, involve the widest participation of the States that will be attending the conference later.\n60.\tOnce again, before this Assembly, Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its decision to preserve its sovereignty over the 200 miles of its territorial sea. This is based on elementary reasons of justice and is in accord with the geographical, geological and ecological characteristics of our adjacent sea, and with our inalienable rights to promote the development of our economy and to safeguard the health and well-being of our population, without prejudice to the guarantees provided by the exercise of the rights of international communication. Up to the present we have co-operated with the greatest willingness in the search for an international consensus to safeguard all those rights, and we shall continue to do so.\n61.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General raises the question of the very fate of the Organization and gives us observations and comments as a basis for a very constructive discussion on the matter.\n62.\tMy Government wishes now only to refer to some aspects of that and to refer to the beginning of this statement, when I defined the nature of Uruguay's participation in the Organization.\n63.\tWe are convinced that both political and philosophical beliefs with regard to the requirements of modern life strengthen the ties between nations. Those increased relations must obviously be administered in accordance with law. Certain basic principles must be safeguarded: independence, justice, solidarity and equality among States.\n64.\tAt the same time, modern law must give up those rigid criteria of a formal nature and must enter more deeply into this reality of relations among countries and consider the specific idiosyncrasies of each. Thus the normative order will ensure the substantive validity of the principles as such and not merely their appearance. The organized international community will have to strengthen its capacity to achieve in order to transform declarations into deeds. But in the meantime we must link and tie our immediate and circumstantial interests to objective targets based on a true understanding of the community of interests.\n65.\tAt the same time, we must be ready to correct any possible mistake that power politics and ideological penetration may introduce in the development of international solidarity. If I may, I shall put it another way: we must create and maintain an atmosphere of political security that will guarantee the free development of the community.\n66.\tThese and other more concrete tasks, all equally urgent, are tasks that can be discussed in the United Nations as the most appropriate body. We believe that at the same time it may lead to the creation of the atmosphere we require for these transformations. They are linked in an extremely complex and complicated play of fields and planes, that calls for spiritual and material changes in order to create a new prospect for mankind: international solidarity without destroying national characteristics.\n67.\tThat is why we agree with the Secretary-General that we should create for our Organization the target of making it \\\"a more reliable instrument of world order and cooperation, accepted and respected by all Governments and capable of safeguarding the common interests of mankind in a crowded world of increasingly interdependent but sovereign States\\\". Only thus will we be consistent with the responsibilities we have assumed."

        "file_text": "\ufeff49.\tMr. President, first of all, on behalf of the Government and people of Panama, and personally, may I offer you our fraternal congratulations on your election to preside over this session of the world Organization. Your election to such a high post is a matter of satisfaction to Latin Americans. This is a doubly well-earned distinction because of your ability as a humanist and because you represent the supreme values of American culture as a spokesman of a country whose history has been written in pages of glory in the struggle for independence of Latin America.\n50.\tWe are also gratified to extend our cordial welcome to the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on their admission as new Members of the United Nations. We are convinced that these States, one of which in fact belongs to our continent, will make a significant contribution to the work of carrying out to the fullest extent the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n51.\tI should also like to greet the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose efforts to make the ideals and principles of the Organization effective have earned him the appreciation and acknowledgement of the Members of the Organization, as well as of world public opinion. I also wish to greet the staff of the Secretariat who so devotedly and efficiently work in the different spheres of the world Organization's activities.\n52.\tMy country, together with other small and medium- sized nations, has studied with great care the statements made by the eminent spokesmen of the world superpowers, who attach renewed importance to the work of our Organization and offer new prospects to mankind that the values and ideals of the United Nations will be sincerely and effectively put into practice.\n53.\tThe new attitude that can be read into the statements made by the Powers of the East and the West obviously reflect the transformations that are taking place in the disposition of world forces. One of the main aspects of this change is the increasingly important and legitimate participation in international decisions of the medium-sized and smaller nations, particularly those that in the last 25 years have gradually emerged from colonialism and dependency and have become independent and sovereign States.\n54.\tIt is an undeniable historic fact that admission to the Organization of new nations has increased the vigour of the United Nations potential to achieve fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter, and particularly that of ensuring the true sovereign equality of States. Gradually, a new international order has gained ground and force, based on the true and effective development .of the purposes and principles of the Charter, which safeguard the right of the countries that lack war power and economic strength, and respect their sovereignty and their right to exploit their natural resources to benefit their economic and social development. The position of these countries in the international concert of nations is well-defined and the recently adopted Declaration of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries, held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, stresses the point that I am trying to make. In that Declaration, they reaffirmed the decision to base their international relations on the principles of sovereign equality and respect for territorial integrity, to avoid the threat or use of force in international disputes; and to work out peaceful settlements in accordance with the principles of the Charter. The Declaration also appeals to all States to act in accordance with such principles.\n55.\tThe Republic of Panama has based its international policy on firm adherence to the principles adopted by the non-aligned nations and is therefore committed to the task of achieving world-wide respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and to the task of bringing about decolonization, which is one of the categorical imperatives of our day.\n56.\tHowever, the small nations still have some misgivings with regard to the apparently encouraging statements made by the great Powers. The good faith underlying these statements has to be proved with concrete facts. Events take place daily which vitiate the professions of openness on the part of certain Powers. The gigantic economic and military power of some of these nations constitutes a danger to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the smaller nations, and this is particularly so for those Governments that are endeavouring to change their old economic and social structures in order to benefit the great masses of the population. There are still retrograde sectors and multinational economic cartels that refuse to agree that every country has the right to decide its own future for itself.\n57.\tAs far as we, the small countries, are concerned, the strengthening of the United Nations is one of our major hopes. In point of fact, it is the sole hope that we have of strengthening our independence and wiping out colonialism and all forms of oppression that still subsist in large areas of the world and this fact is brought home to us in our international relations.\n58.\tOur national sentiments are offended by the brutal fact that on Panamanian soil jurisdictional limitations still exist that weigh heavily on our national existence. Since part of our objective is to free ourselves from this unjust situation, we undertake to make known our cause to all the sister Republics of America and to put it before the peoples of the world, because the persistence of a colonial situation in Panama is of concern to the community of nations.\n59.\tPursuant to these plans, the Panamanian Government, at the beginning of this year, called for the holding of Security Council sessions away from Headquarters so that that body might consider \\\"measures for the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security in Latin America in conformity with the provisions and principles of the Charter\\\", to use the words of Security Council resolution 325 (1973).\n60.\tMy country had the honour of acting as host to the Security Council in Panama City from 15 to 21 March 1973. At that historic series of meetings, the question of the Panama Canal was thoroughly debated and we made it clear that we no longer wished to be a divided country bisected by a colonial enclave set in the very heart of the Panamanian isthmus.\n61.\tThese legitimate Panamanian aspirations, which have been recognized in official documents of the two countries concerned, without any real action being taken, can be summed up briefly as follows: first, to abrogate the Isthmian Canal Convention of 1903 that was agreed to in perpetuity and all the amendments thereto; second, to convene on a completely new, equitable and just treaty regarding the present Panama Canal; third, to respect the effective sovereignty of Panama over the totality of its territory; fourth, to ensure the reintegration of the so-called Panama Canal Zone in the Republic of Panama, so that it is no longer subject to the United States jurisdiction; and fifth, to lay the groundwork for the assumption by the Republic of Panama of full responsibility for the efficient functioning of the interoceanic Canal.\n62.\tMy presence in this Assembly hall is due inter alia to my desire to repeat to the members of the Security Council, to the brother Republics of Latin America, and to the nations from other latitudes that supported our efforts and continue to encourage us, our undying gratitude and thanks. These deeply rooted feelings of gratitude are extended also to the illustrious representatives of Austria, China, France and the Soviet Union, who all voted in favour of a joint draft resolution that was submitted to the Security Council.\n63.\tIn the statement that the President of the Security Council read on behalf of his colleagues when he adjourned the meeting in Panama,  the justice of our cause was set forth. According to that statement, the majority of the speakers at the Panama session stressed the fact that all States have the inalienable right to full jurisdiction over the totality of their territory. They also stressed that it is essential for all States to abstain from any act that might undermine the national unity and the territorial integrity of any other State. And on this point they stressed that the denial to Panama of its intrinsic right to full sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entirety of its territory, including the Panama Canal Zone, is a constant source of tension and, as such, constitutes a threat to peace and security in Latin America. They said that, in order to eliminate that threat, Panama must be given full sovereignty over the so-called Panama Canal Zone and the foreign military bases must be dismantled.\n64.\tPractically all speakers expressed the opinion that without any doubt Panama has the right to make the maximum use of its main natural resource, namely, its geographical position, so as to benefit its own economic development; they pointed out also that the situation in the Panama Canal Zone constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We are particularly grateful for the decision taken by Peru, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Sudan and Yugoslavia to sponsor with Panama a draft resolution on the question of the Panama Canal.  In accordance with that draft resolution, the Security Council-after having taken note of the willingness shown by the Governments of Panama and the United States of America to reach a just and fair agreement with a view to the prompt elimination of the causes of the conflict between them and to establish in a formal instrument agreements on the abrogation of the 1903 Convention on the Isthmian Canal and its amendments, and to conclude a new treaty that would fulfil Panama's legitimate aspirations and guarantee full respect for Panama's effective sovereignty over all of its territory \u2014  would have urged the two governments to continue negotiations in a high spirit of friendship, mutual respect and co-operation and to conclude without delay a new treaty aimed at the prompt elimination of the causes of conflict between them.\n65.\tHowever, that draft resolution was not approved because of the negative vote cast by one of the permanent members of the Security Council. Yet the result of the vote was that, of the 15 members of the Council, 13 voted in favour; one \u2014 the United Kingdom \u2014 abstained; and the United States cast a negative vote.\n66.\tI shall not prolong this statement by commenting on the political, diplomatic and psychological consequences of that outcome, but I cannot avoid repeating that it is obvious that the case of Panama requires a just and equitable solution without delay.\n67.\tThe Secretary-General, with his usual competence and dignity, described the correct approach to the solution of the problem. He informed the members of the Security Council at a meeting of that body that: \\\"This problem awaits a solution which can only be based on the respect for law and the search for justice.\\\" And he added: \n\\\"A solution will have to take into account the basic principles which are enshrined in the Charter such as the principle of territorial integrity, sovereign equality, the obligation to settle all international disputes by peaceful means and the principle which by now has become an accepted common standard, namely, that any State is entitled to put to full use and for its own account all its natural potentialities.\\\" \n68.\tThere can be no doubt that the support given to Panama by the Security Council and the views expressed by the Secretary-General evoked a positive response in important international circles. Proof of this can perhaps be found in the fact that President Richard Nixon in his annual report to the United States Congress on 3 May 1973, after referring generally to Latin America, specifically referred to the problem existing between his country and the Republic of Panama. In that message he pointed out that\n\\\"Another important unresolved problem concerns the Panama Canal and the surrounding Zone. U.S. operation of the Canal and our presence in Panama are governed by the terms of a treaty drafted in 1903.\\\"\nHe later noted:\n\\\"The world has changed radically during the 70 years this treaty has been in effect. Latin America has changed, Panama has changed. And the terms of our relationship should reflect those changes in a reasonable way.\\\"\nAnd he came to this conclusion:\n\\\"It is time for both parties to take a fresh look at this problem and to develop a new relationship between us \u2014 one that will guarantee continued effective operation\n\nof the Canal while meeting Panama's legitimate aspirations.\\\"\n69.\tAuthorized representatives of the United States have repeated their readiness to abrogate the unjust Isthmian Canal Convention of 1903, a vestige of the \\\"big-stick\\\" policy and of the peak period of colonialism, an anachronism that has no justification in these days when we affirm the self-determination of peoples and the sovereign equality of the nations that proclaim the Charter of the United Nations as their international constitution.\n70.\tIn the time that has elapsed since the Council met in my country, the United States and Panama have come to an agreement on the methodology of the negotiations and, I repeat, have reaffirmed the commitment to abrogate the existing Treaty and to draft a completely new one that will be just and fair and designed to eliminate the causes of frictions that have thus far seriously upset our friendly relations. So that negotiations can continue, the United States recently nominated the well-known diplomat, Mr. Ellsworth Bunker, to head the United States negotiating team. We trust that Mr. Bunker will go to Panama very soon and that the negotiations will progress along the right lines \u2014 that is, that they will fully satisfy the legitimate aspirations of my country which, I am sure, are shared and understood by an overwhelming number of the States Members of this world Organization.\n71.\tA few days ago, Secretary of State Kissinger, from this very rostrum, repeated that justice cannot be confined to the frontiers of a single nation. We want that justice to shine on Panama too. We want it to illuminate the oppressed peoples of the world as well. The readiness of the United States to abrogate the 1903 Convention is a step that we consider to be a positive one, but the gesture must go beyond the mere spoken word; it must be embodied in tangible facts that will encourage the prevalence of justice that we, a peace-loving people, desire.\n72.\tMy Government considers it an unchallengeable truth that the geographical position of the Isthmus of Panama constitutes the main natural resource of the national Panamanian State, and that the inter-oceanic Canal is one way of exploiting such a resource. Logically, the Republic of Panama has sovereign rights over the territory and full jurisdiction over the inter-oceanic waterway and its coastal region. At the same time we are primarily interested in its continued secure and effective functioning.\n73.\tIt seems obvious to us that, within a natural and legitimate relationship between our countries, the jurisdictional exercise claimed by the Republic of Panama as an expression of its own territorial sovereignty also contains within it the maximum guarantees that the international waterway will continue to serve the needs of trade and international transit and the maintenance of international peace and security.\n74.\tAs Panama has found sympathy, warmth and support in this hall for our just cause, so too my country is at one with all those who nobly and justly are struggling, in Latin America, in Africa and in Asia. In other words, Panama is true to the struggle against colonialism, neo-colonialism, imperialism and racial discrimination. Panama welcomes the decision of the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau to declare that territory an independent State.\n75.\tIt is for that reason, too, that Panama maintains its adherence to the principle of a 200-mile width of the territorial sea and has made it part of its legislation. We have therefore joined all the countries in general, and particularly those of Latin America, that proclaim and defend that self-same principle. We consider it both necessary and urgent that an international agreement, widely accepted, should be drawn up in which would be set forth the legitimate aspirations of those coastal States for which the sea, the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof, including the continental shelf, straits and marine channels of communication, as well as the air space over those areas, are in fact important natural resources and, as in our case, their main natural resource. The location of the Panama Canal as a means of inter-oceanic navigation in our own territory and the fact that up to this moment, because of a profoundly unequal relationship, another nation has derived the benefit of the main natural marine resource of Panama, force us to attach capital importance to the question of international waterways and straits. We must press for respect for the legitimate interests of the coastal State without jeopardizing the need for world navigation and trade.\n76.\tWe note that there are many different situations and positions with respect to this problem and we hope that a positive result will be achieved by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, to be held next year.\n77.\tThe speedy progress of marine technology, the profound change in the concepts and the means of territorial defence, the accepted denuclearization of Latin America and the increasing need of the coastal peoples to exploit the sea for their own benefit and to utilize the vast resources of the oceans, as well as the inter-oceanic marine means of communication, all create new legal, political, economic and environmental problems. But, at the same time, the increasingly acute awareness of these problems by nations of the third world, whose coasts make up almost the total, or at least the majority, of the active coasts of the planet, make it inevitable that flexible agreements will be achieved with due regard for the diversity of existing situations, so that most of the aspirations of each coastal State will be met regarding its own coasts and straits, without curtailing the rights of other, land-locked countries.\n78.\tAs each developing country tackles the essential task of exploiting the resources of its geography for the benefit of its inhabitants, it is faced with a pattern of foreign economic domination which, sometimes subtly and sometimes with crude violence, stifles all efforts of true human liberation and creates and keeps alive certain sources of tension.\n79.\tWe whole-heartedly support the idea expressed in paragraph 19 of the Political Declaration adopted by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries that \\\"international security cannot be achieved if it does not include an economic dimension which guarantees to all countries the right to implement their development programmes, free from economic aggression and any other form of pressure\\\" [see A/9330 and Corr.l].\n80.\tIn this statement I have referred to matters that are of vital importance to the Republic of Panama. But this in no way signifies that my country lacks interest in and devotion to the other work of the United Nations regarding the many items on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n81.\tOur mission to serve the cause of international peace and security has been proved by Panama both in the Security Council during our term of office and in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism that we had the honour of presiding over in July and August of this year. Furthermore, our historic background stands us in good stead in the International Court of Justice, in the Economic and Social Council, in the International Law Commission and in the Commission on Human Rights, as it did in the many steps we took in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Nations  and in dealing with the question of the definition of aggression, the prohibition of genocide as a crime against humanity, decolonization and the eradication of discrimination and racial discrimination in the world.\n82.\tThe contributions we have made in this field are based on our unshakeable faith in the ideals which underlie the very existence of the United Nations and which are expressed in the many resolutions of the General Assembly on the principles of international law governing friendly relations and co-operation among States.\n83.\tI believe that the statements that are made in good faith in the general debate of the General Assembly, in order to enhance the universalist mission of the United Nations in bringing together the great and small nations, must be brought to bear when we consider the report that the Secretary-General has submitted on the matter.\n84.\tI think that the best tribute to and the most significant statement of support for the United Nations would be the full implementation of resolution 2925 (XXVII) in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to ensure that it will contribute more widely to the solution of international problems and increase the efficiency of the decisions and effectiveness of resolutions adopted by its constitutional organs."

        "file_text": "\ufeff182.\tFirst of all, Mr. President, I should like on behalf of my delegation to congratulate you most warmly on your accession to the Presidency of the Assembly. We all know how wide is your experience and authority and we know we shall need those two qualities in order to complete our difficult discussions on the many subjects before us at the present session.\n183.\tIn accordance with well-established tradition, the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, has made things easier for us by the submission of his clear, objective and realistic report on the work of the Organization.\n184.\tI should like to join the many speakers who have preceded me in greeting the admission to the United Nations of the two German States and the Bahamas. That brings our Organization closer to the ideal situation, which is the participation of all nations of the world in our work. We are particularly happy at the admission to our Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany, a neighbour and friend with which we enjoy close ties of friendship and fruitful co-operation in a number of international organizations, particularly within the framework of the European communities. I wish to express the conviction that the arrival among us of new Member States represents an appreciable strengthening of the United Nations and I trust that the very few countries which have not yet joined us will be able to do so in the very near future.\n185.\tIf one glances at the international situation today7 one is able to see certain reasons for satisfaction. Is it not true that for the moment there is no major source of war, causing considerable loss of human life? I believe that fact should be stressed and Sir Alec Douglas-Home was quite correct when he quoted the Secretary-General and stated that we could consider with a certain optimism the fact that the United Nations had in the last few years contributed to defusing a number of conflicts [2128th meeting, para. 122], Thanks to the wisdom of enlightened statesmen, satisfactory compromises have recently been achieved that have led to a considerable reduction of hostilities in Indo-China. I trust that the agreements recently reached between India and Pakistan will allow a definitive settlement of the difficulties that still persist on that subcontinent.\n186.\tUnfortunately, the world is not safe from new sources of violence and illegality.\n187.\tIt is with the deepest feelings of sadness and regret that we heard of the tragic death of President Allende and the overthrow by force of a democratically elected regime, regardless of the merits or deficiencies it might have had. For the Chilean people and in the interest of all nations here assembled, I trust that democratic freedoms will promptly be re-established, and we ask above all that, there as everywhere else in the world, respect for human rights be guaranteed to all men irrespective of their political opinions.\n188.\tTo turn to the European continent, the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has just started in Geneva and the negotiations on mutual and balanced reductions of forces in Central Europe will soon enter an active stage.\n189.\tA continent which for many decades has been disturbed will thus be able to make progress on the road of co-operation among countries with different social regimes, on the road to better mutual understanding and, hence, to increased security. I express the hope and the profound conviction that the negotiations under way will serve to ensure not only material exchanges but also, and primarily, better mutual information and a freer exchange of men and ideas, as well as full respect for human rights and intellectual freedoms. Together with my colleague Mr. van der Stoel, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, I should like to stress that, in saying this, our concern is not to intervene in the domestic affairs of certain States but rather to address an appeal to them to prove by tangible deeds that detente and rapprochement between peoples are much more than a vague slogan and have become an everyday reality.\n190.\tIn the Middle East, there has been no progress for a very long time. Although a certain detente is enjoyed all over the world and countries of very different ideologies are in the process of establishing relations that could hardly have been dreamed of only a few years ago, that region is still in a situation which is neither war nor peace and which may at any moment degenerate into a new confrontation. That situation is \u2014 we must unfortunately repeat it-contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Charter, to the rules of international law, to the resolutions of the United Nations and also to the interests even of the parties and all the countries of the region.\n191.\tThe need for a settlement is manifest. The principles on which such a settlement should be based are set forth in the Charter as well as in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). I need not reaffirm the importance of that resolution, which has the twofold advantage of having been adopted unanimously and of defining the respective obligations of the parties. Furthermore, it has acquired particular value since it was accepted by three of the parties concerned, namely, Egypt, Jordan and Israel.\n192.\tThe provision on withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel must, however, be considered in conjunction with the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. These two elements cannot be considered each as a prior condition for the other, since that would lead to never being able to change the situation. Only the parties concerned, either through direct or indirect contacts, whether these are termed negotiations rather than soundings or preparatory talks, can decide by common agreement what in the end will be secure and recognized boundaries and, consequently, what will be the so-called minor changes to be made to these same boundaries.\n193.\tMay I be allowed sincerely to regret the fact that such negotiations have not yet been possible and also that Israel is in the process of creating a fait accomplis in certain parts of the occupied territories, which might jeopardize the very objective of such negotiations.\n194.\tIt is naturally also true, and experience has proved this very often in the past, that it is difficult to maintain for a long period of time a status of strict occupation. That is not an accusation against any of the parties, nor is it an excuse; but it is merely a statement of the regrettable fact that, the more time passes, the more the search for a solution becomes difficult. May I express, contrary to what certain other speakers have said, my conviction that in this specific case time is on no one's side but against all, and my hope that all the countries concerned will realize this and act accordingly before it is too late.\n195.\tFor five years from this rostrum I have drawn the attention of the Assembly to the fact that we must never underestimate the importance of the Palestinian phenomenon within the framework of the Middle East conflict. The inexcusable acts of terrorism and political blackmail exercised through innocent victims should finally prove to the most recalcitrant observers that no final settlement can be arrived at if they overlook this burning question.\n196.\tI come now to the question of colonialism and connected phenomena. Although the situation in this connexion has greatly improved throughout the years, it is nevertheless a fact that millions of human beings are still deprived of their fundamental rights to self-determination, freedom and independence.\n197.\tDespite the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject, we must unfortunately note that colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid continue to prevail particularly in southern Africa.\n198.\tI should like to make the position of my Government very clear on this matter. We are firmly opposed to any\npolicy which an objective examination of the facts allows us to consider as colonialist or subject to convictions of racial discrimination, and we consider the action of Governments following such a policy as reprehensible. My Government gives neither military nor economic assistance to such Governments and fully complies with the mandatory decisions of the Security Council in this respect. However, we do not consider the exclusion of colonialist Governments from international organizations, or even the breaking off of diplomatic relations, as constituting the most effective means of forcing them to change their policies.\n199.\tI should like to add here that I profoundly regret a certain confusion which seems to have been created in the Assembly between the notion of struggling against terrorism and that of opposition to colonial or national liberation movements. The legitimacy of the objectives of the latter can but suffer from that confusion.\n200.\tWe are convinced that it is necessary unreservedly to condemn any terrorist activity endangering the lives of innocent persons. The taking of hostages, the hijacking of aircraft and the resulting blackmail are particularly repugnant crimes which cannot be justified nor excused by any motive and in any circumstances. It is truly deplorable that a series of political motives \u2014 albeit valid but nevertheless secondary when compared to the objective sought \u2014 has prevented the conference recently held in Rome from adopting any concrete decision. It is certainly necessary that this Assembly adopt quick and efficient measures on this matter and that the highest political gatherings of the world thus reaffirm the great moral principle that the end does not justify the means.\n201.\tI come now to another important question, which deals with economic development and social improvements in the world in order to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth among all peoples. Three years have elapsed since the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], and certain doubts have appeared regarding the possibility of achieving the targets set by the Strategy, because of the absence of sufficient funds. That does not necessarily prove that we should give up the Strategy here and now and lose confidence in the results to be expected from the Second Development Decade. Indeed, the Strategy was conceived from the outset as a dynamic instrument which had to be adapted to changing circumstances. Therefore, its contents can be expanded to take into account certain new elements, while the general philosophy and the basic objectives are maintained.\n202.\tThus the interdependence of monetary problems and those raised by economic development and the structure of international trade has been brought to light. Another important element is the poverty of the masses in the developing countries, with all the attendant scourges such as under-employment, malnutrition, lack of decent housing, lack of education and crying inequalities in standards of living. It is urgent that valid solutions be found to these complex problems. In order to do so, we have to replace the old statistical approach of measuring economic growth on a per capita basis by a new concept placing human welfare in all its aspects at the centre of development policy.\n203.\tI should also like to mention the world-wide problem of finding a sufficient supply of food-stuffs and the necessity for an increased international effort to contain the expansion of desert zones and to improve the yield of arid lands. The tragic drought that has devastated a number of Sudano-Sahelian countries in western and central Africa has suddenly brought these two problems to the attention of the world. Very significant assistance has been given following that catastrophe, both on a bilateral basis and through the machinery established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, since it is quite possible that the drought may persist in the region, outside assistance is still indispensable. And for that assistance to be effective, it is imperative that the international community, and the organs of the United Nations in particular, tackle these problems in a co-ordinated fashion.\n204.\tI believe that the proposal made [2124th meeting, para. 71] by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, for the holding next year of a world food conference is a wise one and that preparations should immediately be undertaken for it.\n205.\tI am happy to state, within this general context, that my Government has just decided considerably to increase, within the limits of its possibilities, the assistance we give to the developing countries. This increase will start with the 1974 budget.\n\n206.\tWith regard to the world population problem, it is encouraging to note that the United Nations Special Fund has increased its activities. It is to be hoped that the World Population Conference to be held in Bucharest in 1974 will produce ideas concerning all aspects of this very delicate problem.\n207.\tAll over the world, efforts are being made to create concrete programmes based on the results obtained at the United Nations Conference on the Environment, held at Stockholm in June, 1972. We know that our natural resources are not unlimited and that the search for growth at any price can have extremely grave long-term consequences. In asking nations to protect and improve the common heritage, we must endeavour to seek genuine growth but also to protect the human element. It is therefore urgent to find a way of reconciling the immediate legitimate interests of mankind with the protection of the interests of succeeding generations.\n208.\tIn recent years, the United Nations and its affiliated international organizations have assumed new tasks which the authors of the Charter of San Francisco could not foresee, and thus the very structure of the Organization and the co-ordination among the various organs have become more and more complex. I therefore believe that the time has come to re-examine this evolution as a whole in order to make the necessary improvements while maintaining the central and co-ordinating role which the Charter has entrusted to the Economic and Social Council.\n209.\tI have very briefly tried to express the views of my Government about some of the problems now confronting the United Nations. The achievement of a better world community is an extremely difficult task which\ncalls for the full co-operation of all nations. I trust that the efforts of the present session will bring us closer, under your guidance, Mr. President, to that noble goal.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff86.\tMr. President, my delegation joins others in expressing our sincere congratulations to you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The election of a man of your experience and skill befits the onerous demands of your new office and is a source of confidence and inspiration to my delegation. I hope that through your guidance this session will further the cause of freedom, justice, peace and progress. I therefore pledge my delegation's unqualified support in the successful execution\nof your noble task. I\n87.\tI would also pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, who steered the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of this Assembly with admirable competence and impartiality.\n88.\tI wish to reiterate my Government's sorrow at the recent death of His Majesty King Gustaf VI Adolph of Sweden, whose contribution to the well-being of his own people and to the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations is a living testimony to his achievements.\n89.\tPermit me also to express the shock felt by the party, Government and people of Zambia at the loss sustained by progressive humanity as a result of the tragic death of President Salvador Allende, whose name will go down in history as that of a man who strove to rid his country of the shackles of imperialism and neo-colonialism and to promote the economic independence of the developing countries.\n90.\tMy delegation wishes to extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, which have joined the United Nations. The admission of these States is a manifestation of the significant trend towards the realization of the principle of universality in the United Nations. My delegation hopes that these new Members will add a new and a positive dimension to the proceedings of this session and future sessions of the General Assembly. -\n91.\tThe search for a world order based on freedom, justice, peace and the security of all peoples and countries remains a major preoccupation of Zambia together with other non-aligned and peace-loving countries. This session is taking place hardly a month after that historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held in Algiers in September. I wish, from this rostrum, to pay a tribute to the Government and people of Algeria not only for the warm hospitality they extended to the participants but also for all their untiring efforts, which contributed so much to the success of the Conference. The Algiers Conference was yet another milestone in the determined collective effort of the non-aligned countries to eradicate the many evils that still afflict this world. It is the hope of my delegation that, as in the past, the important .decisions of that recent non-aligned Conference will greatly facilitate the work of this session.\n91. We in Zambia have been consistently opposed to activities and situations which are contrary to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. We have always objected strongly to foreign interference 'in the internal affairs of countries in Indo-China. We believe this to be the major reason for the senseless loss of many lives and destruction of property. We have welcomed with relief the Paris peace agreements on Viet-Nam. We are nevertheless distressed at the persistent violations of these agreements. We have repeatedly condemned the brutal bombings to which the people of Cambodia have been subjected. We have always urged, and urge now, that all forms of foreign interference in Indo-China-and in this particular case in Cambodia and Laos-should cease forthwith so that the people of that region, who have suffered far too long, may be left alone freely to determine their own destiny. This is their right. Indeed, I wish to register our deep admiration for the courage the people of Indo-China have shown in their just struggle to rid themselves of foreign aggression.\n93.\tWe continue to be encouraged by the bilateral negotiations which are aimed as creating favourable conditions for the reunification of Korea without interference from outside. We remain convinced that the immediate withdrawal of United States troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea would be conducive to the early conclusion of the bilateral negotiations and to the goal of reunification. In view of the desire of the people of Korea to reunite, we are opposed to any manoeuvre to have North and South Korea admitted into the United Nations as separate entities.\n94.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a serious threat to international peace and security. In complete defiance and contempt of the decisions of the United Nations, Israel, a State Member of our Organization, continues its illegal occupation of Arab territories. Displaced Palestinians continue to be denied their fundamental rights. In the meantime, they languish in misery, many of them without shelter. The recent report of the Secretary- General  and the subsequent Security Council debate on the situation in the Middle East make it clear that Israel and its supporters are obstructing a peaceful settlement of this crisis. The readiness of the Arab side to make peace has been demonstrated beyond any doubt.\n95.\tIn my address last year,  I referred to the initiative by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and paid a tribute to the 10 members of the Committee of African Heads of State, who, in the OAU efforts to supplement those of the United Nations, visited both Cairo and Tel Aviv. They made every effort to help find a just and durable solution to the problem. The lack of positive response from Israel has caused considerable disappointment to us. As I said earlier, Israel has not complied with numerous United Nations resolutions. It is the duty of the United Nations to ensure that Israel honours its obligation as a Member. We appeal to all States to make earnest efforts towards finding a peaceful and just settlement of the crisis in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We sincerely hope that the current initiative of the Secretary-General will bear fruit.\n96.\tZambia has already welcomed detente in Europe and the process of negotiations that now characterize relations among the major Powers. The relaxation of tension among the super-Powers and their growing willingness to negotiate for the improvement of their mutual relations have reduced the immediate danger of a major world conflict.\n97.\tWhile detente and the process of negotiations among the major Powers and in Europe are gaining momentum, aggression, pressures and interference in the internal affairs of many small and medium-sized countries and the threat of force against them are on the increase. We disapprove of this trend. It is our firm conviction that genuine peace and security, particularly that of developing countries, can come about only if efforts are similarly directed, with the participation of all States on an equal basis, to the solution of the many problems that bedevil the vast majority of the countries of the world. In other words, our goal must be to strengthen international peace and security as a whole. In this connexion I cannot over-emphasize the importance Zambia attaches to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)J adopted by this august body.\n98.\tZambia is opposed to all forms of nuclear testing. This stand is consistent with our commitment to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. We believe that there is an urgent need for the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The partial test-ban Treaty is a half-hearted measure. For that reason, its effectiveness becomes questionable. Quite understandably, there are some among us who consider it both unfair and discriminatory to prohibit others from acquiring nuclear weapons after certain States have accumulated theirs by the same means and continue to improve upon them both qualitatively and quantitatively. It seems to us that only a comprehensive test-ban treaty which will apply to all has greater chances of effectiveness.\n99.\tWe in Zambia deeply regret the unhappy events which made it impossible for a Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference to be formed as envisaged under General Assembly resolution 2930 (XXVII). It is indeed a pity that such developments should have occurred to prevent the implementation of that resolution, which was adopted after protracted and painstaking negotiations. We remain strongly convinced that a world disarmament conference would be a most significant endeavour and perhaps a real beginning in the search for genuine disarmament.\n100.\tWe regret the ineffectiveness of the Conference of -the Committee on Disarmament. We remain convinced that all nations must participate fully as equals, in all discussions that touch on their peace and security. Any bilateral decisions among big Powers which affect other nations, big or small, without full consideration for their legitimate interests, are unacceptable to us. Furthermore, we consider world peace and security based on balance of power, which seems to be the framework of accords bilaterally negotiated between the super-Powers, as nothing but an illusion.\n101.\tSince the last session, Africa has witnessed two sad events. Mr. Amilcar Cabral, President of the Partido Africano de Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde, was brutally assassinated on 20 January 1973 by the agents of\nPortuguese colonialism. The world cannot but deeply mourn the tragic death of that great son of Africa.\n102.\tIn Mozambique, where Portugal still maintains its colonialist policies, the Portuguese Fascist forces brutally murdered 400 innocent men, women and children late last year at the village of Wiriyamu. The Wiriyamu massacre will indeed go down in history with Sharpeville and My Lai as epitomizing the bestiality and savagery of fascism, colonialism and imperialism. These barbarities are in the vile tradition of generations of colonialists who have terrorized and subjugated the people of Africa. It would be outrageous for this Assembly to let those heinous acts by Portugal pass uncondemned.\n103.\tI am glad to say that neither Cabral's tragic death nor the Wiriyamu massacre has deterred the determination of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique from their resolve to free their countries from Portuguese colonialism. Similarly, the struggle in Angola continues.\n104.\tIt is common knowledge that Portugal is a small and poor country. On its own it cannot withstand the onslaught of the freedom fighters in its colonies. Portuguese colonialism in Africa is sustained principally by some of its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. The concern of OAU about any form of assistance given to Portugal which enables it to carry out its atrocious policies in Africa was demonstrated by the appointment of a Special Mission to NATO countries led originally by my own President and concluded last year by Moktar Ould Daddah, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. We appreciate the positive response of certain NATO countries to appeals to them to terminate all such assistance to Portugal. We call upon those NATO countries still rendering this assistance to Portugal to take example from the others. We would like to state further that the countries which supply arms to Portugal, either bilaterally or within any other framework, bear a special responsibility for the atrocities committed by Portugal against the people of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and the rest of Africa.\n105.\tPortugal will not win its colonial wars in Africa. The continuation of colonial wars by Portugal will only cause untold loss of life in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, including loss of life by Portuguese nationals in those areas. The Portuguese regime should now start negotiations with the leaders of liberation movements to bring about independence to these countries. We know the leaders of liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.\n. They are fine men and women. They are not racists. We are convinced that when they take over the management of the affairs in their respective countries, people of all races and all religious beliefs will live together in peace and in harmony.\n106.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the rebel regime has intensified its oppressive and segregationist policies against the 5 million indigenous Africans. During the year, the regime introduced a system of mass arrests and collective, punishments against innocent villagers in the north-eastern area on the mere suspicion that they offered cover to freedom fighters. I must state that in spite of these desperate acts by a clique of frightened men, the freedom fighters will not be discouraged from intensifying the struggle for the liberation of their country.\n107.\tI should like to reiterate what my Government has continued to uphold regarding the obligation, f the British Government as the administering Power in Southern Rhodesia. The British Government must ensure that there should be, no independence in Southern Rhodesia except on the basis of majority rule. In this regard it is incumbent upon the British Government immediately to convene a constitutional conference, representative of all sections of the people of Southern Rhodesia. In order for this objective to be realized, it is imperative for Britain to ensure the release of all political prisoners and detainees so that they can participate in determining the destiny of their country. In this connexion, we condemn the continued detention of African leaders by the illegal regime of Ian Smith.\n108.\tThe problem of Southern Rhodesia has been compounded by external factors. We all know that the illegal regime is very weak internally. However, the breaking of United Nations sanctions continues to be one of the major factors that have sustained the illegal and racist regimes. We regret that certain countries which are in a better position to implement sanctions against the Smith regime are in fact the main culprits. However, we note with appreciation the positive trend in the foreign policies of the new Governments of Australia and New Zealand vis-\u00e0-vis southern Africa.\n109.\tSince the unilateral declaration of independence by the settler minority in Southern Rhodesia, we in Zambia have made sacrifices in our efforts to abide by the decisions of the United Nations which are aimed at bringing about justice to the oppressed people of that country. In pursuance of this policy we have decided to cut off completely dealings with the rebel regime. As a result and at a very high cost to Zambia, we are engaged in rerouting our trade to the north instead of to the south, a route to which we had been tied by the colonial pattern of trade in southern Africa.\n110.\tPermit me to express the sincere thanks of the party, the Government and people of Zambia to all those countries which have responded positively to the appeal by the Security Council in its resolution 329(1973). My delegation would equally like to thank the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his initiatives designed to ensure the implementation of the Security Council resolution.\n111.\tIn examining the problem of southern Africa it is imperative to pay particular attention to South Africa's political, economic and military role in Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia. Apart from intensifying within South Africa its evil policies of apartheid, the effects of which we recently witnessed in the Carletonville massacre, the Pretoria regime's basic foreign policy objective is to sustain the minority regimes of southern Africa. In this regard it should not surprise the international community that South African military forces have joined ranks with those of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and with the Portuguese colonial forces in Mozambique and Angola.\nIn recent months we have witnessed the savage killing of innocent men, women and children by the racist minority regimes, particularly in Mozambique, Southern Rhodesia and Namibia, in a desperate attempt to stifle the efforts of the gallant freedom fighters.\n112.\tSouth African aggression is not confined to the people of countries still under the yoke of minority rule in southern Africa. Together with the Portuguese Fascists and the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia, it has intensified its acts of aggression against neighbouring independent African States. My own country, for instance, has at the hands of the Pretoria-Salisbury-Lisbon axis lost many innocent lives.\n113.\tIn the international Territory of Namibia the racist regime of South Africa is rigorously implementing its apartheid policy through the creation of the so-called \\\"homelands\\\", in complete disregard of the opposition of the Namibian people to any Balkanization of their country. This opposition was unequivocally demonstrated in their boycott of the recent bogus elections organized by the South African occupation forces.\n114.\tWe in Zambia had serious misgivings about the usefulness of the contacts which the Secretary-General of the United Nations has been conducting with the racist regime of South Africa over the question of Namibia, in accordance with the mandate given him by the Security Council in its resolution 302 (1972). His reports have confirmed our anxieties that these contacts are detrimental to the interests of the Namibian people and should therefore be discontinued forthwith. Given the refusal of the South African regime peacefully to terminate its occupation of Namibia, it has become imperative for the Namibian people to intensify their armed struggle.\n115.\tIn the light of these developments in southern Africa, Zambia will continue to render all possible assistance to liberation movements. We - are happy to note that the liberation movements are receiving increased assistance from many parts of the world. They deserve this assistance. They are putting it to good use, for the frontiers of oppression are receding; but their needs are still very considerable. To this end, we wish to appeal to all progressive forces in the world to offer substantial material assistance to the liberation movements.\n116.\tIn my address to this Assembly last year I stated my belief and conviction in the capacity of the United Nations \u2014 particularly of its specialized agencies \u2014 to provide health, transportation, educational and other facilities in the liberated areas of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea- Bissau. The subsequent adoption by the General Assembly of resolutions calling on the specialized agencies of the United Nations to render the assistance indicated in the resolutions on the Territories concerned was a clear endorsement by the international community of the necessity and urgency of such assistance.\n\n117.\tWe are aware of and appreciate the fact that the limited resources at the disposal of the United Nations have\nto be disbursed world-wide. However, we believe most sincerely that the provision of such multilateral assistance would be consistent with the genuine priorities and long-term objectives of the United Nations. Apart from achieving maximum economic effect in the field of development, a token contribution would reflect concrete solidarity between the liberation movements and the United Nations.\n118.\tAs we await the full and effective implementation of the relevant resolutions in this regard, I wish to reiterate another related appeal concerning the full participation of the representatives ,of the liberated areas in dependent countries and of Namibia in the activities of the specialized agencies, on the basis of established criteria applicable to non-Members of the United Nations.\n119.\tIt cannot be overemphasized that the direction and scope of the activities of specialized agencies should, perhaps more than ever before, reflect the priorities of the United Nations. Such priorities are cleat. Given the relaxation of tension between East and West, the potentially explosive problems facing the international community continue to be imperialism, colonialism, apartheid-.and the slow rate of economic and social development of developing countries. In other words, the basic task confronting the world is the attainment of those living standards which are consistent with human dignity \u2014 a task which inevitably demands maximum co-operation and commitment by all parties concerned.\n120.\tMy delegation commends the speedy action of the United Nations in coping with natural disasters and providing and co-ordinating the necessary relief and rehabilitation, as recently demonstrated in Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa. In these situations the specialized agencies have been admirably responsive.\n121.\tThe gap between promise and performance in international economic co-operation continues to widen at a dangerous pace. Problems have been highlighted and\n- diagnosed. Various prescriptions have been advanced, but the will to translate them into practical action consistently continues to be inadequate. We are all aware of these failures. We know that the share of developing countries in international trade has diminished over the past year, despite the spectacular rise in global trade. We equally know of the general unsatisfactory trends in the important economic sectors of these countries. In the absence of political will, particularly on the part of the developed countries, to dispose of their resources in favour of their poor counterparts, the logical result is that outstanding problems become more complex, new ones emerge, and the gap between the poor and the rich continues to widen.\n122.\tGolden opportunities for solving some of the latent and actual problems have been lost out of callous indifference on the part of developed countries, and failures to fulfil their various obligations have been rationalized away. This situation is clearly a despicable disregard of the purposes and the spirit of international economic co-operation.\n123.\tDeveloping countries have experienced, and continue to suffer, disproportionately, the ominous influences of\ninflation and international monetary instability originating from the leading participants in the development process. Such trends and developments have adversely affected the ability of developing countries to contribute meaningfully to the effective implementation of global and other strategies.\n124.\tOn present indications the prospects for forestalling a repetition of the failure of the First United Nations Development Decade will largely depend on the unlikely achievement of total commitment to the set goals by all parties concerned, and particularly the need for developed countries to pay more heed to their responsibilities under the Charter and as prescribed by other relevant international instruments.\n125.\tMembers of this Organization should do their utmost to forestall the erosion of all hopes that the international community has placed in the Second United Nations Development Decade, the failure of whose International Development Strategy would entrench the disappointments which climaxed the end of the first Decade.\n126.\tOur attitudes and commitment as partners in the process of development should consistently reflect the increasingly recognized principle of mutual interdependence in international relations. This demands the adherence to those principles and objectives which recognize the fact that all national, bilateral or regional policies and practices which influence international relations should be regarded as matters of mutual concern. For example, the achievement of detente between the East and West should not be permitted to affect adversely the genuine economic interests of developing countries. Additionally, the forging of closer links by way of preferential trading arrangements among the developed countries should not equally j permitted to erode the benefits of other international arrangements in favour of developing countries. The participation of developing countries in such arrangements whose consequences affect them should be on the basis of equality and mutual advantage.\n127.\tMy delegation recognizes that the significance of the proposal for the drafting of a charter of economic rights and duties of States in terms of the urgent need to safeguard the national sovereignty and independence of all States is that this would improve international economic relations.\n128.\tWhile reaffirming each country's inalienable right to the full exercise of sovereignty over its natural resources, my delegation would at the same time urge greater awareness of the limited character of natural resources and Itherefore the institution of effective measures to ensure their efficient exploitation and utilization. Furthermore, we would hope that current deliberations on various commodity shortage problems will usher in a new era of realism, rationale and economy in the management and exploitation of the world environmental resources for the betterment of mankind.\n129.\tThe important issue pertaining to the role of multinational corporations and the influence of developing countries as well as on international relations in general, has now seriously engaged the attention of the international community.\n130.\tTwo important initiatives in this regard have been undertaken by the United Nations Secretariat under the guidance of 20 eminent persons appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1721 (LIII) of 28 July 1972 and by the group of non-aligned countries as part of their continuing efforts aimed at achieving peace and progress.\n131.\tThe United Nations study on the subject,  the meeting of the economic experts of the group of non- aligned countries recently held in Santiago, Chile, and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September, have on this important subject recognized the urgent need for countervailing action against the negative activities of multinational corporations or the adoption of appropriate measures to place private foreign investment at the service of national development objectives.\n132.\tIn order to give concrete effect to the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, as well as to realize vital national goals, my delegation reaffirms the cardinal right of every nation to undertake all appropriate measures designed to recover its natural resources and aimed at facilitating the full exercise of its control over the exploitation of such resources particularly by private foreign investment.\n133.\tMy delegation equally supports the immediate cessation of any form of interference by countries in which multinational corporations originate in disputes between the latter and their host countries, particularly developing countries.\n134.\tI should now like to turn to another important area in which the United Nations is making efforts. This important area in which the United Nations is making efforts is regarding the progressive development of the international law of the sea.\n135.\tIt will be recalled that during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2750(XXV)J, the United Nations reaffirmed that the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction was the common heritage of mankind. Subsequently, it was decided [resolution 3029 (XXVII)] to convene the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which would deal, inter alia, with the establishment of an equitable international regime \u2014 including an international machinery for the international area and its resources and a broad range of related issues.\n136.\tMy delegation is pleased to learn that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, whose task it has been to prepare for the Conference has made significant progress in the discharge of its responsibility. For instance, the Committee has succeeded in identifying the issues necessitating the holding of the Conference. In some cases, single texts have been agreed upon, and in others alternative texts have been presented. It is our view that adequate preparations have been made on the basis of which we can look forward to the convening of the Conference as originally scheduled.\n137.\tWhile recognizing that the stage has been reached for convening the Conference, we note that previous Conferences on the Law of the Sea gave inadequate attention to the problems of land-locked States.\n138.\tParticular attention needs to be given by the Conference to the following three vital issues. The first relates to the right of land-locked States to free access to the sea. We note that attempts to solve the problem began quite early in the present century. Yet it is recognized that insufficient safeguards have been provided for land-locked countries. Previous conferences have largely left the question for settlement through bilateral or regional negotiations. Past and contemporary experience has vividly shown that this is highly unsatisfactory, especially in southern Africa. To avoid this continuation of such ill effects on international relations it has become necessary that such a right and other related issues should be provided for by the forthcoming Conference.\n139.\tAnother important issue to be decided. by the Conference appears to be whether or not the international area already declared to be the common heritage of mankind, will be the subject of exploration and exploitation by an enterprise or by individual States on licences to be issued by an international authority. We believe that, in order to safeguard the interests of developing countries, some of which rely for their economic survival on land resources which are also to be found in the international area, it would be vital to assign the functions of exploration and exploitation of the area to an enterprise subject to the control of a truly representative international authority. In that way, we would be assured of a strong regime which would safeguard the interests of all States, especially the developing countries.\n140.\tThirdly, concerning the limits of national jurisdiction, we are gratified to note that the Secretary-General, in response to the decisions of this Assembly during its twenty-seventh session, has prepared a study on the economic significance, in terms of sea-bed mineral resources, of the various limits proposed for national jurisdiction.  In establishing uniform limits of the territorial sea, the Conference will need to give due attention to such data.\n141.\tNeedless to say, we have addressed ourselves to only a few of the issues before the forthcoming Conference, which, when assuming its momentous task, should no doubt also have regard to its contribution to international peace and security.\n142.\tZambia attaches great importance to the United Nations. We have consistently held the view that the United Nations is vital to human development. Its importance in the maintenance of peace and security in the world is invaluable, for through it all States are able to give expression to their equality among the rest of the members of the human family. The United Nations, in our view, is one of the greatest expressions of interdependence in an ever-growing and ever-more-complex international community. Consequently, one of the cardinal principles of Zambia's foreign policy is to support the United Nations.\n143.\tThis is not to say that all is well with our Organization. As I stated earlier, in my address to this august body at its twenty-seventh session, there is a growing crisis of confidence in the ability and authority of the United Nations to deal effectively with pressing international problems such as the achievement of human freedom and independence.\n144.\tWe must act now to restore confidence in this vital instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. As we move closer to a fuller realization of the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations, an essential and important element for its effectiveness, we must at the same time weed out all impediments in order to ensure that the Organization assumes its proper role for the benefit of mankind. The growing tendency, particularly among the super-Powers, to bypass the United Nations in dealing with problems of vital importance and interest to the whole of the international community should be discouraged, as it has, inter alia, the effect of eroding the prestige and authority of this Organization. The principle of equitable and more-broadly- based geographical representation in all major organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies must be fully realized. The Security Council, the organ charged with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, must cease to be a preserve of the big Powers, where they can use their power to veto at will in order to protect their interests and those of their allies. We wish to reiterate our belief that the time has come for a review of the whole question of permanent membership in the Security Council. We strongly believe that a new criterion for eligibility should be devised. In our view, this should be based not on military or economic power, but rather on the principle of equitable geographical representation. Mere military or economic strength should not be the criterion for permanent membership in the Security Council. Certain countries falling within this category are guilty of protecting and sustaining the racist minority regimes of southern Africa. Such behaviour does not befit the responsibilities that they have assumed, as it is in itself a contravention of the Charter, let alone the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly.\n145.\tWe would also urge the elimination of the privilege of veto enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council, or at least the institution of measures that will guarantee against its abuse. It is intolerable that the wishes of the vast majority of countries should be frustrated by one permanent member.\n146.\tAlthough much remains to be done, the international community has taken significant steps towards realizing the objectives of the United Nations. The areas of crisis are being reduced, if somewhat slowly; some of the goals are in sight. The phenomenal growth of the non-aligned movement is gradually transforming a divided international community into one. I wish to reaffirm Zambia's commitment to the objectives of the United Nations. Zambia, along with other peace-loving nations, will continue to work tirelessly for the attainment of these objectives."

        "file_text": "\ufeff88.\t Mr. President, first of all may I thank you for allowing me to\naddress the Assembly from this rostrum. Furthermore, on behalf of the nationals of the countries commonly called the countries of the third world, I wish to congratulate you on your brilliant election to preside over the General Assembly of the United Nations. I have no doubt that, owing to your well-known reputation as a statesman, you will carry the heavy burdens it imposes with competence and to the immense satisfaction of the General Assembly and to the pride of the so-called third world. Glancing at your biography, Sir, I find both pleasure and pride in discovering that you, like myself, were at one time a journalist.\n89.\tThe people of Zaire, at one with the Popular Movement of the Revolution, our national party, has entrusted me with presenting the thanks of the citizens of Zaire to the United Nations through this august Assembly.\n90.\tIf a small minority of States Members of this Organization refused to participate in the Congo operation at that time, the great majority nevertheless spontaneously placed troops at the disposal of the Organization, or assisted financially in the carrying out of the operation that allowed us to maintain peace and the unity and integrity of national territory. Through the United Nations, Zaire wishes to give heart-felt thanks to all parties.\n91.\tI will take advantage of this opportunity to pay a tribute also to the Secretaries-General of the world Organization who have worked so hard and have been able to assure us of our existence.\n92.\tMy thoughts go out particularly to the late Dag Hammarskjold, who died in the service of this important Organization and of the Republic of Zaire.\n93.\tMy tribute must also be addressed to his successor, U Thant, who gave himself body and soul to the maintenance of peace in the world and who paid special attention to the cause of Zaire.\n94.\tI am very grateful, finally, for the appointment of Mr. Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I wish for him a brilliant and fruitful career.\n95.\tAll the world knows the circumstances that surrounded the accession of my country to independence. In 1960, Zaire, which was still called the Congo, collapsed one night like a house of cards. A number of experts in colonialism had decided hastily that our people were congenitally incapable, attempting to prove thereby that the independence of new nations was an unsuccessful operation. We were presumed and judged incapable of governing ourselves without the colonizers.\n96.\tBut we believe that the accident that occurred in Zaire was foreseeable. Despite the fact that by the Act of Berlin of 1885 the Zaire river basin was opened to the entire world, Zaire itself was isolated from the world. It was outside the pale of progressive ideas.\n97.\tFurthermore, at the time it attained independence my country, 80 times larger than its one-time\nmetropolitan area, had only 10 national cadres that had completed their university studies; and in the administration, in the army and in the private sector, there was not a single Zairean cadre.\n98.\tIt was for that reason that 1960 to 1965 were dreadful years for us and we are forced to recognize that anarchy, chaos, disorder, blindness and incapacity prevailed in Zaire.\n99.\tSome of you may have to consult your dictionary to find out precisely what the word \\\"anarchy\\\" means, but we in Zaire were so well acquainted with it that many people felt that the word \\\"anarchy\\\" was an invention of Zaire. That is why disorder in any part of the world was baptized \\\"congolization\\\".\n100.\tOur country suffered because of its lack of political preparation; but it suffered above all because of the greed of the West and the East. Both of them tried to gain a decisive influence over us so that they could control our important natural resources. Some wanted to recolonize us economically, whereas others wished to dominate us ideologically.\n101.\tZaire, which went through indescribable chaos to become an organized and well-governed country, after its unfortunate experience finally recognized its true friends. The Zairean experience is based on a political philosophy that we call authenticity. This is an awareness on the part of the people of Zaire that they should return to their beginnings and search for the values of their ancestors in order to appreciate the values which contribute to the country's harmonious and natural development. It is the refusal of the people of Zaire blindly to espouse imported ideologies. It is the affirmation of the worth of the Zairean, or of any man, as he is and where he is, with the mental and social structures that are his own. A return to authenticity is not narrow nationalism, a blind return to the past. On the contrary, it is a useful instrument for peace among nations, a condition for existence among peoples, a platform on which co-operation among States can be built. For authenticity not only implies a profound knowledge of one's own culture, but also a respect for the cultural heritage of others.\n102.\tThus, strengthened by this experience, we in all modesty believe that Zaire can now give to the world its own interpretation of problems that confront us.\n103.\tWe shall start by dealing with our own continent, Africa. For Africa today remains the only continent where colonization, racial segregation, apartheid and contempt of man because of the pigmentation of his skin persist. Africa is a continent that has suffered some of the greatest humiliations of recorded history.\n104.\tFor centuries the situation of the black man in Africa has deteriorated. Under the pretext that they had come to Africa to civilize us, the first whites, the pioneers of that civilization, began by emptying our respective countries of their fundamental substance through the shameful practice of slave-trading \u2014 and even at that period the chief offenders were the Portuguese. Our ancestors were not considered as men, or even as beings with intelligence and feeling. They were considered as a set of muscles fit for mechanical labour such as we expect from an animal \u2014 a horse, a buffalo, a donkey or an ox.\n105.\tSlavery continued and in the nineteenth century became a veritable catastrophe for the African continent. To justify themselves, these colonialists and slave-traders pitted us against our Arab brothers, affirming their role in slavery. They pretend to forget that the Arabs were only brokers and commissioners, because slave-trading of the blacks was carried on for the sole profit of the whites.\n106.\tThe colonial countries of Europe very rapidly learned the meaning of the adage that you can never be better served than by yourself. Thus, in 1885 the great slave-traders of the period met in Berlin and, like vultures, carved up the African continent among themselves. No more would slave-trading raids cost them dear. Unorganised occupation would not occur again; it would now be premeditated and organized. The exploitation of the blacks would not be sporadic; it would now become systematic, permanent and definitive by the pure and simple appropriation of the African territories by the slave-traders. The black had no longer to escape the raids he lost his rights, his country and his freedom. The process of dehumanization had begun. The black had to give up his personality, his mental and social structures \u2014 in a word, his authenticity.\n107.\tPseudo-scientific arguments in which the black was alleged to be an inferior being were not lacking to justify this business of dehumanization. They maintained that the white colonizers were different from the blacks whom they colonized and, therefore, superior to them. In order to perpetuate the exploitation of the black by the white, the colonizers systematically set about destroying African traditions, African languages, African culture \u2014  in a word, making a brute of the black man so that he could only speak, think, eat, dress, laugh or breathe as the white man did.\n108.\tDespite the huge organization created to perpetuate the slavery of the black man, the whites of Europe could not extinguish the flame of freedom and dignity in black Africa. Thus, about 1960 an irresistible and irreversible feeling for freedom seized all the peoples of Africa and led to disarray among the colonialists who were not prepared for it. The black man broke his shackles and said \\\"No\\\" to exploitation and' to his alienation by the West.\n109.\tA fruit falls only when it is ripe; but in the storms' and the tempests of history the fruit falls, whether ripe or not.\n110.\tFrom that time on, we believed that the colonialists finally understood that history cannot be turned back. But today's experience shows that Africa has not yet reached the end of its suffering, for the colonialists are still waging a rear-guard action. In fact, white mercenaries paid by certain countries have tried to re-conquer some countries that have already gained independence. This was the case in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Sudan, the Federal Republic of Nigeria and in my own country, Zaire.\n111.\tIn the town of Bukavu, in eastern Zaire, a white mercenary from Europe, seriously proclaimed himself President of the Republic of Zaire. Had a black man done so in Europe, he would immediately have been taken for a hoaxer or a mental case; but, since he was a white man doing so in Africa, the colonialists mobilized the press, radio and television and placed them all at his disposal, not only to offer him publicity, but also to ridicule the Chief of State of Zaire, myself. My position has not been challenged in my own territory, or in any of the countries represented here. But such provocation was an intolerable insult to me which I cannot pardon.\n112.\tAt this very moment that I am speaking to you, the anachronistic situation at present prevailing in Angola, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa would be unthinkable without the hidden support of certain Powers.\n113.\tHow can one explain the fact that a country like Portugal has the strength to control enormous territories such as Angola and Mozambique unless it is upheld by more powerful nations than itself? In fact Portugal is an economically, socially and culturally under-developed nation. It has no democracy. It has no military force. Its sole record is that of having the highest level of illiteracy in Europe. Its strength and its arrogance are directly linked with its membership in NATO. Portugal, with its colonies, is strategically necessary for that military organization.\n114.\tThe volume of investment and capital coming from the West to the Portuguese colonies increases daily. The building of the Cabora Bassa dam, which will serve mainly the Republic of South Africa, shows unequivocally that the interested Powers will always oppose the liberation and independence of the countries I have mentioned. Furthermore, the Minister of the Interior and of Information, Mr. Cornelius Mulder, recently stated that the Republic of South Africa was ready to supply military support to all the countries of southern Africa, including Mozambique and the other Portuguese territories, in order to combat what he called terrorism \u2014  in 'other words, the heroic struggle of the African nationalists. Mr. Mulder made that statement when he was on a visit to Rhodesia to inspect the units of the South African army that are fighting, together with the Rhodesian forces, against the Zimbabwe patriots.\n115. Between the two Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique there is a country where some years ago a similar situation developed. Call it what you will, it is a scandalous situation. I am referring now to Rhodesia. One morning we learned from the press that after a number of secret meetings between the Government of Her Very Gracious Majesty the Queen of England and the British settlers in Rhodesia, the latter had rebelled against their Government, their country and their sovereign and that the authorities of Great Britain were unable to induce their compatriots in Africa to change their minds.\n116.\tThe motto of Great Britain is Dieu et mon Droit \u2014  God and my right. I presume that means that the role of the Government of that country is to ensure that justice prevails where it has authority; but glancing at the history of that great people we note that it has largely justified the existence of that motto and even gone beyond mere justice at times to what it might term the sole right of the great island. To be convinced, all we need do is recall the innumerable movements of rebellion and independence that have been so violently squashed by Great Britain in the course of its history. As regards Africa, the example of Kenya suffices \u2014 strikingly so. In fact, the injustice of the British Government, which reserved the best lands for its own settlers in that country, led to the legitimate revolution of the Mau Mau. That revolt was savagely squash  by the butchery of approximately 15,000 persons.\n117.\tThe case of the United States of America, which valiantly struggled to attain its independence, is far too well known to be dwelt on here. Everywhere, in Kenya, India, Guyana, Cyprus, Aden, Palestine, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Great Britain has resorted to force to ensure that its authority would prevail \u2014 everywhere except, strangely enough, in Rhodesia.\n118.\tAnd yet the Africans of Rhodesia, counting on the justice of that great country, had earlier trusted the British Government; unfortunately they had to change their tune. One day 2,000 black rioters who had climbed the trees around Salisbury airport to welcome the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, chanted the following: \\\"We are black. We are the orphans of Rhodesia. No one helps us. No one loves us.\\\" The white police answered, \\\"Leave those damned monkeys. Let them go back to the trees they came from.\\\"\n119.\tThat is why we denounce racism. It is premeditated; it is ignoble; it is inhuman.\n120.\tMuch has been said about economic sanctions to put down the secession in Rhodesia but in point of fact Great Britain carefully protects its friend in NATO, Portugal, and the latter in turn protects its friends the British settlers of Rhodesia. Paradoxically, they do not manage to discourage the secessionists, but they are managing to stifle an independent country \u2014 Zambia. Great Britain, which considers itself the most traditionally democratic country in the world, the defender of fundamental freedoms and the legitimate rights of man, accepts, tolerates and implicitly upholds its 200,000 rebellious subjects who, contrary to the elementary rules of democracy, keep 4 million blacks in slavery.\n121.\tThe situation of the Portuguese and British territories reaches as far as South Africa. That is the only country in the world where the whites have raised segregation to the level of an institution. The term apartheid would not exist in human language had the whites not been in South Africa.\n122.\tInstead of being logical with themselves and consistent in allowing blacks and whites to be separated, each group developing according to its own fashion, the whites push their barbarism by exploiting the black man, as they did in the old days of slavery. Thus, thanks to an almost free labour force, 420,000 blacks extract by hand two thirds of the world's production of gold, for the profit of the whites. And the blacks of South Africa have no right to strike, no trade union rights, no rights at all. They have asked for an absurdly small increase in their wages, taking account of the present world price of gold, but they have simply been beaten down by the South African authorities.\n123.\tThe Republic of South Africa has plagued the United Nations for over 20 years with the problem of Namibia. Now the South African racists are Balkanizing that great African territory.\n124.\tFaced by this conspiracy against independent Africa, three countries, those most directly concerned, have tried to co-ordinate their efforts in order to ensure, on the one hand, their own security and, on the other hand, the freedom of the countries at present occupied. I take advantage of this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to my brothers, Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda, for their wisdom and their determination to secure African liberation. The pooling of our resources within the framework of a permanent tripartite conference, will, I am sure, allow the creation of an axis of dissuasion, Kinshasa-Lusaka-Dar-es-Salaarn. All those who love Africa should assist Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire in shouldering their responsibilities.\n125.\tOn a number of occasions, particularly in the Lusaka Manifesto,  Zaire has joined other African States to convince and persuade the racists of southern Africa to give up their wrong ways, but that attitude of good will has been received with complete contempt.\n126.\tNow that we have achieved political, economic and social stability, we cannot be happy while our brothers of Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia are still languishing under the yoke of the Portuguese colonialists, the British settlers of Rhodesia and the racists of South Africa. Furthermore, Zaire is the link between a number of African countries.' We are surrounded by French-speaking, English- speaking, Portuguese-speaking and Arab-speaking countries.\n127.\tFrantz Fanon used to say that Africa looked like a revolver whose trigger was in Zaire. It is therefore an imperative political duty for Zaire to make its material and military contribution to all its neighbours that are still subjected to colonialism of any sort. The daughters and sons of Zaire have entrusted me with informing this Assembly that as of this moment Zaire as a whole is mobilized to fight against all the racists and colonialists of southern Africa. If we must place our finger on the trigger of the African revolver of Frantz Fanon, Zaire is ready to shoulder all its responsibilities. All countries that call themselves our friends will, I trust, be on our side, and in practical fashion. For as far as we are concerned, passivity in this field is equivalent to complicity.\n128.\tMy country is ready to undertake this sacred struggle, whatever may be the sacrifices involved. And we shall never retreat, regardless of what may happen, regardless of what it may cost. The struggle for African liberation also has its moments of satisfaction, and it was with enthusiasm that we welcomed the birth of a new independent State, Guinea-Bissau. Zaire hastens to support the candidacy of that new State for membership in our Organization.\n129.\tIt is obvious that Portugal feels that it has been undermined by this new victory for Africa. For, despite its belonging to NATO, despite the quantities of weapons and troops used to keep Guinea-Bissau under its thumb, the daughters and sons of that country have just thrown Portuguese colonialism out of their national territory. Thus any new intervention on the part of Portugal in Guinea-Bissau will have to be considered as aggression, pure and simple, against an independent State.\n130.\tEvery continent has its problems, and Africa has its own. It is the situation I have just described to you.\n131.\tBut there is another problem also of the greatest interest to our continent, namely the situation in the Middle East. In plain words, it is the Israeli-Arab question that concerns us.\n132.\tThe situation prevailing in that part of the world is without doubt the most complex and the most delicate confronting mankind today. To listen to the protagonists, one is tempted to conclude that the point of departure agreed to by all is Security Council resolution 242 (1967). But each of the parties has its own interpretation of that resolution, and in any case no one is implementing it.\n133.\tYou may perhaps be wondering where Zaire stands in this matter. In Zaire, before taking any decision, we try to analyse the facts objectively. It seems to us both childish and unrealistic to believe in the myth about throwing the Israeli people into the sea. That people does exist and it has a right to live. But it is also true that the Palestinian people has the same right as the Israeli people, that is, the right to have a homeland and to live in peace. It is therefore inadmissible that the refugees of 1947 should have been displaced to become refugees a second time in 1956 and a third time in 1967. The Jewish people, which suffered under nazism and from all sorts of racism, should understand better than any other people the sufferings of the Palestinian refugees, who for a quarter of a century have been without a homeland.\n134.\tTime and again Israel has called for secure and recognized frontiers. But Israel has never said what they should be. For 1956. replaced 1947, and 1967 replaced 1956. Perhaps tomorrow other frontiers will be demanded, and for that reason the Arab people believe, in their turn, that they run the risk of being thrown into the sea, only this time it would be the Indian Ocean. In the Middle East there exist three kinds of reflexes: the reflex of fear, for the Israeli people; the reflex of 'despair, for the Palestinian people; and the reflex of humiliation, for the Arab people. That, we believe, is how the problem stands.\n135.\tLately, when an African country takes a sovereign decision in the Israeli-Arab conflict, the Israeli authorities declare that that decision was dictated purely and simply by the Arab countries; and what is more, that the African leaders were paid for taking such a decision. Such allegations are serious and insulting.\n136.\tFurthermore, we can only be astonished at the visit to Israel just recently made by the Minister of the Interior and for Information of the racist State of South Africa, Mr. Cornelius Mulder. That visit gives us a lot to think about with regard to the orientation of Israel's African policy, and hence, the future of Israel's relations with independent Africa. Zaire, which has now reached the moment when it must choose, must dispel all misunderstanding and remove a certain ambiguity resulting from its African vocation. Zaire has therefore to choose between a friendly country, Israel, and a brother nation, Egypt. But between a friend and a brother the choice is clear, and our decisions are made in full independence and freedom from all pressures.\n137.\tTherefore, by virtue of the prerogatives conferred upon me by article 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of Zaire, I announce to all the world the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Israel, such severing of relations to continue until Egypt and the other Arab countries involved have recovered their territories at present under occupation.\n138.\tLike the Middle East, concerning which I have just spoken, Asia has for some decades been torn by savage wars. Nevertheless, we are gratified at the development of the situation in Viet-Nam and Laos. And here we must straightforwardly recognize the political courage of the President of the United States of America and his Government in having realized that a military victory was impossible despite the resources being employed.\n139.\tConcerning Cambodia, we believe that what goes for Viet-Nam and Laos also goes for that country. I fervently wish for the people of Cambodia a rapid return to conditions of domestic peace.\n140.\tRegarding the problem of Korea, the Republic of Zaire enjoys excellent relations with both parts of that land, North and South, that share the votes of the Korean people. For this reason, we suggest to all Members of our Organization that they refrain from taking any action that might widen the gulf between the two parties, and that, rather, they help them to pursue the course that they have freely chosen for themselves, namely that leading to reunification. In the meantime, they can be admitted as observers. And if they succeed, as we earnestly hope they will, in reaching unity, we will, needless to say, have a single Korean nation represented here by a single delegation. But if, unfortunately, the goal at present being sought is not reached, then we shall have to bow to the inevitable and admit two delegations, just as we have done in the case of the two Germanys.\n141.\tZaire believes that the admission of the two Germanys to membership in the United Nations is a contribution to the maintenance of peace in the world.\nZaire, therefore, through me, welcomes the presence in this hall of the representatives of those two countries.\n142.\tTurning now to the Conference on Security and Co -operation in Europe, according to information in our possession, that security also concerns the Mediterranean basin. But when we speak of the Mediterranean basin we are also talking about the coastal countries, and this inevitably brings into the work of that Conference our brother countries in Africa, namely, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.\n143.\tI would like to say something now concerning some problems very close to us, those involving international economic relations between the rich countries, commonly called the \\\"developed countries\\\", and our countries, arbitrarily called the \\\"countries of the third world\\\". I am speaking here, of course, as a representative of my country, but also as an African leader and a citizen of what is known as the \\\"third world\\\".\n144.\tIn Zaire we challenge that term, \\\"third world\\\", which to us makes no logical sense. For if what is sought is an economic definition, that is to say, if we talk about a country with a capitalist system, which belongs to one category, and a country with a collectivist system, which belongs to another, that would mean that all the others are neither capitalist nor collectivist. And this is not quite true from the economic point of view, for certain so- called \\\"third world\\\" countries have in fact either a capitalist system or a collectivist system. Nor can one justify the term \\\"third world\\\" from either a geographical standpoint or a population standpoint, because the \\\"third world\\\" does not constitute one third of mankind, but rather two thirds; and that is why we find that the term \\\"third world\\\" is accompanied by a feeling of condescension. Consequently, this term is outmoded. For those who invented it, there exists a category of countries known as \\\"Western\\\" countries, and others which form the club of what is known as \\\"the East\\\". Apart from these, all other countries are pigeonholed under the same label: \\\"third world\\\".\n145.\tThe element of scorn, of contempt felt by certain colonial countries does not stop there. They began by calling the so-called third world countries \\\"backward\\\" countries. The people who coined this word found it too strong themselves and tried to mitigate it by replacing it with the word \\\"under-developed\\\". And now, in order to avoid wounding diplomatic sensibilities, we are called \\\"developing\\\" countries.\n146.\tIn Zaire we wonder exactly what development means. Is it possible to term \\\"developed countries\\\" those which possess an impressive number of cars, which build thousands of miles of roads, which pollute the waters, the seas and^ the air? Shall we call \\\"under-developed countries\\\" those whose inhabitants are poor \u2014 as certainly they are \u2014 but which have fewer cases of suicide, fewer murders and fewer disturbed and sadistic people?\n147.\tI must confess that I have never considered Zaire, my country, as under-developed, because my people are disciplined, hard-working, full of dignity and pride, while\nthe countries which call themselves \\\"developed\\\" are the scene of social disturbances, of strikes. That is why we prefer the term \\\"equipment\\\" to that of \\\"development\\\". We are quite willing to recognize that we are under- equipped by comparison with other countries, and that is precisely the understanding of the specialists in the Western economy when they are in a mood to face the facts.\n148.\tThe United States of America is the leading member of the club of the 10 richest countries of the world and it has proved this by landing the first man on the moon. But it is never said that the other nine members are under-developed by comparison; all that is said \u2014 as we say \u2014 is that they are under-equipped by comparison with the United States.\n149.\tWhat I have said proves that the concept of \\\"developing countries\\\" is wrong and specious because for each of us there is always someone who is better equipped or worse equipped than himself, and we are all in a perpetual stage of development; that is to say, we are developing. Also, those who call themselves developed should realize that the under-equipped countries have themselves realized their own condition. Indeed, the latter have finally understood that the division of the world is not a function of ideology or a degree of industrialization of the various countries.\n150.\tThe world is divided into two camps: the dominators and the dominated, the exploiters and the exploited. The poor countries are not what they are because of . congenital incompetence; they are so because of history which has resulted in certain countries dominating, exploiting and robbing others in order to get rich themselves. It is a matter of mathematical logic: when the rich exploit the poor, the rich become even richer and ^he poor become even poorer.\n151.\tToday it is good publicity to talk of the assistance given by the rich countries to the poor countries. When a rich country gives only one kilo of medicine to a poor country, the press, radio and television are called in, diplomatic speeches are exchanged; some boast of the aid and others give thanks for it. This propaganda has even aroused, among certain theoreticians of rich countries, opposition to assistance to poor countries because they say it is the poor of the rich countries who enrich the rich of the poor countries. Nothing could be less true because, if you take a good look at the situation, you will note that, paradoxically enough, assistance benefits the donor country above all.\n152.\tIn fact, what are the forms of assistance? One can distinguish three forms in particular: fellowships for students, assistance in personnel, and financial assistance.\n153.\tWhen a fellowship is granted to a young student from a poor country, it is spent entirely by the student in the rich country. It may even happen that the scholarship is not sufficient, that the poor country has to provide a supplement; that is to say, in fact, what amounts to a transfer of capital from the poor country to the rich country.\n154.\tThe same goes for those who are called technical assistants; their salaries are spent in the country of which they are nationals. In Zaire, for example, we house them, we provide them with transport, we pay their salaries, and we pay for their annual vacations and their return tickets. As for their salaries, half is transferred monthly to their accounts in their home countries. A large proportion of our external payments is made up of transfers of salaries from expatriate workers. Again in the case of Zaire, every year we have to grant a sum of $40 million for salary transfers for technical assistants.\n155.\tReference is often made to financial assistance, but if one takes a close look at that too, it will be seen that the credits of the donor countries are accompanied by conditions with regard to the provision of equipment and by exorbitant interest rates and very short repayment periods. Furthermore, they remain in the vaults of the banks of the rich countries, and the beneficiary countries do not receive a single cent to spend at home. So it is actually as if the poor country were financed without actually benefiting from this financial assistance. It might be said \u2014 to use the language of financiers \u2014 that what we have here is a kind of self-financing of the rich countries.\n\n156.\tFurthermore, my country transfers annually to the former metropolitan country, as payment for services and in dividends of the private companies established in our country, a sum which ranges from $300 million to $350 million. And that is why I am wondering who is helping whom. I am convinced that in this particular field we are not really speaking the same language.\n157.\tThat is why, if the rich countries really want to help the poor countries, they must protect them from credit facilities, research departments and international experts. Let me explain. At the drop of a hat, unscrupulous merchants in the West offer us all kinds of credit facilities. They may sell us paper, cigarettes, water, even air, on what they call easy terms, without taking account of the way in which this causes our external indebtedness to deteriorate.\n158.\tThe rich countries should not be concerned only with assisting their industries to export on any terms whatsoever, but should also take account of the financial situation of the importing countries.\n159.\tI have just said that we in Zaire prefer the term \\\"equipment\\\" to that of \\\"development\\\", and there is ho disgrace in recognizing that we are behind in .terms of equipment in comparison with many countries in the world. This is the result primarily of a lack of sufficient skilled manpower. This lack has given rise to a category of individuals known as experts. These experts should come to do a precise kind of work and for a limited time, until their counterparts have been trained. But what we very often see, unfortunately, is that, instead of considering themselves transient elements, they cling to their jobs, working in ivory towers and hiding their files so that they will always be needed.\n160.\tAs to the research departments, they are rather like the tongue of Aesop: the best and the worst of things. While it is true that a good research department can carry out a useful survey for the country, it is also true, unfortunately, that often a research department does not work towards the solution of a problem, but rather to identify many problems which give rise to new surveys. Many research departments are therefore not really doing their proper work \u2014 that is, solving a problem \u2014  but, rather, are working to create new markets.\n161.\tIf I criticize the organization of technical assistance, it is not just for the sake of doing so, and it does not mean that I am not sincerely grateful to all those who have helped my country to overcome its difficulties, but because I consider there are other ways which are more disinterested and more effective.\n162.\tTake, for example, co-operation between China and Zaire. Since the month of January this year, Zaire has been the scene of a unique experiment in the field of co-operation: that is, the assistance given by China to my country. The Chinese technical assistants in our country receive no air tickets from us and they transfer no salaries to their home country. The Chinese experts adopt the same way of life as their Zaire counterparts. The Chinese moves about, lives and eats exactly as does his Zaire counterpart. In the field of financial assistance, China has made us a large loan on a very long term and without interest. This, in my view, is a fine example to follow if you want to help an under-equipped country.\n163.\tWe should always have present in our minds the fact that the world is at a cross-roads. It is no longer divided by ideology, nor even all that much by race or by political geography, but by economics, and this is the real essence of the question of relations among the peoples of the world today.\n164.\tMore than once the poor countries have uttered cries of alarm, asking the rich countries to understand their precarious situation in the economic world today. The last summit meeting of non-aligned countries in Algiers,  whose report will be given from this rostrum by the current President, Mr. Boumediene of Algeria, stressed unequivocally the danger of allowing such a situation of flagrant injustice to persist.\n165.\tMore than once we have denounced the scandalous deterioration of the terms of trade, and certain theoreticians of the West, in order to ease their consciences, have attempted to demonstrate that the quality of manufactured products has improved while primary commodities have remained the same, and that hence it is logical for manufactured products to cost more than primary commodities. Such theoreticians have demonstrated obvious bad faith. For example, when you are making up a menu, you may have meat, vegetables, fruit, coffee and tea. Now you may think that those products have not changed much over the years, but the prices of the products of the rich countries \u2014 meat, for example \u2014 have soared upwards, while coffee and tea remain subject to permanent fluctuations. Rubber, which we produce, costs less than it cost 2*0 years ago, while the\ntires that we buy have constantly gone up in price. The petroleum produced by the under-equipped countries is cheaper than the mineral water produced by the equipped countries.\n166.\tThe consequence of all this is the appreciable improvement in the standard of living of the equipped countries, to the detriment of the under-equipped countries. As an example, the peasants of the Kivu mountains, who grow tea, are always barefoot, while the management of Lipton, which markets the Zaire tea, lounge about in the finest mansions of the world.\n167.\tI think that this injustice stems from the fact that the rich countries are at the same time judges and litigants, because it is they and they alone who set the prices for our primary commodities and the prices of their manufactured products.\n168.\tThis situation is often aggravated by the policy of the large multinational companies which, when they invest in a country, take no interest in that country but simply in their profits; and when those companies come to us they do not create a new company, but a tenth or a hundredth or even a thousandth branch. The host country therefore becomes a simple pawn at the mercy of the might and power of a given multinational company.\n169.\tThe problem of the poor countries is merely a reflection on a world scale of the problems which exist on the national level. Thus, the workers and peasants are often in revolt in the rich countries, and the leaders of those countries find this quite normal; whereas our revolt, just as legitimate, is passed off as obliviousness, demagogy and political instability.\n170.\tIt is quite wrong, therefore, to believe that the assistance of the rich countries has the result that the poor of the rich countries enrich the rich of the poor countries. I believe that you will come to the same conclusion as I, after what I have just explained: that it is the poor of the poor countries who enrich the rich of the rich countries.\n171.\tIt is time, in my humble judgement, to think of true solidarity and of assistance on the world level. Assistance must be genuine and not a matter of publicity. In Africa, primarily in Zaire, when you help someone you should do it with discretion. You must be sensitive to the dignity of the recipient, because any assistance which humiliates the recipient is never appreciated. Assistance must be deep- seated and not simply a passing matter.\n172.\tThe drought which has afflicted the Sahelian countries in Africa has certainly led to some bursts of generosity. Food parcels have been sent \u2014 but I have not heard of a single rich country which has decided to make a gift of those countries' debts to it. That would be true aid.\n173.\tI would request this great Assembly to adopt a resolution requesting the rich countries to remit the debts of the drought-stricken African countries because the scourge of the drought has only served to aggravate their already precarious situation. Let us not forget that several of those countries have the sad privilege of being among the poorest countries of the world, a fact recognized by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n174.\tB\u00bb't assistance should not only be the business of certain rich countries vis-\u00e0-vis all poor countries. In my view, we must all help each other. A poor country always can find another country poorer than itself that it can help, and it is not impossible that in the rich countries there are poor people who are even poorer than the poor people of the poor countries. They also need everyone's help.\n175.\tThat is why it is time to talk of world solidarity. All countries must participate in aid, everyone giving to those more unfortunate than himself some assistance which comes from his heart. That is what we intend to do in Zaire, because everything we do is without publicity, without conditions, without calculation and without ulterior motives.\n176.\tAmong the claims of the under-equipped countries, particularly the former colonial countries, there is a matter of vital importance. This relates to the cultural heritage of our countries. During the colonial period we suffered not only from colonialism,' slavery, economic exploitation, but also and above all from the barbarous, systematic pillaging of all our works of art. In this way the rich countries appropriated our best, our unique works of art, and we are therefore poor not only economically but also culturally.\n177.\tThose works of art, which are to be found in the museums of the rich countries, are not our primary commodities but the finished products of our ancestors. Those works, which were acquired for nothing, have increased in value so much that none of our countries has the material means to recover them.\n178.\tWhat I am telling you is fundamental, because every rich country, even if it does not possess all the masterpieces of its best artists, has at least the bulk of them. Thus, Italy has those of Michelangelo; France, of Renoir; Belgium, of Rubens; and Holland, of Rembrandt and Vermeer. Another circumstance which demonstrates that what I am saying is right is that Hitler pillaged the Louvre during the Second World War and took away the magnificent works of art which were there. When liberation came, even before thinking of signing the armistice France did everything in its power to recover its art objects, and that is quite right. That is why I would also ask this General Assembly to adopt a resolution requesting the rich Powers which possess works of art of the poor countries to restore some of them so that we can teach our children and our grandchildren the history of their countries.\n179.\tI believe also that it is my duty to draw the attention of this august Assembly to the collective responsibility of the human race. All leaders are responsible not only to their own nationals but also to all their fellow-men. Indeed, it is no longer enough to sweep the street outside your own house to have done your proper duty; you also have to see if your neighbour has done the same as you and particularly if he is not passing over to you the dirt in his own household.\n180.\tNow the whole world is talking of the disappearance of the human race because of the pollution in all environments. The misfortune in such cases is that we are witnessing a true inflation of texts and books which, in their desire to draw attention, in fact do the opposite.\n181.\tWithout any doubt, it is a matter of prestige to possess the atomic bomb or even better the thermonuclear bomb; but to make it operational, and particularly to miniaturize it, you obviously have to carry out tests, and that is not always convenient. We condemn all nuclear tests wherever they take place and we do not condemn any one country more than another. In this particular area, we do not agree with the atomic countries which are asking all others to ratify Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. For our part, we have ratified it with enthusiasm; yet, we do not manufacture bombs or even bullets. But the countries concerned are telling us every day about the invention of evermore sophisticated weapons. Now what is responsible about that?\n182.\tIn Zaire we are flattered when we are considered the champions of the conservation of nature. But what is the use of this national effort if our efforts are cancelled out by people thousands of kilometres away from us. That is why we had no hesitation in paying our contribution \u2014 sizable when compared to our means \u2014 to the United Nations Environment Programme.\n183.\tI propose to you that the United Nations sponsor a world study to identify all forms of pollution and ways of fighting them. This study should logically be financed by the rich countries, not just because they can afford to do so but particularly because they are the principal polluters.\n184.\tIf I have primarily addressed myself to the so- called developed countries, it is because we, who must endure the backlash of what they do, have to cry out loudly in order to be heard. But it is my duty to level some criticism also at the so-called third world countries, which is in fact tantamount to a kind of self-criticism.\n185.\tIt is not enough just to condemn colonialism, imperialism and racism; it is important too to \\\"measure our strengths and weaknesses and to unite in fighting the battle of development. If Africa were really united, there would no longer be any racists in Africa, there would no longer be any British colonialists to massacre our brothers in Zimbabwe, there would no longer be any Portuguese colonialists to enslave our brothers in Angola, Mozambique and the Cape Verde Islands.\n186.\tIf the Arabs were also united, they would force the great Powers to impose a just solution in the Middle East.\n187. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the lack of unity among the under-equipped countries.\n188.\tAs long as telephone communications and air links between our different States still pass through the former metropolitan, making them even richer, we cannot talk of harmonious development. As long as trade among our States remains haphazard because we produce the same products and compete with each other in the markets of rich countries, we shall always be playing into their hands and enslaving ourselves. As long as those of the so-called third world countries which are rich, particularly those which are petroleum producers, while complaining of the exploitation of the industrialized countries, let their savings rot in Western banks, our development will always be in jeopardy.\n189.\tThat is why I utter a warning that we should all forget our small rivalries and our petty sordid interests in order to constitute among ourselves, in harmony, a great force, not a force against the East and the West but a force which would enable us to sit down and talk as equal partners with both sides. Furthermore, we have a real advantage by comparison with the rich countries because they have made mistakes which we can avoid, and that is particularly the case with the conservation of the environment, water pollution, urban concentrations, noise pollution and all the unpleasant aspects of modern life. And if the economists of the equipped countries were sincere, they would confess that our populations in the countryside incontestably possess the greatest riches, and ones they themselves do not possess \u2014 calm and quiet.\n190.\tMoreover, there is a difference, in our view, between poverty and wretchedness. We are called \\\"poor countries\\\" because some of our compatriots go barefoot, do not wear many clothes and sleep in rudimentary dwellings. But the modern life of the sophisticated countries shows that millionaires leave their Cadillacs in garages and make long journeys to our countries precisely to walk barefoot, sleep under the stars and sunbathe. No doubt, what they are looking for is natural happiness and a genuine joie de vivre. Does that mean that one has to be rich to be able to afford to live like a poor African?\n191.\tOur world, which thanks to evolution has become small, is ceaselessly undergoing rapid transformations, which make imperative an adaptation of mental attitudes. At the national level, each State is adapting itself to modern developments by all kinds of decrees taken as the days pass. What is true for each of our States should be all the more so for the United Nations itself. Our Organization, which has now survived for 28 years, has not evolved much, although the circumstances obtaining at its creation have changed entirely.\n192.\tThe Powers which at Yalta imposed their hegemony on the world \u2014 just as the Powers did in 1885 and were able at their whim to carve up Africa into a thousand pieces \u2014 proceeded from hot war to cold war, one side fearing the capitalist danger and the other the Communist danger.\n193. Today peaceful coexistence has become a reality and the circumstances prevailing at the time of the drafting of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco have changed, and there is no longer any reason for the great Powers of 1945 to be the only permanent members of the Security Council, alone possessing the right of veto. We cannot understand how, 28 years after the war, Europe should be represented by three countries with the right of veto, Asia by a single country with the right of veto and the American continent by a single country also with the right of veto. The maintenance of peace is no longer the monopoly of a few privileged States but rather the business of everyone.\n194.\tThe defeated countries of yesterday \u2014 Japan, Italy and the two Germanys \u2014 have since then acquired economic, political, demographic and cultural power which it would be ridiculous to ignore. The United Nations has gone from 45 Members at its founding to 135 today. The African continent, which in 1945 was nothing but a mass of colonies with no say in matters, now numbers 41 independent countries, or nearly one-third of the entire membership of our Organization.\n195.\tAnd that is why logic, justice and equity dictate, among other things, the permanent presence of the African continent in the Security Council. A thorough review -f the Charter of the United Nations is long overdue, otherwise we ourselves would be guilty of institutionalizing imperialism.\n196.\tIn conclusion, I should like to sum up. I have spoken at length of Africa to denounce two scourges which no longer exist anywhere except in that continent: colonialism and racism. The situation in the Portuguese colonies amounts to racism of white against black. The injustices of the British settlers in Rhodesia against the Zimbabwe patriots is the domination of the black by the white. Apartheid in South Africa and the problem of Namibia also represent contempt for the black by the white.\n197.\tWe can no longer accept a situation where throughout the world all races are free except the black race of Africa. And that is why we are determined to do everything in our power to change this state of affairs. The domination and exploitation of the black on the soil of its ancestors by the white foreigner must cease.\n198.\tI have tried to analyse the situation in the Middle East and I have concluded that true friendship consists in telling the truth. Zaire supports the right of the Israeli people \\\"to existence and peace, but we can find no justification for the occupation of Arab territories by Israel.\n199.\tI have noted a favourable development towards peace in Indo-China, and all the Members of this Organization should support the strengthening of that peace. It is urgent that the Member States concerned by the civil war in Cambodia should help to restore peace in that country.\n200.\tWith regard to the Korean problem, I have proposed a solution which would promote the unification sought at present by the two parties. In the initial phase, it would be a matter of admitting the two entities as observers until a favourable solution is reached which they deem appropriate for the future and the happiness of the Korean people itself.\n201.\tI have denounced the injustices committed by the rich countries against the poor countries, because the former have everything to say and the latter nothing to say. I have stated that we cannot be at the beck and call of the great Powers that flatter racists for the sake of their, alliances.\n202.\tI have suggested a revision of the Charter of the United Nations to adapt it to the present situation in the world, taking into account particularly the representation of the African continent and also the fact that those that were defeated yesterday have, in their turn, become today great Powers, and the decisions of our Organization should be applied by all its Members without differentiation and should not remain a dead letter in this forum. I have also suggested, for humanitarian reasons, that the great Powers should remit the debts of the drought-stricken African countries. I have supported the candidacy of a new African State for membership of the United Nations, namely Guinea Bissau. I have proposed that this august Assembly adopt a resolution requesting the rich countries to return works of art to the countries that have been the victims of expropriation. I have suggested that a study be undertaken, at the expense of the rich countries,  determine the causes of the different kinds of pollution in order better to fight this scourge throughout the world.\n203.\tI have pointed out that security in Europe also implies the security of the Mediterranean basin and that it is imperative for the African countries that border on the Mediterranean to be associated in any work affecting that security. They are the fraternal countries of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.\n204.\tIt will have been noted, I hope, that in Zaire we express ourselves freely and clearly. And I would ask all the friendly countries represented in this hall that may have taken offence at anything I have said to realize that in Zaire our judgement is based on justice alone.\n205.\tLike any other human endeavour, the United Nations is not perfect because of, among other things, all the reasons that I have mentioned. Severe criticism is often levelled at it from many quarters \u2014 by some because it does not fully meet their aspirations, and by others because it is not at their beck and call.\n206.\tFor our part, without passing any value judgement\non the United Nations  \u2014  and we are certainly far from wishing to make an assessment of it here \u2014 we do note in Zaire that the achievements of the United Nations are more positive than are its shortcomings. We hope that, thanks to it and through it, we shall be able to do more to promote co-operation among the inhabitants of our planet in the economic, cultural, scientific and technical fields, for the building of a better, fairer and more just world, in absolute respect for the authenticity of everyone.\n\n\n\nc\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff78.\tMr. President, the distinguished speakers who have addressed this Assembly before me from this rostrum have offered their sincere congratulations to you on the great honour which the Assembly has conferred on you by electing you to preside over this session. On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, may I tell you how pleased we are to endorse those significant tributes. Your election is a well-deserved tribute that we pay your country, which is so closely linked to ours by so many different ties, especially by the imperishable figure of our common Liberator, Sim6n Bolivar, and which is a land admirable for its natural beauty and the noble quality of its men. It is also a just recognition of your many and varied personal merits and virtues, of your long career as a public figure, and of your unflagging devotion to the cause of peace.\n79.\tOn this occasion it is likewise fitting to express our special appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, whose equanimity has garnered the sympathy and affection of us all.\n80.\tIt is particularly gratifying to us to take this opportunity to extend a cordial welcome to the new States Members of the Organization: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.\n81.\tThis twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is of special significance to me personally. It is, in fact, the fifth and last year of the constitutional term of office of the\nPresident of Venezuela, Mr. Rafael Caldera. It is also the fifth time that I am addressing this august Assembly.\n82.\tFor that reason, in the present general debate I shall refrain from giving in detail our position on the specific items on the agenda. My delegation will express the views of my Government in the relevant debates. In this unique United Nations forum I shall, on the other hand, refer to the fundamental principles that have guided the course of the international policy of my Government during these last five years in its endeavours to contribute to the coming into being of a new, just and humane international order.\n83.\tProfound economic, social, political and cultural differences separate the peoples of the world. It is true that there are varying degrees of wealth and power, of poverty and weakness. Nevertheless, we can affirm that the world is divided into two major sectors, namely, a minority of countries which have everything and a majority of countries which have little or nothing.\n84.\tThe imbalance between the developed and the developing countries grows day by day. Wealth and progress are still in the hands of the same States. Whichever way one looks at it, there is a lack of three indissolubly linked fundamental elements of development \u2014 capital, educational level and technology \u2014 that engender a vicious circle of poverty.\n85.\tThese serious inequalities, added to the desire for domination and the ambition for power over human communities, have given rise to and maintain actual patterns of subjection exercised by the developed countries over the under-developed ones.\n86.\tFour main instruments help to shape these patterns of subjection: so-called international aid, the deterioration of the terms of international trade, foreign investments and the power which weapons and money give.\n87.\tAlthough any generalization invariably conceals a simplification, we might perhaps describe the patterns of subjection at present prevailing in the world as falling into two categories: a system of subjection based on economics and another based on ideology.\n88.\tUnder the economic system of subjection the underdeveloped countries, being a prey to the developed countries' desire for gain, suffer economic domination, which in turn leads to the loss of their political and cultural independence. Under the ideological system of subjection, the developing countries are prey to the developed countries' desire for ideological penetration and we see their structures infiltrated, falling under the control of the developed countries and, ultimately, losing their economic freedom and their political independence.\n89.\tOn the other hand, we are well aware that the international order engendered by the policy of blocs and the balance of power has not achieved peace. It has only succeeded in preventing a global conflagration, but armed conflicts have not ceased since the very moment when the Second World War ended. The very precariousness of peace teaches us that the system of international relations under which we live cannot lead us to the objective so earnestly desired by all, namely, peaceful coexistence and the harmonious development of peoples. It is essential that we build a new international order, inspired by lofty and enduring principles and not by considerations of practical expediency.\n90.\tWe consider that the fundamental goal of the present- day world is development. Pope Paul VI, in his now familiar phrase, stated that the new name for peace was development. Indeed, as long as there are inequalities existing between men and an unjust distribution of the benefits of progress, in both the domestic and the international field, there can be no peace. Inequalities are a sign of injustice, and injustice in the end engenders violence.\n91.\tDevelopment, however, cannot be of any kind. It must be a development that is harmonious, fair and balanced, both within each country and among all nations. Therefore we must not confuse development with economic growth, or material well-being with progress. Man does not live by bread alone. Development must encompass the total man, and all men, the whole nation, and all nations.\n92.\tOn the other hand, the harmonious and human development of civilization transcends all divisions within States or among States. Art, science, philosophy, literature, are in our times more than ever before the fruits of collective endeavour.\n93.\tThe scientific and technological revolution has brought men and peoples closer than at any other time in the history of mankind. Thus the outbreak of a contagious disease in one part of the world endangers the whole world. As we stated in 1971 before the General Assembly:\n\\\"Thus there emerges a new concept: that of mankind. We think of mankind as all the peoples of the world and, thus conceived, mankind appears to us as a world-wide society which encompasses us all and which is in opposition to individual societies or States, having their own lives, it is true, but dependent on the development of that greater society.\n\\\"Thus, then, as it does internally where each State seeks the realization of the common good of all its citizens, in the universal society of nations there is also need for a Universal Common Good which is the objective and raison d'etre of international authority and of the action of each of the States making up mankind.\\\" \n94.\tHow can we fight pollution and. the destruction of nature unless we take a loftier view that compels us to be ever mindful of the supreme interests of humanity?\n95.\tHow can we radically change the existing unjust structure in the international division of labour, where some countries export their manufactures at increasingly higher prices and others export their raw materials at increasingly lower prices, other than by the conception of an economy on a world scale?\n96.\tThe universal common good presupposes a system for the international distribution of production; or, in other words, all countries being members of the community of nations must be able to be a part of a real and effective system of universal economy that provides for all stages of the economic process. This necessarily implies the formulation of a global and comprehensive world economic policy aimed at the development of humanity; the universal common good \u2014 and not merely the development of a group of privileged countries. In the name of that universal common good we must question the development patterns followed by the modern industrialized countries, both in the East and in the West.\n97.\tEvery action has to be inspired and guided by an underlying principle. Hence at the international level we must have a set of values, that is to say, a principle towards which our action is directed and which guides our action. That principle is the principle of international social justice, which has been proclaimed with ardent conviction by the President of our Republic in many international forums.\n98.\tThe industrial revolution brought in its wake profound poverty among the workers, who were subjected to the law of supply and demand. Wages declined steadily, while their needs grew. In this situation, the workers became aware of their poverty and sought a principle that would raise their spirits and lend weight to their claims. That principle was the principle of social justice. They combined their efforts and turned their common weaknesses into strength. The first trade unions came into being, and with them the development of the labour movement.\n99.\tSocial justice became the dynamic moving force behind a multitude of economic, social, political and cultural changes. Justice was the regulating principle, seeking to restore the balance between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\", between the strong and the weak, the rich and the poor, the employers and the workers, the socially strong and the socially weak.\n100.\tIn the name of social justice, fiscal legislation was changed and it seemed perfectly logical that those who had the most should shoulder the heaviest burdens. In the name of social justice, labour protection laws were passed to restore the balance between employers and workers. In the name of social justice, an entirely new perspective of struggle and global transformation emerged and a new concept of economic and social relations was defined.\n101.\tWhy should we not bring that social justice into the international order? Why should we not use the set of values that enabled men to change substantially the internal situation of many countries? Why should we not use that set of values as a principle to transform the international order and thus rid it of the injustices on which it is based? At this point I should like to yield to President Caldera and quote from his address to the United States Congress:\n\\\"Just as 'society', in the national ambit, has the right to impose different relations among its members, so the 'international community' demands that the peoples of the world participate according to their capacity, that 'all' may live a human existence. The rights and duties of the different peoples must therefore be measured in terms of the capacities and needs of each, in order to\nmake peace, harmony and progress possible and so that we may all develop in a spirit of genuine friendship.\n\\\"If we believe that an international community exists, if we honestly maintain that all men constitute a great society and that that great society has the right to exist and prosper, then it is essential that the burdens and responsibilities taken on for its sake be in keeping with the relative opportunities, the strength, and the degree of development and wealth of some people.\\\"\n102.\tFurthermore, this principle applies to developing countries such as ours. Among us, too, those who have the most must accept greater obligations. We could hardly cry out against the injustices of the great Powers if we were to practise among ourselves the very acts of injustice which we reproach them for.\n103.\tIn the light of the principle of international social justice, the whole range and outlook of the unsuitably termed \\\"international aid\\\" takes on a completely different complexion and perspective. It is not a question of a favour, but of a duty. The greater the possibilities, the greater the obligations. On the other hand, it is inadmissible that a \\\"developed\\\" country should demand of a \\\"developing\\\" country a counterpart equal to, or even greater than, the \\\"value\\\" of the \\\"assistance\\\" rendered. And it is even more inconceivable that the \\\"assistance\\\" should be used to pressure or to coerce the \\\"assisted\\\" country. How can underdevelopment be overcome in such conditions? We were right when we stated, on several occasions, that the wealth of the developed countries has its roots in the poverty of the developing countries.\n104.\tLet us also consider the over-all aspects of foreign investments from the point of view of international social justice. True, the developing countries need foreign capital to attain their own development. However, those investments should not be prompted either by a profit motive or by a desire for ideological invasion, because, in either case, such investments lead to the subjugation of the country in which they are made.\n105.\tInternational social justice, on the contrary, demands that foreign capital investments be directed towards the development of the individual and of all the men in the country where such investments are made. It also requires that States respect each other, and hence exclude any abuse of power by the stronger against the weaker.\n106.\tThe realities of the present-day world prompt us to speak on the subject of ideological pluralism. May I be permitted to make a few remarks in this connexion to dispel any possible misunderstanding.\n107.\tMan is a rational and free being. As a human being he is responsible for his destiny. Hence, he has the right to act out his role in life. That is why we speak of self- determination and the fulfilment of the human being.\n108.\tSimilarly, in a national community, the various human groups, legitimately constituted, have the right to pursue and give expression to the various conceivable ways in which their purpose may be realized. This, logically, implies the right to dissent and to express dissent.\n109.\tFor analogous reasons also, every national community in turn has the legitimate right to fulfil its own destiny and, consequently, to carry out in full freedom its historic mission within the international community. The existing system has enshrined that right in a number of principles, namely: legal equality and mutual respect among States; the self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n110.\tThe diversity of economic and social regimes and systems which exist in the various States on the one hand, and, on the other, the need to establish conditions of legal security for the benefit of peace, have ushered in a new phase in the relations between peoples that we call \\\"ideological pluralism\\\". It follows as a corollary from the aforementioned principles, and it is in this context that it can be correctly interpreted.\n111.\tIdeological pluralism implies the coexistence, at one and the same time, of different ways of establishing the scale of values according to which a society is structured and organized.\n112.\tBecause of its origin and source, if we wish to be consistent, ideological pluralism at the international level presupposes \u2014 or at least should presuppose \u2014 the application of the same principle that is applied at the national level, with the consequent right to dissent.\n113.\tTo invoke ideological pluralism at the international level while denying it at the national level reveals a serious inconsistency. In point of fact, it is tantamount to invoking in the international order the self-same right that 'is denied in the domestic order.\n114.\tI should like now to refer to Latin America. In the international concert of nations there are countries that are bound by very special ties. This is particularly outstanding in the case of the Latin American countries.\n115.\tFor us, Latin American unity is a historical necessity . if the countries of Latin America are to play their part in the\ndevelopment of mankind.\n116.\tMy Government is convinced of this historic reality. The President of the Republic, on a recent tour of a number of countries in South America, proclaimed the urgent need for that unity within what he termed \\\"the pluralist solidarity\\\".\n117.\tIt goes one step beyond ideological pluralism, because this can be viewed as a part of a system of \\\"coexistence\\\", namely, a system whereby one country accepts that\nanother should have a different conception of its own economic, political and social order. However, such a system does not preclude there being a latent state of war, since one of the parties regards the internal order of the other as unjust, feels that it should cease to exist and is waiting for it to disintegrate, or even goes as far as to try to bring about deliberately its downfall, in a struggle for world hegemony.\n118.\tFor its part, pluralist solidarity presupposes a system of coexistence where it is not enough to \\\"tolerate\\\" those who are different, but where it is actually necessary to \\\"want\\\" to be different, in order to achieve the common\nhistoric goals which we place over and above our contingent momentary differences. In other words, we sacrifice our present differences \u2014 which are merely contingent \u2014 for a future which is permanent and for the sake of which we must all unite.\n119.\tIt would be a serious mistake to begin to build the world of tomorrow on existing models. The results are before us.\n120.\tHistory bears witness to one certain fact: underdevelopment will not be surmounted by the use of familiar, known methods. We are aware of no under-developed country that has overcome its under-development. Other ways must be found. . . . The Club of the developed countries, Eastern and Western, is still exclusive and excluding.\n121.\tWe believe that it is possible for each country to find its own course. It is based on the methodology of the trade union struggle, an historic experiment that has proved to be effective'. What were the trade unions? They were associations of workers who by combining their weaknesses turned them into strength.\n122.\tThe trade unions, however, soon realized that in order to be truly powerful they had to unite. And so the trade union federations came into being. These, in turn, realized that they, too, had to unite to acquire even greater authority. In fact, just as not all trade unions had the same strength, so too not all federations had the same power. Thus did the trade union confederations emerge. They moved from the national to the international level.\n123.\tLet us transpose that experience to our own struggle against under-development on the international level. The primary-commodity producing countries would form organizations at the international level, enabling them to achieve their just aspirations on the world market. That is what we affirmed at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held at Santiago in 1972, in Santiago.\n124.\tIt has sometimes been said, \\\"more trade, less assistance\\\". And that would be so if trade were fair. But how can the terms of trade become more just unless the developing countries unite? We cannot sit at the negotiating table if v/e have no power to negotiate, and that power can be acquired only by having representative organizations backed by numerical strength. *\n125.\tIt will therefore be of paramount importance to organize the primary-commodity producing countries on a sectorial basis.\n126.\tThis would be a unique way for the developing countries, for the producers of primary commodities, to organize, and a way that requires no promises of the kind that are made to be broken, a way that would change the structure of power between developed and developing countries.\n127.\tIt is a methodology that is taking its first steps in the field of petroleum, and it will not prove fully effective until we are able to extend it to other significant primary commodities \u2014 namely, those without which there can be no development process.\n128.\tThat methodology can and should be improved on, and even supplemented. Just as the trade union movement of the developed countries created its own security, economic, social and financial structures, so too there would be no obstacle to the primary-commodity producing developing countries initiating experiments towards the same goal.\n129.\tThere are difficulties involved in putting into practice the idea we propose. Stultifying national egotisms will have to be surmounted. But did not the trade unions encounter many and even greater obstacles in their struggle to improve the lot of the workers? This is the great challenge for the under-developed countries: to find their own way.\n130.\tIn conclusion, allow me to make a comparison. According to legend, St. Christopher used to help travellers across the river by carrying them on his shoulders.\n131.\tThe river is under-development; St. Christopher the developed countries; the travellers, the developing countries. Up until now the developed countries have carried us on their shoulders.\n132.\tIf violence is not to take over the world, and if peace is to reign on earth, changes will have to be made.\n133.\tIt will be necessary for St. Christopher to give travellers a helping hand, and no longer to carry them on his shoulders. Thus, and only thus will the travellers one day be' able to cross the river by themselves.\n134.\tThe way lies before us. It is called \\\"international social justice.\\\""

        "file_text": "\ufeff153.\tMr. President, on behalf of the Greek delegation and on my own behalf I should like to tell you how much satisfaction we feel in knowing that the General Assembly is meeting this year under your guidance. Your election is a well-deserved tribute to your high moral and intellectual qualities; it is also an affirmation of the positive role your country, with which Greece maintains friendly and cordial relations, is playing in international affairs. Your distinguished career in the United Nations, marked by a strong sense of deep devotion to peace and international co-operation, assures us that your mandate will be exercised in the best possible way.\n\n154.\tAt the same time, I should like to express our deep gratitude to the outgoing President, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Mr. Trepczyriski, for the able and effective way in which he discharged his heavy duties during a session that was difficult and fraught with complicated problems.\n155.\tLastly, I should like to welcome the admission of three new Members to our Organization: the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. On behalf of my Government I should like to convey to them our warmest congratulations. We hope that they will be able to contribute to the strengthening of our Organization in the interests of world peace and peaceful co-operation among peoples.\n156.\tBefore proceeding to express very quickly my Government's views on certain items of the agenda I should like to pay a tribute to the persistent efforts of our Secretary- General for the maintenance of peace and the attainment of the ideals of our Charter. The year that has passed since the last session of the General Assembly has been marked by a relaxation of international tensions and the creation of a climate favourable to the search for peace throughout the world.\n157.\tGreece, a country devoted to peace and firmly devoted to the principles of the Charter, has made it its duty to make a sincere and constructive contribution, either on a bilateral or on a multilateral basis, to any initiatives designed to safeguard peace and strengthen international security.\n158.\tIn particular, I should like to refer to the policy inaugurated by my Government a few years ago towards the countries of the region in which Greece is situated. Despite differences in political and social system, and without prejudice to our respective international commitments, and of course with the co-operation of the other countries of our region, we have been able to inaugurate a new period of co-operation in all fields to the mutual benefit of all. What we desire above all is not only development of bilateral relations on a broader and more fruitful basis but also transportation of those relations to a multilateral plane. If I have ventured to refer briefly to these developments in south-eastern Europe, it is because we are convinced that they are in complete harmony with the purposes pursued by our Organization and certainly contribute to their attainment. In this context I should also like to recall that it was Romania, a country of our region, which, with the vigorous support of other countries including Greece, in the General Assembly last year mentioned the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in matters affecting the safeguarding of world peace, the development of co-operation among all countries and the strengthening of the rules of international law.\n159.\tTurning now to certain items of our agenda, I should like first of all to deal with the question of disarmament under strict and effective international control. We are comforted by the fact that a new period of detente and international co-operation is looming on the horizon. This development could only lead to a process of various types of negotiations on the limitation of armaments. I would first refer to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, which have already had a concrete impact upon the limitation <}f defensive strategic weapons. We all hope that the second phase of those negotiations covering the possibility of limiting offensive strategic weapons, a phase under way at the present time, can achieve the same success. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament continues its work in Geneva along positive lines, though perhaps not at the desirable pace. Next month in Vienna we shall be resuming negotiations between the countries members of the NATO alliance and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Treaty on possible reductions in the forces of the two alliances on a mutual and balanced basis. Finally, the European countries, as well as the United States and Canada, are hoping that the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has just begun its work in Geneva, will succeed in endorsing military measures which will serve to strengthen confidence between East and West.\n160.\tWith respect to the other items on the agenda of that Conference  \u2014  that is, security, economic and trade relations and the freest possible circulation of information, ideas and persons \u2014 we shall participate actively in the second phase in order to try,-in co-operation with the other participating countries, to find concrete solutions to all those problems at the root of the fundamental issue, which, in our position, is as follows: Will we merely experience a period of detente of a more or less verbal nature, or will we, rather, find the means of setting up real and sincere co-operation between peoples and States?\n161.\tThat line of thinking leads us to examine briefly the problem created by the fact that the world is divided into developed countries and developing countries. Some-and rightly so-have called this a problem of the north and south of our planet. First of all, we should consider how the vast resources, both material and intellectual, which are today used in pursuit of the arms race, can rather be devoted to economic and technological support for the developing countries. We firmly believe that all efforts to establish and strengthen a lasting peace cannot succeed if the major portion of the people of our earth continues to live in conditions bordering on famine, poverty and misery.\n162.\tIn respect of the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of international problems and the strengthening of peace, there is still a great deal that remains to be done, and I can only agree with the Secretary-General when, in the introduction to his report on the work of the United Nations, he says: \\\"Some of the mechanism provided in the Charter for achieving these aims, however, has not proved workable . ..\\\" [Aj 9001/Add.l, p. 1].\n163.\tTo that I should merely like to add that my Government considers it essential to fill in the lacuna consisting of the lack of practical machinery that would enable our Organization to discharge its primary task-that is, to maintain and strengthen world peace. Thus the time has come to leave improvisations aside and to adopt a general agreement covering all aspects of peace-keeping operations. While not overlooking the socio-economic tasks of our' Organization, we consider that primary attention, with everything that this involves in terms of material contributions, should be devoted to peace-keeping, particularly in those countries bearing a major responsibility for that task. Greece, desiring to see the goals of the Organization achieved, is contributing materially and morally to their success and is ready to do everything it can along those lines. In particular with respect to the United Nations Force in Cyprus, I should like most warmly to thank our Secretary-General for his interest and all those countries that have exerted so much effort to preserve peace on the island.\n164.\tIn respect of the problem of Cyprus, which continues to bf a source of deep concern for my Government and the entire Greek people, I should like to add the following comments. We have repeatedly stated-and we firmly adhere to this viewpoint-that this question should be settled by establishments on that island of a truly independent, sovereign and unitary State. That is the position we adopted after several tragic phases of the question which affected the rights and aspirations of the Greek population of Cyprus. Moreover, we consider that that solution can be achieved only through the intercommunal talks under way at this very moment in Cyprus, in which the United Nations representative is participating and which are being followed by constitutional experts of Greece and of Turkey. That is our position of principle, and we lend our full and complete support so that the talks can achieve a successful result. For that matter, success can be achieved only if the participants show a spirit of realism and compromise.\n165.\tThe Greek delegation had occasion at previous sessions of the General Assembly to explain its position on the situation in the Middle East. Despite certain hopes expressed last year, we are compelled to observe, to our very deep regret, that no progress has been recorded in the restoration of peace in that part of the world. Indeed, Arab territories are still occupied, the path of negotiation continues to be blocked and the hour of peace apparently is no closer. This immobility, this state of stagnation in which the problem of the Middle East is bogged down, hardly serves to help heal the still open wounds; on the contrary, it opens the door to backsliding, which could have nefarious effects on peace and international security. As the Secretary-General has stated-and I endorse his statement- \\\"Time is not on our side in this highly explosive situation\\\" \n166.\tNo one can therefore be complacent or accommodate himself to the present state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\". We consider that it is incumbent upon our Organization, and more particularly upon those of its Members that are endowed with exceptional prerogatives by the Charter, to explore and encourage fresh diplomatic initiatives for the application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which still provides the best basis for a just, viable and equitable settlement of the problem which concerns us. The passage of time is neither to the advantage of the Arab countries nor to the benefit of Israel, but it is certainly detrimental to peace and international security.\n167.\tOn the question of bringing peace to Indo-China, I shall confine myself to expressing the fervent hope that the agreements and the communiques ensuring peace will be scrupulously applied by all the parties in order to ensure that the so-sorely-tried peoples of that region of the world can live in peace and in respect for human dignity, and that the political will of those peoples will be freely expressed without any foreign intervention.\n168.\tMy delegation attaches particular importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. However, I must emphasize that the interests involved are so broad and the difficulties to be overcome so vast that we must envisage the United Nations initiative in this area with very cautious optimism. Greece, which is almost entirely surrounded by the sea, is anxious to safeguard its sovereignty and its territorial integrity from any attacks and, in addition, to respect or, rather, to see respected \u2014 the traditional principle of the freedom of the sea. Although we would like to confirm our determination to contribute to the success of that Conference, for obvious reasons we could not depart from certain fundamental principles of international law. Those principles are as follows; First, no discrimination can be accepted between the mainland and the island part of the same national territory; secondly, no discrimination can be accepted between citizens of the same country; thirdly, we must have absolute respect for the fundamental principles which govern the deliberation of maritime frontiers.\n169.\tAny infringements of these principles will certainly lead to complications, the consequences of which cannot be foreseen.\n170.\tI turn now to a question which is dear to the hearts of all of us. Thanks to a long tradition and to the national character of the Greek people, that people has always rejected any form of discrimination, whether it be racial, religious or social, and it has rejected it morally, politically and culturally. It is therefore without any great effort and remaining completely faithful to our traditions that we unreservedly and without hesitation endorse all the efforts that our Organization is making to do away with the racism and intolerance which, unfortunately, exist in certain parts of the world. But just because of this point we have no reservations or prejudice whatsoever, we think that these principles of acceptance and mutual tolerance should be applied reciprocally and without discrimination. We certainly cannot accept the idea that racial discrimination should be condemned in one country and tacitly tolerated in another.\n171.\tBy the same token, I should like to refer to what may be considered as another form of racial discrimination, that is to say, the vestiges of colonialism. If the principles of our Charter are to be accepted by all \u2014 and they must be-then the principle of self-determination of peoples should be respected in die first instance.\n172.\tThe year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has seen a new and terrible wave of terrorism unleashed throughout the world, conducted on an international scale, which constitutes a resounding provocation in the face of international morality. The impunity which most often accompanies those acts, which are as horrible as they are condemnable, should no longer be tolerated by the international community and especially by our Organization, the attitude of which so far has been passive, for such an attitude only serves to increase the number and scope of these base criminal acts. What we are called upon to do is to condemn unequivocally and without reservations acts of terrorism and those who perpetuate them, because any equivocation on this only leads to the impunity of the criminal and consequently to the encouragement of those acts.\n214. I must add that no national cause, no matter how worthy of respect, can find justification in such acts, which serve only to arouse the indignation of world public opinion. My delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will not conclude its work without having obtained: first, the accession of all Member States to the Tokyo Convention of 1963, The Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971 secondly, the adoption of a new convention on such acts of international terrorism, as the aforementioned conventions still have not dealt with, which would establish an international jurisdiction recognized by all Member States and which would provide in detail for the responsibility of those criminals.\n215.\tIn conclusion, I should like to add that, in a world which is in a continuous state of evolution and where gigantic transmutations of values are being manifested, the new generation, which is not bound to the past by any mental habits, will not be able to support us so long as we obstinately continue to feed on the past and to model ourselves on the past. The world today knows that it is our refusal to respect the commandments of our Charter \u2014 rather than the structural defects of the temple of peace erected on the ruins of the last World War \u2014 which discredits our profession of faith in the great ideals on which our Organization was founded.\n216.\tTherefore, let us not expect public opinion to give weight to our proclamations, unless they reflect a change in spirit, a ripening of our common will to prove that the ideals that led us to create the United Nations are still very much alive."

        "file_text": "\ufeff111.\t Mr. President, at the outset permit me to congratulate you on your election as President of this twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you all success in this high office and pledge you the full confidence and support of my delegation.\n112.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for his tireless efforts in promoting the cause of the United Nations. I recall with pleasure the visit of the Secretary-General to Iceland earlier this year, which my Government and the people of Iceland appreciated highly.\n113.\tI want join my colleagues who have spoken before me in welcoming the new Members of the United Nations \u2014  the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We look forward to their valued contributions to our Organization.\n114.\tNow I should like to refer briefly to what we think should be the role of the United Nations in the world today and what we see as the main purpose and objectives of the Organization 28 years after its foundation.\n115.\tIceland is one of the smallest Members of the United Nations and, since we joined in 1946, we have seen our membership of this Organization as a corner-stone of our foreign policy. A small nation has no less than the big Powers a vested interest in solving the political and security-related problems of our times and in maintaining an effective international organization that can successfully deal with the manifold challenges of international society. Our experience has shown that regional arrangements, however desirable, cannot always meet the wishes and interests of the smaller Members, which gain wider support and sympathy in a world body of a truly universal character.\n116.\tThere can be no doubt that the necessity for global co-operation in the political, economic and social fields has never been greater than today. The question is, therefore, how we can best make the United Nations an effective instrument for furthering such co-operation. In this respect we should like to emphasize what Secretary-General Waldheim has said in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1/, that the United Nations cannot successfully deal with disputes unless it has the full support and political backing of the international community. From the simple fact that this is not always the case stems much of the disillusion and disappointment frequently expressed when the record of the United Nations is debated. We need a much clearer understanding of the fact that the United Nations is not a supra-national government but an instrument of negotiation and multilateral diplomacy. Assertions that the United Nations has been ineffective in solving conflicts endangering world peace, such as the war in Viet-Nam, and has so far failed to bring peace to the Middle East must be viewed against this background. This does not mean, however, that we should not strive to make the United Nations a more effective organization with much wider powers than it has now, to enable it to act on its own in times of crises.\n117.\tWhat we want is not a debating club or a forum for pursuing narrow national policies but an organization which can play a strong and active role in finding solutions to the most controversial problems of our times. This might mean restructuring the United Nations machinery, but the gain would be a stronger instrument of world order capable of safeguarding the common interests of mankind. We must remember that the United Nations was created nearly 30 years ago to cope with a world in many respects very different from the one we live in today. While turning the United Nations into a much more effective instrument for world peace, we must adapt to new needs and interests, foremost among them being those of the newly independent countries whose position and voice in the Councils of the United Nations should be strengthened. The concepts of colonial times, with their legal and moral anachronisms, must be eliminated.\n118.\tHowever, if it is sometimes necessary to focus attention on the shortcomings of the international institutions and their achievements, we can note with satisfaction definite progress on a number of highly problematical international issues since we last met in this Assembly hall.\n119.\tThe Korean question has long been one of the difficult and most controversial issues in the United Nations. With the start of direct talks between North Korea and South Korea a welcome change has taken place which has led to the invitation to both Governments to come before this Assembly and state their cases. After 23 years the United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has in its report to the Secretary- General [A/9027] recommended its own liquidation. That will be another positive step in normalizing relations between the two Korean States. There remains, however, the question of the United Nations Command in South Korea. Its future is a question to be resolved by the Security Council, as it has a direct bearing on the maintenance of peace in the area. We hope that the time will soon come when we can welcome the Korean States as new Members of this Organization.\n120.\tA major step forward was the joining of the Organization by both German States. This event represents the pinnacle of the tireless efforts for the normalization of relations on the European scene, crystallizing in the accords between the two German States, and between the Federal\nRepublic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland. These have been among the most hopeful sings of our times and have greatly contributed to the general search for peace in the world.\n121.\tSimilarly high hopes are fixed on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which opened in Helsinki in July this year and is now in its second stage in Geneva.\n122.\tThe time has come to eliminate the barriers that have divided the peoples of Europe in spite of their common history and cultural heritage. We must strive not only for a mutual reduction of forces in this area, but also for greatly increased co-operation in the economic field and closer contacts among the common people. The goal is a unified Europe which can contribute greatly towards the establishment of a lasting peace in the world.\n123.\tWe see a long list of items of concern to the international community on the agenda of this General Assembly. The question of decolonization merits special mention. We cannot but recognize the fact that millions of people are still living under the yoke of colonialism, deprived of their fundamental human rights. This is so in spite of repeated efforts by the United Nations throughout the years. The major blame must be put on the Governments concerned which have, year after year, consistently ignored the resolutions and directives of the United Nations, in particular with respect to southern Africa.\n124.\tThe process of decolonization must be accelerated and every pressure put on those Governments that persist in refusing to grant peoples under their domination basic human rights. As a country that has been under foreign domination for 500 years and that has become only recently independent, we fully appreciate the appeals from those still under foreign domination. Withholding freedom and independence from millions of people, not only in southern Africa but elsewhere, constitutes a major obstacle to the relaxation of international tension and may indeed lead to armed conflict if persisted in. We address an urgent appeal therefore to those nations that still practise oppression and colonialism to adhere to the course charted by the United Nations in these matters.\n125.\tIndeed, the United Nations should strive to persuade Governments to live up to the universal Declaration of Human Rights, which certainly is one of the most important documents created by this Organization. We must also try to make the United Nations a more humane Organization, concerned not only with the problems of States and high-level diplomacy, but also with the hopes and aspirations of the common man, under whatever system of government he may be living.\n126.\tIn the field of economic and social affairs the United Nations has a record of long and praiseworthy accomplishments, one of them being the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme at the last General Assembly [resolution 2997 (XXVII)]. There is an urgent need not only to protect the human environment but also to conserve and wisely husband the world's dwindling natural resources. This can best be done by ensuring effective control by each country over its natural resources, be they found on land, on the sea-bed or in the superjacent waters. Only a few weeks ago the meeting of the non-aligned countries in Algiers proclaimed that any infringement of the right to effective control by each country over its natural resources \\\"is contrary to the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter and hampers the development of international co-operation as well as the maintenance of international peace and security\\\". \n127.\tIndeed, at its last session the General Assembly spoke out with no uncertain voice on this subject. By adopting resolution 3016 (XXVII) with 102 votes against none, the vast majority of the nations of the world reaffirmed the right of States to permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources, including those of the sea-bed and the marine resources of the superjacent waters.\n128.\tThis basic principle has since been reaffirmed by two other United Nations bodies, first by the Committee on Natural Resources at its third meeting in New Delhi last February, and then by the Economic and Social Council at its fifty-fourth meeting, last April and May, in resolution 1737 (LIV).\n129.\tThere need therefore not exist the slightest doubt that it is the will of the United Nations that nations enjoy full sovereignty over the marine resources of the continental shelf and the sea-bed area far beyond the old 12-mile limit. And it behoves me to draw attention to the fact that such resource jurisdiction is precisely what the Government of Iceland has promulgated through the adoption of our 50-mile fishery limit last year in partial implementation of our 1948 Continental Shelf Law. We have, therefore, acted in complete conformity with the tenets proclaimed by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly regarding permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources. Indeed, the adoption of resolution 3016 (XXVII) by over 100 States is an implied recognition by the international community of extended fisheries jurisdiction over the continental shelf waters.\n130.\tIn resolution 3016 (XXVII), it is furthermore declared that all actions by States aimed at coercing other States in the exercise of their sovereign rights over their coastal resources are in violation of the Charter.\n131.\tA year ago  I drew the attention of the General Assembly to the dangerous situation which already then prevailed in the waters around Iceland, where my Government had adopted fishery limits of 50 miles from the coast. It is with great regret that I now must report that the situation not only has not been improved but has greatly deteriorated. It has been intensified through continued British trawling in the area under the protection of British vessels of war. These vessels of war, furthermore, operate in co-operation with British military aircraft surveying the area and reporting to the war vessels the position of Icelandic coast guard vessels. The war vessels have repeatedly ignored international rules of navigation and rammed our coast guard vessels. This constant and hostile behaviour has already led to the loss of human life. And, obviously, such a state of affairs is not only intolerable now, but could easily lead to further serious consequences. My Government has continuously protested against these warlike activities and demanded that the warships be withdrawn immediately. But so far that request has fallen on deaf ears. My Government has informed the British Government that if these activities continue, we will feel ourselves obliged to sever diplomatic relations. In view of our traditional friendship with the British people, I sincerely hope that this measure will not become necessary.\n132.\tI want to emphasize in this connexion that my Government, before the extension of the fishery limits, indicated its willingness to negotiate a practical interim arrangement which would meet the problems of the British trawler industry because of the extension. Negotiations for this end had in fact led to considerable progress in finding a solution when the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom was sent to the area. The British point of view is that this was necessary because the British trawlers fishing within our limits were being harassed by our coast guard. The coast guard was in fact to a very limited extent trying to prevent illegal fishing within our fishery limits, which were respected by all nations other than the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. I want to make it clear that we are still negotiating with the Federal Republic of Germany for a practical arrangement for their trawlers and it seems that a satisfactory solution is now in sight. We have already concluded agreements with Belgium, Norway and the Faroe Islands for continued fishing for a limited period by a specified number of their vessels under licence. Until we had concluded these agreements, our friends from Belgium, Norway and the Faroe Islands respected our 50-mile limit and stayed outside.\n133.\tIn fact, no fishing vessels from any country other than the United Kingdom have continued fishing inside our limits under the protection of vessels of war. Only the British trawlers have done that, and are still doing that. This I have to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations today.\n134.\tThis unfortunate state of affairs shows the urgent need for avoiding any unnecessary delay in convening the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Therefore, I want to use this opportunity and this occasion to summarize the views of my Government with regard to that urgent matter.\n135.\tThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction has devoted much time and effort to the preparation of the Conference and its report will soon be discussed in the First Committee of the Assembly. Under the terms of its resolution 3029 A (XXVII), the Assembly decided to review at this session the progress of the preparatory work of the Committee and, if necessary, to take measures to facilitate completion of the substantive work for the Conference and any other action it may deem appropriate. In the same resolution, the General Assembly decided to convene the first session of the Conference at New York for a period of approximately two weeks in November and December 1973, for the purpose of dealing with organizational matters. It was also decided to convene the second session of the Conference for the purpose of dealing with substantive work in April and May 1974. My Government attaches great importance to the observance of this schedule or at least to avoiding any unnecessary delay.\n136.\tThe argument has been advanced that further preparatory work is required since the sea-bed Committee has not been able to produce draft articles for the Conference. In the view of my Government it must be kept in mind that the sea-bed Committee has worked on the basis of consensus. No voting took place on the various proposals submitted. It was, therefore, never to be expected that uniform draft articles could be produced by the Committee. On the other hand, the Committee has thoroughly discussed all the problems involved and alternatives are available on most issues. Perhaps the number of such alternatives might be reduced through further work, but that work could just as well be performed by the Conference itself. This problem will, of course, be further examined and discussed in the First Committee, but I repeat that, in the view of my Government, it is of the utmost importance to avoid any unnecessary delay in convening the substantive phase of the Conference, although we would not be opposed to a short delay of two or three months for the purpose of further preparation, if that is generally considered useful.\n137.\tFifteen years have passed since the 1958 United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Neither that Conference nor the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea of 1960 was able to solve the problem of the extent of coastal jurisdiction. Since then the progressive development of international law has been rapid, and it should now be possible for the forthcoming Conference to proceed with its work on the basis of the alternatives and consolidated texts already available. A great deal of work has been done in order to clarify the issues, and certainly the major problems are evident and ripe for treatment at the Conference.\n138.\tThe international sea-bed area is the common heritage of mankind and it must be delimited so as to make it a worthwhile concept for the developing nations, and machinery must be established with sufficient powers and functions to ensure the practical implementation of that concept. Valuable texts dealing with these problems are available.\n139.\tThe problems of pollution and scientific research must be solved in the light of the valuable work of the sea-bed Committee. The important problems of islands, archipelagos and land-locked States also have been discussed at length. Within the confines of a relatively narrow territorial sea of up to 12 miles, the problems connected with straits used for international navigation should not be insurmountable.\n140.\tThe obsolete system of dealing with coastal jurisdiction over resources in terms of a territorial sea designed for military purposes is now replaced by a functional solution in terms of an economic zone, beyond the territorial sea, of up to 200 miles, which already enjoys overwhelming support in all regions of the world. Certainly the concept of the exclusive economic zone is quite compatible with the right of navigation. Freedom of the seas has for a long time been used as an argument to protect the special interests of the powerful maritime nations, including their distant-water fisheries. That idea has now been replaced by the principle of the protection of the vital economic interests of the coastal States in their natural resources. This is clear from the positions of States in the preparatory work for the Conference, in which the representatives of 90 States and observers from 30 States-120 States in all \u2014 participated. And after all, it is the practice of States and their policy declarations that are mirrored in customary international law. It is now the task of the Conference to codify that practice.\n141.\tThe Icelandic delegations to the sea-bed Committee, on 5 April 1973, submitted a working paper which reads in part as follows:\n\\\"A coastal State may determine the extent of its exclusive jurisdiction and control over the natural resources of the maritime area adjacent to its territorial sea.\n\\\"The outer limits of this area shall be reasonable, keeping in view the geographical, geological, ecological, economic and other relevant local considerations, and shall not exceed 200 nautical miles.\\\"\n142.\tOther delegations have made similar proposals and it is now clear that the concept of an economic zone of up to 200 miles enjoys ever-increasing support from all regions of the world, as evidenced by proposals and policy statements from a great number of States in all regions of the world \u2014 Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Latin America and Europe. This progressive development has reached such proportions that it will not and cannot be stopped.\n143.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has had its work facilitated by years of tireless preparatory work. Its own work must now start and it must proceed with confidence and courage to ensure the success of the great task entrusted to it."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your acknowledged experience and dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations will be fully reflected in the successful discharge of your responsible duty. In your election we see an additional recognition of the important role which Latin America is playing in the work of the United Nations. The peoples of the Latin American continent are today making an evermore substantive contribution to the general struggle for progress. They see the road leading to the fulfilment of their aspirations in an increasingly closer co-operation and common activity with all those countries sharing the same ideals of freedom and independence. This was especially reflected at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. \n2.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, the President of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly, for having effectively and competently guided the deliberations of that session.\n3.\tThis year's session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is actually being held after one of the largest international gatherings ever held-the Fourth Conference of the\\\" Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. That Conference, which was attended by the highest-ranking representatives of about 100 countries and peoples, with a population of almost 2,000 million, expressed the determination by even greater reliance upon their own forces and strength, by further strengthening their mutual co-operation and by joint action to change the prevailing inequitable political and economic relations in the world and to seek, together with other countries, solutions to the pressing international issues.\n4.\tContrary to attempts at peremptory interpretations of their orientation, the resolve of the non-aligned countries to implement the decisions adopted at the Fourth Conference by intensifying their concerted activities constitutes, in fact, an integral part of their permanent determination to co-operate with all the international elements on an equal footing. The view that the non-aligned countries are aligning themselves into a bloc cannot but cause perplexity. The non-aligned countries remain consistent in their fundamental position of opposing the division of the world into blocs, into closed privileged political, military and economic groups. Rather than shunning the concerted action of the non-aligned countries, the true approach to the solution of world problems lies only in common efforts and the equal co-operation of all the international factors.\n5.\tAs a follow-up to their previous gatherings at Belgrade, Cairo, Lusaka and Georgetown, the non-aligned countries assembled at Algiers decided that world developments have confirmed the value and the vitality of the principles, purposes and practice of the policy of non-alignment. They examined in depth the present highly significant moment in international relations, made decisions and took stands of their own regarding the most important issues and preoccupations facing the peoples and countries in the world and the United Nations.\n6.\tThe non-aligned countries-whose number has increased almost fourfold since their first summit conference 12 years ago-constitute a real force, without whose participation it is not possible to settle major problems affecting mankind. Any attempts to bypass the non-aligned countries when dealing with international problems of vital interest to all inevitably tend to aggravate existing conflicts and to sow the seeds of new ones.\n7.\tI should like at this point to quote the following words from the statement President Tito made at the Algiers Conference:\n\\\"The non-aligned countries are not asking anyone to grant them the right to participate on an equal footing in the solution of world problems. They have won this right and are firmly resolved to exercise it through unity and co-ordinated action. This means that they are assuming their share of responsibility and obligations.\\\"\n8.\tIn the course of the last few years events have taken place marking the transition from the cold war to the relaxation of tensions, to negotiation and agreements. This process is marked by the summit talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and between, the United States and the People's Republic of China, by the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam, the treaties recognizing the consequences of the Second World War, and other events. These developments have reduced the immediate danger of a general nuclear war and of a direct confrontation of blocs and they affirm the validity of the principles of active peaceful coexistence.\n9.\tThis was also evident in the preparations for and the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Conditions have been created which will make it possible, in the second and third phases of that Conference through persistent and cautious efforts, to achieve further progress in the direction of removing bloc divisions and evolving a security system based upon equal co-operation among the sovereign and independent States of Europe and North America. We believe that the improvement of relations must not be limited to the participants in the Conference, which, with few exceptions, in fact represent the entire developed world. The desired stability and durability of relations will depend upon the extent to which they evolve as an integral part of general security and co-operation in the world, and in close connexion with the situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East in particular. This emphasizes even further the need for a genuine contribution on the part of the participants in the Conference to the solution of key world issues and especially to the completion of the process of decolonization and the development of the less developed countries. Peace and security are indivisible \u2014 either they will be universal or else they will be enjoyed by no one.\n10.\tMore than 10 years ago, at a most critical stage, the non-aligned countries-among them my own-urged upon the great Powers the need to start negotiating with a view to removing the dangers of a general conflict. Through their stands and actions they have, together with other progressive and peace-loving forces, contributed to checking bloc policies and to the initiation of the positive processes of relaxation of tensions and negotiation.\n11.\tIt is with profound concern, however, that we note that the practice of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States, of political and economic pressures and of blockades is continuing. Moreover, there is no hesitation even in resorting to open armed intervention for the purpose of obstructing the liberation of peoples from imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and all other forms of domination and exploitation. The relaxation of tensions has not favourably affected the international economic position of the developing countries: their position is deteriorating further. The changing of the prevailing system of the inequitable economic relations in the world represents one of the central political issues of peace and security upon which many fundamental antagonisms of the contemporary world are increasingly centering.\n12.\tThe peoples of the Middle East, Indo-China, Africa, and Latin America are forced to continue to fight for their freedom, independence, and political and economic emancipation.\n13.\tThe events in Chile strikingly demonstrate that the forces of international imperialism and reaction even in the present conditions do not hesitate to resort to any methods or means in order to obstruct the struggle of peoples for freedom from foreign domination and exploitation. Those events serve as yet another warning to the independent countries, and especially to the non-aligned countries, which have sufficient cause to be disturbed and to worry and to ask themselves; \\\"Who is next? Where will the next blow fall? \\\"\n14.\tWhat is happening in Chile also demonstrates the danger that even in conditions of detente new hotbeds of tension may break out. In Chile a confrontation is taking place between an anti-neo-colonialist revolutionary  \u2014  which is with increased vigour spreading over the entire region -and the imperialist forces and interests. This conflict is fraught with many dangers for other countries and for international relations in general. Consequently, the negative effects of this crisis extend far beyond the boundaries of Chile.\n15.\tMy country deeply grieves at the tragic death of President Salvador Allende, who fell in the struggle for the social progress of Chile in independence and democracy and to whom all those who fight for the emancipation of nations and man are indebted. Brutal mass persecutions and terror against the democratic forces of Chile are arousing the greatest indignation among the peoples and the Government of Yugoslavia.\n16.\tThe military junta did not stop at violence against the legitimate representatives and the democratic forces of their own country. The military junta has created through terror a situation which renders impossible the normal functioning of many foreign diplomatic missions, including the embassy of my own country.\n17.\tIn view of all of the foregoing, my Government has today decided that diplomatic relations between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Government of the military junta in Chile shall be broken off. In making this decision the Government and peoples of Yugoslavia remain faithful to their traditional friendship with the freedom-loving people in Chile and deeply believe in the ultimate victory of the people of Chile over the forces which have trampled on their liberty and legitimate rights to independence, to sovereignty over their natural resources and to an independent road to social, economic and political development.\n18.\tWe are firmly convinced that the democratic and peace-loving forces in the world will not reconcile themselves to the attempts at collusion between international, imperialism and domestic reactionary forces in order to arrest the irreversible processes leading to the full political and economic independence of peoples and countries and their progress.\n19.\tThe crisis in the Middle East continues to grow and is .ominously extending to the entire area of the Near East. Israel continues its aggressive and expansionist policy, uses force daily, resorts to State terrorism, changes the situation in the territories occupied by force and prepares new measures of annexation. All this drives Israel's policy into ever deeper isolation. A grave responsibility falls upon the shoulders of those forces which identify themselves with the aggressive goals of Israel. The aggravation of the crisis in the Middle East not only complicates the situation in the Mediterranean, but also limits the scope of otherwise positive developments in Europe. Any expectations that external factors could control this crisis for a longer period of time are both illusory and in essence dangerous.\n20.\tA just and durable settlement is possible only through the total withdrawal of Israel, without pre-conditions, from all the occupied territories, and through ensuring the legitimate national rights of the Arab peoples in Palestine. It is through their own struggle that the Palestinian people have made the attainment of their own rights a focal point of the solution of the Middle East crisis. The United Nations, with its decisions, has established the platform and determined the venues; no doubt it constitutes the most suitable instrument for securing a just solution. Efforts should be exerted by all Member States to find a final settlement in the Middle East on this basis. Should Israel persist in its aggression, it will be necessary to apply sanctions against it in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter, which was the position taken by the non-aligned countries at the Algiers Conference.\n21.\tThe forces of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid continue to suppress African peoples in southern Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and the Cape Verde Islands, and elsewhere, enjoying the political, economic and military support of some Western countries and international capital. Moreover, we are faced with increasingly frequent aggressive attacks by colonialists and racists on the independent countries of Africa-Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zaire, the People's Republic of the Congo, Senegal and Guinea. Tomorrow this could befall other countries as well. The United Nations must resolutely resist this. In the opinion of the Yugoslav delegation, the essence of United Nations action aimed at the eradication of colonialism in the world lies primarily in extending effective all-round political and material assistance to the liberation movements as the only authentic representatives of their own peoples. My country will continue to extend full support to those movements. It is high time that those movements should no longer be treated, as petitioners or observers. The United Nations action should go beyond this in recognizing the liberation movements as the legitimate representatives of the sovereignty of their respective countries in their struggle for the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n22.\tThe Paris agreements are the result of the invincible struggle of the people of Viet-Nam, which is its historic contribution to the realization of the goals of freedom and independence in the world. The only road leading to the consolidation of peace in this area lies in strict implementation of the agreements concluded and in the total cessation of any external intervention in all countries of Indo-China. It is necessary to prevent the violation and flouting of the Paris agreements by the Saigon regime, with support from outside. The provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, which is consistently implementing the policy of non-alignment, has pledged itself to the full implementation of these agreements and to the right of the people of Viet-Nam to freedom, independence and self- determination, and my country will continue in the future to extend its full support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam.\n23.\tIt is likewise necessary to put an end to the continued external intervention in Cambodia. The successful struggle waged by the people of Cambodia enjoys ever-broader support and confirms the fact that Prince Sihanouk and the Government of National Union are the sole legitimate representatives of the people of Cambodia. It is both absurd and unacceptable to have Lon Nol's regime, which came into power through foreign intervention, representing Cambodia in the United Nations. The time has indeed come for Cambodia to be represented in the United Nations by its true representatives, and the Yugoslav delegation will work for that at the present session of the General Assembly.\n24.\tThe demands of the Korean people for unification without foreign interference merit our full support as a contribution to the improvement of the situation in that area and in the world in general. Supporting the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, my delegation will strive for the adoption at the current session of a decision likely to expedite the realization of the aspirations of the Korean people \u2014 a vital pre-condition for which is the withdrawal of foreign troops.\n25.\tInitial results have been achieved in the area of disarmament, although they do not as yet represent real steps in the direction of general and complete disarmament. The limitation of the scope of the detente among the great Powers is seen in the fact that the arms race continues and that it is spreading to new areas. Although we also welcome the bilateral measures aimed at disarmament that have been taken, we are convinced that substantive results cannot be achieved without the participation of all countries. I should like on this occasion also to reiterate the position of my country, which has been stated many times in the past and is shared by the non-aligned countries in general, namely, that the largest possible share of the resources released through disarmament should be utilized for a more rapid solution of problems of development.\n26.\tThe convening of the World Disarmament Conference is, in our opinion, the best way to initiate the process of general disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. At this session maximum efforts should be exerted to overcome the existing difficulties and to initiate preparations for convening the Conference. The continuation of negotiations for the undelayed conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of all chemical weapons and on the destruction of the existing stocks constitutes an urgent task of the United Nations. It would be of special importance to have the nuclear Powers at long last respond to world-wide demands for total prohibition of the use and production of nuclear weapons and for the destruction of the existing stockpiles and the prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests in all environments. An inseparable part of such measures should be the elimination of foreign military bases and the withdrawal of all troops from foreign territories, as consistently advocated by the non-aligned countries.\n27.\tWe, like many others, have never deemed the relaxation of tension and recourse to negotiations as constituting an isolated process. Even less do we see them as a vehicle for preserving conditions in which it is possible to perpetuate foreign domination over the peoples and countries that seek to strengthen their political independence by strengthening their economic independence while at the same time enriching their independent internal development through new forms and paths of accelerated and comprehensive social and economic progress.\n28.\tWe fully appreciate the fact that it is not possible to liquidate overnight the existing crises and conflicts, or to resolve all pressing issues. However, the determination to seek out effectively, and to find, just solutions to these problems and to extinguish existing hotbeds will in the future be the basic criterion of the merit of further detente. Moreover, unless we resolutely embark upon this course,\neven the results achieved thus far will be jeopardized.  \n29.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries called upon the international community to ensure a proper place for development objectives in the United Nations and to evolve a new system of international economic relations based upon equality and the common interests of all countries. The non-aligned countries are demanding that a general and comprehensive concept of the resolution of long-term and pressing economic problems should be founded upon a new world system of economic relations, especially a new world system of international trade, monetary and financial relations. They desire to build this concept in co-operation with the developed countries, and to participate most actively, and on an equal footing, in the practical implementation of the solutions to be adopted. This is the essence of their positions as contained in the Economic Declaration and the programme of action for economic co-operation, adopted at Algiers [see A/9330 and Corr.], as well as in the decisions adopted by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries that was held at Georgetown in August 1972.\n30.\tThe non-aligned countries decided to establish a solidarity fund for financing projects related to their economic and social development. The international community as a whole, and in particular the Governments of certain developed countries, have to demonstrate greater political readiness to support the outstanding efforts being exerted by the developing countries. This also entails a curbing of the harmful activities of transnational companies as instruments for the preservation of old-type relations, and an end to the denial of the right to the exercise of full sovereignty over natural resources, and it also requires non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\n31.\tAn expression of the determination to assign to problems of development the place they serve in our general efforts aimed at securing peace and security in the world would undoubtedly be the broadest possible support for the initiative of the Fourth Conference of the non- aligned countries to convene, in the near future, a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic issues. Of great importance too is the proposal advanced by that Conference concerning the holding of a joint conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, at the ministerial level, with a view to formulating a programme of international co-operation for overcoming the increasingly dangerous food situation and for solving certain other acute problems.\n32.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J is not being implemented, while the objectives set are not being realized. At the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly we should establish the causes and\neffects of the unsatisfactory implementation of the Strategy and formulate requisite measures for its realization.\n33.\tThe General Assembly should also demand that the interests of the developing countries should be respected and reflected in the monetary and trade negotiations for the establishment of new relations in these most vital areas of international economic co-operation, and it should also demand the adoption of the principles of preferential treatment, non-reciprocity and non-discrimination upon which those relations should rest.\n34.\tI should also like to point out the urgency and importance of the formulation of a concept on the achieving of collective economic security in which every member of the international community would have its unobstructed, independent economic and social development guaranteed. The foresight and validity of the initiative of the President of Mexico, Mr. Luis Echeverna Alvarez concerning the adoption of a charter on economic rights and duties of States  has been confirmed. In saying this I wish to voice our interest in having this charter drafted and adopted as early as possible.\n35.\tThe question of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations has never before been of such great importance as today. In reflecting the changed relation of forces in the world, the United Nations has in many ways had its own physiognomy changed. Conditions are being created for this Organization to serve as the main instrument for the solving of major issues of the contemporary world.\n36.\tThe United Nations is more and more approaching full universality. In this connexion we welcome the admission to our Organization of the new Members-the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with which my country has been developing friendly relations and all round co-operation. In the admission of the two German States we also see an important manifestation of the positive changes that have taken place in Europe, based upon the recognition of realities.\n37.\tIn the admission of the Bahamas we once again welcome the success achieved in the realization of the right\n. of peoples to self-determination and the elimination of vestiges of colonialism.\n38.\tI am certain that in the near future we shall also welcome the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. We are of the opinion that there need no longer be any obstacle to having an independent and non-aligned People's Republic of Bangladesh become a Member of the United Nations, which, there is no doubt, would also constitute a significant contribution by our Organization to the further improvement of relations in the subcontinent, towards which the agreement of 28 August 1973 between India and Pakistan at New Delhi has Contributed in large measure.\n39.\tWe find ourselves, however, in a very contradictory situation. The United Nations is drawing closer to full universality and reflects the turbulent processes of national emancipation and the democratization of international relations, but at the same time its effectiveness is not enhanced. The efforts of a limited number of countries to have the most important problems of common interest taken more and more but of the framework of the United Nations are increasing. Many decisions and resolutions are not being implemented or else are openly violated. The cause of such a state of affairs does not lie in the shortcomings of the Charter, but in the behaviour of a limited number of Member States which do not refrain from flagrantly violating its principles and objectives. Such a situation is rendering the work of our Organization more difficult.\n40.\tWhile being aware of the responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council, we feel that the resort to the use of the veto for the purpose of blocking decisions on which there otherwise exists a very broad consensus can only harm the realization of the role and aims of the United Nations Charter. We firmly believe that our decisions should and can in a greater measure be the outcome of agreed positions and mutual understanding on the broadest possible basis.\n41.\tThe existing weaknesses and hardships facing the United Nations can be overcome only through concerted efforts and joint operation. We hold the view that the United Nations should serve as the central place for the consideration and settlement of the most important international issues affecting the interests of all States. The world Organization should be informed and appraised of the negotiations and agreements reached outside the United Nations which have a bearing on the interests of the other countries, or when, by their substance they fall within the domain of the responsibility of the United Nations.\n42.\tThe non-aligned countries are aware of the fact that their goals can best be achieved through the United Nations and, therefore, they are vitally interested in, and persistently work for, the strengthening of the role and effectiveness of this Organization.\n43.\tNever before has the demand for equal participation in the solving of common issues been so resolute, nor has the number of countries and peoples determined to decide their own destinies in a sovereign manner been larger. In the conditions of the cold war, the dangerous confrontation between the military-political blocs and the great Powers, the general tension and great danger of a general nuclear war, the United Nations was thwarted in discharging its duty in conformity with the letter and spirit of the Charter. We believe that now there exist better chances for the United Nations successfully to discharge its duty in the new conditions. Let us  \u2014  individually and collectively through our attitudes and our contributions-make this a reality."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tI am perfectly aware of the world situation by which we are all deeply impressed in these hours and days of our life. I also know perfectly well that the Security Council of the United Nations is seized of this situation and within a few minutes will hold its meeting.\n2.\tI prepared my speech \u2014 if you will excuse me saying so \u2014 last week, and when I got the new information regarding the Middle East I wondered whether or not I should change my speech. I decided not to change it because I think that the basic factors of the international situation are the same today as they were a few days ago. But nevertheless I wish to quote Article 51 of the United Nations Charter because the Arab States in the Middle East should be conscious of the measures and of the possibilities contained in that Article:\n\\\"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken\nmeasures necessary to maintain international peace and security.\\\"\n3. On the questions and problems of the .Middle East, since 1967 several new decisions have been taken by the Security Council and the General \\\"Assembly. These resolutions did not make it possible to free the territories occupied by Israeli forces after the 1967 aggression, and since the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council were not strong enough to free the occupied territories and to restore the rights of the Palestinian nation, the Arab States, on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, and mainly on the basis of Article 51, therefore have every right to make every possible effort to liberate their territories.\n4.\tI am not informed of how the activities in the Middle East were started and what results are being recorded for the time being. But I wanted to emphasize that, under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, the Arab nations have every right to free their territories by all means at their disposal. And I must add that it is in the records of the United Nations General Assembly that the Hungarian delegation expressed this view several times during previous years. Therefore, it is not the present situation which gave me the idea to quote Article 51 of the Charter.\n5.\tIn spite of the present situation, I think that we have the right to speak about the improving international situation. I say \\\"improving\\\" because when we speak about improvement in this case we have to compare the actual situation with what could happen \u2014 that is to say, against the background of the danger of a thermonuclear war.\n6.\tI think one is justified in saying that in the present world situation there are three main questions that occupy the nations. First, in what sense can we talk about an improvement in the international situation? In what sense are we justified in saying that we are experiencing a detente in the present world situation? Second, are the changes that we are experiencing today in international life lasting changes, or only superficial phenomena? And third, what should we do to make the present world situation more favourable and to secure the good results that we have obtained so far, and what should we do to attain even more favourable results, in the Middle East and all over the world?\n7.\tI have listened very carefully to all the speeches that have been delivered here and have even studied them, and in the knowledge of those speeches I wish to explain the views of the Hungarian Government regarding the present world situation.\n8.\tHungary is a member of the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Viet-Nam. Therefore I begin with answers to these questions that have arisen through the Viet-Namese situation in particular, and by the situation in Indo-China in general. I do so not only because Hungary is a member of that Commission, but mainly because the situation in Viet-Nam provides the most understandable answer to problems of the world situation that we are experiencing today.\n9.\tWhat we are now experiencing \u2014 and I speak on behalf of a Government that is represented on the Control Commission in Viet-Nam \u2014 is a certain illustration of the world situation as a whole, and I think that the statement which was drafted last week was fully justified even by the events in the Middle East today.\n10.\tIn co-operation with the other members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision, the Hungarian Government considers it one of the principal tasks of its foreign policy to promote the full enforcement of the cease-fire Agreement, written and signed in Paris on the Viet-Namese question, and its transformation into genuine conditions of peace in Indochina. This is our main task in our international activities and it is no easy one.\n11.\tTo that end we have to take into consideration several questions. How was the truce arrived at? What is the function of the International Commission of Control and Supervision and of the participants of the twelve-Power Paris conference? What could be done for a better solution and, finally, what kind of international cooperation, including possible assistance on the part of the United Nations, is necessary to normalize the situation in Viet-Nam and in Indo-China in general?\n12.\tThe truce in Viet-Nam was brought about by the four belligerent parties for reasons of their own, and its observance depends on the understanding and cooperation of the four belligerents in the first place.\nin an illegal state. The full legal conditions of its functioning are still non-existent today. The International Commission of Control and Supervision relies for its existence and functioning upon a single source of law: the Paris Agreement of the four ex-belligerent parties. That is the only source of law, and it provides that the Commission can function only when its four members act together. Owing to the fact that Canada felt justified in withdrawing from the Commission, and that the new member, Iran, was able to replace it only recently, the functioning of the Commission was interrupted for several months.\n16.\tSecond, the functioning of the Commission has already been inconsistent with the rules laid down in Paris and, in spite of Iran having taken the place of Canada, this continues to be so for the time being. The fact is that, according to the basic source of law, the Commission can function only together with the Four-Party Joint Military Commission of the signatories to the Paris armistice Agreement, that is to say, in co-operation with the Government of Saigon and the Government of the revolutionary forces of South Viet-Nam. But since, pursuant to the Agreement, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the United States of America ceased to be members of the Joint Military Commission, the other two signatories, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the Saigon Government of South Viet-Nam, ought to have started co-operating in the framework of a two-party Joint Military Commission. This is a very important point in the situation in South Viet-Nam. This has not yet been done. Consequently, the internal situation in South Vietnam makes impossible the functioning of both the International Commission and its control teams.\n17.\tThird, the failure of the arrival of international assistance is also hampering the realization of the plans of normalization envisaged in the Paris Agreement. That Agreement has three Viet-Namese signatories. It involves three Viet-Nams. One of the three, the Saigon Government, maintains a permanent mission to the United Nations here in New York. But the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam are denied this possibility. This circumstance hampers also the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the normalization of the situation in South Viet-Nam.\n18.\tInternational assistance is very much needed in Viet-Nam. It is needed in the economic field, of course, but what we have to urge here in the General Assembly of the United Nations is political assistance from international sources for the implementation of the armistice Agreement on Viet-Nam.\n19.\tWhat are the arrangements of the Paris Agreement that call for international assistance? They are as follows.\n13.\tBoth the observance of the truce and its transformation into genuine peace will also in the future depend primarily on the four signatories, but they need international assistance. That is why the four of them together invited the present members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision to take part in the work of the Commission. They invited us. It was for the same reason that, again, the four signatories together proposed the convening of the twelve-Power International Conference on Viet-Nam, held in Paris in January of this year.\n14.\tIn the present situation something is wrong both with co-operation among the signatories and with international assistance also. This situation involves serious dangers, and its consequences can be incalculably grave.\n15.\tFirst, the International Commission of Control and Supervision was paralysed for months; I might say it was\n1 Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam, signed at Paris on 27 January 1973.\n20. First, the three Viet-Namese signatories should be given equal treatment internationally. If the Saigon Government is represented here by observers, then the other two signatories should also have such representation here in New York. If for any reason this is not feasible and they cannot obtain the right to be represented here, then in that case the representation of the Saigon Government should be terminated at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I think this is an issue that should be considered also by the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Saigon, and it is the intention of the Hungarian delegation to put some such proposal on the table of the Control Commission. The provisions of the Paris Agreement cannot be enforced in South Viet-Nam if its principles are undermined here in New York in the name of the United Nations.\n21.\tSecond, it is clear that for reasons that are well known, the question of Viet-Nam does not fall within the competence of the United Nations because the relations of the Organization with the parties interested in the question of Viet-Nam remain unsettled. The Act of the 12-Power Paris International Conference on Viet-Nam was signed by the participants, as stated in the instrument, \\\"in the presence of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\\\". This was preceded by long negotiations in Paris, carried on day and night. Those most directly concerned in this matter saw in this a significant stand in favour of the United Nations. The attitude of the United Nations towards the question of Viet-Nam depends to a great extent on the assistance that Member States of the world Organization can provide in carrying out the plans envisaged in the Paris Agreement. The possibilities for the United Nations depend on this question.\n22.\tThird, we have to insist that the formation of the Two-Party Joint Military Commission in South Vietnam should enable the International Commission of Control and Supervision to function. Taking note of two Governments of South Viet-Nam does not mean creating three Viet-Nams instead of the existing two. Some people think that our proposal has as its end the creation of three Viet-Nams. Our position is as follows. The recognition of two Governments of South Viet-Nam does not mean the setting up of two South Viet-Namese States. The measures necessary for constitutional life will be introduced under the direction of a council which could be created by the two new South Viet-Namese Governments, by the National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord created by the two South Viet-Namese Governments, which will provide the necessary foundation for a genuine constitutional life in South Viet-Nam. The outside help needed for this purpose is to encourage the three Viet-Namese contracting parties to comply with the agreement signed by them in Paris.\n23.\tThe world owes much to the Viet-Namese people because in the current international situation, even with knowledge of the news on the Middle East, we are sure that there is a possibility of removing the danger of a new world war. This situation, which is favourable in spite of very threatening news, was prompted and prepared by the victorious activity of the Viet-Namese people. Subsequently, we have to pay a tribute to the VietNamese nation and we have to help the Viet-Namese nation in creating such a situation for itself in which a normal and peaceful life is possible. The Viet-Namese people have made an enormous sacrifice for the\nattainment of the present world situation. It is now the duty of all peoples and Governments in the world \u2014  whatever their attitude and role may have been during the war in Vie'-Nam \u2014 to offer their co-operation in the implementation of the Paris agreements for the sake of the Viet-Namese people and the peace and security of the world at large.\n24.\tAs it was by a sharp turn that the possibility of the truce in Viet-Nam became apparent, so did the possibility of detente in Europe arise. In 1969 and in the early part of 1970 it was still inconceivable that representatives of the two German States would sit together in this hall. Later in 1970, on the other hand, the well-known treaties and agreements came about one after another.\n25.\tSince 1969 the countries of Europe have travelled a long, long road towards institutionalizing their peace and co-operation. The second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is now taking place in Geneva. The best advice for its progress is provided by the experience and lessons drawn from the negotiations held thus far. These lessons are the following, culled from the experience of Europe.\n26.\tFirst, countries of other continents should be kept informed of the state of the European negotiations and intentions concerning international policies. The institutionalizing of European security is in the interests of all other continents in the world. This is so from the economic, political and security points of view alike.\n27.\tSecondly, we in Europe must not forget that there is an interdependence between the problems of Europe and those of other continents. As the settlement of the question of Viet-Nam and the relaxation of tensions in Europe were mutually beneficial, so progress in the work of the European Conference will help to promote the settlement of the Middle East problems and, vice versa, the solution of the Middle East problems will help European States to settle their own problems.\n28.\tThirdly, persuasion, understanding and compromise have helped us so far to progress in the affairs of detente in Europe. We argued patiently with one another, trying to persuade each other. We came to an understanding wherever it was possible. We accepted compromise solutions where total accord was impossible. Considering the diversity of the participants in the European Conference, their differences in social conditions, historical background, geographical situation and specific interests, there are many questions in Europe to which only compromise solutions will be possible in the future as they were only possible in the past. If some now insist on rigid formulas and wish to force them upon others they will block the way to real progress.\n29.\tFourthly, progress requires at least a minimum of mutual trust. In the case of such deep-seated contradictions as exist in Europe a minimum of mutual trust there between countries and Governments means mutual realization of the coincidence of essential interests. Any action that disturbs the evolution of such a minimum of confidence can slow down progress. So those who wish to\nplace talks on the reduction of armaments before political detente are like the peasant who would put the cart before the horse. First we have to proceed with the Conference on co-operation, namely, to lessen political tensions and create a minimum of confidence. Then we can discuss military questions on their merits. Today's balance of military forces in Europe, among other things, explains the state of quiet in Europe. We do not let it be disturbed by ill-considered and ill-conceived actions. Those who perpetuate the remnants of the cold war period \u2014 the notorious international radio stations and other propaganda agencies \u2014 to serve the purposes of international reactionary organizations while speaking at the European Conference about the free movement of persons and ideas are suspect from the point of view of the creation of mutual trust. The socialist countries took the lead in urging the convening of the European Conference, in stepping up tourism and in pressing for East-West co-operation in the scientific, artistic and cultural fields alike. We think that what is most essential to the strengthening of confidence is to increase industrial co-operation between East and West, in Europe and all over the world. The experience of history shows that commercial ties can go with the wind if international relations become tense and peoples are separated by conflicts. But industrial co-operation \u2014 co-operation in production and in general joint production schemes \u2014  can better withstand and resist the adversities of the tensions of the international political situation.\n30.\tIt is probably correct to refer to the world situation by saying that either a series of security systems will be created in various continents, or that the life of our generation will be plunged into a thermonuclear catastrophe. The idea of such a plan has emerged recently particularly in connexion with Asia. Taking into consideration all that is now happening in Asia and in the Middle East, including the growth of the international importance of certain nations in Asia and including Siberia, Mongolia, the two Koreas, China, Indo-China and so on, it can be supposed that the coming years will provide an opportunity for the preparation of an Asian security conference.\n31.\tAt first there was much opposition to such an idea in Europe also, but finally the situation in Europe became ripe for the idea to be put into practice. The idea may still seem illusory today to many in Asia but the peoples of Asia, singly and collectively, may soon become aware that they can profit by the bilateral and then the multilateral talks on the preparation of an Asian conference on co-operation. There are already favourable signs which appeared after the war in Viet-Nam and the war on the Indian subcontinent. According to all indications, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan are coming near to a solution of their common problems. We hope Bangladesh will soon see the obstacles removed and be free to join in the work of the United Nations. New possibilities can be explored by the negotiations between representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Seoul authorities.\n\n32.\tJapan can play a very important part especially on the Pacific coast of Asia, in improving international relations. Japan is the only country in the world that has\nalready been given a taste of the destructive force of atomic war. With the very fast development of Japanese industry and of the Japanese standard of living, Japan has become extremely sensitive to changes in international relations. Japan is interested in detente and can see that rising tensions are harmful \u2014 and may become more so. For this reason there is every justification for looking forward to increasing participation by Japan in international activities.\n33.\tIt is the Middle East that gives the least clear evidence of any change for the better in international relations. Nevertheless \u2014 and in spite of recent happenings \u2014 there are indications that a period of change may be opening up \u2014 and perhaps the present series of events in the Middle East may contribute to such a new era. You may remember what we heard last year in the General Assembly regarding Viet-Nam and Europe \u2014 in much the same way as we are now hearing what is going on \u2014 when by a sudden turn the adversaries came to see the necessity of co-operation. A similar situation may come to pass in the Middle East also within a few weeks or a few years.\n34.\tWhat are the indications of finding a solution in the Middle East? They include, first, the unity and the cooperation of the Arab Governments are improving \u2014 and this is a very important factor in the Middle East; secondly, the unrealistic policy of the Government of Israel becomes more and more isolated and is clashing with world opinion. The Assembly knows how many times warnings have been expressed in this United Nations building asking the Government of Israel to pay heed to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) \u2014 but these proposals were never accepted. We hope that that resolution will be accepted by all who are directly interested in the Middle East.\n35.\tIn the matter of detente or no detente the United Nations has good reason to devote special attention to the growth of the international importance of the non-aligned countries, particularly now, a few weeks after the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries that was held in Algiers.\n36.\tPresident Boumediene of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, as host of the Conference, in his appraisal of that historic event declared: \\\"The veritable atomic bomb consists of the thousands of millions of the peoples of the third world\\\". Political declarations like this have to be understood and explained in general as the speaker has meant those expressions. It is clear that President Boumediene has meant to liken the strength of the non-aligned countries not to the destructive and devastating force of the atomic weapon, but to a force effective against the danger of any new war.\n37.\tThe role of the non-aligned countries is indeed of immense historical importance from the point of view of international peace and security. As up to now these nations have had a great part to play in changing the international relations, for in the future they will play a still greater role in improving international contacts. The vast majority of the non-aligned countries consists of those nations which, after tens or hundreds of years of colonial oppression and exploitation, have won\nindependence in the past 10 to 20 years. The appearance o these countries in international life was of great importance and it was of great help in liquidating the cold war and in improving international understanding. These countries have changed the international atmosphere, among other things, by helping here in the United Nations, and outside it, to divert attention from invented problems of the cold war and to concentrate on really fundamental problems of contemporary humanity.\n38.\tThe participants of this large-scale Conference in Algiers dealt with every essential question of international life. The Hungarian Government followed the Conference with great attention. It is reasonable that at this year's session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, this Conference, its purport and importance, should be recalled not only by those who attended it, but also by those who are attentive observers of the manifestations of the Conference and their international repercussions. All burning questions of our day, from the liquidation of the vestiges of colonialism to the new problems of the law of the sea, were under consideration and discussion either in the framework of the general debate of the Conference, or in its commissions, or in its resolutions, or in the interventions of heads of State.\n39.\tThere were some who described the Conference as the peoples' coming of age. Those peoples of full age gave forth a sensitive response to the events in Chile. It is very interesting to know what had been said in Algiers regarding the problems of Chile. The Foreign Minister of Chile had taken part in the preparation of the Conference, but President Allende was no longer in a position to leave his country because, conscious of his responsibility, he wanted to meet the impending challenge and attack of the plotters. News of the murderous attempt against Allende in Chile reached Algiers in the closing hours of the Conference. The international reception of the events in Chile was well described by the 12 September issue of the Algiers daily EI Moudjahid, which in its summary of the results of the conference in Algiers wrote this about the Chilean tragedy:\n\\\"A few days ago 2,000 million people, through their representatives, sent from Algiers their greetings to the Chilean people struggling for its future. The third world, assembled in our capital, in Algiers, welcomed the victories won by that Andean people under President Allende's leadership. At the same time it expressed its anxiety about the intrigues plotted by outside forces against this original experiment aimed at the liberation of man. A few days after this message of solidarity had been issued, bombs were dropped on La Moneda Palace and President Allende is dead.\\\"\n40.\tSince that time we know how much of the tragedy of the nation of Chile has been experienced. I have to salute the President of the present session of the United Nations and the Secretary-General for having felt the need to intervene in Santiago, Chile, concerning the fate of many patriots of the Chilean nation. It is in this international atmosphere that the Chilean people has to suffer from the chaos produced by the assassinations. Since the functioning of its diplomatic mission in Chile had been\nmade impossible, the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic decided to suspend Hungarian-Chilean diplomatic relations. For the first time in the history of mankind, the countries of Latin America are now truly taking part in the moulding of international policies concerning the destiny of the whole world. The people of Chile cannot be debarred from this either. Time and the development of international relations work, and will work, for the triumph of Chile's democratic traditions.\n41.\tIn Algiers the representatives of the non-aligned countries decided to hold their next conference at Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1976. It is conceivable that by the time of the Colombo conference considerable progress will have been made, with the assistance of the United Nations, both in the liquidation of the vestiges of colonialism and in the settlement of the economic problems of the world.\n42.\tAnd we hope that you, Mr. President, will be happy to greet the next conference of the third world in your native land.\n43.\tAt the current session of the General Assembly great attention has been aroused by the proposal of the Soviet Union [A/9191]. That proposal is really worthy of considerate attention because, if carried out correctly and with good will, it may give rise to favourable new occurrences in the fields of disarmament, economic development and international political co-operation.\n44.\tI begin with the political effect of the Soviet proposal. The proposed joint action of the five permanent members of the Security Council may create better conditions for the co-operation of the five nuclear States in checking the armaments race. If the five great Powers can come to an agreement on the principles of a collective reduction of their military budgets, the political effect of such a step would be of paramount importance for the handling of the questions of disarmament, the continued improvement of international relations, and the consolidation of truly peaceful conditions in international life.\n45.\tAt present, disarmament negotiations take place in three different forms: first, on a bilateral basis between the Soviet Union and the United States; second, at the well-known Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva; third, in the framework of the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. In all three cases it is a serious problem that all five great Powers are not united in understanding the purpose of those negotiations.\n46.\tIf it now proves possible to take a step forward, the co-operation of the five nuclear States would not only promote these three kinds of negotiations but also facilitate the convening of a world disarmament conference. A conference of this kind held in earlier years, in which the States then Members of the United Nations participated, gave impetus to a more active handling of the questions of disarmament. That is how the Geneva Committee on Disarmament came into being. Now that great progress has been made in the\nuniversalization of the United Nations, a disarmament conference of all States Members of the United Nations could bring forth new ideas about more efficient forms of dealing with disarmament problems. Such an agreement between the five great Powers may also greatly promote the improvement of the political atmosphere by increasing the confidence of small States that such cooperation is possible.\n47.\tThe economic consequences would, of course, only gradually appear: first, to the extent that the five nuclear States come closer together; then to the extent that other countries follow the example of those five members of the Security Council. But the proposal shows by itself that as international political tensions are lessening, so it becomes possible to contemplate releasing the resources absorbed by armaments, resolving burning international economic problems, and tackling questions involving the very subsistence of the human race.\n48.\tA question of fundamental importance is whether the detente of our days is a lasting one or only temporary. If it is temporary, then it is time to prepare for new conflicts, as is being done in the Middle East. We in the Hungarian Government, mindful of the basic factors underlying the present international situation, and keeping them in the background of all present-day events, are of the opinion that we may prepare for a lasting improvement in the international situation, including the situation in the Middle East. The durability of detente is demonstrated, as a matter of fact, in this debate, and even in the debate regarding Middle East problems. There were only a few statements here that did not reflect the real intention of improving international relations. I wish to mention only one of those speeches, mainly because I think we may draw some very positive conclusions from the content of those negative speeches.\n49.\tAs the Chinese proverb goes, \\\"There is a good side to every bad thing\\\". The Chairman of the Chinese delegation, in his statement [2137th meeting], did .not make a single proposal for actually improving the international situation, for the development of cooperation between countries, or for the solution of problems of the developing world. He disparaged everything that can today be called an improvement \u2014 for example, if someone looks at the world situation in a human manner. He has extolled everything that is bad in the world situation today; finally, he demanded that the United Nations be made more effective, stating at the same time that the years since the restoration of the rights of China in the United Nations have brought great disappointment to the People's Republic of China.\n50.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic is one. of those Member States of the United Nations which for years and years have consistently argued here in this hall and in several committee rooms of the United Nations against enforcement of the unjust resolutions adopted against China by United Nations bodies. We were always with China in this respect. It is strange that now it is that very same China that indiscriminately demands the enforcement of United Nations resolutions. I think that the representative of China should read the resolutions\nwhich the United Nations passed against China. As a member of the Security Council, the delegation of China, making use of the right of veto, has up to now prevented the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations. Yet here, in the General Assembly, it advocates the revision of the Charter which also granted the right of veto to China. These last few years have been a disappointment to many, especially because one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, during the years of its membership, has put forward in this Organization not a single constructive idea or proposal, only intrigues. The United Nations records bear evidence of this fact for anybody to read. They also show that the Hungarian delegation has always joined forces with the countries which made every effort to restore to China its rights in the United Nations. Those efforts have been crowned with success. The delegation of the People s Republic of China is present in the United Nations. Despite bitter experience we do not regret what we did here for the sake of the People's Republic of China. It was justified because we feel sure that the bitter experience of the past few years will prove to have been a passing phenomenon and that China will be a constructive Member of the United Nations.\n51.\tBesides, the current improvement of the general international climate is usually disparaged by those who have contributed nothing towards it and who hold the naive belief that they will benefit by international tensions. Such negative manifestations against the improvement of international relations cannot effectively influence the work of the General Assembly \u2014 that is the good side to this bad thing. Hopes for an improvement in the world situation \u2014 in the Middle East, in Asia, in Latin America and in Europe \u2014 are so strong and overriding that such antiquated ideas are passed over by the General Assembly.\n52.\tThere are weighty reasons why I am speaking in such a way. International relations today are such, and the consequences of armed conflicts are so disastrous, that all countries, regardless of their social systems, are equally interested in an amelioration of the situation leading to international co-operation. Of course, this realization can only gradually come about and many obstacles have to be removed beforehand.\n53.\tNo doubt the first to come to that realization was the Soviet Union. I could cite also many other examples from the history of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, but since it was the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1971 that gave the most comprehensive summary of the steps to be taken in the present state of world affairs, I shall refer to that in the first place. Although this reflects the position of a Party Congress, very many countries today, regardless of their social systems, endorse the programme of peace formulated by it. It is clear from that Soviet programme of peace that the Soviet Union, despite all difficulties, wishes consistently to improve its relations with all countries and to. offer its international cooperation in the definitive elimination of the danger of thermonuclear war.\n54.\tWith new initiatives in its foreign policy, the United States has accepted also, as a programme point, that after the confrontations it must embark on consultation.\n55.\tFrance has played an historic role in the realization that after the cold war following the Second World War, a period of co-operation must emerge for independent countries with different systems. The slogan a \\\"European Europe\\\" was a French definition, and was the expression of a new historic necessity in Europe.\n56.\tIf the United Kingdom could stop raising problems concerning the \\\"smaller Europe\\\" and pay attention to European Europe, and to the most important questions in international life today, it would be beneficial not only to the United Kingdom but to all of us.\n57.\tNow for the first time the Chinese people live in a united national State. It is only a matter of time before Taiwan will also find a way to settle its relationship with the mother country. The requirements for the advancement and prosperity of the great masses of the people of China also make the People's Republic of China interested in easier international relations.\n58.\tThat is what I wish to say with regard to the five permanent members of the Security Council, on the one hand, because their co-operation is decisive for the future of the United Nations, and on the other, because I spoke earlier about the relevant interests of the two German States, India, Japan and other countries.\n59.\tThe Hungarian Government believes that despite all difficulties and obstacles, the current movement for improving international relations will continue. That movement has been brought about by such fundamental causes as will help us to co-operate successfully in making the improvement in the international situation a lasting one.\n60.\tGreat tasks lie ahead of the United Nations. Expectation is growing in connexion with the increased efficiency of the United Nations. This hope is encouraged by the admission of new Members, first of all the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. If it proves possible to rectify the mistakes committed earlier in the name of the United Nations, as is expected in the case of Korea and Indo-China, then the United Nations will have greater possibilities in the Far East. There is a growing desire to make better use of the possibilities opened by the existence of the United Nations for the settlement of international issues.\n61.\tFinnish-Hungarian talks were held recently between representatives of two nations having many things in common in their heritage and their history but with different social systems today. At the invitation of President Urho Kekkonen of the Republic of Finland, the First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Janos Kadar, paid a visit to Finland. The joint declaration of the two statesmen on international questions had this to say about the United Nations:\n\\\"Both sides consider it necessary to promote the full\nimplementation of the principles laid down in the\nUnited Nations Charter and to support the world Organization in the just settlement of international problems.\\\"\nIt is a statement of two representatives of two States Members of the United Nations having different social systems.\n62.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic, together with other States Members of the United Nations, is interested in the relaxation of international tensions, in the solution of problems in the Middle East and in the strengthening of peace and security. For those very reasons, we take part, both within and outside the United Nations, in every international action which promises to improve international relations, to make what is called detente a genuine and irreversible relaxation of tensions and a real solution, by negotiation, of controversial issues."

        "file_text": "\ufeff Every five years, to the pleasure which each of us has of commencing our contributions to this debate with congratulations to the President, there is added a special measure of satisfaction as we pay a tribute to one from our own region who has assumed the high office of the presidency of this Assembly. So is it for me today. The mature wisdom and erudition which characterized his many years of devoted work as Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations have justly earned Ambassador Benites the respect and indeed the affection of his colleagues both in the Latin American group and in the general councils of this Organization. That respect and affection, no less indeed than the experience which he brings to the presidency, will serve to assure him of the support of the entire Assembly even as they inspire us all with confidence in the success that will attend his term of office.\n2.\tAs one of his Vice-Presidents for the twenty-eighth session, may I assure him even more personally of the unswerving support and assistance which he may, with confidence, demand and expect from me and from my delegation.\n3.\tAnd to his predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, who guided our twenty-seventh session with wisdom and efficiency and whose conduct of the business of the Assembly earned him the respect of the international community, may I extend the gratitude of my delegation and of my country for the service he has given to the furtherance of the objectives of this Organization?\n4.\tFor Guyana, as for so many other Member States, the commencement of the twenty-eighth session was overcast by the shadow of developments in the Republic of Chile \u2014 a member State of our Latin American community with which we have had close and fraternal relations. I take, therefore, this early opportunity in the work of the Assembly to pay our tribute to the memory of the late Dr. Salvador Allende, whose tragic passing deprived not only Chile but all the developing world of a courageous champion \u2014 a champion whose aspirations were the aspirations of the third world and whose valiant struggle the struggle of all within it who demand social and economic justice.\n5.\tMany of the early hours of the session have already been occupied with congratulations to the three new States Members of the Organization-sentiments, of course, with which my delegation has been associated. I hope I may be permitted, however, a special word of welcome to our sister Caribbean State, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, which joins this Organization as its one hundred and thirty-fifth Member. The Bahamas is linked to the English- speaking States of the Caribbean by those enduring bonds which a shared historical experience has wrought. That experience has moulded of these Caribbean States, including the mainland States of Guyana and Belize, a geopolitical community which accepts a destiny with a Latin American broadened to encompass it and which promises to make its own enriching contribution to the region thus enlarged.\n6.\tThe Caribbean Community and the Caribbean Common Market, that were inaugurated on 1 August of this year, embody those perspectives. It is a time of progressive change throughout our subregion and it is in every sense a propitious time for the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to embrace the opportunities of independence and to join the family of the wider international community.\n7.\tThe welcome accession of the Bahamas to independence and its admission to this Organization serve to remind us also of those territories of our region that still remain to find fulfilment through self-determination. The impediments that strew their path are not merely the traditional ones; they are both different and various: they range from fear of aggression in one case to concern over viability in others. For these, at least, the impediment is not that of a metropolitan overlordship reluctant to relinquish dominion. In securing the completion of the processes of decolonization in the Caribbean not only the States directly concerned and those of us who share a destiny with them, but also this Organization itself, will need to be mindful of those special problems-will need to be vigilant lest an illusion of decolonization be allowed to displace the reality of self-determination.\n8.\tThe Caribbean Sea has been a cradle of imperialism. When we divest the region, as we must, of the last remnants\nof European colonialism, let us be certain that we have banished colonialism in all its forms, and let us be certain that we have not merely substituted a new hegemony for that which is passing from the scene. My delegation will not hesitate to speak out against any such development which retards rather than advances the march of the peoples of the Caribbean within the integrity of their several societies towards the dignity of nationhood.\n9.\tAnd let us remember that the admission of a new Member State such as the Bahamas is no less the fulfilment of the principle of universality because it is the result of the process of decolonization; for the principle of universality itself is frustrated when societies that have a right to advance to the status of nationhood in the international community are. for whatever reason, denied' the right to political independence as sovereign States, Correspondingly, the denial of the right of self-determination of peoples must also be recognized as an impairment of the principle of universality and an injury to this Organization itself, whose strength derives from the fulfilment of that principle.\n10.\tIn common with the rest of the international community my delegation applauds the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This Organization is immeasurably strengthened by their membership, and the community of Member States \u2014 which is, after all, the community of mankind-is much more real now that they will exercise their not inconsiderable influence and make their important contributions within, and not merely outside, this Organization.\n11.\tBut my delegation would like to look upon the admission of these two great European States as symbolic of even more than the advancement of the principle of universality. With their admission, the international community has broken free of that bondage to the past which the realities of a war-time experience imposed upon this Organization-perhaps inevitably imposed-even as, through the Charter, those realities gave the Organization life. With the decisions on the admission of the German States, those articles of bondage have passed into obsolescence and have been denied their capacity to stifle the growth and frustrate the achievement of the objectives of the Organization. This subordination of the past to the principles of the Charter and to the present and future demands of international organization must surely be the real significance of the momentous decision made in that respect.\n12.\tIs it then too much to hope that in thus freeing ourselves from these particular constraints of memory we may have released a greater potential for creativity than has hitherto been manifest? Is it not possible that by this act of realism we may have finally liberated ourselves from the psychological chains of the era, now long past, which moulded tills Organization? The answers are important, for those chains have shackled more than the principle of universality; they have, in important respects, cramped the effectiveness of the United Nations system and stunted the potential of multilateral organization for securing a peaceful, just and habitable planet. There is a pressing need for release from these several restraints as the international community pursues the objectives of the Charter.\n13.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l], the Secretary-General has rendered a notable service to Member States in speaking out with clarity and with courage on these basic issues: on international goals and the effectiveness of the machinery through which we pursue them; on the needs of our human society and the strength and quality of our will to secure them; on the essentiality of reappraisal and the inevitability of fundamental adjustment. We would do well to take heed of the. grave warnings which that report signals. Against the backdrop of widespread public disillusionment and disenchantment with the United Nations, the Secretary- General alerts us to the fact that time is not on our side, that we need action, innovation and determination, no less than thought, criticism and idealism \\\"if mankind is not to be overtaken once again by the destructive side of human nature\\\" [A/9001/Add.l, p. I.J He records-and this we all know to be the truth-that some of the mechanism provided in the Charter for achieving the aims of the Organization \\\"has not proved workable in the rapidly changing world situation\\\"; that in the area of international peace and security \\\"the United Nations-and especially the Security Council \u2014 has often been frustrated\\\"; that on the economic and social side the integrated response required to interrelated contemporary problems \\\"is often hard to achieve through the international machinery set up for far more limited purposes over a quarter of a century ago\\\"- institutions created in 1945 which \\\"no longer correspond to current needs\\\"; that these challenges of change will not be met \\\"through ritual public statements of approval and support\\\" [ibid.,, p. 2} but by a continuous effort of assessment, of adjustment and of development of new machinery and methods; that, above all, there is need for Member States to examine with care and imagination not merely the United Nations system but their own attitudes, their own assumptions, their own goals and their own machinery.\n14.\tThese are serious warnings, and this Organization owes it to itself and to the peoples of the world in whose name and for whose welfare it exists to pay them the respect we know they deserve. The Secretary-General has expressed the hope that his observations might provide the basis for constructive debate on the present state of the Organization and some of its problems for future development. My delegation can think of no higher purpose that this general debate could serve than that it should provide a positive response to this invitation and that the dialogue thus begun should carry over into the work of the twenty-eighth session, so that the reality, and not merely the rhetoric, of assessment, of adjustment, of action, of innovation and of constructive development may inform our deliberations and decisions on specific issues.\n15.\tWhether the Assembly will respond thus positively, indeed whether the Assembly will respond at all, to the Secretary-General's call for fundamental reappraisal will depend in large measure on the attitudes of the developed countries-among them many of the founding Members of the Organization-to the basic premise of its existence, namely, the validity of multilateral international organization as the most effective means of ensuring man's survival on a planet that sustains him in an environment of peace. I say \\\"the developed world\\\", because it is still the case that for the greater part the developing countries, despite their disappointments with the functioning of the United Nations system, are unequivocal in their commitment both to its objectives and to their attainment through making the Organization more effective.\n16. But whereas the disillusionment of the third world leads to a resolve to perfect the machinery of the United Nations, the disenchantment of developed Member States- of West and East-tends to lead them away from international organization and in the direction of a world society responsive not to the genuine consensus of mankind but to the dictates of a contemporary, albeit transient, power. There are, indeed, occasions when it is hard to resist the conclusion that some Member States tend to see positive value in a United Nations system that is petrified, quiescent and ineffectual \u2014 a facade of international organization, an illusion of international consensus, masking the reality of an operational power structure.\n1 7. For so long as these tendencies persist, progress along the road which the Secretary-General's report has illumined will be slow and halting. It must, therefore, be a major part of the purpose of the third world to convince the developed States that \u2014 although the United Nations is far different today from the organization they envisaged at San Francisco; although international peace and security must now be considered in the context of a world situation far different from that with which they were dealing when the Charter was drawn up; although on the economic and social side such urgent present-day issues as the environment, natural resources, population, outer space and the sea-bed, were but small clouds on the horizon 28 years ago-the realities of contemporary international life do indeed give renewed validity to the concept of international organization.\n18.\tAnd we must convince them also that it is in the interest of all States \u2014 rich and poor, developed and developing, the militarily strong and the defenceless weak, primary producer and industrialized alike-to make the United Nations an effective instrument for reaching by consensus, and implementing by joint resolve, those decisions which are essential for the survival of every State and every man.\n19.\tA General Assembly that has finally consigned to obsolescence the concept of \\\"enemy States\\\" must surely be capable-and at what time more propitious than this?  \u2014 of an acknowledgement that over a wider area of the structure and working arrangements of the Organization the time has come for a similar accommodation with contemporary reality and for a similar resolve \u2014 and for action in implementation of that resolve \u2014 not to hamper the effectiveness of the Organization by an attachment to forms and concepts and attitudes that have lost their relevance and validity.\n20.\tWhat is the alternative to such an accommodation? One consequence of the continued decline of the effectiveness of the Organization must inevitably be an erosion of the support of those who still remain committed to improving its effectiveness in the belief that such improvement is attainable. It is a mistake for any to believe that the United Nations can for long retain credibility and integrity, and . therefore support, while condemned to a state of inertia in important areas of international concern.\n21.\tBut, of course, the consequences go well beyond a further decline in support for the Organization. The United\nNations is the forum, the only forum, in which mankind must seek agreement on the basic arrangements for his continued existence on the planet. Without the United Nations or without a United Nations Organization which is credible and effective \u2014 for it amounts to the same thing \u2014  the alternative to international consensus is international confrontation. There are already signs that this is the direction in which we are moving.\n22.\tThe developing world can have no a priori interest in a policy of confrontation. That is why at the level of economic justice we kept faith for so long with the International Development Strategy formulated for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] with rolling phrases to redress the several inequities of under-development. That is why we put behind us the disappointment of the First United Nations Development Decade and were ready to renew effort and expectation in the unfolding of the Second. But the developing world cannot live on promises with performance for ever deferred. It must look to its survival.\n23.\tThe aspirations and hopes that were centered in the International Development Strategy have been thwarted \u2014 in some cases by the plain disinterest, in others by the active pursuit of the vested interests of the developed world. The confrontations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have for the third time yielded little. The biennial review of the International Development Strategy now in progress [item-46] has already disclosed that the cause of development has lost momentum, due mainly 10 the failure of the developed countries to honour their commitments under the Strategy. Economic crises, especially in the international monetary system, have reduced still further the limited benefits which have flowed from dwindling aid and shrinking and uncertain trade. The average rate of economic growth of developing countries has actually declined, and even the modest beginning towards narrowing the gap in living standards between developed and developing countries stipulated in the Strategy is not yet in sight.\n24.\tTo what has all this led? It ha:; led, in the first place, to a loss of faith in the International Development Strategy and, because that Strategy is the product of the United Nations system, it has served to diminish the faith of the developing world in. that system itself \u2014 certainly in the system as at present organized and operated.\n25.\tSecondly, it has led to the recognition that relation ships between the developed and the developing worlds are not likely to alter significantly within the framework of the present international economic system; that it is not just the case that some nations are rich and others are poor, but that the two conditions are inextricably linked together, that some nations arc rich because others are poor, and that the existing system of economic relations between States serves to perpetuate the imbalance.\n26.\tThirdly, it has led to an appreciation that an essential mechanism for improving the prospects of real development for the third world is a massive, programme of economic co-operation among developing countries at regional and interregional levels. It was this appreciation that led to the formulation at the Georgetown Conference of Foreign\nMinisters of Non-Aligned Countries a year ago of the Action Programme for Economic Co-operation, a programme which has now been further concretized and given a renewed mandate by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States recently concluded at Algiers.\n27.\tIt will fall to the President of Algeria, President Boumediene, as the Chairman of the Algiers Conference, to convey to this Assembly the over-all results of those consultations. Let me say, however, with respect to this particular matter of economic co-operation between developing countries-since it is one for which Guyana has been entrusted with specific responsibilities by the Algiers Conference-that we will, with the authority of the States members of the movement, be approaching the appropriate institutions of the United Nations system for all necessary assistance in the development of global programmes of action for co-operation between developing countries in the important fields of trade, industry and transport.\n28.\tAs this interregional project in its conception and objectives derives from the ideals enshrined in the Charter itself it is clearly right that it should be executed with the support, and within the framework, of the United Nations system, Indeed, given that involvement, its global significance and its potential for improving the conditions of the developing world can help significantly to ensure that this Organization remains relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of the greater part of mankind. As the Secretary-General indicated in his remarks to the Algiers Conference, the United Nations has already given assistance in this matter. We look forward, with confidence, to continued support from the Organization in these efforts of collective economic security which have become so necessary a supplement to the faltering International Development Strategy.\n29.\tFinally, the total experience of recent years has brought home to the developing world a lesson which has relevance for all States. It is the lesson of interdependence at two levels: first of all, of interdependence among the various international economic issues-of monetary policy, of trade, of investment, of the environment, of the sea-bed and the ocean floor; and, no less important, the lesson of interdependence among all countries, rich and poor alike, These lessons have been well learned by the developing States, and they have already begun to inform their conduct in the area of international economic relations.\n30.\tIf these lessons were to inform also the conduct of the developed States, there is no reason why the United Nations could not become an effective instrument for installing a new and more equitable international economic regime founded on consensus and operated with a perception of man's community of interest.\n31.\tBut if these lessons of interdependence, if these concepts of interrelationship, are not acknowledged and respected by the developed world, there is a grave and present danger that we shall move to new levels of confrontation in the area of economic relations, confrontations which will increasingly and inevitably range beyond the scope and competence of the Organization.\n32.\tThe world's racial crisis has already advanced to this point not because of a lacuna in the objectives of the United Nations, but because of the failure of Member States, in varying degrees of delinquency, to respect decisions of the Organization and to subordinate a narrow national interest to the more permanent values of human dignity and the self-determination of peoples.\n33.\tThe record in the field of disarmament is not dissimilar; and here also concepts of a balance of power, like myths handed on unquestioningly by one generation to another, continue to erode the principles of collective security to which the Charter is wedded, and to contract what should be a dialogue of all men into a dialogue of a self-appointed directorate. Once again, it is in another place, not here in the councils of the world community, that this issue, vital to man's survival, is debated.\n34.\tBut as with the cirsis of race and decolonization, so with disarmament. When the debate shifts from the United Nations it enters a no-man's-land where order and legality have no sway and from which there is no return save back to the machinery of international organization. And this is where we are at \u2014 if I may use the contemporary idiom to describe the contemporary scene \u2014 this is where we are at in the area of international economic relations.\n35.\tIt is said that the spirit of detente is at large in the world today. But how pervasive is its presence? How pervasive is its influence? An easing of international tension is always welcome and all mankind is the beneficiary of it. Those who have contrived the present detente have rendered a distinct service to our time. But let us not be unmindful of the reality of its current manifestation. It is not, in fact, little more than a strategic detente which leaves untouched \u2014 at this state at any rate \u2014 a whole range of festering issues and several levels at which contest and confrontation continue?\n36.\tIt is true, also, that within the developed world there is a new thrust towards global consciousness, a sense of the interrelatedness of issues, a perception of the finiteness of the planet, an urgent concern for the preservation of the environment and the world's resources of fuel, of food and of raw materials. But Such insights, alas, are still all too frequently conditioned by the particular interests of the developed world.\n37.\tThe result of all this is that the advance of the major Powers to contact and communication has so far issued in only a limited dialogue which excludes the majority of States. Thus the recognition of the interrelatedness of economic issues is reflected in the search for new arrangements for management of the international economic system; but, as in the case of the international monetary system, the new arrangements are devised to operate still in the primary interest of the developed world and pay only token regard to the conditions of other States. Especially significant is the diminished concern for the problems of underdevelopment as the developed world increasingly looks inward. Indeed, it is almost as if the dialogue of detente is crowding the problem of under-development off the agenda of the developed States.\n38.\tThe super-Powers must forgive us if we do not seem enthusiastic enough about the detente they have achieved. It is not that we are unmindful of the value of an accord that enables them to speak in unison in this Assembly on those matters that concern them both. It is that we continue to yearn for their support in unison in this Assembly and outside it for those causes that concern our very survival.\n39.\tIt is surprising, therefore, that some 60 heads of State or Government were personally assembled in Algiers less than a month before this session of the Assembly commenced, an assemblage never before achieved in the annals of international consultation, including the deliberations of the United Nations itself? And it is to be wondered at that it was to economic issues that these leaders of nearly one half of the world's States gave special attention, and that it was upon action to achieve economic change that they Firmly resolved?\n40.\tThe United Nations has no better friends than the States members of the non-aligned movement. To making this Organization more universal and less selective, more democratic and less elitist, more operational and less of an observer, more effective and less frequently frustrated, we are all, and have been always, committed. If this commitment makes us aligned, it is at least an alignment with the deepest purposes of this Organization; it is an alignment with the spirit of the Charter; it is an alignment with the cause of internationalism; it is an alignment that brings strength to the United Nations system, not one which seeks an aggregation of power outside it. That more than one half of the States members of this Organization are so committed should be the occasion for immense satisfaction.\n41.\tIf the major Powers are indeed prepared to move from detente among themselves to co-operation among all nations, from coexistence to community, they will be taking a path which the non-aligned have long charted and upon which we have long been waiting to proceed. Our commitment to the goals of co-operation and community is one of the realities with which this journey of all men and all States can begin, and it is one of the best auguries for its success.\n42.\tIt is time, therefore, that the developed world should take practical steps to ensure that this commitment is not squandered; and, matching it with a commitment of their own, that it should move with conviction and with a sense of realism and self-interest to enable this Organization to make a reality of co-operation and of community, for this Organization must be the instrument of co-operation and these United Nations must be the embodiment of community.\n43.\tThere is, therefore, I submit, no issue before this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly more critical to the future of the United Nations and of international organization generally, or indeed to the survival of the concept of human community, than that which appears on no agenda item but is implicit in each-the issue presented in the Secretary-General's questions: \\\"What kind of world organization do we need? And what kind of world organization are Governments prepared in reality to accept? \\\"\n44.\tThese questions are not being asked by the Secretary-General alone. They are being asked outside these walls by the people of the world, who want to see the United Nations the effective instrument of peace, justice and progress that they believed it to be. The demand for a response is every day more clamant. The question can neither be ignored through indifference nor avoided by circumlocution, nor countered by generalities. It is time that within these walls we provide the answers \u2014 all of us \u2014 in terms that are clear and positive and unequivocal; in terms that are consistent with the spirit, the aims and the mandates of the Charter; above all, in terms 'acceptable to the people of the world \u2014 all the world-in whose name this Organization exists.\n45.\tAnd it is time, within this Assembly, and in the specialized agencies and in our bilateral and multilateral relations generally, that we matched our actions to our answers.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff104.\tSir, your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly constitutes a resounding tribute to your brilliant qualities as an enlightened politician and diplomat in whom the sense of duty yields nothing to that of compromise and moderation. Such qualities, combined with long experience in. international affairs, are guarantees of the full success that will crown the work of the present session under your presidency. In addition to greeting you, my delegation wishes to greet Ecuador, that noble country of which you are a worthy son, a country that is honoured by a very old humanist tradition, like the rest of the Latin American hemisphere, of which it is a part and which shares with our African continent the vibrant accents of joie de vivre, of warm welcome and hospitality as well as of faith in the future and the will to action.\n105.\tMr. Stanislaw Trepczynski rendered great service to the international Organization by the remarkable manner in which he presided over the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His sense of equity, his absolute respect for divergent opinions, his desire for efficiency and his lofty views have won him the esteem of us all.\n106.\tMy delegation wishes at the same time to reiterate its high appreciation and renew its full support to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose outstanding courage and dynamism combined with his unshakable faith in this Organization will make of it, we are convinced, a more effective instrument for safeguarding international peace and security, so dear to us all.\n107.\tRwanda, moreover, is very happy to extend a very warm welcome into the concert of nations to the new Member States.\n108.\tAmong them we see the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, two States which, we hope, will one day again become one nation, the great and noble German nation, the fatherland not only of Goethe, Beethoven, Kant, Leibnitz, Marx and so many other illustrious persons who have made of Germany one of the greatest centres of culture and civilization, but also the fatherland of Count von Goetzen, that resolute and strong-willed young man who on 2 May 1894 crossed the Kagera upstream from Ruvubu and built a bridge between Rwanda and his own country that still exists. The admission to our Organization of that Germany, which is today reconciled with itself and has recovered its grandeur and to which we are tied by so many historic links and fruitful co-operation, gives us the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.\n109.\tEach year at the same time the community of nations gathers together to consider its fate: to take stock of the past and to establish its programme for the future. Such an examination, if it is objective, must be placed over and above the elegance of style and language which at times, regrettably, is no more than a mask for ulterior motives, and must be focused closely on the realities of our time.\n110.\tIt would be idle for me to repeat here that when we assess the successes and failures of the international Organization, we must first of all convince ourselves that it can be no more than what its Member States wish it to be. In fact, their degree of loyalty to the objectives laid down in the Charter must be the only yardstick to which we can refer to assess its effectiveness.\n111.\tThe preamble shows us that, after the indescribable sufferings engendered by two world wars in the space of one generation, the main concern that dominated the gathering in San Francisco in 1945 was precisely to preserve future generations from other, similar catastrophes, by establishing a structure of peace and collective security founded principally on the spirit of tolerance and good neighbourliness, the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, unconditional respect for human rights, non-recourse to force, and the peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as international economic and social co-operation.\n112.\tA cursory glance at the present state of international relations entitles us, happily, to assert that the current session begins in a climate of detente and more resolute co-operation among States. It may be recalled that the climate of understanding-from which certain ulterior motives were not absent-which reigned at the time of the signature of the Charter was followed by a whole series of discouraging events for mankind, dominated mainly by the cold war between the Powers possessing weapons of mass destruction, many hotbeds of tension in the world, and regional wars here and there on almost all continents.\n113.\tWithout allowing ourselves to be blinded by foolish optimism, we must congratulate ourselves on seeing today an ever greater abandonment of the recourse to force in international relations and the birth of a process of appeal to negotiation as a means for settling conflicts, and greater co-operation among States in several areas, especially the economic, cultural and technical areas. This new physiognomy of international relations accounts for an attitude of renewal on the part of Member States which prompts them increasingly to adjust their conduct to the principles laid down in the Charter.\n114.\tIt is in accordance with the same principles that Rwanda, for its part, intends to define and apply its policy, both internal and international.\n115.\tAlthough it is true that we step into the future with our burden of the past, the Rwanda of today is not the feudal Rwanda explored by Count Goetzen in 1894, nor that colonized country which ceased to be a colony on 1 July 1962 and which was succeeded by the country which, after many changes, is the one I represent today. It is a changed and new Rwanda which seeks jealously to defend the fundamental freedoms of its people, as well as its national sovereignty. Everyone knows that national sovereignty and the rights of citizens \u2014 which are never served on a gold or silver platter but almost always in difficult conditions fraught with suffering and heroic struggle-are also preserved with difficulty, for they are continuously threatened by many enemies, among them imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, the greed of leaders who unscrupulously exploit their people, and by under-development with its sequel of misery, ignorance and disease.\n116.\tIt was precisely to consolidate that national sovereignty, threatened as it was on the inside by a group of leaders who hatched a diabolical plot for the division and devastation of the country, and to ensure for each Rwandan citizen or foreigner living in our country the free exercise of the fundamental freedoms of the human person, that on 5 July 1973, the High Command of the National Army, under its brave and courageous leader, Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal, President of the Republic and Chairman of the Committee for Peace and National Unity, took the major decision to take, the fate of the nation into its hands.\n117.\tThe events of 5 July 1973 were ineluctably inscribed in the very logic of affairs, for the famous words of Georges Clemenceau had found their field of application:\n\\\"It is absolutely impossible for a man in power not to yield one day to the forces of disruption. The very best minds sooner or later have to confront circumstances where the advantages of the unknown outweigh the adversities of life's changing fortunes.\\\"\nIt is neither the forces of disruption alone, nor the many advantages of the unknown in the adversities of fortune, but also that neo-colonialist conspiracy of destruction and national devastation which decided the position to be taken in such hard circumstances.\n118.\tThe accession of the country to independence, with the weight of the responsibility stemming from and the many needs which a poor country like ours must face up to, very soon stifled the impulse of our best leaders in the past who, lacking the imagination to find the solutions demanded by circumstances, found refuge behind the facile policy of \\\"divide and rule\\\", and division by the cynical promotion of hatred, tribal and racial struggles, regional divisions elevated to the rank of doctrine and by mobilizing national public opinion against the menacing spectre of an imaginary enemy, in this case the neighbouring sister States of Uganda and Burundi. Such an attitude ran counter to the very principles of this Organization and of the Organization of African Unity. The person who incarnated the State, short of being a god, had become a true myth. As was said by an Arab philosopher, Ibn Khaldun:\n\\\"Men always regard the man who has subdued and dominated them as a higher being. Inspired by a reverential fear of him, they see in him every perfection, or they attribute perfection to him so that they will not have to admit that they were subjected by perfectly ordinary means.\\\"\nWhile this was the general attitude of the average citizen, there were many enlightened men in the retinue of the Prince who were aware of the dictum of Pascal:\n\\\"To say the truth is useful to the person one says it to, but disadvantageous to whoever speaks it because it earns him hatred; those who live with princes love their interest better than the prince they serve; and they will not give him anything if it is harmful to themselves.\\\"\nAs Abraham Lincoln said, \\\"You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.\\\"\n119.\tCorruption and intrigue in the entourage of the old leader fatally would lead to the fall of that government and the birth of a new generation desirous of saving the nation and consolidating the peace and unity of the country. The national forces of security, under the peaceful guidance of the valiant leader, Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal, President of the Republic and Chairman of the Committee for Peace and National Unity, took the fate of the country into their own hands without bloodshed and proclaimed the advent of the Second Republic. To bring back peace and internal unity, to re-establish good relations with neighbouring and sisterly States, to strengthen understanding and economic and social co-operation with all nations, to co-operate with the international organizations, to support the just and legitimate struggle of the national liberation movements, this is the challenge of the new Rwandese Republic.\n120.\tBut while Rwanda wants peace and proclaims respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of its people, it wants other people to enjoy the same rights and freedoms.\n121.\tMembers are no doubt aware of our grave concern at the anachronistic and explosive situation prevailing in southern Africa, where the law of the jungle and that of the strongest have replaced the law of nature, which, in fact, compels men to live together in peace. It is humiliating to see the human condition of the African trampled underfoot on his own African soil.\n122.\tIn Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, Portugal brings death and desolation. Recently, the Government of Lisbon became guilty of unprecedented genocide by proceeding to the systematic extermination of peaceful and innocent Mozambican populations because they merely expressed aloud their desire for self-determination.\n123.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, Ian Smith has established a pseudo-government under the complacent eye of the United Kingdom, which in the eyes of my Government is solely and fully responsible for the situation prevailing in that African territory. In South Africa -the authorities of Pretoria have relegated to second place the imperatives of universal morality by establishing racism and apartheid as the religion of the State. In Namibia, the same Government of Pretoria continues to exercise an unlawful authority, illegitimate and illegal because that Territory has been repeatedly declared to have been placed under the authority of the United Nations and it is the right of that people to march towards self-determination and independence.\n124.\tThe sad triple alliance between Lisbon, Salisbury and Pretoria continues scornfully to trample underfoot the relevant resolutions of the international Organization and to create on the African continent the last vestiges of militant imperialist resistance. It is also regrettable that certain States Members of this Organization, among them the NATO group, should fail to comply with the complete embargo placed on the supply of weapons to those three countries, thus sanctioning the immoral causes for whose defence those weapons are destined.\n125.\tThe Governments of Pretoria, Salisbury and Lisbon attempt to justify their monstrous crimes by claiming that they are fighting against subversion and insurrection. In so doing, they forget that, as so rightly was said by Condorcet: \\\"Insurrection is the last resort of oppressed peoples; it is a sacred duty when there is no other means of saving oneself'. It is useful to recall, as was so rightly said by Mao Tse-tung: \\\"In the fight for complete liberation, the oppressed peoples rely first of all on their own struggle and then, and only then, on international assistance. The people who have triumphed in their own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation\\\".  In sacrificing themselves for their people the vanguard of the liberation movements will have found death for a noble cause. It is true that men are mortal, but the death of African martyrs for the liberation of their peoples carries more weight than the highest of mountains.\n126.\tIt is high time that the international community should find ways and means of improving the explosive situation in southern Africa, but the situation is no better in the Middle East.\n127.\tAfter six days of war which led to the present situation, six years of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" have elapsed. Rwanda recommends strong measures to arrive at a climate of peace in that area and is profoundly convinced that the only valid solution to that conflict, which has thrown so many families into mourning and created so many orphans, lies in the integral application of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and in sincere negotiations among the parties concerned. My country condemns categorically all annexation of territory by force, by whatever Power.\n128.\tIf peace has not yet entirely come to Indo-China, Rwanda is however gratified at the Paris agreements which crowned the laborious negotiations begun there and put an end to a long and cruel war in Viet-Nam. May those agreements become a reality and serve as an example to solve the acute problems existing in other neighbouring territories. The problem of Cambodia is of concern to us. A nation must decide its future, if necessary by force; it also has the right freely to choose its leaders and the system that is best suited to it.\n129.\tI cannot pass over in silence the question of Korea, all the more so since the international Organization has been closely associated with its development. As a representative of a country which maintains normal diplomatic relations with the two political entities of the Korean nation, I am in an even better position to express our satisfaction with the fact that the two Koreas themselves have opened a process of rapprochement without pressures or external interference. We congratulate them and encourage them to persevere in that path, the only one, far from the sound of battle, that can lead to peace between their two States and to the happiness of the Korean people as a whole.\n130.\tA desperate political situation nourishes man's imagination and sometimes inspires him with solutions which are original but often rich in disastrous consequences. That in our eyes is the fundamental explanation of what today is called international terrorism.\n131.\tAt the twenty-seventh session from this high rostrum the delegation of my country did not fail to condemn most categorically that form of piracy sui generis of modern times. Our conscience;, unless it is obscured by passion, cannot remain silent in face of the cries of those defenceless innocents who frequently die under the rubble of hijacked planes; no human being can close his ears to the atrocious sufferings that Portugal, South Africa and the Ian Smith clique impose daily on the populations of southern Africa. My Government condemns such practices that are equally terroristic and incompatible with universal morality. We should like to repeat that in our country the end does not justify the means and it is not enough for a cause to be just for it to be necessarily justified to the extent that every possible means may be used to defend it.\n132.\tWould the granting of independence to colonial peoples, the extinction of points of hot and cold war and the abolition of international terrorism be enough to give mankind hope for the future unless States at last realize that they must abandon the old adage \\\"he who wants peace prepares for war\\\"?\n133.\tUndoubtedly we must congratulate ourselves on the trend we see emerging in the world towards the settlement of conflicts by negotiation and not by force, but this is no more than a trend and the reality is that the infernal spiral of armaments on which States have embarked is far from being halted. Each year billions of dollars are earmarked for armaments and for the payment of experts in that field. Is this not a genuine misappropriation of the fruits of the labours of mankind, which should be used for his development but are used for absolutely negative purposes which may destroy the whole human race?\n134.\tMan must become aware of this anguishing reality and sheathe the sword of Damocles which is suspended over the head of the whole human species.\n135.\tDisarmament? Yes. As the most disarmed country in the world, our weakness commands us to propose it; as the most undeveloped country, our poverty inspires us to request those who have a surplus of material means to stop their arms race and to turn those enormous resources wasted in preparing the destruction of our planet towards more humanitarian uses which would help to close the gap between the wealth of the rich countries and the poverty of the under-equipped countries.\n136.\tThe developing countries, among them my own, encounter many obstacles in seeking to ensure the development of their economies. In fact, in most of these countries the economic structures that were established by the colonial Powers were laid down solely in their own interests. It is undeniable that colonialism is one of the major causes of under-development, since, as Yves Lacoste has said,\n\\\"The dissemination of modern economy throughout the world is not based on relatively equitable economic exchanges but is closely linked with the establishment of direct or indirect political domination. The exclusive system was for a long time the codified expression of the old colonial pact, which, although abolished in law at the end of the nineteenth century, has not in fact disappeared Transformed into a servant, the colony had to supply what the metropolitan country could not or did not wish to produce, and could only trade with the metropolitan country. Such a division of labour had the effect of reserving the benefits and rights to the colonizers, the losses, duties and obligations being supported by the colonized.\\\"\n137.\tThe old colonies have today become for the most part sovereign States and Members of this Organization, but they have not altogether recovered their economic independence. And we must say, as Diderot said two centuries ago, that \\\"what is intolerable is not to have slaves, but to have slaves and to call them citizens\\\".\n138.\tThe political independence of the developing countries will not be fully achieved, therefore, until those countries once again become masters of their own economies and can talk on a footing of equality with the developed countries. The third world possesses enormous natural resources which could justify such claims. Unfortunately thus far the raw materials exported by those countries do not get a fair price in international markets, which are still controlled almost entirely by the industrialized countries. And yet, ironically enough, it is those same raw materials that are used to manufacture the finished or semi-finished goods which are then imported by the developing countries. The prices of those products are very high, vis-\u00e0-vis the earnings derived from the sale of raw materials, and the developing countries are therefore faced with a chronic deterioration in their terms of trade. Moreover, the manipulations of international exchange rates by the rich countries aggravate further this already alarming situation. The important Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers from 2 to 9 September 1973, tackled these\n, problems with anxiety. The time has come for the members of that movement to agree on solutions to these problems.\n139.\tMoreover, in a number of developing countries the gap between the demographic growth and the economic development is so great that we are bound to consider that some of these countries are heading for a catastrophe. In my own country, for example, the annual rate of population growth is 3 per cent; that population has already attained 3,896,000 persons in a small continental territory where the annual income per capita and volume of investments is one of the lowest in the world. Unless there is greater international solidarity, my country, like many\nothers sharing these same problems, will reach a critical stage in the near future. But all these difficulties must not hinder our freedom of choice in the assistance we request. It is in this context that the President of the Republic of Rwanda, His Excellency Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal, clearly laid down the orientation of our policy vis-\u00e0-vis foreign aid in his address of 1 August 1973, on his programme. He said:\n\\\"The economic progress and even the stability of production conditions cannot be maintained and confirmed without a sustained effort to provide appropriate vocational training in all fields and at all levels. That vocational training must be truly carried out in a conscientious, active and concrete manner. The Government will count on the goodwill of its main leaders and the cadres of technical assistance for the realization of this primary objective. The Government attaches particular importance to having foreign technical assistance really benefit Rwanda and its people through the material realization of the projects undertaken and the true enhancing of the technical qualifications of our nationals who co-operate with foreign experts within these programmes. It would1 be essential at the end of each mission for Rwandese counterparts to be able not only to continue without difficulty the projects undertaken but even to acquire the necessary technical knowledge to ensure that they themselves can assume responsibility for subsequent extension of those projects. Control over the effective realization of assistance must be carried out in a more serious manner. The same goes for the co-ordination and the management of the assistance. To ensure the envisaged development programme, the Government will need even greater assistance from friendly countries and regional and international organizations.\\\"\n140.\tIn the same context, Rwanda wishes to express its profound sympathy with the sister African countries bordering on the Sahara desert which have been cruelly struck by the scourge of drought. It expresses its sincere thanks to all the African countries and those other countries and international organizations which, in an effort of human solidarity, have come to their assistance. For its part, it has made its own effective contribution within the limits of its possibilities.\n141.\tIn science and technology, man has progressively become the master of the depths of the seas and outer space, which daily become more familiar to him. Natural under-water reserves and the enormous possibilities that may be opened up by the use of solar rays are increasing the common heritage of mankind. It is believed that the planet earth can, theoretically at least, ensure the subsistence of 15,000 to 20,000 million persons and that the world population increase would only be dangerous if resources failed to increase at the same rate. But the population is increasing enormously, and never thus far has the world run as many risks as today. It has never been so difficult to foresee the future. In fact the world population increase, which was relatively slow in past centuries, has accelerated since the beginning of the twentieth century. For many centuries the average rate of growth was lower than 0.3 per cent. It was 0.5 per cent towards the end of the 19th century. It rose to 1 per cent in 1940. It is at present estimated at 2 per cent. Strict deduction shows that more than 300,000 years were necessary for the world to be peopled by 3,000 million persons; the doubling of that figure will take only 30 years. The figure of 3,000 million was reached in 1960, and it is estimated that in 1962 alone the World population grew by 63 million.\n142.\tNow, the developing countries alone encompass 2,400 million persons, that is to say, three-quarters of mankind, but they unfortunately possess only 15 per cent of the world's revenues.\n143.\tRwanda sincerely hopes that in the exploitation of the new resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the utilization of the possibilities of the cosmos for economic and social purposes there will be no room for unconscionable contracts which will bind the third world, already so poor and highly exploited, to a material situation of no return.\n144.\tThe material construction of a world without frontiers progresses with gigantic steps. Means of communication are so perfected today that a banal event that takes place anywhere in the world is simultaneously known by all. But, despite this physical rapprochement between men, national selfishness still sows warfare for conquest or preservation of spheres of influence; races try to exterminate other races in the name of the law of numbers or of the sword; the provocative luxury of the industrialized world exists arrogantly side-by-side with the deep material poverty of the third-world countries.\n145.\tIf man has already eliminated some of the obstacles that have arisen in the way of his progress, there are still many over which he has not yet triumphed; the most important of these is the estrangement between the rich and the poor countries.\n146.\tThe United Nations has been and continues to be for my country not only a body to which the Charter attributes a number of responsibilities in the interests of mankind but also a privileged place for the exchange of experiences which may bring about the creation of a deeper understanding of our common destinies. My Government hopes that this Organization will receive the full and unconditional support of all Member States. It sincerely hopes that in this international Organization the group of non-aligned countries, representing over three-quarters of mankind, will adopt a more coherent position and a more effective strategy in order to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the Organization, which to us is the ideal framework for the harmonization of all international relations.\n147.\tRwanda proclaims once again its faith in the international Organization and its unconditional loyalty to the work designed to base all relations between States and individuals on sincere negotiations."

        "file_text": "\ufeff46.\t On behalf of the Japanese delegation I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ambassador Benites on his assumption of the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that Ambassador Benites will guide this session of the General Assembly with the sagacity and good judgement born of a wealth of experience. My delegation for its part will spare no effort in co-operating with him in the discharge of his great responsibility.\n47.\tAt the same time, I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyuski, the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We were deeply impressed by the leadership he manifested during that session.\n48.\tI wish to take this opportunity also to pay my tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our esteemed Secretary-General. I recall fondly the great pleasure the Government and people of Japan had in welcoming the Secretary-General to Japan last February for friendly exchanges of views on a variety of problems, both within and outside the purview of the United Nations.\n49.\tI should like next to extend a warm welcome to the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas upon their admission to the United Nations at the opening of the current session of the General Assembly. Let me express our sincere hope that the three new Member States will join the others in contributing to the attainment of the objectives set forth in the Charter.\n50.\tMore than a quarter of a century has passed since the end of the Second World War and the birth of the United Nations. Looking back over the history of these years, I cannot but have the keen realization that the world is now entering a new era. Profound changes are taking place in the international situation around us.\n51.\tLet me enumerate a few of the fundamental problems which have characterized the changing world since the Second World War. First, I wish to dwell upon the fact that the development and control of nuclear energy has become a prime determinant of international politics. The development of nuclear weapons, which might be said to be the baleful offspring of the Second World War, has given rise to a \\\"balance of terror\\\" in the post-war international community, thus making it possible to avoid the outbreak of total warfare. This is one notable feature of the post-war world. It is a new development, unprecedented in modern history, that large-scale, total warfare has not broken out among the major Powers of the world for nearly 30 years.\n52.\tNone the less, it must be admitted in all candour that this state of affairs has been brought about on a highly shaky basis of mutual checkmate among the major Powers, under conditions of the \\\"balance of terror\\\". Whatever peace we have had upon this shaky ground has been a \\\"transient peace\\\", and it is for this very reason that the United Nations has been making continuous efforts to see that this peace becomes a more stable one. A quarter of a century has elapsed since the end of the war, and the \\\"transient peace\\\" has at last begun to show signs of shedding its \\\"transient\\\" character. I believe the time has come to build a framework for consolidating and perpetuating these new moves on a more stable basis. I believe the time has come for the United Nations to consider on its part a new pattern of co-operation addressed to the needs of such a new era.\n53.\tThe second point I wish to emphasize is the new relations among countries which came out of the war transformed. A large-scale war always brings about an enormous change in the relations among nations, and the Second World War, which was fought literally around the world, was no exception. The relations between the victors and the defeated, the emergence of \\\"super Powers\\\", and the relations between them and the rest of the world marked a fundamental change in international politics brought about by the Second World War. Over the quarter century since the war, there has been a gradual but steady process of readjustment of such relations. Today we talk about the multipolarization of the world. What we in fact see in this may be essentially a convergence of the world at large in a new international order, after years of readjustment in the post-war era. I believe it necessary for the United Nations to recognize this change fully and to adapt itself to it with sufficient flexibility so that it can function in a truly effective way as the centre of international peace and co-operation.\n54.\tThe third point to be noted is related to the retreat of colonialism and the birth of a number of new nation-States. The number of States Members of the United Nations, which was 51 at its inception in 1945, has grown to 135. The very fact that the vast majority of these newly admitted Members are new States, born after the war, amply testifies to the magnitude of the change. This in itself is a phenomenon which merits special mention in the history of the world.\n55.\tI believe, however, that I am justified in saying that the change which this produced in post-war international relations was not only one of quantity but also one of quality and goes to the root of such relations. As former colonies were liberated and a number of new States came into existence, there emerged in the international community diversities in many respects such as race, creed, ideology, culture and even scales of values. Consequently, it has become more difficult than ever before to reach consensus in dealing with the multitude of problems which confront the world.\n56.\tWe realize this difficulty fully when we recall the major problems we are now addressing ourselves to in the United Nations. At the same time we realize that the role to be played by an organization like the United Nations has become all the more important inasmuch as it aims at the adjustment of different scales of values and the realization of international accords in this highly diverse world of today.\n57.\tIn order to grasp precisely the changes in the contemporary world I have just described and to respond to them in an appropriate manner, we have to develop an awareness on the part of us Member States in line with the new situation. I consider it most essential for all Member States to appreciate this challenge and to proceed to co-operate within and outside the United Nations in tackling the major problems of the world which are brought before the United Nations today.\n58.\tIn this connexion I should particularly like to stress that many of the multifarious problems of today's world cannot be resolved satisfactorily through isolated efforts of an individual State or even through traditional bilateral means. The problem of natural resources and energy and the problem of world food are typical examples of such problems becoming increasingly urgent in recent years. Similarly, in order to ensure the prosperity of the international community as a whole and to promote the well-being and the standard of living of each of its members, it is essential to expand trade in accordance with internationally established rules. In this context, international trade and monetary problems are also problems which require solutions through concerted efforts and co-operation among nations. We are faced also with the problem of the human environment and with the problem of economic and social development in developing countries, which is of the greatest concern to all of us in the present-day world. We all know that we cannot hope to solve these problems through isolated, single-handed efforts. We must all recognize the absolute necessity of guiding our work with the recognition that this is really one world, not just one world in the abstract.\n59.\tI would even go one step further and stress that the implications of that fact go beyond the realms of economic and social development or of scientific and technical collaboration, and that they are extremely important also in ensuring world peace and security. To illustrate this point, international co-operation in the field of disarmament can be effective only if we tackle the problem, not merely in terms of military power, but also on the basis of wide-ranging co-operation among all the nations in such diverse fields as the economy and science and technology.\nIt is from this viewpoint that Japan is contributing as best it can to the promotion of disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament, as an important aspect of its foreign policy, by making its knowledge and technology available in the cause of world peace.\n60.\t1 believe that the few examples I have cited show clearly that the world is now entering an era of new possibilities, an era in which interdependence among States, mutual understanding among peoples and wide-ranging cooperation in the fields of the economy and culture, communications and technology could serve as more effective vehicles for the maintenance of lasting and stable peace than deterrence by force or deterrence by the balance of terror.\n61.\tWhat we need now in this rapidly changing world is to build a new framework for co-operation and to translate the emerging awareness of the solidarity of the international community into concrete action. It is true that at the time of its inception the United Stations did not clearly envisage for itself this role as the centre of efforts for such actions. Nevertheless we have every hope and expectation that the United Nations will succeed in adapting itself to this new challenge of the time and become an organization capable of responding to the challenges which confront us in the world today, We have high expectations for the United Nations in this respect, since, with all its imperfections, it is the only body mankind can turn to today.\n62.\tAt this juncture I wish to invite the attention of this Assembly to the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization for the past year fA/9001/Add.l], issued a few weeks ago. This report shares the viewpoint I have tried to elaborate. In particular, the Secretary-General has urged the States Members of the United Nations \\\"to decide on constructive, contemporary and imaginative ways in which it can be used to meet the present and future problems which we face\\\" through mutual co-operation. I am fully in agreement with that view. I wish to welcome as appropriate and timely the initiative for the examination of the problem as suggested by the Secretary-General.\n63.\tAs early as on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, Japan emphasized the need to review the Charter in order that this Organization might be able to adapt itself to the changes of the 25 years since the war.3 Now that the United Nations is approaching its thirtieth anniversary, I should like to propose that each Member State engage in soul-searching, free from any preconceived ideas, and reflect on the role to be played by the United Nations in this new era. We can share the benefits of our wisdom and rally our forces together in the common effort to open up a new vista for the future of the Organization,\n64.\tWhen I consider the role the United Nations can play in the ever-changing world of today, I find it necessary to emphasize how important it is for Asia, which has undergone unprecedented changes since the Second World War, to find a new order and stability befitting the new\n\nsituation in which it finds itself. I do not think I need reiterate here our deep interest in important questions confronting the world today, for which there is an ever-increasing need for an early settlement. I refer, for example, to the problem of the Middle East and the question of southern Africa. Nor do I need to stress the importance we attach to new developments among nations in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, as symbolized by the Conference on Security and Cooperation In Europe.\n65.\tBut, as the representative of Japan, which is located in a part of Asia, I cannot but notice in particular the outstanding changes both in quantity and in quality that have taken place in Asia amid the major developments in the world over the past year since the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n66.\tThe first to be noted in this connexion is the return of the People's Republic of China to the international community, symbolized by the restoration of its seat at the United Nations at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, two years ago [resolution 2758 (XXVI)]. I accompanied Prime Minister Tanaka when he visited Peking just one year ago with the mission of putting an end to the anomalous relations which had existed between the two countries for such a long time. As a result, diplomatic relations were established between the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China under their joint communiqu\u00e9 of 29 September 1972. It is also to be noted that developments leading to the improvement of relations between China and the United States of America, which began with the announcement in 1971 that President Nixon would visit Peking, have been accelerated since then. On the other hand, I have noted with great interest that efforts to achieve a new order and stability have been intensified among the nations of Asia, particularly among the Association of South-East Asian Nations group countries. That development should be evaluated as symbolic of the spontaneous efforts of the nations of the region.\n67.\tIn Indo-China, the Agreement on Viet-Nam was concluded in January this year and the Peace Agreement on Laos in February. Moreover, in Laos, the agreement on the solution of the. political and military problems was reached among the parties concerned and the Protocol to the Peace Agreement was signed. Thus, the international situation in the Indo-Chinese peninsula has undergone an epoch-making development leading towards a lasting peace.\n68.\tJapan established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam on 21 September, taking into account the new international developments brought about by the conclusion of the Paris Agreement. I firmly believe that this establishment of diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam can contribute to the peace and stability of the Indo-China region in the future. In Cambodia, to our regret, there is yet no prospect of peace in sight and fighting still continues. Japan, for its \npart, seeks peace and stability in Indo-China and earnestly hopes for the early settlement of Cambodian problems. I cannot but express deep concern over the present situation in Cambodia.\n69.\tJapan thinks it desirable that the settlement of Cambodian problems be brought about without outside interference, through peaceful negotiations among the Cambodian parties concerned, in accordance with the principle of self-determination. From this viewpoint, Japan wishes to appeal to the Cambodian parties concerned that they, for their part, spare no effort to assist the efforts of the parties concerned.\n70.\tThere has also been a significant development in the Korean peninsula. Ever since the issuance of the joint Communiqu\u00e9 at Seoul and Pyongyang on 4 July 1972, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been engaged in a direct dialogue and have been endeavouring to find their own solution for their problems. My country sincerely welcomes this dialogue and wishes to observe its progress with patience and sympathy. In this connexion, the statement made by President Park Chung Hee on 23 June of this year is a monumental landmark in the path of securing peace and security in the Korean peninsula, We foresee a number of difficult obstacles to be surmounted before the goal of unification, which all the people of Korea so ardently desire, can be achieved and permanent peace and security in the region can be attained. We appreciate highly the fact that the Government of the Republic of Korea has shown, in frank recognition of the reality of coexistence of the Governments in the South and the North, its realistic and constructive attitude in dealing with the situation before the achievement of the ideal of unification. We sincerely hope that the dialogue and co-operation between South and North will be developed further and that the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula will be maintained, thus strengthening the foundation for peaceful unification.\n71.\tOn the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, the groundwork for the normalization of relations between India and Pakistan was laid with the conclusion of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972. We are gratified to note that an agreement was subsequently reached in New Delhi on 28 August of this year for the solution of the pending issues regarding prisoners of war, as a result of continuous efforts made by the two countries. It is our hope that Bangladesh will be welcomed to membership in the United Nations at the earliest possible date.\n72.\tI believe that these new developments during the past year are clear signs that Asia is now entering a new era in which Asians will seek a new and stable order, and prosperity based on such order. As one responsible for the foreign policy of Japan, an Asian nation, I welcome these new developments in Asia and renew my determination to fulfil our responsibility in the cause of further stability and development in Asia. It is in this spirit that I wish to take this occasion to reflect on the roles the United Nations can and is expected to play in advancing the stability and prosperity of the region.\n73.\tI need hardly reiterate that the United Nations, as a universal international Organization, is responsible for the maintenance of peace and prosperity in all the regions of the world. This implies in no way that the United Nations can remain indifferent to possibilities for regional cooperation in each individual part of the world. The United Nations is an organization whose basic objective is to promote the security and welfare of the whole world and mankind. In the process of achieving this objective, however, the United Nations is expected to encourage, in the political, social and economic fields, the kind of regional co-operation best suited to individual regions, taking into account their respective characteristics and thus contributing to the harmonization of efforts to promote peace and prosperity through regional co-operation. I attach the greatest importance to the study of the concrete measures which the United Nations can take today for Asia, which is in a period of transition, for this will offer very useful suggestions in probing for new possibilities open to the activities of the United Nations in this new era.\n74.\tTo that end, I should like to examine today the presence of the United Nations in Asia and explore this question from three different angles: namely, first, what role the United Nations can play in the maintenance of peace in the region; secondly, what contribution the United Nations can make to the economic and social development of the region; and, thirdly, what should be the relations between the United Nations and Asia in the fields of culture and science.\n75.\tThe end of the war in Viet-Nam is, as I have pointed out, an event of such importance that it could signal the opening of a new era in Asia. I sincerely hope for the earliest possible arrival of the day when the peoples of Indo-China can concentrate their entire energy on the task of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the region; the day when they can work for the stabilization of their lives and the promotion of their welfare; the day when lasting peace in the region can thus be ensured. In this perspective, I am firmly convinced that the United Nations can play no small role in stabilizing life as well as promoting welfare in this region, thereby bringing about peace and security in the region.\n76.\tIn this connexion, I welcome the statement made on 27 February 1973 by Secretary-General Waldheim, at the International Conference on Viet-Nam in Paris, that if the Governments in the region so desired, the United Nations and its specialized agencies could play an important role in receiving, co-ordinating and distributing international aid to meet emergency and rehabilitation needs. My country has long stressed the necessity for the provision of rehabilitation assistance to die region, and is already adopting the policy of initiating whatever assistance is feasible at present. However, I believe it desirable that such rehabilitation assistance should be made available for the whole of Indo-China, regardless of differences of social system, on the basis of broad international co-operation. We therefore expect the United Nations to play a positive role in promoting international co-operation directed to the entire Indo-China region, and Japan will be prepared to make an appropriate contribution to such activities of the United Nations.\n77.\tIn seeking lasting peace and security in Indo-China, I believe that it is important to re-examine the roles the\nUnited Nations can play for the purpose of maintaining and ensuring peace in Indo-China.\n78.\tAs Members are aware, Japan appreciates highly the activities undertaken by the United Nations to prevent the spread or recurrence of. conflicts; these activities are in fact the most effective manifestation of the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations conceivable in the present circumstances. In particular, the achievements of the United Nations in such areas as Kashmir, the Middle East, the Congo and Cyprus have marked an important page in the history of the Organization's maintenance of international peace and security. It is from this viewpoint that we have advocated at several past sessions of the General Assembly the strengthening of such functions of the United Nations and their further institutionalization.\n79.\tIn Indo-China, where there are at last growing prospects for peace after many years of conflict, it is highly opportune for the United Nations to reaffirm its role as a peace-keeping Organization and to explore the possibilities open to it in ensuring peace in this region. Such an initiative merits serious consideration as a part of the long-term task of determining how the framework can be built under which peace and stability in Asia are to be secured. Until now, I must concede, the United Nations has not concerned itself sufficiently with the conflicts in the region. It has in fact been denied an important role in settling these conflicts by the inhibiting reality of international politics. However, the United Nations has proved itself to be capable of functioning with adequate effectiveness at least in the field of preventing the spread and the recurrence of conflicts, and this is a field for which the United Nations is discharging the primary responsibility. We should always bear this in mind as we examine the possibilities, consideration should be given to the will and desire of the countries concerned. In this spirit, both Viet-Nams should be welcomed as Members of the Organization if they wish to join.\n80.\tIn the Korean peninsula, the United Nations has been involved in the problem of the unification of Korea from 1947 until today. We believe that the United Nations deserves deep appreciation for the valuable role it has played by its presence in restoring and maintaining peace in this region. It has immensely contributed to the maintenance of peace in the whole of Asia.\n81.\tThe United Nations has persevered for a long time in its efforts to achieve rehabilitation and unification in the Korean peninsula through the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. There have been recent moves calling for new responses on the part of the United Nations. The significant development of the situation in the Korean peninsula, and the efforts of North and South Korea to make progress by means of a peaceful dialogue between themselves, have made it most important for the United Nations to adapt itself to the new situation and to welcome and encourage such moves. It is also important for the United Nations to re-examine its role in a constructive manner, and to seek the most appropriate way for the Organization to co-operate in the establishment of a stable order in the Korean peninsula.\n82.\tIt is equally essential to have a correct understanding of the role which has been and is still being played by the\nUnited Nations in the restoration and maintenance of peace in the Korean peninsula. It is now 20 years since the termination of the Korean war, and the United Nations is still fulfilling its responsibility, as a direct party to the Armistice Agreement,  for enforcing and securing the armistice line, thereby contributing to peace in this region. It is my conviction that this fact should never be forgotten by the Members of the United Nations who are responsible for, and concerned with, the maintenance of international peace and security.\n83.\tAs we turn our attention to the field of economic and social development, we find ourselves in the year of the first review and appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the United Nations Second Development Decade, which was adopted at the twenty-fifth commemorative session of the General Assembly. Japan welcomes this programme as a significant undertaking.\n84.\tAt the same time, in implementing such an ambitious programme and in seeking to bring about the economic and social progress and development of the world, it is not to be forgotten that Asia, with a population of over 2 billion  \u2014 more than half the total population of the earth, and embracing a large geographical area as well-merits weighty consideration. It should be noted that, despite the very low average per capita income of the developing countries in Asia, the per capita receipt of official development assistance in Asia from 1969 to 1971 amounted only to an annual average of USD3.13, which is below the average per capita receipt of $4.27 for die developing countries as a whole. I should like to stress the necessity of giving greater consideration to the needs of the Asian region, as symbolized by these figures, in order to achieve the over-ail goals and objectives of the Development Strategy.\n85.\tWhile it is our expectation that the Asian countries will continue to accelerate their own-efforts for development, my country for its part will continue to co-operate with them in whatever way we can. In this connexion, I should like to point out that there is much room for the United Nations to take a more active part in tire economic and social development of Asia. As a concrete possibility along these lines, I should like to make particular mention of the recent movement in which the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East [ECAFE] is expected to be further strengthened and developed in a new direction while responding flexibly to the changing situation in Asia.\n86.\tMy country hopes that ECAFE, which covers almost all the countries of Asia, can make a great contribution to the achievement of the common goals of over-all economic and social development of the countries of the region, while overcoming the difficulties arising from the diversity and complexity involved in all the political, economic and social aspects of the Asian region. My country firmly believes that such a contribution by ECAFE is indispensable for the prosperity of Asia.\n87.\tIn this context, it can be said that the twenty-ninth session of ECAFE, held in Tokyo last April, was particularly significant. At that session, against the background of various important events indicating the tidal wave of change in the region over* the past one or two years, it was recognized that it is of utmost importance to stabilize and elevate people's livelihood through the economic development of the entire region, and thereby to strengthen the foundations for peace. I should like to take this opportunity to make a few suggestions on the significance of ECAFE and the desirable role it can play against the background of the achievements of the Tokyo session. \n88.\tFirst of all, it is felt that, although ECAFE has numerous achievements in the past to its credit, its recent activities have been extremely diversified on all fronts, perhaps excessively so. I think it has become necessary for ECAFE to give constant consideration to the fixing of priorities and in so doing to discard obsolete projects and consequently give preference to projects in new fields which are truly necessary for the economic and social development of Asia.\n89.\tSecondly, in contrast with the past activities of ECAFE, which have been focused on industrialization, trade and resource development, I should like to call attention to the importance of agricultural development as the heart of the economic development of Asia. The economy of developing countries in Asia is heavily dependent on agriculture, and agricultural development is the key to their over-all economic development. From this point of view my country stressed at the Tokyo session that ECAFE should explore a new strategy for economic development, based on a comprehensive approach, with greater emphasis on more efficient agricultural development. It is gratifying to note that such a way of thinking, as set forth by my country, came to be shared by other members of ECAFE, and finally found its expression in the resolution adopted at the session.\n90.\tThirdly, we are all well aware that, parallel with agricultural- development, a solution of the population problem is another key to Asian development, In connexion with the problems of employment and over-all social development, over-population constitutes an important cause of mass poverty in Asia. It is the expectation of my Government that ECAFE will also play a greater role in this field.\n91.\tFortunately, ECAFE, now headed by Mr. Maramis, the new Executive Secretary, has actively launched reforms of its activities. It is the intention of my Government to consider a wide range of co-operative measures in dealing with these problems. I highly appreciate the importance of such positive co-operation toward economic and social development by ECAFE, which represents the presence of the United Nations in Asia. I sincerely hope that the United Nations will play an ever increasing role in the over-all economic and social development of Asia through ECAFE, with full co-operation and co-ordination with other agencies of the United Nations family, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which are undertaking valuable activities in this field.\n92.\tAs I turn to the activities of the United Nations in Asia in the fields of science and culture, I wish, first, to refer to the point I made at the outset, namely, that the world of today embraces diversities of race, creed, ideology and scales of value. In such a diverse world, greater importance than ever is attached to the role to be played by an international organization like the United Nations, which aims at adjusting the different views and values of various peoples and thereby achieving international consensus. In this spirit my country believes that the establishment of the United Nations University, which was approved at the last session of the General Assembly [resolution 2951 (XXVII)], will be a highly significant undertaking.\n93.\tJapan has always recognized the utmost importance of the realization and strengthening of international solidarity as a means of laying the foundation for peace, and, for that purpose, has consistently endeavoured to make the United Nations University a reality ever since U Thant, the former Secretary-General, proposed that project in 1969.\u00ae For reasons of history and geography, Japan has had the experience of being a cultural meeting-point between the East and the West, and has endeavoured to act as a bridge between the developed and the developing countries. With this in mind, I firmly believe that, if the headquarters of the United Nations University is established in our country, it can play an extremely important role in promoting the presence of the United Nations in Asia. The University has vast opportunities open to it in many areas of learning -such as the comparative studies of different cultures and social values in the world, the development of measures to tackle the environmental problems common to all human beings living on the \\\"only one earth\\\", and studies of possibilities for co-operation between the developed and the developing countries in promoting economic and social development, The symbolic importance of locating the headquarters of this world-wide research institution in Asia is by no means small.\n94.\tAt the same time, with a view to securing sound administration of the University on a stable financial basis and in accordance with the principles of academic freedom and independence, I believe it is necessary to establish what we might term \\\"the endowment fund of the United Nations University\\\", to enable the University to obtain the necessary financial resources for its administration. My country therefore hopes that the maximum number of Member States, as well as other sources, will join in making contributions to this fund and share the burden in reasonable proportions. The University can then acquire a truly international character and prove to be a most effective means of international co-operation, I wish to announce that, with the fulfilment of these expectations, the Government of Japan is prepared to make a financial contribution to the fund up to a total amount of SUS 100 million in five yearly instalments, subject to the approval of the Diet.\n95.\tBesides those activities which I have touched upon, mention should be made of the activities of the United Nations and other related bodies in the fields of science and culture, covering such extensive and complex areas of international co-operation as the sea, outer space, atomic energy, the human environment and meteorology.. With the\n\nrapid progress of science and technology, the activities of United Nations bodies in these areas are expected to become increasingly important. At the same time, in considering the Organization's activities in these new areas, attention should be paid to the enormous usefulness of regional co-operation and the possibilities of helping to solve some of these problems through a regional approach-\n96.\tFor example, in the protection of the human environment, monitoring programmes and other regionally organized activities are necessary and can be effective. In the Asian region, positive initiatives in this direction have been taken by such bodies as ECAFE, and further development of such co-operation should be considered. In the field of outer space there have also been active deliberations in the forums of the United Nations concerned with such problems as direct broadcast satellites, which will be put to practical use in the near future. It is the desire of my Government that the direct broadcast satellites to be launched over the Asian and Pacific region should contribute to the greater solidarity of the international community in that part of the world.\n97.\tI have made some suggestions here focusing attention on the question of what roles the United Nations should play in Asia, which is on the threshold of a new era. However, in order to play its full role in responding to the expectations of Asia, as well as of the rest of the world, the United Nations naturally must consolidate its foundation and should make great strides In its future activities on the basis of a stable foundation. Before concluding, therefore, I should like to touch upon the necessity of stepping up efforts to strengthen the financial position of the Organization.\n98.\tIt is indeed deplorable that the United Nations is facing a serious obstacle to the effective and efficient performance of its functions as a result of the growing accumulation of debts year after year. In a realistic response to this problem, Japan has made its positive contribution to a series of new efforts to find a comprehensive and complete solution for the accumulating deficit of the Organization. To our great disappointment, however, no solution has been found to this day. Representatives of many Member States have stressed the importance of placing the finances of the United Nations on a sound basis. I am convinced that there is unanimous recognition among the Member States of the importance of settling this matter as soon as possible.\n99.\tWhat is urgently required now is a positive move which will trigger concrete actions leading to the solution of the problem on the basis of our common concern. I appeal to those Member States which support the principal financial needs of the United Nations- and in particular to the permanent members of the Security Council, which are entrusted with special tasks and high responsibilities for the maintenance and development of the United Nations-to take the initiative in making voluntary contributions to the Organization.\n100.\tIn making this appeal, I should like to announce that the Government of Japan is ready to seek the approval of the Diet at the earliest opportunity for a voluntary contribution of $US 10 million to help solve the financial problem. This contribution is not only an expression of the high hopes and great esteem that the people of Japan have for the activities of the United Nations, but also clear evidence of my country's spirit of co-operation with the United Nations. I make this announcement with the expectation that it will induce other Member States to take similar action and thus mark the first concrete step towards a fundamental solution of the financial problem. I wish to couple this announcement with the expression of my sincere hope that all the Member States, in particular those in a position to provide the principal financial support of the United Nations, will demonstrate their constructive and co-operative attitude. At the same time, I wish to request the Secretary-General to make still greater efforts to solve the financial problem.\n101.\tMy country has a deep-rooted national policy of living as a peace-loving nation, committed to its ideal of preserving its security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peoples of the world. For a country like Japan, with its dense population and scarce natural resources, there can be no peace without peace for the world, and no prosperity without prosperity for the world. From such a standpoint, my country is determined not merely to be a beneficiary of peace but also to accept its responsibility in the building of peace.\n102.\tThe United Nations is the forum for co-operation in a wide range of fields, covering politics, economy, culture, science and technology. Such co-operation, I believe, is the best means for Japan to abide by its renunciation of the role of a military Power, and to contribute to the building of peace. As I mentioned earlier, the world is now moving into an era in which deterrence by international cooperation will assume ever-greater importance in maintaining and ensuring peace and will supersede deterrence by force. My country sincerely hopes that the United Nations will become the principal vehicle for such deterrence by international co-operation and firmly intends to redouble its efforts to strengthen such functions of the Organization.\n103.\tIn this connexion I wish to express my appreciation for the sympathetic statement by the Secretary of State of the United States in which he expressed his support of the important role to be played by Japan in the United Nations.\n104.\tI shall be extremely happy if what I have said can be taken as evidence of Japan's hopes for the United Nations as well as its earnest desire to strengthen it.\n105.\tIn closing, let me express my sincere hope that this session of the General Assembly will succeed in achieving constructive and fruitful results."

        "file_text": "\ufeff29.\t Permit me, Sir, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ghana, to congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty- eighth session of this august Assembly. We are particularly happy to see you preside over the deliberations of this session because both your country and mine are dedicated to world peace; both realize that it is only under conditions of peace that our cherished aspiration of improving the living standards and the general welfare of our people can be achieved.\n30.\tThis session has on its agenda a number of items of great significance, not only to the countries that we have been accustomed to describe as the third world \u2014 of which your country and mine are a part \u2014 but to the world community as a whole. I have no doubt that your qualities as a statesman and your varied and rich experience as a diplomat will assist you in steering the course of this session to a successful and fruitful end. My delegation wishes you every success in the discharge of the great responsibility entrusted to you.\n31.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of my delegation for the able manner in which your predecessor conducted the affairs of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly. His performance was net lacking in patience, tact and diplomacy, without which this Assembly could not hope to conduct a successful business.\n32.\tMy delegation also wishes to express its appreciation of the work of the Secretary-General. His report to this session on the work of the Organization [A/9001] reflects a readiness and a capacity to further the interests of the world community. We are confident that he will\ncontinue to bring to his task the resourcefulness and diligence which he has demonstrated already.\n33.\tWe welcome the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization. This event not only strengthens this body but also furthers the course of detente in a region which has for many years been regarded as a major area of world conflict. It is our hope that the experience of these two States will enrich the capacity of this Organization in its efforts to make the world a better place for us all. In the same spirit, we extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, whose presence here should remind us again that, for the purposes and aims of this Organization, no country is too small or too weak, no contribution by any Member State is too insignificant.\n34.\tI should like to express the appreciation of the Government and the people of Ghana for the Cocoa Agreement which provisionally came into effect on 30 June 1973. It is hoped that the signatories to the Agreement that have not yet ratified it will do so soon and that those who missed the opportunity of signing it will accede to it in due course. The difficult course through which this Agreement has passed is a symptom of a cancerous growth that continues to plague our world community: narrow national interests constantly blind us to over-all global interests. It is the hope of my delegation that the Cocoa Agreement will not be the last commodity agreement to be concluded and that it will be followed by other commodity agreements. It is only when such agreements to stabilize the prices of commodities on which the economies of developing countries largely depend have been concluded that those countries can hope for a planned and sustained economic growth.\n35.\tThis century has seen a very significant change in the complexion of the world. Territories that were mere colonial appendages have acquired identities of their own and are endeavouring to shape their own economic destinies. They want now to establish their own economic identity within a world economic system. The question is not whether they will be able to do this, but whether they will be enabled to do so.\n36.\tTwenty-eight years after the Second World War we are still struggling with the problems that war left behind. The national economies of countries on both sides of the war were shattered. Years of economic effort to raise living standards to decent levels were destroyed in five years of vendetta, vindictiveness, callousness and complete disregard for the human person and, indeed, for the survival of our planet. This same war brought in its wake an event which, though salutary and justifiable in its moral significance, none the less compounded the economic problems which faced the world and which continue to do so. This event was the emergence of independent sovereign countries, expected and willing to play their part in the general effort to reconstruct the economy of our planet.\n37.\tWhat is interesting in this general effort at reconstruction is the manner in which countries capable of doing the most in this exercise have viewed the problem. Immediately after the Second World War, the Marshall Plan was established. Under that Plan, countries which were involved in the war, no matter on which side they fought, received economic assistance to reconstruct their economies. Some of the loans received under that Plan have yet to be paid back. Nevertheless, with the assistance granted, those countries have been able not only to develop booming economies but also to create a capacity to pay back loans. Countries like my own, which as colonies fought alongside the colonial Powers and their allies to preserve what we were made to believe was the dignity of the human person, have not been treated with an equal degree of concern.\n38.\tIf I have made reference to these historical events, it is not because it is my wish to subject this august Assembly to a lecture on a subject which representatives perhaps know better than I. My intention is merely to draw attention to a difference in the performance c f the world community in two situations which my delegation considers identical in all their aspects, except in their incidence.\n39.\tEvery year from this rostrum we are told of the ever- widening gap of relative economic growth between the developing and the developed countries; every year this Assembly is warned that this situation is inherently dangerous to world peace. It is relevant to ask, What has the world community as a whole, and particularly the rich, done to avert the inherent danger which we all, year in and year out, have foreseen and have stressed so often?\n40.\tIn assessing our performance in this regard, one cannot help but mention a number of factors that seem to my delegation to be clear pointers to the inadequate concern which the countries with the capacity to help arrest the situation have so far shown.\n41.\tIn the first place, almost every developing country is in debt \u2014 debt that has come about often from the so-called foreign aid, a conversion of part of the resources which have been taken from our lands and which are now reluctantly returned to us at unbelievably high rates of interest with a number of subtle strings. The huge interest on these debts has accumulated over the years, and in some cases has exceeded the principal. How can debtor countries service these debts when their economic growth falls far short of what the United Nations itself considers acceptable and desirable? How can the under-equipped world \u2014 to borrow the phrase from President Mobutu \u2014 free itself from factors not inherent in the economies of the developing countries, as some people would want us to believe, but in the nature of the world economic system dictated by the developed countries.\n42.\tThe burden of the developing countries is not debt, stifling to economic growth though this might be; these debts are more symptoms of a sick world economic system. Developing countries take loans to improve their economies, but what do they find? The past decades have witnessed a steady rise in the price of industrial goods; against this, the prices of the primary products on which they depend for the modernization of their economies have been fluctuating downwards. In this situation it is not surprising that most developing countries are becoming perpetual debtors to developed countries with little hope of achieving economic viability. President Mobutu called on the world community to cancel the debts of the\nSahelian countries affected by the drought. I would go one step further and suggest that serious consideration should be given to suspending indefinitely or cancelling altogether debts that constitute a barrier to and hinder a reasonable and accepted rate of economic growth.\n43.\tThis situation has been made even more complex by the present trend in the organization of the world economy into powerful economic groupings. My Government has no grudge against any decision of any group of countries to concert their economic efforts in their mutual interest. It is, however, the view of my Government that if such a group of countries, by reason of historical antecedents or by any other factors, occupies a dominant position in the world economic structure, its actions should not fail to take into consideration the general economic well-being of the entire world community. This, in the view of my delegation, should be the guiding principle of an organization such as the European Economic Community or any other economic group. It is with this understanding that we African countries have decided to enter into negotiations with the European Economic Community.\n44.\tIn our effort to create a more equitable economic system we launched the first international United Nations Development Decade. Our stock-taking at the end of that Decade, however, showed that we were far from achieving our targets. Nevertheless, we launched the Second United Nations Development Decade. Statements made by various countries at the launching of the Decade gave rise to some optimism regarding the performance of the international community. Regrettably this hope has not been justified. The United Nations World Economic Survey, 19721 presents \\\"a picture of unusual contrasts\\\". While the economies of developed countries have been marked by a continued buoyancy, those of a majority of the developing countries continue to lag substantially behind targets set for the decade of the 1970s. On present performance the indications convince us that the Second Development Decade will end with its targets still unachieved.\n45.\tIn the face of this grim reality, it is only natural that developing countries should begin to attach less and less credibility to declarations of intent by developed countries. It is for that reason that my Government advocates and pursues a policy of self-reliance.\n46.\tAs stated in the charter of the National Redemption Council, the principle of self-reliance implies a recognition that our national regeneration depends on our own efforts, and that it is only through honest and hard work on the part of every citizen that Ghana can develop and prosper. Thus, while we welcome assistance from external sources, we are committed not to rely on foreign aid for the solution of our problems but instead to protect the wealth of the nation by active State participation aimed at capturing the commanding heights of the economy for our people.\n47.\tDuring the year world currency problems, which had been developing over a number of years, reached a high- water mark. The American dollar was devalued on two occasions and the currencies of European countries as well as that of Japan were either revalued or floated. In spite of\n1 United Nations publication, Sales No. E.73.II.C.1.\nthe existence of international machinery for consultations on monetary matters, developed countries met to consult on a solution to the problem as though the economies of the developing countries did not form part of the international economy.\n48.\tIn the view of my delegation, all issues, whether economic, scientific or political, have international repercussions; their solution therefore demands international consultations. These problems cannot be effectively considered for the entire world community by a group of countries, however affluent or powerful they may be. Their consideration must not exclude any country, however poor or weak.\n49.\tThe degree of interdependence reached by our present world has internationalized almost every issue to a smaller or larger extent. Until we have recognized this reality solutions to the many problems which face the world community today will continue to elude us. If we seize the opportunity now we may yet usher in the world of plenty which we all seek.\n50.\tMy Government would like to express its sincere appreciation to all those countries which have responded to the call to come to the assistance of countries within the Sudano-Sahelian region. We also welcome the efforts being made by the Food and Agriculture Organization and other United Nations agencies in this regard. We would however be failing in our duty if we did not point out the fact that the problem of drought, resulting in crop failures and decimation of the livestock population in the area, is not a recent one. Yet no serious effort was made to overcome it. When we consider that all the countries in the area were for many years under the colonial rule of one country or another, the manner in which the colonialist bore his \\\"burden\\\" in Africa becomes clearer to us. It is the view of my delegation that it would not be enough to combat the present crisis in the area. We should, and we must, formulate and execute plans which will eventually eliminate the problem altogether.\n51.\tIn our statement from this rostrum at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly,  we pledged our co-operation in any efforts that would be made to ensure that humanity not only would rid itself of hunger, poverty and disease, but would live in a clean and healthy environment. In fact, we believe that efforts to eradicate hunger, poverty and disease on the one hand, and to ensure a healthy environment on the other, are supplementary to each other. We do not believe that environmental protection and industrialization are necessarily mutually exclusive.\n52.\tWe are happy that as a result of discussions at the last session of the General Assembly the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme was elected. That Council, of which my country has the privilege to be a member, has already had its first session in Geneva. My delegation wishes the Governing Council and its secretariat every success in their efforts to find a solution to a problem which is gradually becoming an issue fundamental to human existence.\n53.\tMy Government has been following with keen interest the discussions which have been proceeding on the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. This is an issue of universal concern to all of us. We subscribe to the basic principle guiding the discussions on this issue, namely, that the area should be exploited for the benefit of mankind as a whole. It is the view of my delegation that this principle should be used as a measure for all provisions we write into any convention governing the use of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Our discussions on the issue should recognize the disparities in national endowments of scientific and technological know-how, availability of development capital and the structure of national economies. It is the hope of my delegation that the results of the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction will contribute in no small way to our work at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, scheduled to be held next year. There are problems, such as the limit of territorial waters and the question of land-locked and shelf-locked countries, to be solved. In the view of my delegation those problems are not insurmountable, given a willingness to accommodate and recognize each other's concerns.\n54.\tThere is a link between the equitable economic world order that my delegation advocates and the completely free community of nations which the twentieth century demands. Peace and harmony must, however, exist in the world if freedom and justice are to be secured and maintained for all.\n55.\tCloser consultations among the major Powers have strengthened the atmosphere of detente and further lessened the chances of an atomic war. The end of the war in South-East Asia, coupled with the withdrawal of foreign troops from the region, has prepared the way for peace and reconstruction in an area which for over two decades has endured so much human suffering and witnessed such great material destruction. The conclusion of the treaty of accord between the two Germanys not only will widen the scope for reuniting separated families but also will, we believe, substantially lead to the relaxation of tension in Europe and foster the experiment of coexistence within the framework of different social systems.\n56.\tAlthough these developments are welcome, we cannot but feel concerned and certain trends which could have a far-reaching effect on the aims and purposes of this Organization. There has been in recent years a tendency for the big and powerful nations to seek accommodation outside the forum of this Organization. Perhaps that is because there is a growing lack of interest in the United Nations on the part of some of these big and powerful nations.\n57.\tThe United Nations was established to ensure that the world would be saved from human suffering and senseless devastation. We have a collective responsibility to ensure this; this responsibility we can neither shirk, abdicate nor delegate. The more this forum is used, the more effective it will be in the discharge of its functions.\n58.\tNotwithstanding progress in decolonization, the continued existence of colonialism and racism in certain parts of the world, particularly in Africa, remains a challenge to our demand for universal freedom and justice and constitutes a potential threat to international peace and security. Freedom and the related self-assertion of human dignity are some of the most priceless human rights. No wonder that national histories abound in examples of supreme sacrifices in pursuit of these rights. Such sacrifices continue to be made in our contemporary world and will continue to be made in the cause of human dignity. We in Ghana recognize the Tightness of this cause. It is in the light of this that we are resolutely pledged to the material and moral support of the gallant freedom fighters in Africa who are still struggling to free themselves from colonialism and racism, be they under Portuguese colonial rule or under that of the racist regime of South Africa. If peaceful means were possible we would advocate them, but since the racists and the colonialists leave us with no other choice we have come to the conclusion that armed struggle is the only effective means left to us to liberate our brothers in bondage. The Chairman of the National Redemption Council and Head of State of Ghana made this commitment clear when he said at the opening ceremony of the Committee of Liberation of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Accra in January of this year:\n\\\"We must begin with a reaffirmation of armed struggle as the only means of liberating South Africa. This reaffirmation is important for the purposes of mobilizing all our resources for the common struggle  \u2014  We do not accept the so-called contradiction between commitment to world peace and commitment to armed struggle for freedom in Africa. The liberation struggle is a just struggle for peace and human dignity, for there can only be a lasting peace in the world when all men are free  \u2014 \\\"\n59.\tThis leads me to the Portuguese Territories in Africa. At this juncture I should like to pay a tribute in this forum to Amilcar Cabral, a victim of the pernicious system he sought to eradicate. Ghana deeply mourns him, particularly because it was shortly after the twenty-first session of the Committee of Liberation in Accra that he met his death at the hands of a cruel assassin. Amilcar is dead, but the spirit that motivated his dedication still lives on. He has become a martyr, not only in the cause of his own country but in that of the entire African continent. There may be many like him who may fall in the course of the struggle; but neither torture nor death shall deter us. We shall fight on till victory is won.\n60.\tThe Government and people of Ghana rejoice at the independence of Guinea-Bissau. We wish that independent State every success and look forward to co-operating with it in OAU and, we hope, in the very near future in this Organization.\n61.\tMy delegation now urges this Organization to address itself urgently to the question of the illegal occupation by Portugal of part of the territory of Guinea-Bissau, in the light of the threat to international peace which that illegal situation poses.\n62.\tPortugal has sought to justify its oppression of other human beings by legal arguments and by arguing the efficiency of its administration. It has sometimes pointed a deriding finger at independent African countries. I should like to point out with emphasis that the peoples of Africa are not necessarily claiming a superior ability to order their own affairs. What they are demanding is a right to be human beings and to be respected as such. We no longer wish to be fed and nurtured by benevolent foster mothers; we demand the right to order our own destiny, make our own mistakes, suffer their consequences and learn from them. This is Africa's case. In our struggle to achieve our objective there will be no compromises; there will be no limit to the sacrifices we are prepared to make.\n63.\tIn this regard I should like us to remember those 400 men, women and children who were brutally murdered in the villages of Wiriyamu and Chawola by Portuguese troops. Africa will always remember them among its sons who laid down their lives that the peoples of the continent of Africa might live in freedom and dignity. If there are any among us who seek evidence of Portuguese brutality in the Territories under Portuguese domination, this should be sufficient.\n64.\tIn the face of such brutalities, we cannot but express our grief and deep regret that the NATO allies that are Members of our Organization continue to supply arms to Portugal. It should now be obvious to them that the arms supplied are the very ones which Portugal has used, and continues to use, to perpetrate unspeakable atrocities against humanity. We appeal to these allies, in the name of humanity, to cease forthwith supplying arms to Portugal.\n65.\tWe appeal for more than that. We call on all the Members of this Organization to demonstrate their abhorrence of the inhuman policies of Portugal by limiting or severing contact with the Portuguese authorities. We call for this isolation because it could well be that it would be only through such universal disapproval that Portugal would come to realize the folly of its actions.\n66.\tIn 1972 Portugal announced constitutional changes in the Portuguese African colonial Territories. While taking note of these changes, my delegation would like to make it clear to Portugal that what-4he peoples still under its domination demand is not a sham constitution gratuitously conferring a measure of internal self-government; what they demand, with the backing of the rest of Africa, is that Portugal should recognize their right to self-determination and sovereignty. On this there will be no compromise.\n67.\tThe situation in Zimbabwe, where illegality has been enthroned, continues to cause a great deal of concern to my Government. This is particularly so having regard to the frustration caused by the violations of the sanctions imposed by this Organization.\n68.\tWe were saddened and disappointed when a Member of this Organization, who with others was charged with the primary responsibility for ensuring world peace, passed a law legalizing the importation of chrome which this Assembly, with the consent of that same country, had outlawed. We are happy to note that a repeal of that law now appears imminent. My delegation would go further and suggest that that Government should go a step further by closing down the propaganda office that it now permits the usurpers of Zimbabwe to maintain under its protection.\n69.\tSanctions need to be strengthened and made all- embracing, and no breaches of any kind should be allowed. The excuse often given for breaches of sanctions is that they have not worked. In the view of my delegation, if they have not worked, it is because certain Members of this Organization have ensured that they should not and will not work.\n70.\tIn recent times there have been certain developments in Zimbabwe which should give cause for even greater concern. I refer to secret trials, imprisonments and executions of African nationalists and others, under the so-called Southern Rhodesian Terrorist Act. How many such secret trials, unknown to the outside world, may have ended in the execution of Zimbabwe Africans, and perhaps other nationalists, as well. What my delegation wishes to ask is, What does the United Kingdom Government intend to do to stop these illegal and arbitrary acts in a Territory that still remains its primary responsibility? Secondly, what does this Organization intend to do, if only on grounds of concern for human rights? The United Kingdom Government as the administering Power has the duty to intervene to prevent further illegalities, and this Organization has a responsibility to bring all its resources and authority to bear on the matter in order to ensure that African lives are not sacrificed in the consolidation of illegality.\n71.\tA Canadian YMCA document entitled \\\"Investment in Oppression: southern Africa today bears the seed of the next decades' Viet-Nam\\\" states:\n\\\"Racial wars are already in progress in the Portuguese colonies. The Rhodesian regime faces growing African hostility. The unequivocal rejection by the African population of the attempted British-Rhodesian settlement has demonstrated to the world the intensity of the Africans' rejection of the white minority regime. An eventual eruption of violence there seems evermore likely. The status of Namibia is far from being settled. The potential for a violent upheaval in southern Africa is undeniable although the strength of the regime suggests that any struggle would be a long and bloody one, if there were no international intervention or mediation.\\\"\n72.\tFor more than a decade, this Assembly has adopted resolutions condemning apartheid, racial discrimination and colonialism which Portugal and South Africa and the racist regime of Southern Rhodesia have resolutely defied. These three countries have placed themselves outside the pale of civilized behaviour and the time has come for the international community to show its deep displeasure by ostracizing them. We consider it appropriate that NATO members show their commitment to the self-determination of all African peoples by excluding Portugal from their military and defence alliance. Portugal needs NATO more than NATO needs Portugal, and there is no doubt that meaningful action to exclude Portugal would have a telling effect on its attitude.\n73.\tFurthermore, sanctions should not only be intensified against Rhodesia; they should also be extended to South Africa and Portugal. If we believe in the United Nations as a forum that brings together all races and creeds to work together to improve living conditions on this planet, we are in honour bound to exclude countries which despise the basic principles of the United Nations from economic, social, cultural and political fellowship.\n74.\tNever in the history of the United Nations have so many Member States walked out of a General Assembly debate as they did last Friday [2141st meeting], as a mark of their total rejection of the racist policies of the Vorster regime of South Africa. South Africa cannot fail to see the utter contempt in which the rest of the world holds its policies. In its own interest, it is called upon to change those policies forthwith. It should be forcefully reminded that those who make peaceful evolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.\n75.\tBy the decision of this Assembly, South Africa has been isolated from international sports because of the operation of apartheid even in sports [resolution 2775 D (XXVI)]. In an attempt to break that isolation, South Africa announced reforms in sports which it told the world were aimed at removing apartheid in sports. South Africa's intention, however, was to throw dust into the eyes of the rest of the world. That intention becomes clear when we read a report in the issue of The Times of Wednesday, 30 May, to the effect that the Government of South Africa had \\\"confirmed that it had stopped multiracial football matches which were being played without fuss between factory and schoolboy teams at Newcastle in Natal\\\". In its issue of 20 June, The Times carried a report from Michael Knipe, disclosing that the African members of a multiracial team that had played in London \\\"had to act as porters for the team\\\".\n76.\tThat is the extent to which South Africa is prepared to go in its deception of the rest of the world community. From this rostrum, my delegation urges this world body not to allow South Africa to take international public opinion for a ride.\n77.\tWhen this obnoxious system produces a reaction from South Africans and non-Africans who still have a conscience, South Africa takes refuge behind its laws, ironically described as \\\"terrorist laws\\\".\n78.\tThe whole world was shocked when in September it was rudely awakened by news of the cold and ruthless murder of 11 Africans at Carletonville. Sharpeville, and the helplessness and the agony it stands for, was painfully recalled. South Africa lost no time in shedding crocodile tears of phoney regret, while giving notice that it would resist any effort by the international community to reach at the truth of those senseless murders, which have become the hallmark of the apartheid regime. Surely, the next of kin of the helpless victims reject any expressions of sympathy from those who secretly organized and are a party to the murders. My Government will never be satisfied with any inquiry conducted solely by the racist regime to justify the actions of the murderers. My Government will be satisfied only with an inquiry internationally conducted, or conducted under United Nations auspices, that will have the objective of bringing the murderers to a speedy trial and that will indicate measures to avoid such murders in future.\n79.\tAt its 1682nd meeting the Security Council authorized the Secretary-General  \u2014  in paragraph 5 of its resolution 323 (1972) \u2014 to continue his consultations on the status of Namibia. At the time that resolution was adopted some of us were sceptical about the value of such consultations. Now the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council on his consultations has justified that scepticism. It has supported our contention that the conditions for dialogue with South Africa do not exist. That is why my delegation supports the consensus reached by the United Nations Council for Namibia at its 167th meeting, held on 27 March this year, opposing further contacts with South Africa on the grounds that: \\\"To maintain contacts with the South African regime would mean an acceptance of its policy on the part of the United Nations.. .\\\". \n80.\tIt is time to remind the South African regime, without mincing words, that it is the inhabitants of Namibia themselves who must decide their future, and certainly not South Africa; that the people of Namibia have so decided on that future; and that they have decided on independence. If South Africa claims that it does not wish to impose a settlement on Namibia, let it accede to the clear wishes of the people and withdraw from the Territory now, today.\n81.\tThe Namibian problem is not an intractable one. It is intractable only in South African eyes. It is not a complicated issue. It is an issue similar to that which faced any of the Second World War Mandated Territories. Mandatory Powers have withdrawn and conceded independence to the indigenous peoples. South Africa is called upon to follow that example and grant independence to the people of Namibia. We do not accept that protracted discussions should be held in a situation where the solution is clear: independence for the people of Namibia, now. If South Africa has no designs whatsoever with respect to any part of Namibia's territory, let it back that assertion by withdrawing from Namibia forthwith. The people of Namibia do not want to appear to be subsidized by apartheid money, made bloodier by the death of the martyrs of Sharpeville and Carletonville. They demand independence to enable them to exploit their own natural resources for the benefit of their own people. South Africa has no duty in Namibia other than to pack up and quit that Territory.\n82.\tThe real representatives of Namibia do not want a dialogue with Vorster. They reject murderous hands and the deadly gifts they carry. The only discussion permissible is one with Sam Nujoma, leader of the South West African People's Organization, and his colleagues about the immediate transfer of power. That is South Africa's only duty in Namibia, and if it had any honour South Africa would perform that duty right away.\n83.\tThe world community continues to express concern over the arms race; yet the report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly [A/9141-DC/236], like its predecessors, does not indicate any prospect of a break-through. In the meantime, the stockpiling of armaments, particularly nuclear and biological weapons, continues, and that in spite of the significant relaxation in the international situation which all of us have noted. Agreement on a nuclear test ban in the atmosphere and in outer space  was reached 10 years ago. Since then there has been no progress towards an agreement on a complete test ban. In fact, the partial-test ban Treaty has not yet gained universal accession. France, for example, continues to plan to carry out atmospheric tests in the Pacific, in the face of vigorous opposition from all the countries in the area, which stand in great danger of being affected by the radiation from such tests, and against the ruling of the International Court of Justice. \n84.\tThe view of my Government is that the issue of disarmament, like many issues facing our present international community, is of universal concern. It is of concern both for the militarily powerful and for the militarily weak. That is why my delegation supported the decision to hold a world disarmament conference, adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly [resolution 2930 (XXVII)].\n85.\tIt is the hope of my delegation that the militarily powerful nations, which as permanent members of the Security Council have the primary responsibility for safeguarding world security, will recognize the general obligation of the world community as a whole to ensure world peace. It is hoped that they will, in recognition of the general world concern over the disarmament issue, co-operate with the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly [resolution 2930 (XXVII)] to make the envisaged Conference a success. Even if such a conference achieved nothing at all \u2014 and in the view of my delegation there is much that it could achieve \u2014 it would serve to emphasize the general world concern over the issue of disarmament.\n86.\tMy Government views the outbreak of fresh fighting in the Middle East with a great deal of concern. It is our view that in this situation the question of who attacked first is less relevant than the lesson which the new development emphasizes.\n87.\tSince 1967 Arab lands have been occupied by Israeli forces. For an even longer period the Palestinians have remained refugees, dependent on international charity, with no hope that their plight will be relieved. Hurt national pride and human suffering have combined to give rise to the situation which we are now witnessing in the Middle East. Until the Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Arab territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 war, and until the plight of the Palestinian has been relieved and the security of all States in the area has been assured, the Middle East will continue to be a hotbed of threats to peace in the area, as well as to international peace. My delegation urges this Organization to redouble its efforts to reach a settlement in the area which will restore national pride, human dignity and security to all concerned. The Government of Ghana would be willing to lend its assistance to any initiatives to that end.\n88.\tIf this Assembly were to commit itself to the goals that we have enumerated, if the membership were to pledge support to the realization of those goals, then we might yet live to see a world not only of sovereign States in which there was an equitable sharing of economic resources but also a world of plenty and a world of freedom and justice.\n89.\tI wish the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly success."

        "file_text": "\ufeff419.\t Mr. President, I should like first of all to congratulate you upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. For the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we are proud to have as President a man who has the courage of his convictions.\n420.\tIt was not my intention to mention in this statement the problem of the Middle East. Tragic circumstances compel me to do so.\n421.\tWith the prolongation of the cease-fire, the hope of a diplomatic, just and balanced solution was born, and\nBelgium had begun to believe that 1973 would at last witness the opening of true negotiations. The breach of the cease-fire sets back the chances of a negotiated solution and again plunges this region of the world into the horrors of war.\n422.\tThe situation is complex. Egypt and Syria consider that Israel's refusal to withdraw from the occupied territories, its reluctance to accept the principle of non-acquisition of territory by force, could no longer be tolerated. The Palestinian people did not see approaching the moment when its legitimate aspirations would at long last be taken into consideration; Israel was becoming irritated at the difficulties of beginning a negotiation which would bring a peace that none of the parties would contest and by which its right to existence would be confirmed, thereby removing forever the spectre of its destruction.\n423.\tBelgium was cognizant of the sincerity of the positions of each of the parties, believed in their desire to conclude peace and felt their concern at the prolonged deadlock. But it could not resign itself to believing that weapons would be preferred to diplomacy. War sometimes brings victories; rarely does it bring solutions. We have known this for thousands of years. In such circumstances, our Organization must not be discouraged; it has the obligation to attempt once again to achieve the reconciliation and pacification for which it was created.\n424.\tThe Security Council is in session \u2014 that is its duty. In our opinion, it must order rapidly the cessation of all fighting, and this without seeking first to determine the responsibility for this new confrontation.\n425.\tThen, this time, and without delay, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must be implemented.\n426.\tMy country, together with its European partners, will contribute to this end in order to establish secure and recognized boundaries in that region that are guaranteed by international commitments and protected by the presence of international peace-keeping forces. A situation of this kind would have made the present confrontation impossible.\n427.\tI shall say no more for the moment, but, as a European country that has known two deadly wars, I appeal to the Security Council to take action to stop the bloodshed.\n428.\tMr. President, you are a citizen of Latin America, that vast continent whose peoples are striving to create a promising future. A gigantic task is being carried out in hope, and also in suffering and pain. With profound concern my country followed the evolution of the situation in Chile. The Belgian Government condemned most formally the overthrow by force of democratically elected bodies, and I cannot remain silent or fail to voice our concern regarding the maintenance of human and political freedoms in a country that is dear to us for more than one reason.\n429.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1] the Secretary-General emphasized the progress achieved by our Organization in its\nsearch for universality. We are happy to welcome the representatives of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. As a European, I have special reasons for being gratified at the admission to the United Nations of the two German States. Their admission is the result of a realistic and courageous policy followed by the leaders of both States. It is also the fruit and the symbol, one might say, of the evolution we have seen in Europe and throughout the world of late. Cold war tensions are followed by detente; the era of multiple confrontations is succeeded by the present, the time for negotiation.\n430.\tWe must underline the fact that the two German States sought to complete the normalization of their relations through their entry into our world Organization. The logical effect of this admission, it seems to me, should be the abrogation of the provisions of Articles 53 and 107 of the Charter, which mention \\\"enemy States\\\".\n431.\tWe should also like to express our concern at the persistence of certain situations which jeopardize the Organization's desire for universality. Such is the case with regard to the African Territories of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau. In this connexion we are duty-bound to note with regret that resolution 322 (1972), adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 22 November 1972, remains a dead letter in all its parts. Belgium continues to uphold this resolution, for which it voted, because it believes that the exercise of self-determination and independence cannot be refused to the peoples of those Territories.\n432.\tThe purpose of the negotiations recommended by the Security Council is to transfer power to freely elected political institutions representing the whole of the populations concerned. In its bilateral relations with Portugal, as well as in the international bodies where it sits side by side with that country, Belgium, as in the past, will strive to convince the administering Power that it is up to that Power, first and foremost, to take the necessary steps to that end.\n433.\tWe are gratified to find that a spirit of mutual understanding has permitted the authentic representatives of Papua New Guinea and the Australian Government to proclaim the independence of that territory not later than 1975. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas has already joined us, following fruitful negotiations with the former administering Power. May these two glowing testimonies of accession to independence through negotiation encourage Portugal to do likewise.\n434.\tAt the same time that it reaffirmed the inalienable right of the peoples of the Portuguese Territories to self-determination and independence, the Security Council recognized the legitimacy of their struggle to acquire that right. In this spirit Belgium is prepared to consider the granting, through international organizations, of humanitarian assistance to the victims of that struggle.\n435.\tWe also express the hope that in Namibia, Southern Rhodesia, Korea and Viet-Nam, decolonization and detente will very soon, for the happiness of those peoples and in the interest of relations among nations, add to the universal character of our Organization.\n436.\tThe basis of the two trends \u2014 decolonization and detente in terms of closer co-operation among all countries of the world \u2014 is unquestionably the recognition of fundamental human rights. To desire detente is to renounce the aims of war, even when one believes that one can achieve them through non-violent means.\n437.\tTo desire detente is to eliminate the fear of an attack. It is to engender at the same time security, which is the first condition for any co-operation. True peace, a peace that is not a mere armistice, implies the rule of law; that is to say, a state where the rule of law prevails and respect for human rights is recognized for all citizens without distinction.\n438.\tThe sometimes uncertain and always cruel play of unbridled nationalism is certainly not the best road to peace. This is a truth that the peoples of Europe learned to their sorrow and at great cost and much suffering. This truth so dearly bought has led them to establish a \\\"Community\\\" as a framework for their reconciliation and co-operation.\n439.\tThe political purpose of that Community, as instituted by treaties, was recalled and confirmed by the summit conference of its nine members held in Paris in October 1972. At the same time, that Conference spelled out the terms of the challenge that the peoples of Europe intend to take up. By virtue of that challenge, the European Community proposes in particular to make a creative contribution, within the limits of its human, intellectual and material resources, and to affirm its own concepts in international relations in keeping with its desire for an open policy for progress, peace and co-operation.\n440.\tThe initial role of the European Community will be to show that it is possible to constitute a powerful entity on the production level and on that of human creativity, fully adapted to the industrial and technological requirements of our time, without, however, yielding to the temptations of what some have called the nationalist universalism of the great Powers. We believe that the realization of this ambition will be greatly facilitated if, at the same time and progressively, the constituent rules of the universal community grouping all the nations of the world are clearly spelled out on the basis of the provisions of the Charter.\n441.\tIt is in this spirit that my country, like the other members of the European Community, wishes to avail itself of the opportunity afforded by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. To consolidate detente and security in Europe means to seek out and create the necessary conditions for multifaceted co-operation among all the countries of the continent. As a prior condition to the search for security and co-operation of Europe as a whole, it was necessary to normalize relations between the two German States. Similarly, and in a wider context, we believe that normalized relations between all the European States \u2014 States whose economic and social systems are different \u2014 should provide an essential contribution to the establishment of the world community.\n442.\tI have sought to place the integration efforts of the countries of the European Community in the perspective of a more distant goal, that of the universal community of all nations. In our view, talks and negotiations between East\nand West represent the next stage and a step towards that ultimate objective.\n443.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe must therefore be placed on a sound and secure basis. In this connexion, we attach particular importance to the development of the human relationships with which the Conference must concern itself. On that occasion too, a step must be taken towards enlarging the exercise of human rights.\n444.\tWe consider, indeed, that detente in Europe will be neither complete nor lasting so long as people are unable to meet together freely, without hindrance of any kind, so long as they are unable to express themselves without constraint and see what they wish to see, so long as there are still obstacles and barriers that prevent those who wish to do so from reading or being read.\n445.\tIn this context I associate myself with the warning of my British colleague, who stated that detente must be genuine and not an illusion [2128th meeting, para. 124].\n446.\tThe lot that we assign to a man \u2014 considered as an individual, as a member of a family or of the various groups constituting our societies \u2014 the lot of man determines to a great extent the quality of the relationships we propose to establish among States.\n447.\tI do not lose sight of the fact that order and stability in international relations demand strict observance of the rule of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. This is the raison d'etre and the wisdom of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter. Belgium has no intention of departing from that precept. However, it must be emphasized that non-interference cannot mean indifference, insensitivity, lack of concern for others. It seems obvious that, if it is impossible for us to build between us bridges of a certain human solidarity, the limits of our forthcoming agreement will be extremely narrow, not to say distorted.\n448.\tWhat we have in mind is a detente that is not fictitious, but real and genuine, a detente among open societies. To my way of thinking, a detente of this kind implies not only a continuing exchange of products but also a guaranteed interchange of people and ideas.\n449.\tThe negotiations on balanced reduction of forces constitute a particular element in our efforts to consolidate detente in Europe; they represent at one and the same time a test and a step that could serve as an example. It is a test, for we -cannot visualize any serious effort in the matter of detente without a concomitant concern with regard to reducing the weapons for waging war or intensifying threats or tensions.\n450.\tThis concern for some tangible and voluntary manifestation of detente should be seen in the light of our concern for the further development of human relations and contacts. In point of fact, such relations and contacts have so far been limited to a strict minimum, that is, to only those absolutely necessary among the leaders and officials of the countries concerned. The negotiations on a mutually balanced reduction of forces are also a step that could serve\nas an example because, in the view of the Belgian Government, they could be the prelude to a general reduction of armaments throughout the world. Belgium was gratified, moreover, at the progress achieved in the contacts of the SALT negotiations. This is reassuring with regard to the commitments undertaken by the nuclear Powers on the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. My country also welcomed the agreements concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union in their search for an adjustment in their bilateral relations and in their desire to reduce the risk of nuclear confrontation between the two Powers.\n451.\tFurthermore, we have noted with satisfaction the fact that the dialogue between the United States and the People's Republic of China is proceeding in furtherance of greater stability in Asia. My Government is gratified by the progressive normalization of relations between those two great countries.\n452.\tMay I be allowed to thank the Secretary-General of our Organization for his first report on the studies conducted by the peace-research institutions [A/9130 and Add.l]. My country initiated this action because, in our opinion, fundamental research into the bases and the conditions of peace, into the sources, motivations and development of conflicts, can make a great contribution to the mission of peace of our Organization. The listing of the work already achieved is far from complete, considering that a great number of research centres have not yet responded to the action taken by the Secretary-General.\n453.\tFurthermore, my delegation has had the opportunity on several occasions to describe the scope of our proposal, which goes much further than a simple compilation of peace-research efforts. We therefore believe that the undertaking must continue and we hope that the report which the Secretary-General will submit at the next session of the General Assembly will be more comprehensive.\n454.\tIt seems to me, moreover, that the basic research will be useful not only in connexion with the problems of war and peace in the conventional meaning of those terms. In the context of our relations in times of peace, the' research could also make an essential contribution to the thinking of statesmen and to informing public opinion. What is more, this has already been done. I have in mind, inter alia, the line of thinking to which the work performed at the instigation of the Club of Rome has given rise, as well as the studies conducted by UNCTAD or in connexion with its activities.\n455.\tThe development of international economic relations over recent years shows that the concept of collective economic security could usefully be studied in greater depth both at the research level and concurrently, preferably, within the framework of the specialized agencies. Whether we are concerned with the monetary crisis, with the preparation of tariff negotiations, with the problems resulting from the existence of multinational companies, with energy requirements, or with the limits to the resources of our planet, our universal interdependence and, consequently, the usefulness of thinking seriously about the conditions for economic security, become more and more apparent.\n456.\tIt has often seemed that men discover wisdom only when compelled to do so by the force of events. It is quite possible that we may be at one of these junctures in history.\n457.\tWith increasing sharpness, the United Nations is questioning the directions being taken by the international community in the fields of economic and social development. This critical analysis is being conducted both in the light of the traditional basic tenets of the growth concept and in the light of concerns that have become more imperative, such as the population explosion and the preservation of the human environment.\n458.\tThis critical rethinking is also proceeding with a view to improving the management of the international Organization and enhancing its effectiveness. On this subject, the efforts being made to formulate working programmes and medium-term plans for the Organization and its related institutions \u2014 a matter closely linked to an improvement in budget forecasts \u2014 are gratifying.\n459.\tThe multiplicity of the problems mentioned and the complexity of the programmes undertaken make the necessity for consolidation more and more pressing, at both the conceptual and the operational level.\n460.\tWithout any doubt, it is for the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly to effect such consolidation and to become the rallying-point for thinking on the matter.\n461.\tThe adoption by the Assembly in 1970 of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] provided a framework for working out the necessary consolidation. The Organization has indeed addressed itself, during the current decade, to a review and evaluation on a continuing basis of the progress achieved in implementing the Development Strategy with respect to both the developing and the industrialized countries. It is clear that by systematizing the study of development problems the Strategy will make it possible to mark the road already covered, to measure the laps that have been completed, to review the priorities set, and to lay down new guidelines.\n462.\tAs far as Belgium is concerned, co-operation with the developing countries is based on the same principles as those underlying our efforts to promote detente and cooperation in Europe. In both cases, the aim is to forge friendly links among all nations and to achieve international co-operation through the solution of international problems by promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all, as provided in Article 1 of the Charter.\n463.\tMy country is fully aware of the particular duties incumbent upon it in this matter. Economic integration, of which it is a beneficiary within the framework of the European Economic Community, is not an end in itself. The nine countries have now set up a specific framework for establishing their trade relations and their economic cooperation with the African countries and Madagascar. Important negotiations were recently begun for the purpose of extending these links to other countries and gearing them to the new requirements of development.\n39\n464.\tBut over and above this regional approach, the disadvantages of which should be greatly reduced following the enlargement of the Community, the Europe of the nine has set itself the goal of co-operating with the developing countries on an increasingly world-wide scale. The system of generalized preferences is the start of this trend in the direction of a more general approach.\n465.\tThe promotion of commodity agreements is also' part of this approach. As is common knowledge, the purpose of these agreements is to help to stabilize the prices of commodities and to intensify the trade of the developing countries, and this intensification should also facilitate the future multilateral trade negotiations carried out within GATT.\n466.\tSimilarly, the monetary negotiations should take into account the interests of the developing countries and the increase in the resources which may be transferred to them.\n467.\tThe recent occurrence of a tragic situation has drawn the world's attention to one particular aspect of the idea of collective economic security. I am referring here to the surge of the drought which has stricken the populations of Sahelian region in central Africa.\n468.\tLike so many other Governments, the Belgian Government has tried to express the feeling of solidarity which has emerged spontaneously among our populations in a tangible and effective form. To the extent that our means allow, we hope that we have helped to meet the needs which were, and still are, enormous. Our aid was provided bilaterally as well as through the co-ordinating machinery set up by FAO.\n469.\tThe work done by the latter organization deserves our praise. In reading the reports of the teams we have sent into the field, I am, however, struck by the amount of improvisation which was inevitable at the initial stage of relief co-ordination. I fear that the effectiveness of the voluntary action must have suffered as a consequence.\n470.\tIn order to improve the utilization of our aid capability, action on two levels might be considered.\n471.\tThe proposal submitted by the Secretary of State of the United States for the organization of a world food conference in 1974 seems to me to meet a fundamental medium-term need. However, I think it would be advisable also to consider the usefulness of setting up permanent emergency machinery for food aid problems as a whole.\n472.\tThe field of action of this machinery would be twofold. It would be both a centre of information and study and an emergency relief agency for critical food situations. I think that such an arrangement could be developed from what is already operating within the framework of FAO.\n473.\tI wish to limit my statement to the crisis in the Middle East and to the two major matters of constant concern to all countries: political and military detente and co-operation for development. In our opinion, the need for action in these three fields derives from the fundamental principles of\nthe Charter: justice and respect for the equality of rights of peoples and individuals. Unless there is respect for such rights our Organization cannot hope to fulfil the mission entrusted to it \u2014 that of being a centre for harmonizing the action of nations in the attainment of common ends."

        "file_text": "\ufeff90.\tThe positive progress being made in the international situation, which has been brought about by the continued implementation of the policy of peaceful coexistence, has been adequately reflected in the statements of almost all heads of delegations who have taken part in the general debate now coming to an end at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The peoples of the world, who welcome with relief the process of international detente, which has begun, have once again recently found themselves confronted with dangerous developments as a result of the expansionist policy of the ruling circles in Israel, who have unleashed military action against the Arab countries. Representatives who have spoken here have welcomed the relaxation of international tension and have severely condemned the brigandage and violence which the Israeli aggressors have raised to the level of State policy.\n91.\tThe debate has also shown that the ranks of those who favour peace and international security, freedom and independence for all peoples and economic progress and social justice have grown considerably. It is also obvious that the favourable development of international relations is ensured by the active and constructive policy of the Soviet Union and the other socialist States, and that the successful implementation of the programme of peace put forward by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would serve the interests of all peoples of the planet.\n92.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, which has played a part in the work of the United Nations since its establishment, notes with satisfaction that throughout the Organization's existence, and particularly during recent years, an ever-growing number of Member States have been displaying increasing interest in the most vital matters considered in the United Nations and have been giving constructive consideration to and showing active support for the proposals put forward by the socialist States. The time is past when the advocates of the \\\"cold war\\\" and the increase of international tension could block any proposal of ours for the simple reason that it was put forward by a socialist country.\n93.\tNo one \u2014 including those who speak from the forum of the United Nations \u2014 can doubt that the peace-loving, high-principled, class-based, internationalist, open and honest position of principle of the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community is in keeping with the interests and needs of all peoples, since it is aimed at strengthening peace and international security, consolidating alliances with peoples struggling for their national and social liberation, developing relations between States with different social systems on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, struggling decisively against aggression and ensuring that the favourable changes which have been achieved on the international scene become irreversible.\n94.\tWhat is important is that work on the fundamental reconstruction of relations between countries and between peoples in the interest of peace and co-operation is being conducted on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, by leaders of States in summit meetings and talks, both at the governmental and at the social level, involving the greatest variety of bodies and organizations and covering an ever-wider range of issues. All peace-loving forces throughout the world welcomed with ardent approval the visits of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade L. I. Brezhnev, to the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany and France, the fruitful results of his talks with the leaders of those countries and the agreements which were concluded. That has been confirmed by many Ministers for Foreign Affairs who have spoken here, and who have stressed the great international importance of the results achieved through such summit meetings.\n95.\tThe anti-imperialist programme of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in September 1973, which speaks of the necessity for a resolute struggle for freedom, independence and peace, and condemns imperialism, colonialism and racism, merits approval and support. We are convinced that the forthcoming World Congress of Peace Forces, to be held in Moscow, will also make a worthy contribution to peace and security on earth.\n96.\tAs is well known, the second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has recently begun. Talks between the USSR and the United States of America on strategic arms limitation have been resumed, and very important bilateral meetings are being conducted, or are pending. Talks on reductions in military forces and armaments in the Central European region will soon be continued. Consequently, opportunities for new steps toward further detente and the expansion of many forms of co-operation between States are more than adequate. The goodwill not only of the socialist States, but also of each participant in these vital meetings and talks, is needed in order to achieve success.\n97.\tConsiderable opportunities are also opening up for the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is essential that the constructive spirit of the general debate should be, maintained during consideration of specific items on the agenda; that will enable the General Assembly to make its own weighty contribution to the further relaxation of international tension. At the same time, it is essential to ensure constant vigilance and to rebuff resolutely any intrigues begun by forces which, openly or covertly, oppose a relaxation of tension in the world, advocate the stockpiling of weapons, sow distrust and enmity among peoples and impede the strengthening of peace and international security. Statements of individual speakers \u2014 fortunately only a small number \u2014 in the general debate have shown that there are still some who, while camouflaging what they say with words of peace, in fact hold positions which conflict with the interests of peace and co-operation. Such positions, even if stated or acted on by only a few, cannot go unnoticed. Through the joint efforts of each and every peace- loving State we can make those who oppose the relaxation of international tension submit to the will of peoples yearning for peace, justice and progress.\n98.\tI should like to dwell further on a few of today's most vital international problems.\n99.\tTwice within the lifetime of a single generation Europe has been the seat and the scene of world wars, which has brought the people of the Byelorussian SSR inexpressible grief and huge losses of life and has both times, as a result of total devastation, almost completely destroyed the economy. Consequently, it was with particular satisfaction that the working people of the Byelorussian SSR welcomed the recent favourable developments in Europe promoting the strengthening of peace and security.\n100.\tThe principles of the non-use of force and the inviolability of frontiers in Europe have been given legal status in treaties concluded by the USSR, the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany; a four-Power agreement has been concluded on West Berlin; the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed that the Munich diktat is null and void; and the first stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has been successfully completed. All these constitute a convincing victory for reason and realism and the success of the policy of peaceful coexistence. We want the European Conference to be a complete success and we hope that its work will be accomplished in the shortest possible time, without any delays or procrastination, and that Europe will become a continent of lasting peace and fruitful co-operation among States. There are many possibilities for achieving those ends. They are clearly and precisely set out in the draft general declaration of the foundations of European security and the principles guiding relations between States in Europe, which is being considered on the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and also in other proposals made by the socialist countries and relating to items on the Conference's agenda.\n101.\tWe again welcome the admission into the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and we note with satisfaction the final and irrevocable recognition and consolidation of the international status of the German Democratic Republic as an independent sovereign socialist State.\n102.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has always favoured the extension of detente to the whole world, to each region in it. During the current session of the General Assembly, speakers have noted with satisfaction the end of the war in Viet-Nam and Laos and the cessation of the bombing in Cambodia. We should at the same time firmly condemn the Saigon administration's violation of the Paris agreements ending the war and re-establishing peace in Viet-Nam, demand that they be strictly observed, and urge the full implementation of the agreements reached in Laos as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of all the peoples of Indo-China. In addition, we regard as totally unjustified the delay in the settlement of the problem of granting observer status in the United Nations to the representatives of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.\n103.\tThe victory of the Viet-Namese people, the current reduction of tension in southern Asia, the active struggle for the restoration of peace throughout Indo-China and the growing support for the just demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign forces from South Korea and the final dissolution of the bankrupt so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea are gratifying events in the continent of Asia. Now one of the primary tasks before us is the strengthening of collective security in Asia. In our view, all Asian countries without exception should join in this work and should ensure the triumph of such principles of mutual relations as the non-use of force or the threat of its use, respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the development of all-round co-operation on a basis of mutual respect and equality among peoples. One can only deplore the fact that some in Asia, following a policy of frantic anti-Sovietism and opposition to detente, do not desire the implementation of those principles, and will not face the fact that they are specifically set out in the United Nations Charter, the decisions of the African-Asian Conference, held at Bandung in April 1955, and other widely recognized international documents.\n104.\tBecause of the absence of a political settlement in the Middle East, the Israeli militarists have been able to fan the smouldering fires of military conflict in that area and, pursuing their expansionist policy, have unleashed military action against Egypt and Syria. Israel and those external reactionary circles which have constantly connived at its aggressive tendencies bear full responsibility for developments in the Middle East. In present conditions, unity of action and solidarity among all peace-loving countries are essential in order to ensure the restoration of the lawful rights of the Arab peoples. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, guided by the interests of peace, is ready to support the most resolute measures taken by the United Nations in order to ensure the full implementation of Security Council and General Assembly decisions relating to the Middle East, in other words, to bring about the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories and to secure respect for the independence and inalienable rights of the States and peoples in that region, including the Arab people of Palestine.\n105.\tA significant contribution towards intensifying the process of detente can be made within the United Nations if consistent and multilevel efforts are undertaken and if each Member of the United Nations displays readiness to cooperate in a constructive manner, and not to adopt the attitude of a dissatisfied critic or passively wait for others to act. These efforts must be specific and consistent, and must help to ensure that the agreements which have been reached are observed, that problems which are being considered are settled, that existing obstacles are overcome and that new initiatives are put forward which are in keeping with the interests of all peoples and with the United Nations Charter. The aim of consolidating successes already achieved and multiplying them in number requires resolute efforts on the part of all peace-loving forces. We must not lose sight of our ultimate objectives, but must strive towards them \u2014 and must always move forward, exploiting any opportunity, however small, to take specific measures which would\n\ngenuinely ensure a lasting peace. We know that such opportunities are available to us.\n106.\tIt is quite clear that the agreement concluded on 22 June 1973 between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, aimed at preventing the outbreak of nuclear war between them and ensuring that they do all within their power to prevent any chance of such a war breaking out, is of enormous importance for the peace, of all mankind. Both sides have assumed a specific obligation to refrain from the threat or the use of force against each other, their allies or other countries in circumstances that might endanger international peace and security. It is vital, in order to ensure universal security and an enduring peace on earth, that other States should accept the principles which have been established jointly by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, namely, the non-use of force and the adoption of resolute measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. That could be done in various ways. The process would be encouraged by the earliest possible adoption by the Security Council of appropriate measures to ensure the full implementation of the resolution adopted last year by the General Assembly [resolution 2936 (XXVII)], which on behalf of States Members of the United Nations, solemnly declared their renunciation of the use or threat of force in all its forms and manifestations in international relations, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.\n107.\tIn the matter of disarmament, States have before them a broad field of action. An overwhelming majority of countries approves the agreements reached by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on defensive and offensive strategic arms, and also the readiness displayed not only to limit offensive strategic weapons quantitatively and qualitatively, but also to adopt measures for the progressive reduction of such weapons. Some action has also been taken in the United Nations to limit and reverse the arms race. Nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water have been prohibited, well- known treaties concerning the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the prohibition of the emplacement of such weapons on the sea bed and the ocean floor and in outer space are being implemented, and a convention governing the removal of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons from military arsenals has been approved [see resolution 2826 (XXVI)]. But these are merely first steps toward the ideal of general complete disarmament, which has been approved by the United Nations.\n108.\tUnfortunately, in recent years, the number of States becoming parties to the already existing agreements has been increasing at a slower rate, and one of those agreements is being openly violated by certain nuclear Powers. During the past year, the question of the prohibition of all nuclear tests by all States everywhere has remained at a standstill, and no progress has been achieved in the elimination of chemical weapons and the implementation of many other proposals submitted for consideration within the United Nations. Unfortunately, the General Assembly's decision concerning the convening of the World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII)] has also reached an impasse because of the positions of two major Powers. Such circumstances require redoubled efforts on the part of all States to settle disarmament problems. It is essential to ensure that those who oppose disarmament and the convening of a World Disarmament Conference should cease to ignore the will of an overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations and all peoples of the world on these matters. The time has clearly come for States Members of this Organization to adopt a position on disarmament problems which would make possible active progress towards their practical solution.\n109.\t'\tConsiderable opportunities in that field are opened up by the item \\\"Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries\\\", which has been included in the agenda on the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics [item 102]. The aims of this proposal, which combines measures of political and military detente with opportunities to increase many times the funds available for international assistance to the developing countries, not only are desirable, but are feasible in today's circumstances. The proposal does not prejudice the principle of equal security of States, and will benefit both the peoples of the countries putting into effect the proposed reduction in their military budgets and the peoples of the developing countries who are struggling for economic and social progress.\n110.\tThe Soviet proposal fully takes into account the desires of the developing countries, since its implementation would enable them, in an atmosphere of detente and greater security, to intensify their efforts to accelerate economic and social progress on a basis of radical social and economic transformations, full utilization of domestic resources and expansion of international assistance. It is no accident that this proposal has been welcomed by the overwhelming majority of such countries. However, we should ignore the wiles of those who invent artificial and unfounded arguments against this proposal, the more so as their so-called arguments do not hold water and merely show that there are still forces in the world interested in prolonging the arms race. One speaker here has openly called for an increase in the military expenditure of the United States, the countries of Western Europe and the developing States. It is also said that the trustworthiness of published data on the military expenditure of each State should be checked. This is nothing but an attempt to replace the question of reduction of military budgets by the question of control by the opponents of this proposal over all the economic and financial, activities of States. But we know full well that, even if this extreme curiosity \u2014 which is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of the States \u2014 were to be satisfied, the opponents of disarmament would always find new, equally contrived \\\"arguments\\\" to avoid accepting the proposal submitted by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and supported by many other States. We have already heard one of these arguments. One speaker alleged that his country was already granting greater assistance to the developing countries than that provided for in the proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Statistics and United Nations studies refute that allegation. Moreover, that speaker does not take into account the well-known fact that not only his country's annual military expenditure, but its entire budget over many years, would be insufficient to compensate the developing countries for the funds of which their economies have been plundered and continue to be plundered by violent means or by means of the so-called unbalanced exchange, to say the least.\n111.\tIf the United Nations wishes to make progress in the sphere of disarmament, it should also completely reject the untenable assertion that the question of the reduction of military budgets should not be discussed in the General Assembly because the proposals on this question were not approved by the Assembly during the years of the \\\"cold war\\\", when the voting machinery was in the hands of the opponents of disarmament. If we follow this line of reasoning, it means that we should not have worked for the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, or for the issue of the invitation to representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the consideration of questions relating to Korea, or that we should give up the struggle for peace, for decolonization and against racism, for the sole reason that, in the past, the proposals on these questions were rejected in the United Nations \u2014 and we know by whom. But these are different times, and there are many new possibilities for overcoming problems which were previously blocked. The United Nations must take advantage of these new conditions, in which peace-loving forces have serried their ranks and international tension is easing, and give additional impetus to the realization of the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n112.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR will actively strive for an effective solution of all the principal problems on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. A number of them have already been referred to. We will also do our utmost to ensure the implementation by all States of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], and to press for the completion and the approval of a draft treaty concerning the moon and the international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [A/8771, annex].\n113.\tAs in all previous years, my delegation will be in the ranks of those who are consistent supporters of the active struggle for the complete elimination of colonialism and the securing of freedom for peoples which are under Portuguese colonial domination or which are kept in slavery by the racist regimes in southern Africa. We shall resolutely support the efforts of the United Nations to put an end to the pernicious activities of international monopolies in dependent Territories, and we shall urge that the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations should fully promote the process of decolonization in their activities. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR welcomes the proclamation of a new independent State, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, on land won from the Portuguese colonialists, and wishes the people of that country success in building a new life in conditions of freedom, independence and the complete liberation of their homeland from the colonial yoke. We wish success to all colonial peoples in their just struggle for freedom and independence.\n114.\tMy delegation will fully support United Nations efforts to eliminate apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination, or any other infringement of basic human rights. At the same time we shall press for the approval of the draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, the implementation by all countries of existing international legal instruments concerning the struggle against racism and the safeguarding of human rights, and also the adoption of the draft principles of international co-operation in the detection, arrest, extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity [A/9326].\n115.\tAt the present session of the General Assembly many delegations have referred to the question of the observance of human rights. Most of those who have spoken have quite rightly demanded the elimination of apartheid and racism and the cessation of violations of human rights by aggressors and colonialists. Unfortunately, individual representatives are attempting to use United Nations efforts to ensure the observance of human rights in order to interfere in the internal affairs of other States. They are ready to protect the \\\"rights\\\" only of individuals who, by their irresponsible utterances or actions, are rendering a service to the forces of imperialism and reaction and slandering the socialist States or attempting to defect to the camp of the aggressors. At the same time, these so-called protectors of human rights close their eyes to the mass crimes of racists, colonialists and reactionaries, not only in violating human rights but also in physically destroying innocent persons because of their democratic convictions. They do not say a word in support of the rights of democrats in Chile and their patriotic efforts to carry out socio-economic transformations in the interests of the working people of that country. They waste no time in recognizing the military dictators' regime in that country, though elsewhere throughout the world, including the Byelorussian SSR, the people have unanimously condemned the actions of the military junta in Chile, which killed the President of the country, Salvador Allende, dissolved the National Congress and local organs of power, trampled on the rights of workers and banned trade unions, abrogated constitutional guarantees for the elementary democratic rights of Chilean citizens and is now pursuing a bloody reign of terror against the progressive forces in the country and the entire Chilean people. The self-styled defenders of human rights remain silent on these events. Many of them remain silent too when the question of the struggle against apartheid and racism and the fight for the rights of Africans is discussed, or the violations of human rights in their own countries. As a rule, these speakers represent countries which are not parties to the conventions, treaties and covenants aimed at combating racism and ensuring the observance of human rights which have been prepared in the United Nations.\n116.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR is proud of the fact that, in our Republic and throughout the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, there are genuine guarantees for an immeasurably wider range of human rights than those provided for in international legal instruments approved by the United Nations. We are party to all the most important international agreements on human rights and conscientiously observe them. This year the Byelorussian SSR ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ibid], and it calls upon all countries to adhere to these documents,\nand to join in the genuine struggle for the safeguarding of human rights and freedoms everywhere and for the elimination of flagrant and mass violations of such rights.\n117.\tThe views of the socialist States, including the Byelorussian SSR, on questions of equitable economic,   commercial, scientific and technological co-operation in the interests of all peoples, with due regard for the needs and demands of the developing countries, are well known. They are actively put into practice in the United Nations and in other international bodies concerned with such problems. We do our best to prevent and overcome the pernicious effects of the activities of the neo-colonialists and international monopolies on the economies of developing countries, and also to protect the interests of the developing countries and to ensure that they can overcome the obstacles to their economic and social progress created as a result of long domination by the colonialists and of the policy they still pursue of plundering the peoples of the developing countries or of infringing their legitimate rights in international economic relations. We provide considerable assistance to those countries, partly through our participation in United Nations international assistance programmes.\n118.\tMay I dwell briefly on one more question \u2014 the need for strict compliance by all, without exception, with the United Nations Charter. Present conditions of detente and the consolidation of all anti-imperialist forces provide a genuine opportunity, greater than ever before, for the full utilization and implementation of all provisions of the Charter in order to ensure that the activities of United Nations bodies are carried out exclusively in order to achieve the purposes and principles of the Organization, the most important of which is the strengthening of universal peace. Today, more than ever before, any attempt to undermine the United Nations Charter, and thereby the Organization itself, is absolutely unacceptable. Those who favour a revision of the Charter obviously hope that, by endless arguments about the merits and shortcomings of the Charter and about what should be done in the future, they will be able to avoid the need to comply with the Charter or to justify their previous activities, which have been contrary to the Charter. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR appeals to all participants in the General Assembly to reject any direct or indirect proposals allegedly intended to make the United Nations more effective, but in fact aimed at revising, violating or not complying strictly with the Charter. We still have considerable work to do to ensure that the United Nations Charter is complied with by all, everywhere, in every sphere of international life and human activity, so that the peoples of the world are satisfied with its activities and the results it achieves.\n119.\tThe Byelorussian SSR has always attached great importance to the United Nations and, through 28 years' participation in its work, guided by its Leninist peace-loving foreign policy, has done its best to achieve the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has always striven to ensure that the United Nations should be an important and effective instrument in maintaining peace and reducing international tension, and that it should be used in the interests of comprehensive and equitable co-operation among States. We have pursued and are pursuing this policy, both during\nGeneral Assembly sessions and in all bodies in the United Nations and its specialized agencies of which we are members. We shall continue to do so in the future everywhere \u2014 both in the principal organs of the United Nations and in its subsidiary bodies; at major international conferences and in small meetings; in the formal consideration and settlement of questions and in the course of consultations with all those who are concerned for peace and progress on earth.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff \n\n Mr. President, allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, to congratulate Mr. Benites sincerely once again on his election to the high post of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to wish him success in the discharge of his responsible duties. I should also like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to his predecessor, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Polish People's Republic, Comrade Trepczynski, whose outstanding competence and personal qualities helped significantly to bring the work of the last session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\n2.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly, substantial changes have taken place in the world. We are moving towards a further development of the process of detente and a fundamental restructuring of international relations as a whole. As a result of these favourable changes, a new situation is developing in the world-a shift from confrontation and the \\\"cold war\\\" to peace, international co-operation, and the creation of a firm basis for peaceful co-existence. The basis for the far-reaching transformations now taking place is to be found in a general change in power relationships in favour of peace and social progress.\n3.\tGenuine successes in the relaxation of international tension have become possible mainly because of the active and enterprising efforts of the socialist countries, which are fighting a consistent and insistent battle to strengthen peace and universal security. The efforts of all peace-loving and progressive forces and a realistic approach by other States to a solution of urgent problems are helping to improve the international situation.\n\n\n\n4.\tThe beginning of the work of the current session of the General Assembly was marked by an important event, which also reflects the positive shifts taking place in the world. It may be said that the admission of the two sovereign German States  \u2014  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  \u2014  to the United Nations is a landmark in the history of our Organization. The membership of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the United Nations is also the result and the confirmation of the accelerating process of detente in Europe, where a clear trend has emerged towards the creation of a durable and lasting basis for peace and security and towards the development of co-operation between the States of the continent on a basis of equality and mutual benefit.\n5.\tIn the last two years, definite progress has been made, on the initiative of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, towards overcoming the consequences of the Second World War and towards the final legal establishment of the inviolability of post-war frontiers. Practical steps have also been taken to reduce the risk of armed conflicts and to reinforce the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between the States of Europe. A clear tendency to extend political detente to the military arena has become apparent, and this would presuppose a reduction of armed forces and armaments.\n6.\tThe successful conclusion of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is an important step on the road to building a reliable system of collective security in Europe. The new historic situation that is now emerging on the European continent is meeting with the approval of all States interested in the development of an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness and cooperation. The favourable turn of events on the European continent raises hopes of creating a firm basis for peace and security not only in Europe, but throughout the world.\n7.\tThe improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America is assisting the process of detente and the stabilization of the international situation. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the recent Soviet-American negotiations.\n8.\tThe importance of the development of Soviet-American relations transcends the framework of bilateral relations, since that development influences to a large extent the improvement of the whole international situation, which is in the interests of all States without exception, whether large or small, for progress and prosperity for every State are possible only in conditions of peace and security.\n9.\tThe changes now taking place in the world are creating favourable conditions preventing nuclear war and armed \nconflicts, for eliminating the last centres of tension, and for developing mutually advantageous co-operation between States.\n10.\tThe principal trend in the current development of international relations is towards the universal recognition and practical application of the principles of peaceful coexistence as the legal basis for relations between States with different social systems. Peaceful coexistence means not only the readiness of States with different systems to live in peace; it also implies a desire to develop economic, scientific, technological and cultural co-operation and mutually advantageous ties, and to settle controversial issues by negotiation.\n\n11.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic is constantly guided in its foreign policy activities by the principle of peaceful coexistence and will continue to develop and expand its ties and co-operation with other States in the world on that basis.\n12.\tLike the other socialist countries, the Mongolian People's Republic is interested in seeing detente become global and all-embracing in nature. We consider that the general improvement in the international atmosphere is opening up good prospects of spreading the process* of detente to the continent of Asia as well, in order that the peoples of Asia may live by the laws of peace.\n13.\tOur delegation would like to point out in this connexion that noticeable changes for the better have recently been taking place on the continent of Asia.\n14.\tThe long heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people against imperialist aggression has ended victoriously. The ending of the war in Viet-Nam, which was one of the longest and cruellest wars of our time, has removed the most dangerous centre of tension not only in Asia, but in the whole world.\n15.\tThe victory of the Viet-Namese people, who relied on assistance and support from the socialist countries and all revolutionary and progressive forces, demonstrated to the whole world that you cannot defeat a nation fighting a just war for freedom and independence, in defence of its legitimate rights.\n16.\tThe Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam, which establishes the right of the Viet-Namese people to decide their own destiny, has created the necessary pre-conditions for solving the Indo-Chinese problem and for strengthening peace and security on the Asian continent.\n17.\tNevertheless, although an agreement was reached on ending the war in Viet-Nam, its strict observance is encountering opposition from reactionary forces. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the obstructionist acts of the Saigon administration and its patrons, acts which hinder the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam. It is only on the basis of strict observance by both sides of all the articles and provisions of the Paris Agreement that peace and tranquillity can be finally established on Viet-Namese soil.\n18.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the patriotic forces of Laos and Cambodia for the realization of the national aspirations of the peoples of their countries. The signing on 21 February 1973 of the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos opens the way to a settlement of problems in that part of Indo-China.\n19.\tNew and positive circumstances have arisen in the development of the situation in the Korean peninsula. Thanks to the initiative and constructive proposal by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a dialogue has begun between the two parts of Korea to find ways to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea.\n20.\tThe attitude of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic to the Korean problem remains unchanged: the Korean people must decide its own destiny without external interference. The immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea are still the essential condition for the peaceful unification of Korea.\n21.\tWe note with satisfaction the opening of the Office of the Permanent Observer of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations. Participation by representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion of the Korean problem will undoubtedly contribute to an objective consideration of the question at this session of the General Assembly.\n22.\tWe welcome the progress that has been made in alleviating and normalizing the situation on the Indian subcontinent. A final normalization of the situation in that region would contribute substantially to the improvement of the political climate in Asia. Lastly, the indisputable fact of the existence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, which has now been recognized by over 100 States of the world, must be acknowledged.\n23.\tIn this connexion, we must point out the abnormality of the situation in which this young and independent State, despite its right to be a Member of the United Nations, still remains outside the Organization. Our delegation expresses the hope that the current session of the General Assembly will put an end to this very obvious injustice to the People's Republic of Bangladesh and that Bangladesh will take its place in the ranks of the Members of the United Nations.\n24.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic has been following events in the Middle East with deep disquiet. The crisis situation caused by the aggressive acts and annexionist intrigues of the ruling circles of Israel, who enjoy the support and encouragement of international Zionism and imperialism, continues to be one of the most dangerous centres of international tension and a real threat to universal peace and security. Such a situation is particularly intolerable in the present conditions of a general improvement in the international situation.\n25.\tResponsibility for the situation that has arisen lies entirely with the ruling circles of Israel and their imperialist accomplices. How much longer will the Israeli extremist^ spurn the efforts of peace-loving forces to bring about settlement of the Middle East conflict, and how much longer will they continue openly to ignore Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\n26.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the solution of the Middle East problem must be based on the familiar Security Council resolution 242(1967) of 22 November 1967 and that the first essential condition for the application of its provisions is the immediate and complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories. The General Assembly must use its authority and influence to overcome the resistance of the Israeli expansionists and their patrons to the elimination of the centre of conflict in the Middle East.\n27.\tlike the peoples of the other continents, the peoples of Asia are vitally interested in ensuring lasting peace and in the creation of more favourable conditions for the solution of the social and economic problems facing them.\n28.\tNow that the aim of ending the war in Viet-Nam has been achieved, the peoples and Governments of many Asian States are trying to evolve forms of co-operation and a structure that would guarantee peace and security on the continent. In many countries the public is becoming increasingly conscious of the fact that the real path to ensuring lasting peace in Asia lies in the creation of a system of collective security.\n29.\tSuch a system can provide the peoples of Asia with the conditions for peaceful development. It must not be directed against any other States, and all the Asian countries without exception must participate in it on an equal footing.\n30.\tA system of collective security in Asia could be based on such principles as renunciation of the use of force in relations between States, respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers, inadmissibility of the seizure of foreign territories, non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and peoples, and. broad development of cooperation on a basis of equal rights and mutual advantage.\n31.\tThe practical realization of the idea of a system of security on the Asian continent would, of course, require a great deal of effort, but it is a realistic cause. We recognize that the increasing opportunities on the road to this important goal are accompanied by certain difficulties. These difficulties are due primarily to the policy of the imperialist and hegemonistic forces which are trying to hold back the process of detente and maintain tension on the Asian continent. Concerted action by the Asian States and all peace-loving forces are therefore required in the interests of ensuring security in Asia.\n32.\tAt its twenty-seventh session, the General Assembly solemnly reaffirmed [resolution 2993 (XXVII)] the principles and provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2134 (XXV)) and urgently appealed to all States to implement those provisions consistently and fully. The principles proclaimed in that Declaration reflect, and are the concrete expression of, the principal and most pressing demand of our times  \u2014  the exclusion of war as an instrument of national policy and as a means of resolving disputes between States.\n33.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic attaches great significance to a most important provision of the United Nations Charter: the provision concerning the non-use of force in relations between States. The principle of the renunciation of the use of force, which is one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, is being increasingly put into practice in relations between States. As you know, resolution 2936 (XXVII) providing for the non-use of force in international relations as an inseparable concomitant of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons was adopted at the last session of the General Assembly on a proposal by the Soviet Union. Strict observance of this principle by States Members of the United Nations and the establishment of its binding nature by the elaboration of special measures decided on by the Security Council will have an exceptionally beneficial effect on the whole development of international relations.\n34.\tThe policy of colonial domination and racial discrimination is still one of the fundamental obstacles on the road to strengthening peace and security.\n35.\tIn order to maintain its influence in Africa and in other areas, imperialism is trying to use the racist and colonialist regimes there to fight the growing national liberation movements of the peoples of the colonial and dependent countries.\n36.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic consistently advocates the final elimination of colonialism, and the immediate granting of independence to countries and Territories which are still under colonial domination. The speedy elimination of racism and racial discrimination in all their forms and manifestations, including the monstrous system of apartheid, is a pressing need of our time.\n37.\tWe are convinced that the just cause of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and of the other peoples under the yoke of the colonialists and racists, will triumph with the growing support of all progressive forces in the world.\n38.\tExperience shows that a rallying and a unity of action by all those fighting for freedom and independence, for peace and social progress, is essential for a successful fight against imperialism and colonialism. Hence the significance of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in September 1973 in Algiers, which expressed the determination of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America to redouble the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle.\n39.\tIt should be noted that the forces of reaction do not hesitate to prevent the introduction of democratic, social and economic changes in various countries, or to divert peoples from their chosen path of progressive development. This is evident from the military putsch in Chile, which was carried out with the support of foreign imperialist forces. The Mongolian people resolutely condemn the overthrow of the legitimate Government of Popular Unity elected as a\nresult of the free expression of the will of the Chilean people, the treacherous murder of an outstanding statesman and politician, President Salvador Allende, and the bloody reprisals against the progressive forces of the country. We express our heartfelt solidarity with the working people of Chile and demand an immediate end to the terror and repression against the progressive forces in the country, and respect for the will and aspirations of the Chilean people.\n40.\tThe general improvement in the international political climate is creating favourable conditions for the elaboration and practical implementation of measures to limit the arms race. The conclusion on 22 June 1973 by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War was an extremely important step towards saving humanity from the horrors of thermonuclear war. It is making it easier to reach an understanding on further measures to limit the arms race.\n41.\tThe strategic arms limitation talks now taking place between the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the negotiations that have begun in Vienna on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe are no less important.\n42.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic still considers that the convening of a World Disarmament Conference is an urgent necessity and one that requires the active and constructive participation of all States, and the five nuclear Powers especially, in solving this key problem of our times. The Mongolian People's Republic, as a member of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, considers that urgent measures must be taken to ensure the normal functioning of that Committee so that it can start work immediately on practical preparations for holding a world disarmament conference.\n43.\tFor the past two years, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva has been discussing, along with other issues related to disarmament, the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Nevertheless, a generally acceptable solution to this problem has not yet been found. It would require from States Members of the United Nations new and serious efforts to reach agreement on the banning of chemical weapons.\n44.\tAt the 2126th meeting of the General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. A. A. Gromyko, submitted on behalf of the Soviet Government a proposal to consider at the current session an item on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries..\n45.\tOur delegation considers this to be a timely and constructive proposal. The translation of this new and important initiative into reality would be a practical step towards solving the problem of disarmament; it would enable additional resources to be allocated for constructive\n\npurposes; and it would permit the acceleration of economic progress in the developing countries.\n46.\tWhile welcoming the readiness of the Soviet Union to reduce its military expenditure, we are entitled to expect that the other permanent members of the Security Council will do likewise  \u2014  this is essential for the implementation of the proposal.\n47.\tA reduction in military expenditure by the nuclear Powers would be a convincing example to other countries with large economic and military potential, and would promote the further strengthening of mutual trust and co-operation between States in the interests of peace.\n48.\tThat is why we consider it appropriate to examine the Soviet proposal, which is in the interest of all peoples of the world, at the current session.\n49.\tIn connexion with the problem of disarmament, we should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the need for an immediate cessation of all forms of nuclear testing, and above all nuclear testing in the atmosphere. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water,  which was signed 10 years ago, was an important step on the road to saving humanity from the dangerous consequences of nuclear testing. But, despite the clearly expressed view of a broad stratum of world opinion, Asia and Oceania are still being used as proving grounds for atmospheric nuclear tests. These tests involve serious danger to human life and cause immense damage to the environment, particularly in those countries in the immediate vicinity of the areas in which the tests are conducted.\n50.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic adds its voice to those of the other nations that are demanding the cessation of nuclear tests in the atmosphere in order to bar the way to a nuclear arms race.\n51.\tIn our opinion, it is essential, in order to consolidate the present positive progress in the world, to spread the spirit of detente and realism to the area of international economic relations.\n52.\tWe appreciate the difficulties being encountered by the developing countries in their struggle for economic and social progress. As experience in many countries has shown, the acceleration of a country's economic development is fundamentally dependent on the mobilization of domestic resources and the introduction of far-reaching social and economic changes in the interest of society as a whole.\n53.\tAnother very important factor for the achievement of those aims is a general reform of the whole system of relations between the developing countries and the developed capitalist countries, a review of the current unjust international division of labour and the introduction of new just forms, standards and principles of co-operation.\n54.\tAt the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the socialist countries submitted an important document - a draft statement by the United Nations on promoting the development of co-operation in economic, trade, scientific and technological matters on the basis of equality.  The provisions of the draft statement reflect the objective demands of the development of modern international trade and economic relations based on the principles of equality and mutual advantage.\n55.\tWe hope that the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will reflect in its decisions the interests of the land-locked States. The existing international legal provisions establishing the rights of land-locked States must be further developed and reinforced.\n56.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the reinforcement of the United Nations as an important instrument of peace and as a centre for reconciling the positions of different States.\n57.\tWe note with satisfaction that some positive progress has been made in enhancing the prestige and authority of the United Nations and in ensuring its universality.\n58.\tOur delegation expresses the hope that this session of the United Nations General Assembly will make its contribution to accentuating the positive trends in the development of contemporary international relations, and reinforcing the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between States in the interests of peace and universal security."

        "file_text": "\ufeff243.\tMr. President, permit me to express to you on behalf of the delegation of Oman our whole-hearted satisfaction at your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its twenty- eighth session. Your many years of experience here among us at the United Nations, in the capacity of Permanent Representative of your noble country, will, I am confident, be much appreciated by my fellow representatives in the course of the coming session, and I take this opportunity to assure you of the full and utmost support and co-operation of my delegation in the execution of your duties.\n244.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to convey, on behalf of my delegation and my Government, our admiration of the exemplary and able manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski of the Polish People's Republic, guided the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n245.\tMy Government and delegation welcomes the new Members of the United Nations and their delegations to these halls. Their presence here among us constitutes one further step towards the achievement of universality in this noble Organization, and my delegation looks forward to co-operating with the representatives of those new Members. We also take this occasion to wish all success and happiness to the Government and people of the newly independent Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n246.\tLast year in his address to the General Assembly my Minister of State for Foreign Affairs expressed the hope of the Omani Government and delegation that the divided countries of this world would soon, after their success in reaching detente and mutually beneficial agreements, join us here as full Members of the United Nations. The applications and consequent admissions of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic so soon after expressing our hopes on this matter is therefore all the more welcome to us.\n247.\tNot all of the hopes and aspirations that my delegation and many other delegations expressed at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly have materialized as speedily and effectively as those in regard to those new Members-least of all in the Middle East. In fact the situation in that area, so critical to world peace and to the efficacy and credibility of this noble Organization, has only worsened in the course of the past year. Israeli intransigence has only further hardened this year, as it has every year since the 1967 Zionist aggression against three States Members of the United Nations. Israeli aggression and use of violence against Arab States in total defiance of our Charter, and of all international laws and standards of behaviour that are enjoined upon Members of this Organization, have in the course of the past year only e/.acerbated\nthe situation. The tactics of terror and intimidation that have been the mainstays of Zionist policy since the beginning of Zionist aggression against the territory and people of Palestine have in the course of the past year reached new and unprecedented levels of violence and bestiality.\n248.\tWe need only recall here the frequent incursions by the regular armed forces of Israel into the territory and air space of neighbouring Arab States, when they have threatened the lives of if not killed or maimed, innocent civilians and passengers of civil airlines. We need only recall the premeditated bestial assassinations of the leaders of the heroic Palestinian resistance movement, the downing of the Libyan civilian airliner killing and maiming over 100 innocent passengers, the piratical hijacking over Lebanese air space of a Lebanese civilian airliner jeopardizing the lives of over 80 passengers, and the recent aggression by the Zionist air force into the air space of the Syrian Arab Republic.\n249.\tThose and many other acts of aggression and State terrorism committed by Israel in the course of the past year have been widely condemned and censured by public opinion around the world as well as by the Security Council and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Furthermore, in the course of the past year many countries from Africa and elsewhere have shown their displeasure and condemnation of Israel's aggressive policies by cutting off all diplomatic and other relations with Israel, and an overwhelming majority of the States Members of this Organization have seen the need for more effective measures by the international community to ensure that Israel not only respects the numerous resolutions adopted by this body but also yields to an international consensus that is determined to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, based upon the principles of our Charter and the tenets of international law. My Government and delegation strongly believe that the time has come for such effective measures, for as the Middle East situation worsens year after year, and as Zionist aggression and terrorism\n\u201e continue to increase year by year, the further and wider will the ramifications and implications of the situation spread, and the greater will be the threat to the peace and security of the whole world.\n250.\tIn that context my delegation welcomed the recent initiative of our Secretary-General to achieve a breakthrough in the present deadlock in the Middle East crisis, and we wish him every success in following up that noble and worthwhile endeavour.\n251.\tI direct my appeal for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East especially to the super-Powers and the permanent members of the Security Council. Those Powers, because of their influence and their permanent seats in the Security Council, are particularly responsible for the peace and security of the world. They have a moral obligation in their policies to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, both within the United Nations and outside it. Too often in the past have those Powers been motivated in their policies towards that area by short-sighted considerations of strategic advantage; too often have the Powers been motivated in their policies towards that area by short-sighted considerations of their own domestic politics.\nBy so doing those Powers compromise the confidence that the peoples of smaller nations around the world place in the big Powers and shed doubts on the reliability, integrity and moral rectitude of the super-Powers.\n252.\tFor that reason we welcome any detente between the super-Powers, for it can be only through such detente and co-operation that the peace of the world can be ensured. The recent summit talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and other agreements achieved by those super-Powers are a source of genuine hope for peoples around the world, and we would all hope that as a result of this detente the super-Powers will be able to work co-operatively instead of competitively for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and in other troubled areas of the world.\n253.\tThe winding down of the war in Indo-China in the course of the past year has been a major achievement in our progress to peace. That achievement reflects the atmosphere of detente between the super-Powers, and it is the hope of my delegation that in the course of the coming year not only will all violence and hostilities in that troubled area cease but also the super-Powers will work within the United Nations and outside it to remove that part of the world from the arena of super-Power rivalry and to assist the peoples of Indo-China to embark once again on the course of progress and economic and social development.\n254.\tMy Government supports the just struggle of African peoples to achieve freedom and self-determination in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and elsewhere in Africa.\n255.\tThe policies of apartheid, racial discrimination and even deliberate massacres of indigenous peoples, as practised by the colonial regimes in Africa, constitute a flagrant violation of the spirit of our Charter and of numerous resolutions passed by the United Nations. The Government of Oman, which bans all commercial dealings with such regimes, believes that the continued existence of colonial racist regimes in this day and age poses a great threat to the international security that all countries, especially the developing countries of the world, need if they are to achieve social and economic progress.\n256.\tThis year my Government has continued to develop the domestic, regional and international framework for such security and stability, which is a vital prerequisite for all economic and social development not only in Oman but also in the entire region. My Government has also sought to work in co-operation with other countries in the region to establish the harmony, security and stability that we all need. In this context my Sovereign, His Majesty Sultan Qabus, has this year undertaken a series of highly successful State visits to various countries in the region to establish the framework for good neighbourly relations and regional co-operation.\n257.\tIn further pursuit of these international and regional policies my Government has this year become a member of the non-aligned group of nations. My country's adherence to that noble organization reflects not only my Government's commitment to its principles, ideals and objectives but also our deep faith in the actual and potential contributions that the organization can make to the cause of peace and progress for mankind, founded as it is upon the principles of co-operation and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States. Those principles, especially that of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other sovereign States, ensure for the organization of non-aligned States the promise of great success in the future in meeting its noble objectives, for it has been shown that it is lack of understanding and interference in the domestic affairs of other sovereign States that have in the past been the causes of war and instability. My Government is strongly committed to the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States, and by the same token has resisted and will continue to resist all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of our country by certain Powers and elements that seek to sow dissent and sedition in our country and thereby to retard our economic and social development.\n258.\tIn conclusion, I have spoken here today about my Government's position on various international issues and about the responsibilities and policies of the nations. In all this, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a great and historic role to play, and I take this occasion once again to express the deep faith that the Sultanate of Oman has in the United Nations and in its capacity to work for peace in the world based upon its Charter and its principles, to which we in Oman remain deeply committed."

        "file_text": "\ufeff137.\tMr. President, when my Prime Minister spoke, before the general debate opened [2122nd meeting], he conveyed to you the congratulations of the Government and the people of Pakistan on your election to your high office. Allow me to add my own and those of my delegation, and to extend our good wishes to you in your task. I take this occasion also to recall the ability and skill with which your predecessor, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Trepczynski of Poland, conducted the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General \n\nAssembly last year, and in particular the remarkable role he played in putting to rest the controversy caused, during that session, by the application of Bangladesh for membership in the United Nations.\n138.\tOn 6 October war broke out in the Middle East, as many had foreseen that it might. Since then, we have heard an account of the situation from the countries directly involved and the great Powers have made statements in the Security Council. In the view of my delegation, it will serve no purpose to determine who fired the first shot. In any event, the Arabs would be fully justified, morally and politically, in taking whatever steps they consider necessary to recover their own territory. The reason why the fighting has broken out is plain enough.\n139.\tFor almost six years the Arabs and the rest of the world have waited for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East in accordance with resolution 242 (1967), adopted in the Security Council in November 1967. Every effort made since then to resolve this conflict has been frustrated by the intransigence of Israel. More than that, by continuing to take action to consolidate its hold over the Arab territories it seized during the 1967 war, Israel has put the world on notice that it has no intention whatsoever to part with that territory. In other words, it has no intention to implement the resolution in question. At the same time, it has tried from time to time during these six years to terrorize its Arab neighbours into submission. Their patience has been exhausted, and considering that all peaceful avenues to settlement have been blocked, it is small wonder that the Arabs have taken up the challenge and decided to meet force with force.\n140.\tWar is tragic in that it inflicts suffering on innocent people as well. My delegation is shocked at the news that Israel has bombed civilian areas of Cairo and Damascus. The attack on Damascus appears to have been particularly vicious. The diplomatic quarter has also been hit and a number of embassies, including our own, have been severely damaged, and diplomatic personnel and their families have been killed or injured. This senseless act cannot be too strongly condemned. It can only lead to further escalation of this conflict.\n141.\tThe time has come for the United Nations, and in particular the great Powers, to assert themselves in the cause of peace. It is no longer enough that we think in terms merely of another cease-fire. The Organization has to find ways not only to silence the guns but also to allow the voice of reason to prevail. The elements of an equitable settlement are contained in resolution 242 (1967). It is time to begin in earnest to implement it by requiring Israel to withdraw from all Arab territories it occupied in the 1967 war. Once this is agreed to and the evaluation of the territory begins, a long-term settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict can be worked out on the basis of resolution 242 (1967), tearing in mind that any settlement, to be enduring, must provide for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.\n142.\tI now turn to other matters. In the first place, we should like to welcome the admission into the United Nations of the two German States and of the Bahamas, the latest of the colonial Territories to achieve independence.\nWe extend to the representatives of all three States to this Organization our warmest good wishes on behalf of the people of Pakistan.\n143.\tSome delegations have expressed the hope that Bangladesh too will soon join the Organization. We share that hope. There are, however, certain impediments that stand in the way.\n144.\tIn Delhi recently an agreement was reached, nearly two years after the India-Pakistan war ended, that India will repatriate the prisoners of war. But not all prisoners of war: 195 of them are to be retained in India for possible trials by Bangladesh for criminal offences allegedly committed by those prisoners during the tragic happenings of 1971. We tried very hard \u2014 I myself was involved in those negotiations \u2014 to persuade India to release all prisoners of war, without exception, in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions, but we failed.\n145.\tAs pointed out by my Prime Minister recently in this Assembly [2122nd meeting], the Government of Pakistan will abide by the letter and spirit of those resolutions and, in pursuance of those resolutions, will not resist the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations as soon as all our prisoners of war, including the 195, have been repatriated to Pakistan.\n146.\tThe key to Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations clearly lies in the hands of India and Bangladesh. We hope that agreement on the repatriation of these prisoners of war also will soon be reached. In that event we will not only not resist Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations, but will warmly welcome it.\n147.\tDespite India's inability for the time being to agree to repatriation of these 195 prisoners, the Delhi agreement is a major step forward towards an over-all settlement in the subcontinent. The three-way repatriation of the prisoners of war from India and of thousands of Bengalis and Pakistan nationals stranded in Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively, is now under way. My Government attaches the highest importance to the speedy implementation of this agreement. As an earnest of our desire to implement it faithfully and speedily, we proceeded to repatriate Bengalis to Bangladesh 10 days before India started to repatriate the prisoners of war, even though under the agreement the repatriation of prisoners of war and of Bengalis had to be simultaneous. We also sent off the 203 senior Bengali civil and military officials we had originally intended to try for treasonable activities with the earliest batches of Bengalis repatriated 10 Bangladesh. We are hopeful that India and Bangladesh will also implement this agreement with the same dispatch and in the same spirit. We also hope that before long India will agree to repatriate the remaining 195 prisoners of war as well. The way will then have been opened for further moves for normalizing relations not only with India but. also with Bangladesh, with a view to strengthening the fabric of peace in the subcontinent.\n148.\tI should like here to record our gratitude to the international community for the generosity and speed with which it has come forward with assistance, and to the Secretary-General for undertaking a massive operation, for the repatriation by air of an estimated 170,000 to 200,000 men, women and children. \n\n149.\tIt was at Simla that for the first time in the post- independence history of the subcontinent the Governments of Pakistan and India resolved to put an end to the conflict and confrontation that had hitherto marred their relations and work for the establishment of a durable peace in the subcontinent. The Agreement signed at Simla on 2 July 1972 states:\n.. the prerequisite for reconciliation, good neighbourliness and durable peace between them is a commitment by both the countries to peaceful coexistence, respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs...\\\".\nThe two countries also agreed to refrain from the threat or use of force against each other's territorial integrity or political independence. We consider that the agreement between India and Pakistan to order their relationship on this basis was the most important achievement of the summit meeting at Simla. We are resolved to fulfil that commitment in every respect.\n150.\tIn fact, this has been the basis of our relations with all countries. In particular, the commitment not to interfere in each other's internal affairs on any pretext whatsoever has been the guiding principle of Pakistan's foreign policy in its relations with all of its immediate neighbours. We scrupulously refrain from interfering in their internal affairs, and we naturally expect from them the same respect for our sovereign rights.\n151.\tOur quest for peace and stability in the Middle East, in the subcontinent and in Asia in general leads us to welcome the detente that is beginning to mark the relations between the major Powers. We welcome it in the hope that it may, as it must, eventually encompass also other areas and issues which at the moment may seem to those Powers as being of subsidiary importance but which are of vital concern to the smaller nations. As has been tragically demonstrated again by the recent outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, there is no assurance whatsoever that despite the detente what are often casually referred to as local wars would not continue to erupt. Indeed, there is cause for some apprehension that in their anxiety to promote and preserve the detente, the big Powers might be willing to overlook or sacrifice the interests of the smaller Powers. We should like to see the detente so develop that the smaller countries also may be able to live in peace and harmony with each other.\n152.\tAnother disturbing feature of the present situation is that the major Powers continue to arm themselves in spite of the detente. Perhaps it is too early yet to see the detente reflected in the field of disarmament. The acid test of the genuineness of the detente will, in our judgement, be the readiness of the major Powers to disarm themselves, which may act as a catalyst for a world-wide move towards general disarmament. The present situation, however, involves a contradiction. For all the talk of a detente, the major Powers remain engaged in producing tools of destruction which are ever more sophisticated and ever more deadly. We fear that there is a basic lack of trust among the nuclear Powers. We fear for them and for the rest of mankind and the terrible price that all of us might have to pay if a major war were unleashed.\n153.\tBorn and nurtured under conditions of insecurity basically stemming from an imbalance of power, now greatly altered to its disadvantage, Pakistan's commitment to the goal of general disarmament can scarcely be doubted. Realizing that an arms race between India and Pakistan is senseless, largely self-cancelling, and involves an appalling waste of the scarce resources desperately needed for their economic advancement, Pakistan at one stage unilaterally cut its defence expenditure. Unfortunately, this action failed to evoke a suitable response, and in recent years in both India and Pakistan the diversion of resources to military expenditure has continued at a disturbingly high rate, to the neglect of their pressing economic needs. We consider that both India and Pakistan should seriously ponder whether the time has not come for them drastically to cut their military budgets and put their resources to better use in staging a war against their common enemy, poverty. As stated by my Prime Minister during his recent visit to this country, we will be ready to discuss this issue with India at an appropriate time in the context of our joint agreement to work for durable peace in the subcontinent.\n154.\tIt was the realization that the arms race that afflicts the world is dangerous and self-defeating that led Pakistan to propose, as far back as 1961, that a study be undertaken of the economic consequences of disarmament. The conclusions of that study are more than ever applicable today in view of the vast increases in military expenditures that have since taken place. The world is now spending something like $225,000 million a year on armaments. What a sad commentary on the \\\"Disarmament Decade\\\". What a macabre tragedy in terms of resources wasted when hundreds of millions of people on this globe live in abject poverty, haunted by the continual threat of starvation or death from malnutrition, when a mere fraction of this enormous expenditure on arms could help lift the pall of fear that envelopes this unfortunate segment of mankind.\n155.\tThe time has come to shift the current emphasis from world-wide military security to world-wide economic security. Constructive action in the field of arms control and disarmament could release substantial savings for development which alone could lead to the effective underpinning of a durable structure of world-wide peace.\n156.\tThe need for disarmament is universally recognized. And yet, after years of negotiations and numerous studies, hardly any real progress has been mad . Armaments continue to pile up at an alarming rate. In particular, delay in controlling and eliminating nuclear weapons could be fatal. The monopoly of a few could soon become the preserve of many, making the task of eliminating nuclear weapons even more difficult and the danger of a universal holocaust more real.\n157.\tThe existing \\\"balance of terror\\\" \u2014 which is in fact only a modern version of the old principle of \\\"balance of power\\\" in a nuclear garb \u2014 has so far prevented the outbreak of war on a world-wide scale. However, this could create a false sense of security. It should not make us oblivious to the dangers to peace posed by regional imbalance in armaments, by resurgent desires for hegemony or by the perpetuation of intolerable injustices, and by the rapidly widening gap between the north and the south, the white and the coloured, the rich and the poor. The mere prevention of a major war does not ipso facto mean the assurance of justice on the basis of which alone a durable peace can be built.\n158.\tWe see proof of this proposition in the recent flare-up of fighting in the Middle East and the situations prevailing in South and South-East Asia and in Africa.\n159.\tIt is a matter of great regret and disappointment that . after 28 years of its existence the United Nations should still be considering the questions of colonialism and racial discrimination. Those questions should have been resolved long ago in conformity with the provisions of the Charter. The shocking spectacle of millions of people still subjected to ruthless colonial domination and exploitation, and still suffering degrading racial discrimination, continues to weigh heavy on the conscience of mankind. The situation is particularly distressing in Zimbabwe, Namibia, the Territories under Portuguese administration and in South Africa. We may derive some satisfaction from the fact that the just struggle of the oppressed peoples themselves to achieve their inalienable right to freedom and racial equality is making steady progress. Temporary set-backs have only spurred them to rededication to waging this struggle even more relentlessly. Pakistan's known commitment to this struggle and its solidarity with all those who are fighting for freedom on the basis of their right to self-determination remains strong and firm. In this context I am happy to announce that my Government has recognized Guinea- Bissau.\n160.\tThese are some of the issues that in our judgement deserve consideration by this august body. There is one other issue which is exercising the minds of people everywhere. Whither United Nations? We believe that the effectiveness, and indeed the future of the United Nations, will depend not only on its ability to prevent war, but on its ability to ensure justice. It is on the distinction between justice and injustice that the Organization will founder or survive. The Charter accepts and makes clear that distinction, but does the membership of the United Nations? In December 1971, the General Assembly, expressing the voice of mankind, issued a clarion call by 105 votes to protect the integrity and sovereignty of a Member State. The Security Council, hampered by a procedure that has lost relevance to today's world, muted and suppressed that voice by a single negative vote.\n161.\tThat part of history is behind us. But is this to remain the pattern for the future? It is our profound hope that it will not. Our faith in the United Nations survives the vicissitudes of the past. It is a faith tempered by a keen awareness of its shortcomings. It is a faith that demands that the United Nations be made stronger and more effective: a United Nations which has the ability to settle disputes that threaten peace, an Organization under which the survival of the weak will find the same guarantee as that of the strong, an Organization guided by principles, not political expediency, where justice will rule instead of the dictates of power politics. Therein lies the hope of mankind and that of generations to come."

        "file_text": "\ufeff72.\t The General Assembly of the United Nations is at present no doubt living through one of the gravest and most decisive moments in its existence. The events unfolding throughout the world, particularly in the Far East and in Africa, where injustice, arrogance and exploitation are regarded as rules of international conduct, clearly indicate that we must assume our responsibilities with all the equity and determination dictated by the situation. This session is therefore crucial, and that is why my delegation is happy to see that the Assembly has elected a political personality of Mr. Benites' wisdom to direct our work. You will all understand the satisfaction we feel as we congratulate him on his brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Through his august person we also convey our felicitations to his country and to the third world of which we are a part for their important contribution to strengthening the United Nations. We wish also to associate ourselves with the congratulations offered to his predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyfiski, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, who conducted the debates of the twenty-seventh session with courtesy and great lucidity.\n73.\tMy delegation cannot, of course, overlook the efforts the Secretary-General continuously exerts in his search for peace.\n74.\tThe brave people of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands have turned a new and glorious page in the history of the liberation of peoples.\n75.\tIndeed, after a succession of decisive victories against the enormous military and industrial apparatus placed at the disposal of Portugal by its NATO allies so as to perpetuate its colonial domination in Africa, the People's National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands on 24 September 1973 proclaimed at Boe the independence of that country.\n76.\tThe sacrifice of our brother Amilcar Cabral was not made in vain. It is fitting to pay a tribute to the memory of that pioneer of independence of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, that authentic son of struggling Africa who was treacherously assassinated on 20 January 1973 by the executioners of the Fascist Lisbon Government.\n77.\tWe salute the birth of that new State. We welcome , that event as one of the most characteristic of our times. It\nmeets one of the great hopes of peoples which love peace, justice and freedom.\n78.\tIt was perfectly normal for the people and Government of the Republic of Mali, which consider that victory to be their own, to recognize the State of Guinea- Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands immediately on the proclamation of their independence.\n79.\tIndeed, the Head of State of Mali, in his message to his brother Francisco Mendes, the Chief Commissioner, said:\n\\\"This historic act, which is a new victory of Africa against its foes, must make all African patriots more determined than ever to commit themselves resolutely\nin the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and apartheid.\n80.\tIn inviting the representatives of the national liberation movements to participate in its work and in giving them assistance, the United Nations has acted in accordance with the trend of history. The people of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands have confirmed that view. To be true to itself, our Organization must as soon as possible decide to admit that new State to membership.\n81.\tHenceforth, any hostile act of the Fascist Lisbon regime against Guinea-Bissau or the Cape Verde Islands should be considered an attempt against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State. The United Nations will then merely have to put into effect the appropriate provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter against the Portuguese Government.\n82.\tIt is a pleasant duty for my delegation to welcome to this Organization the worthy representatives of a brother State, the Bahamas. The people of the Bahamas has after a long struggle turned a new page in its history. We are happy to see it, and on behalf of the Government of Mali, I want to tender our heartfelt congratulations to the delegation of this State.\n83.\tWe are sure that the initiatives which were taken throughout the year by certain Powers to improve their relations contribute to creating a new international order, which thus must succeed the state of confrontation resulting from the cold war. It is to this process that we owe the restoration in 1971 of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China and the admission to the United Nations at the present session of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. These victories, which mark our difficult path towards the universality of the United Nations and which are indeed a triumph of reason and wisdom over the vanity of material power, are evidence that the peoples do not need tutelary power to accomplish their destinies.\n84.\tThe Government of Mali, true to its policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States, could of course only entertain the happiest relations with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The admission of these two States to the United Nations meets one of the warmest wishes of the international community, and we are very happy to see it.\n85.\tThe universality which I have just mentioned will of course have no real significance unless it is understood as a possibility for exchanging political, intellectual and moral values among nations.\n86.\tThe Preamble to the Charter reflects cardinal principles whose correct implementation would normally produce a better world. Since our moral, intellectual and material resources are such as to enable us to achieve this purpose, we should welcome every initiative and every action which commits the international community to this process.\n87.\tWhether what is involved is protection of life, respect of human rights, the struggle against injustice, slavery and hatred or the right of peoples to live in decent economic and social conditions, the objectives of the Charter can only be fully met if they are consonant with the profound aspirations of the peoples on behalf of whom the Charter was adopted.\n88.\tIn fact the struggle for peace after the Second World War has been a continuous confrontation between the forces of progress and those forces which feel that they can continue to govern the world. The latter have found out the hard way that sacred and permanent values on which our society is based are so lofty that they can be temporarily ignored but can never be really destroyed. This reality should be sufficient in itself to establish the philosophy of greatness on the triumph of these values and not on the search for the means to destroy the human race.\n89.\tTo the impossibility of dehumanizing the world has now been added the futility of using weapons in the settlement of conflicts among States, and while we await the establishment of complete justice in the world, peace can be based only on the principles of the Charter, whose essence is based in turn on comprehension and tolerance among nations.\n90.\tThe progress which has been achieved towards detente, even though inadequate, nevertheless is a positive contribution to international relations, and we must now not only continue this tendency but also orient it so as to give it a universal character and thus prevent the explosion of anger of the peoples who have been so frustrated in their aspirations to freedom and progress.\n91.\tIf peace requires genius and if genius requires patience, we can only welcome the conclusion of the cease-fire in Viet-Nam, the cessation of the bombings in Cambodia, the conclusion of the agreement on the repatriation of the Pakistani military and civilian personnel, the conclusion and implementation of the agreement on the formation of a coalition government in Laos, the continuation of negotiations on co-operation and security in Europe, the improvement of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union and the development of the relationships between the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n92.\tThe signature in Paris on 27 January 1973 of the agreement on the cease-fire in Viet-Nam  has officially put an end to 18 years of military commitment by the United States in that country, and it is indeed a victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam, which has written some of the most glorious pages in the history of the liberation of peoples. It has shown once again that faith in human dignity and the nobility and greatness of the nation is not to be destroyed by any weapons, no matter how powerful. The authentic representatives of that country have already taken their place among their comrades in the same struggle among the non-aligned nations, while we await their appearance among us here.\n93.\tWe can only hope that the Paris Agreement, which was concluded after an objective analysis of the political and social realities in Viet-Nam, will be really applied by all the interested parties in accordance with the spirit which presided at its signature.\n94.\tWe can only hope that the search for a false subcontinental balance will not prompt Thieu and his masters to repeat the acts which were condemned by the universal conscience and which were so contrary to the appropriate provisions of the Charter.\n95.\tWe pay a tribute to the Viet-Namese people for having overcome aggression and at the same time having established the political and social structures of the nation.\n96.\tAsia, like the rest of the world, aspires to peace. The success which was achieved in Viet-Nam and the formation of a coalition government in Laos are preludes to a political and social stabilization in the Far East, and this will allow, if these agreements are kept, a reconstruction of the nations which have suffered so much in that region of the world.\n97.\tPeace which is imposed by the force of arms alone is fearsome as such, because it contains the seeds of its own destruction. Indeed the very timid agreements which were achieved among the super-Powers cannot really reassure us, because the mad arms race is continuing, and the spectre of the destruction of mankind can only be banished by general, complete and controlled disarmament.\n98.\tThe implementation of the promises which were given with regard to the chance to conclude in 1974 substantial agreements on the second phase of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks is awaited by the whole of mankind with legitimate impatience, because it may perhaps allow us to free ourselves from the nightmare of self-destruction.\n99.\tHowever, peace and security are so complex that they must have a universal character, which alone can ensure their permanence. A search for solutions to international problems which is based on this fundamental reality can of course lead to concrete results, and Europe gives a partial justification of this view.\n100.\tIndeed the idea which was advanced in 1966 for a global discussion of the problems of that continent by all the States composing it has finally become affirmed and was concretised on 3 July in Helsinki by the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n101.\tOf course, an analysis of the political and social crises in Europe through more than five centuries and the impact of these events on the peoples of the other continents and their negative impact on the normal development of most of the countries which are now called \\\"the third world\\\" justifies our interest in any step which can create objective conditions of stability in that part of the world.\n102.\tBut we must recognize that, whereas it may be easy for a comment or subcontinent to draw material boundaries it is not quite so easy to find solutions to problems of collective security \u2014 and this because of the interpenetration of the interests of the nations and their interdependence. This fundamental fact makes it incumbent upon us to envisage global solutions to the problems important for the future of mankind. The use of force and circumstantial arrangements can only lead us to an absurd equation and to precarious balances.\n103.\tIn the view of my delegation, the international community can really give the full measure of its creative genius for producing durable and great works only in a climate of detente. But unfortunately we see that in Asia, Latin America and Africa, where intolerable events are still taking place, peace and security are still looked upon by foreign Powers in terms of power relationships.\n104.\tThus, the illusion is fostered that islands of peace and prosperity can continue to subsist in a tormented world and that the great majority of men will accept forever to live in conditions of mere survival.\n105.\tA correct appreciation of political, economic and social realities in the world and of the role which every State must play in a universe which wants to be democratic has not always prevailed in our attempts to bring about a settlement of international conflicts, because certain Powers continue to consider themselves as the only ones capable of interpreting the law, while others display a permanent attitude of contempt for the international community, and mock with impunity the values which are the very essence of our existence.\n106.\tIs it not really frightening to see that, at a time when the whole of mankind wants stability and at a time when the Viet-Namese people envisage a future of peace, Powers exist which invoke democracy to support the hysterical clique of Thieu, which wishes with all its heart for new hostilities and a new conflagration?\n107.\tThe proposals for the return to normal life in Viet-Nam that were made by the Provisional Revolutionary Government are so logical that they must be supported by the signatories of the Paris agreements and by the whole of the international community.\n108.\tBut it remains evident that the task of making peace in the Far East will be unfinished until the plot against the Cambodian people has been thwarted.\n109.\tThe Cambodian Royal Government of National Union has achieved many victories over the forces of reaction, despite the blind bombings, the systematic massacre of innocent people and the intensive arming of mercenaries in the pay of wealthy Powers.\n110.\tThe policy of the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea, presided over by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is based on neutrality and is in keeping with the deep aspirations of the Khmer people. It is in agreement with the principles of the Charter and the policy of non- alignment, which has contributed to the positive development of international relations.\n111.\tThe Government of the Republic of Mali would like to express its satisfaction at seeing the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea re-establish its legitimate rights, recognized by the historic summit conference of the non-aligned countries in Algeria, which astonished the world by its unity, by its proper assessment of the international situation and by its proposals which, we are sure, will inspire the action of the international community, because they are based on contemporary realities.\n112.\tOne of those realities, which is based on the legitimate representation of peoples in international organizations, requires, as was the case for the non-aligned countries, that the spokesman for Cambodia in the United Nations should be the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea, which has always been the Government of the Khmer people. Its sound opinions are especially necessary here at the very time when we are working to establish a new order in the world.\n113.\tLast year, in completing my review of events in the Far East, I said that peace was \\\"...within reach in Korea. In order to safeguard it, it. would be sufficient to help the parties to accelerate the process of peaceful reunification which is going on. \\\" The People's Democratic Republic of Korea, true to the principles of settling conflicts by negotiation, proposed last February, in its discussions with Seoul, a peace treaty containing five points which would implement the peaceful reunification of the country. As one could expect, the representatives of the South rejected those proposals, fearing that the United Nations Command would disappear and thus showing that they owe their existence only to the presence of American troops, which are still stationed in Korea under the banner of this Organization. A graver insult could not possibly be offered to the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n114.\tWe want to reaffirm again that the intervention of the United Nations in Korea is a flagrant contradiction of the spirit of the Charter. The so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has given those who created and supported it an eloquent example of an accurate appraisal of the Korean realities by inviting us to recognize that it is not needed and to disband it. The attempts to endanger the territorial integrity of Korea, in their turn, are condemned to failure because the United Nations, which has always affirmed the indivisibility of the Korean nation, can only reject such proposals aiming at perpetuation of the partition of that country.\n115.\tWith respect to the Middle East, the situation remains explosive because of the persistent refusal of Israel to comply with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.\n116.\tAs though the sufferings of the last world war had not sufficed, as though one had erased from memory the ultimate sacrifice of millions of men from every continent who fell on the battlefields to bring about the downfall of racism and of genocide of the Jewish people, as though one no longer remembered the cavalier treatment accorded the League of Nations, there are Powers, some of which are permanent members of the Security Council, that encourage and arm Israel in its scorn for the sacred principles of the Charter.\n117.\tWhereas on the one hand we affirm the precarious- ness of any political settlement based on force, on the other hand some encourage by all means the establishment in the Middle East of a so-called balance that would be based only on the power of arms.\n118.\tThus Israel, which no longer limits its dreams of conquest and whose actions have been reproached by the universal conscience, has deliberately set itself up as a terrorist State. The destruction of a commercial Libyan aircraft, the hijacking of an Iraqi plane, the repeated attacks against Syrian and Lebanese population centres by Israeli fighter planes, the hand of death striking in Beirut and other actions are eloquent illustrations of this.\n119.\tThe genius and superiority of a nation are measured by its contribution to peace and not by its capacity to unleash useless violence.\n120.\tThe faith of peoples in the restoration of their usurped dignity is a force so powerful that Israel would stand to gain by pondering the fate of those regimes which have attempted to break that faith; it would draw sound lessons if it did not wish to expose its people to international hatred and condemnation.\n121.\tThe community of nations would stand to gain in authority if after a quarter of a century of guilty passivity in the face of the tragedy in the Middle East it granted the legitimate demands of the martyred Palestinian people.\n122.\tTo the knowledge of my delegation there has not been, apart from cases of unconditional surrender, situations where negotiations on ending conflicts were started without restoring the conditions that existed prior to those conflicts.\n123.\tThe unconditional withdrawal from Arab territories occupied by Israel and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are the only basis for a just settlement of the Middle East crisis. To interpret those clear resolutions inevitably leads to distorting them. Yet that is what Israel and its allies are doing, thus blocking any initiative for a peaceful settlement of this tragedy, in particular the efforts of Mr. Jarring and of the African Heads of State.\n124.\tThe members of the international community would be accomplices to flagrant violations of the Charter if they did not take energetic measures to repress in an exemplary manner the threat to peace in the Middle East. The belligerent and indefinable idea of secure and recognized frontiers advocated by Israel is a tendentious distortion of Security Council resolution 242(1967).\n125.\tThe resumption of hostilities last Saturday in the Middle East proved that the situation of \\\"no peace, no war\\\" which prevailed was only an illusion and that any incident could set off an explosion which would lay waste the entire region. Israel bears full responsibility for the tragic development of that crisis. It is time for the allies of Israel to understand all the risks which their negative attitude entails for peace in that region, which, for the fourth time since 1948, has become a battlefield with its attendant misery, destruction, humiliation and frustration.\n126.\tLet us recognize that one cannot be for peace and support Israel and international Zionism in their insulting and persistent defiance of the community of nations. One cannot be for peace and sanction the occupation by Israel of the Arab territories of Gaza and Sinai, the Golan Heights and the west bank. One cannot be for peace and challenge the inalienable rights of the martyred people of Palestine to self-determination and to a homeland. One cannot, finally, work for peace in Europe and continue to support Israeli aggression against the Arab nation in the Middle East. The contradiction which characterizes the international conduct of the allies of Israel is, to say the least, an aberration. The complicity of Israel's allies is condemnable and our Organization must draw the lesson by having recourse to the relevant Articles of the Charter to compel the Zionist State to co-operate in restoring peace in the Middle East. In this connexion, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination must not be coupled with any condition or requirement. It is at that price, and that price alone, that our Organization can halt the chain reaction of violence in the Middle East and re-establish there a just and lasting peace in accordance with the historical mission entrusted to it by the Charter.\n127.\tWe are told that the world is in a state of detente; intransigence born of misunderstandings and mistaken appreciations of the profound aspirations of peoples is vanishing. Despite this ray of hope and the solemn commitment undertaken in 1945 to fight, if necessary with arms, all threats to human dignity, we are compelled to note that the most abject colonialism and the most infamous oppression are still rampant in Africa and elsewhere.\n128.\tIn opposition to the concerted goodwill to make relations between States democratic, in opposition to the happy initiative taken or about to be taken to establish this universal peace to which all peoples aspire, there are the ignominious theories and practices of exploitation of man and discrimination of all kinds.\n129.\tWhereas during the course of the year there has been an increase in the visits and negotiations between Heads of State and Government to reduce the tensions Iborn of the last world war; whereas associations of workers, young people, men of learning and religious men have condemned apartheid and colonialism, the crime of genocide perpetrated at Sharpeville has been re-enacted by the dastardly assassination of the Carletonville miners by the racists of Pretoria and the massacre of the peaceful populations of Wiriyamu in Mozambique by Portuguese soldiers \u2014 and during that time Caetano was sipping champagne in London. The United Nations must shoulder its responsibilities towards Portugal, which, with the support of its NATO allies, continues with impunity its colonial wars in Africa in defiance of the\nprovisions of resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization and of the principles of the Charter.\n130.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe people, which rejected the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals that would have confiscated their right to independence for the benefit of the white minority, is daily persecuted by the rebellious and racist Salisbury regime and apartheids being strengthened there by the multiplication of \\\"bantustans\\\". One must recognize that the non-application by certain Member States of the economic sanctions adopted by our Organization against the Ian Smith clique has simply strengthened the Salisbury usurpers' ability to resist. Even though the United States is not the only country to breach the decisions adopted against that rebel regime, it is to be hoped that the Congress of that country will accede to the wish of its Government to put an end to the importation of Rhodesian chrome.\n131.\tThe racist regime of Salisbury has increased its hostility to the independent Republics of Tanzania and Zambia by unilaterally closing the frontiers with those countries and perpetrating on their territory acts of aggression and terrorism that have resulted in the loss of many human lives. Those attempts to stifle action, which have been directed in particular against Zambia, have been rendered futile by the solidarity of the international community, which responded to our Organization's appeals.\n132.\tIn South Africa repression against African nationalists and the liberals of the white race increases while the curve of summary executions and individual assassinations constantly rises. The racist Pretoria Government continues to commit aggression against the people of Namibia, in defiance of the United Nations decision which put an end to its Mandate [resolution 2145 (XXI)] and which has been confirmed by an opinion of the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  Despite the fact that repression has become more severe, the Ovambo people boycotted the electoral sham which the South African occupation authorities organized to perpetuate their domination. The failure of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General vis-\u00e0-vis the Government of Pretoria gives us a measure of the latter's obstinacy in refusing to co-operate with our Organization in the implementation of the relevant resolutions on Namibia.\n' 134. Those are factors which throughout the year have hampered the attainment of the objectives of our Organization in southern Africa. It appears that the persistence of such a situation simply increases the tragic racial tension which prevails in that sensitive part of the world. The General Assembly and the Security Council are bound to draw the appropriate lesson. For its part, the delegation of Mali rejects the conclusions of the report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and proposes that his mandate be ended.\n135.\tThe arrogance of the Government of South Africa is a result of the support and, in particular, the material and technical aid obligingly given it by the NATO military- industrial Powers in the form of unlimited deliveries of arms and munitions. This attitude is doubtless dictated by the fact that those Powers consider South Africa to be a bulwark against I know not what Communist tide. Is it not in the name of that red peril \u2014 which, furthermore, is baseless \u2014 that the Government of Pretoria pushes its stupidity and ignominy to the extent of establishing discrimination between animals? The NATO Powers must abandon their support of the unholy alliance constituted by the Lisbon-Pretoria-Salisbury axis and co-operate with the United Nations for the restoration of peace in southern Africa, because any racial confrontation that is started there may engulf that part of the continent.\n136.\tThe peace to which all our efforts are directed cannot be reconciled with the economic imbalances which characterize our world. Indeed, the gap between the developed and the developing countries continues to grow. The new economic order to which mankind aspires must be based on world co-operation which safeguards the interests of all the partners. At this time the great hopes placed in the Second United Nations Development Decade are beginning to vanish, because, according to the evaluation that has been carried out, the growth rate of the developing countries is far from having attained the 6 per cent target. The report of the Secretary-General on the world economic situation during the year 1972,'1 furthermore, points out that while the economic growth rate generally rose in the developed countries, the situation in most developing countries is reflected in a growth rate slightly lower than during the 1960s.\n137.\tThe reasons for such a decline are known. I shall mention only those relating to the permanent and increasingly more acute deterioration in the terms of trade, the existence of quota and tariff barriers against access to the developed countries' markets of the primary, finished and semi-finished goods of the developing countries, the exploitation of their products by transnational companies, monetary instability and the chronic deficit of agricultural harvests caused by natural catastrophes. The monetary instability which is shaking the world has aggravated the precariousness of the economies of the developing countries. While the successive devaluations of the \\\"have\\\" countries currencies and the unilateral readjustments that mark the end of the Bretton Woods system have had little effect on the economic expansion of the developed countries, the consequences have been drastic for low-income countries. We very much doubt that the negotiations taking place in Tokyo within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will lead to the establishment of a new integrated economic order. We rather fear that they will lead to an accentuation of the division of the world into two antagonistic poles: one in constant growth, the other withering away under the requirements of the first. Furthermore, if we are not careful, the famine which increasingly threatens mankind may attain dramatic proportions.\n\n138.\tThe tragic consequences of the drought on the economies and living conditions of the Sudano-Sahelian countries are serious warnings for the United Nations to take up the problem of food in terms of carefully thought- out plans and not in terms of circumstantial programmes.\n139.\tI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to address my sincere thanks and express the profound gratitude of the Government of Mali to all friendly countries, to national or international organizations, governmental or non-governmental organizations, which have given us aid in our efforts to overcome the consequences of the drought, which has been a hard trial for my country.\n140.\tNevertheless, while this international solidarity permitted us to forestall the worst, the fact is that prospects for a return to normal production conditions in our country remain distant. Indeed, the cycle of drought continues and the latest news enables me to affirm that this year again plants have dried on the ground before they attained full growth. The international community must therefore consider the urgent implementation in those countries of medium and long-term plans so as to free them from their quasi'-total dependence on a capricious rainfall.\n141.\tIn our work we find ourselves facing clear and decisive choices.\n142.\tOur success will be the measure of the determination with which we seek equitable solutions for the multiple and complex problems of our times.\n143.\tThe United Nations, because of its universal vocation, represents the ideal crucible where ideas should be merged so that, patiently but with resolution, we may, from one session to the next, contribute in a positive manner to the progressive attainment of the objectives set out in the Charter.\n144.\tThese are problems of survival which our society faces and no nation is sheltered from the storm.\n145.\tThus, we have no choice but to work jointly for the coming into being of a new international order based on justice and equity.\n146.\tIt is to this task that my delegation invites the Assembly of nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1. Mr. President, in these last days of the general debate I should like to pay a tribute to the authority and distinction with which you are presiding over our work.\n2.\tI shall be relatively brief, for I wish to avoid repetition and, besides, I have no taste or desire for making propaganda. But I would prefer that the truth should prevail even if it should emerge as the truth which is obvious on the banks of the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne and the Rhone, the four principal rivers of my country.\n3.\tThis debate is drawing to a close without surprises, except those that we have ceaselessly warned against, and without excesses. Everyone is gratified by this, even if, in order to achieve it, one had to keep silent on many questions and take for granted what is merely adumbrated in the same way that a fad secures a grip upon minds before it prevails in the streets.\n4.\tYou will no doubt understand what I am referring to. To speak of peace does not call for any great precision. On the other hand, to invoke detente, to believe in it as one would believe in spring when one suddenly comes upon it around the bend after winter, would seem to warrant more assiduity and curiosity. Who does not wish for detente, or could reject it?\n5.\tAt the risk of causing irritation, I would remind you that we have had a long experience of detente and the concept thereof. For the last 15 years it has been the concern of our foreign policy. Judge for yourselves: decolonization; the establishment of East-West relations; friendly and active co-operation with the Soviet Union; the fundamental treaty between France and Germany in 1963; the building of a European entity; as early as 1964, understanding of, and respect for, China, to which the President, of the French Republic has, as you know, just completed a trip; unfailing support for the third world, for the independence of nations and for a more equitable distribution of resources, and, to take a current example, for the harmony of the Comoro islands with their destiny. All these things protect us from naivete, but they have shown us that lucidity and generosity should always go hand in hand.\n6.\tMeanwhile, we learn that 1973 is to be primarily the year of detente. And reference is made to this at every turn, as if a single year were sufficient to meet its needs and as if this year promised exceptional developments. To be quite truthful, I see but two such events \u2014 much discussed, but the full expression of which is not yet completely manifest and of which the consequences, you will agree, are not yet entirely known.\n7.\tIn the first place, I see the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It is, of course, as we all know, not yet concluded. Its principal merit consists in its having gathered together 33 European countries and the United States and Canada. Apart from this essential fact, the results, if they are good, will be, as it were, thrown into the bargain. They will, furthermore, serve the concept of detente mainly by representing compromises between opposing stands that could not have been developed at leisure. In the long run, the contents will matter less than the way in which they were obtained. For our part, we are doing all we can to ensure the success of the Conference, and I am sure that this is well known.\n8.\tThis Conference is therefore an important fact, an unaccustomed event, unusual in recent international practice; it is a development that is comforting to note. For all that, it is not the Eden of detente, it does not represent the alpha and omega of conciliation. It is a joint effort, an arduous effort that is the business of all. It is a state of mind that is being born \u2014 a miracle indeed! \u2014 among the poisonous flowers of the arms race, which remains, however, fraught with the mistrust and the ambitions to which it gives rise.\n9.\tLet us therefore be reasonable in our appreciation, cautious in our enthusiasm, and realistic in our behaviour. Let us not allow ourselves to be trapped in the all-too-easy syllogism: the Conference serves the idea of detente; detente can serve to nourish all speeches; therefore, he who refers to the Conference is, assuredly, one who practises detente.\n10.\tFurthermore on 22 June last, the United States and the Soviet Union published the news of an agreement they had reached on nuclear strategy. That agreement is but a \nbeginning and is to be followed up, so it is stated, in 1974. Its authors were gratified and they invited the whole world to share in their gratification. Why? Because this undoubtedly is an agreement between two very great Powers and it consequently concerns us all \u2014 or rather it affects us all, because it can be clothed in the chaste cloak of detente. Those two reasons are not sufficient to mask the reality that has gradually become apparent to all. In order to avoid bankruptcy, and with political considerations in mind, the two Powers have preferred to limit the development of some of their nuclear armaments while at the same time maintaining a sufficiently strong mutual vulnerability to deter each other from upsetting the balance.\n11.\tThus, this type of detente would be limited to such an exercise in balancing between the two treaty partners. When children fight, one often notices that the strongest avoid a head-on clash with each other and instead attack the lightest-weight members of the other gang, who can be easily knocked down by a few simple blows. It is the same with nations. And if the light-weight nations are at present worried, how can anyone be surprised? The only surprising thing is that it has taken them so long to become nervous, finding themselves with a mere rifle in their hands while the pressures and presences remain the same at their frontiers. All that one very famous actress wore was perfume. I fear that, so scantily clothed by detente alone, we still run the risk of shivering.\n12.\tMy analysis of the recent months would perhaps have been rather less cruel in so far as detente is concerned \u2014  detente is, after all, a French word which we have endowed with its full significance by our actions \u2014 had it not been for the fact that certain slanderous campaigns have sought to cast slurs upon our very idea of national independence, shared by so many others.\n13.\tThe past and geography have taught us lessons that we are not likely to forget. We are like prey that has been so often hunted that the hunter can no longer approach. Illusions, wars, more illusions and war again: this has been our fate. Henceforth, we rely primarily on ourselves, on our own efforts. I cannot imagine anyone, unless he is under an illusion, who could think of making us renounce this.\n14.\tWe have been distressed, I would say hurt, to hear from our friends or from peoples for whom we have affection statements made here or there whose lack of reality in comparison with the facts or the actual situation in the world seems surprising to me. Even more surprising are the steps which have been taken to convince us that the questions at issue are mere figures of speech that we are wrong to feel uneasy about, but merely justified by the domestic considerations of a sovereign State.\n15.\tCan one really deal so lightly with a serious matter of concern to us all? Because it is a matter of national independence for a nation which does not want to be the pawn of world strategy. In its turn, after many others, and left to its own resources France provided itself with nuclear armaments, not in order to indulge in dreams of grandeur, but because its every existence was at stake. Alone, we covered the ground of difficult research, with a considerable time lag. And today some people are indignant that we have dared to tread this path, which is presumably the royal way reserved to those who today hold power; that we have placed our footsteps in their tracks, such deep tracks. And yet what protests did their actions give rise to? I look for them in vain.\n16.\tNowadays one is less modest, doubtless because one knows that with France, a peaceful Power whose only ambition is to live in harmony with all and not to be taken by surprise, one does not run a great risk. Well, one does in fact.\n17.\tI shall not refer to the risk of ridicule. But a risk one is essentially exposed to is the risk of not understanding that one is being manipulated, used, propelled against one's own interests. And more serious still is the risk of being wholly mistaken in one's analysis of the world situation, to have understood nothing, with gaping mouth and, unfortunately, closed eyes. Finally, there is the risk of opposing the will for independence, which should be that of all peace- loving peoples and which France is convinced it is serving while ensuring its own destiny as a free nation.\n18.\tWe shall at least preserve a vivid memory of the moment of collective blindness in which some have foundered, dragging down with them, by means of false evidence, some quarters of public opinion whose irrational fears were nursed at leisure. And we shall therefore abide by our conduct so that our fate cannot be settled except by ourselves, since from now on everyone can realize that we cannot disappear without damage to others.\n19.\tAnd again, we are convinced, we are sure, that by so doing we are strengthening the ground on which Europe must be built by affirming our steadfastness, our independence, our determination not to slacken our defence efforts.\n20.\tHow could I avoid, after all, referring to Europe? Everyone quite rightly wonders, does Europe already exist, and particularly in the consciousness of others rather than in the consciousness of Europe itself? Is it something that is really going to exist? I refer to it only as a citizen of one of the States that go to make it up, attached like so many others to those landscapes and those shores which have borne witness to such diverse activity and been the scene of so much meditation. I speak about Europe only from a certain memory of the past and with the reasonable hope of a more just, more secure and fuller life.\n21.\tI am sure that this is the deep aspiration of all those European peoples who live on an exiguous territory, densely populated, closely partitioned, the internal boundaries of which are crumbling a little more each day, yielding to the thrust of time \u2014 a universal phenomenon.\n22.\tThere is no collective will or power here; only the certainty that in joining forces everything will eventually become simpler, even if the path towards it is not entirely mapped out. This effort might perhaps also warrant the fair name of detente, the effort that nine States, often so different, pursue tirelessly in order to bury antagonisms, adjust their policies, and ensure their well-being. It would warrant being hailed often from this rostrum, and even better to be encouraged from the bottom of people's hearts. It would warrant an organization such as the United Nations showing it henceforth less indifference. Finally, it would warrant an appreciation of the extent to which Europe undoubtedly would be useful to the international order because, besides the virtues of its own joining of forces, Europe would become a pole of peace in a world drifting from one spell of vertigo to another.\n23.\tRecently in Copenhagen, \\\"the Nine\\\" \u2014 as they have become known these days \u2014 agreed to define their common identity among themselves and to express with one voice their opinion on an important matter \u2014 their relationship with the United States \u2014 as they have already done in other cases, for example the Conference on European security. There is nothing unwonted in such behaviour nor is there in the approaches which are to follow, because some State or other will also have wished to establish such a dialogue. There is nothing unwonted either if, in the weeks to come, a common view is expressed within the framework of the Atlantic alliance, where thinking is going on in the light of world developments.\n24.\tPerhaps even, but I do not want to dream too much, the latter will have to take into account this common will which may animate European countries so that a more equitable and better shared universal order may prevail.\n25.\tA more equitable and better shared universal order: it is there that genuine detente will truly be able to flourish.\n26.\tAs long as the independence of everyone is not fully recognized and respected, as long as the living conditions of every country are not made more secure, where indeed is detente?\n27.\tDoes it not lie in the restoration of international monetary regulations, which would give equal opportunities to all, and in a stability without which the weaker will be trampled underfoot?\n28.\tDoes it not lie in the establishment of normal trade practices that would limit emergency measures which have an unexpected effect on markets?\n29.\tDoes it not lie in a rational, generous and far-reaching concept of production and trade, which would share major commodities equally between producers and consumers?\n30.\tDoes it not lie in the establishment of an international code defining the rights and obligations of each State in the world commercial order?\n31.\tThere is nothing new left to be said about these topics. Should one be irritated at the fact that nothing can yet be put down to the credit of international co-operation? Should one be irritated that the monetary organization has been smashed to smithereens under the pressure of its own deficiencies? Should we be irritated that the selfishness of nations hinders any progress towards agreements on primary commodities? Should we be irritated at the fact that shortage is replacing affluence, that the forecasts of technicians are not borne out by the facts and that humble and innumerable lives, often wrecked by hurricanes and droughts, are also suffering from unforeseen vicissitudes, the origin of which they do not know, and that even squander the slender resources of days of starvation?\n32.\tShould one allow onself to become disheartened enough to accept the false pretences, the abortive texts, the proposals which aim at politics and not at the well-being of our fellow men?\n33.\tFor our part, we shall continue crying out certain truths, perhaps in the wilderness of some meetings which are too densely packed with words. We shall continue, by our national action, and also in Europe with our partners,, and everywhere in the world where we are bound by ties of history and friendship, we shall continue to affirm that stability, generosity, responsibility, respect for others are concepts without which there can be no monetary or commercial future for the world, without which there would be just one single prospect: that of bitterness and violence.\n34.\tIn this year of 1973, it would have been easy, had one wished, to restore equanimity to the whole world. Away from dialectics which cause one to lose sight of realities and which deflect the deep inclination for peace of peoples, could not those who claim to bear the highest responsibilities have found the path to true glory?\n35.\tHowever, only interested motives, too well-understood and thoroughly weighed, seem to have guided their thoughts and actions. Take South-East Asia \u2014 where the fighting is taking so long to be extinguished after having been endless \u2014 and on other frontiers where it is still the eve of battle, with sudden outbursts.\n36.\tThere is the Middle East where the situation, one had been told, was under control. And so why should it change? And being so sure of tomorrow one had left until tomorrow what should have been done today. And the results are there for all to see. Did not so much certainty, such assurance, warrant the present being dealt with before the irreparable occurred?\n37.\tLet us hope that those conflicts of another era \u2014  anachronistic to the point that they last without causing inconvenience except, unfortunately, for the suffering populations \u2014 will cease. Let us hope that the collective conscience will be heeded before they go astray who, in keeping with their tremendous present responsibilities, must quickly understand the friendly and urgent message that we put to friends that they be inspired by tolerance and prompted by the will to concerted action not only in their own meetings, but also in their relations with all peoples who, in their powerlessness, follow the progress of such merciless games.\n38.\tOn the subject of those absurd, ruthless, unfair wars, my country has long since, over and over again, voiced its views and stated its policies. Therefore I shall not dwell on that.\n39.\tIn this assembly of nations we have many friends. We feel a community of thought with many peoples, many States, young or old, which, like us, are seeking their way in order to assert their dignity by themselves assuming the responsibility for their destinies.\n40.\tWe believe with them that this rostrum, this international gathering, this periodic and organized pooling of world preoccupations are indispensable so that peoples souls may sometimes throb and that some cries may be uttered here and there; and these, heard by the multitude, may so animate them that nothing will ever be as before; so that falsehood may lose its assurance, that indifference may finally come to be tinged with concern; and that those who make demands and claims may also heed the voice of responsibility; that friendship may cease to be a matter of subservience and influence cease to be burdensome; that the veiled but ever-present threat may no longer weigh on people's minds and hearts, and that from now on, nobody may dare to give expression to it.\n41.\tI myself, prepared this speech several days ago. Before coming here today I changed nothing except the tenses of two verbs, from the present to the past, and inserted two phrases quite spontaneously.\n42.\tThis address is a statement of our policy, a statement of its concepts, duration and determination. I delete nothing. I add nothing to it.\n43.\tBut since last Saturday, fighting has been resumed and all the evidence indicates that it is particularly bloody. I offer the assistance of my country so that the war may quickly subside and not flare up again. We could make suggestions to contribute to a peaceful settlement on condition that everyone wants this and really wants a just and lasting peace. I am convinced that our European friends share this wish. I hope that these sincere wishes are not offered in vain"

        "file_text": "\ufeff119.\tIt is an honour for me, Mr. President, as a newcomer to this Assembly to offer the congratulations of the Irish delegation to you, whose long and distinguished career at the United Nations has now culminated in your election as President of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Your declared loyalty to, and faith in, our Organization will inspire our work. In you too we salute the loyalty to the United Nations of Ecuador and Latin America. As you have so rightly said, Ecuador has been guided in international affairs by \\\"the ethical and legal principles which form the common cultural heritage of Latin America derived from a thousand years of history\\\" [2117th meeting, para. 44], from its own soil and from its blending with the culture of Europe. And perhaps I may be permitted to recall that an Irishman, Florence O'Leary, companion and biographer of the great Bolivar, was privileged to fight for liberty beside Juan Jose' Flores, who became the first president of your country. We in Ireland treasure these links with Ecuador and Latin America and they give us an additional reason for rejoicing in your election to your high office.\n120.\tMy delegation also wishes to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland, the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, who carried out the duties of his high office with outstanding efficiency, distinction and courtesy.\n121.\tIreland is happy to welcome the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as the one hundred thirty-fifth Member of the United Nations-this first land of the New World seen by Columbus, and a land whose culture unites those of many continents.\n122.\tAnd we warmly welcome what you, Mr. President, have described as \\\"historically and politically the transcendent event of this session\\\", the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany, our partner in the European Economic Community, and of the German Democratic Republic. The achievements of the German people in the realms of literature, philosophy, music, art, science and scholarship have enriched the cultures of all our countries and pervaded our thinking. Gutenberg, Luther, Goethe, Kant, Marx, Beethoven-there is no end of famous men and women of whom we might say, as Goethe did of Kant, \\\"Even if you have not read him, he has influenced your thinking\\\". These are the makers of European and world culture, for they are not bounded by any country; these are true citizens of the world who are not so much children of Germany as of humanity.\n123.\tThe Federal Republic has long been a Member of the United Nations family and has given loyal and distinguished service to many of its organs. Its presence in the Assembly and that of the German Democratic Republic will bring to our deliberations the great qualities of the German people as a new and active element in the Organization. Perhaps, too, we can hope that their co-operation here, where they sit side by side, will hasten the day when Germany will again be peacefully reunited.\n124.\tIn his introduction to the annual report on the work of the United Nations, the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, has told us that this body will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support which are not backed by inner conviction, realism and whole-hearted participation [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 2], and he has asked us in his closing words to examine our consciences, to decide just what kind of world organization we need and are prepared in reality to accept [ibid., p. 8]. Do we want an Organization which is more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies, one which will develop an impetus of its own?\n125.\tThese blunt questions deserve thoughtful and at the same time frank answers. The role of our Organization needs to be reviewed at this time for two quite different reasons: first, and most obviously, because of public disquiet, one might indeed say disillusionment, with its achievements as they are known-incompletely, be it said-to public opinion; but also, and ultimately more importantly, because the last few years have seen the emergence of world problems not previously realized or understood, some indeed quite new. Their resolution will require without question a global approach through an Organization representative of all the peoples of the earth.\n126.\tThe last two decades have seen for the first time in the life of this planet the emergence of an almost comprehensive range of organized independent States representing virtually all the peoples of the earth. In the perspective of history it will no doubt be seen as ironical that this should have coincided precisely with a stage in the economic organization and in the economic development of the world that began to render unworkable the very concept of absolute national sovereignty and to demand, with rising urgency, a pooling of sovereignty in certain specific areas of activity in the joint interest of the world's peoples. For some long-established and powerful States this is an unwelcome development, accustomed as they have been to an almost unfettered exercise of sovereignty in the interest of their own peoples-often in the past, be it said, without much regard for the interests of others. Such countries naturally find it hard to accept the constraints on the exercise of their power which this new situation imposes. But this development also poses great psychological problems for States that have come into existence only in recent decades, with an understandable ambition to exercise, within the ,limits imposed by their economic power and geographic extent, the attributes of sovereignty, so long and so harshly denied to them. As the representative of one of these newer States, I am very conscious of this aspect of the problem and can sympathize with the many even newer States that have hardly yet had the chance to consider how best to use the sovereignty so recently secured. We in Ireland know just what is entailed in a recognition of the need to pool parts of our national sovereignty; we have faced this choice and our people, in May of last year, by a majority of five-sixths, decided to recognize that it would be counter-productive and contrary to their interests to insist on the preservation, undiluted, of sovereignty in matters where this sovereignty could not effectively be exercised save in co-operation with neighbouring States. The reality that we in Ireland have faced is one that all the Member States of this Organization-even the most powerful and the most-proud-must also recognize as this extraordinary century draws to its close. None of our States is capable of controlling single- handed the environment in which their people live. Pollution is ubiquitous. Technology is universal. The airwaves reach every corner of the globe, and out beyond it to the stars, whose secrets we are starting to probe by voyages into space. No State can by its own laws or its own power safeguard its people's interests from external influences, be they good or bad. We have no choice, therefore, but to seek each other's co-operation in determining which is the pervasive forces of technology , and which manifestations of economic power endanger our peoples unless controlled and in agreeing on how to control them.\n127.\tOur human loyalties start small: first to our families, then to our local communities. For many people even the extension of loyalty beyond the local community to the State is difficult. And so we do not find it easy to widen our loyalties to new and larger entities perhaps lacking in cultural cohesion and comprising other States or peoples with which we have in the past had deep and perhaps bloody differences. Least of all do we find it easy, yet, to see the world as one community of peoples owing loyalty to each other and to the earth which gives them life and sustenance and shelter. That is why the first tentative efforts towards a recognition of the interdependence of States in the modern world has come at the regional level, among peoples who, however diverse their individual cultures, share a common heritage. Western Europe is today the scene of a development which, while yet at this stage unique, may prove a fore-runner of other similar free unions of culturally diverse sovereign States seeking to overcome mutual suspicion in a sharing of their sovereignty over those features of their economic and social affairs which can no longer be controlled at the level of the individual State.\n128.\tMany of these problems, however, today demand global rather than regional solutions. They require, in the words of the distinguished representative of the United .States, Mr. Henry Kissinger, whom we warmly welcomed here this morning, the acceptance of the imperatives of a global society [2124th meeting]. As Mr. Kissinger said, they will not be resolved by a world fragmented into self-contained nation-States or rigid blocs. They will not, indeed, ultimately be resolved until the world's peoples can raise their sights to a level of vision elevated enough to command a wider view of these problems.\n129.\tBut we cannot afford to wait-for the growth-of technology and the expansion of economic activity will not delay-until a sense of global loyalty emerges, strong enough to carry the superstructure of common decision making needed to resolve all these problems at one swoop. Instead we must start together to tackle these problems with the very limited means now available' to us-the cumbersome mechanisms of decision-making by unanimity which is all that our peoples, and, be it said, their governments, are ready to concede at this stage. The problems that fall to be tackled in this way-first of all through the existing quite inadequate level of international co-operation, but ultimately by something much more highly-developed and more appropriate to the scale of these problems \u2014 are . well known to us all. First there is the problem of the maldistribution of the world's resources in relation to the spread of its people on the surface of the globe. Here we face both the problem of the maldistribution of natural resources, and that of the maldistribution of the capacity to harness them. There are countries with natural resources far exceeding their present ability to develop. There are States with virtually no natural resources at all, which also lack the technological base to import and process such resources. And there are advanced countries which, with or without their own natural resources, have, through their historical development, secured a position of economic power and wealth which places them many levels above States in other parts of the world.\n130.\tSuch disparities between people on the one hand and wealth on the other are morally unsustainable. They fly in the face of the conscience of a growing proportion of mankind which is coming to feel that our neighbour is indeed every other human being; that this feeling is most acute amongst the younger generation in our countries is perhaps one of the most hopeful features of the modern world..\n131.\tBut that is only one of many problems which must be tackled globally. There is the problem of our environment and the using up of resources some of which we now believe to be within sight of exhaustion within the lives of our children or grandchildren. There is the problem of multinational companies, many of them, be it said, responsible for technological breakthroughs which have benefited mankind but which, nevertheless, escape the control of national governments. Some are operating on a scale controllable in the public interest only by a world authority, exercising at world level the same protective function as that undertaken by our national governments within our own States vis-\u00e0-vis purely domestic private interests. And there is also the overflow effect of modern international advertising, operating through pervasive communications media, which may involve abuses that no national government could today control effectively in its own territory without impairing the ability of its own domestic enterprises to hold their own in competition with external concerns free from such constraints.\n132.\tBecause these and similar problems can be tackled effectively only at a global level, and because the interests of the world's peoples demand that they be tackled, the United Nations has a future role to play, the importance of which should not be underestimated. It was perhaps with considerations such as these in mind that a working group was established some time ago to prepare a charter of economic rights and duties of States, and it was such considerations also, no doubt, that the President of Mexico had in mind when he some weeks ago addressed a letter to the Secretary-General asking that work on that charter be accelerated [A/9142].\n133.\tBut it is not only in areas such as these that the old concept of absolute national sovereignty must start to give way to a wider sense of human solidarity. Human rights transcend national boundaries. In our membership of this body, and in certain of its activities, that fact is partially recognized. But we are still far indeed from the point where throughout the world the basic rights of human beings are protected by a code of legislation universally enforceable on an international basis. There is more lip-service, and less real commitment, in this aspect of our joint activities in the United Nations, than perhaps in any other.\n134.\tIn this particular area the member States of the Council of Europe have something to offer. We have accepted a significant measure of derogation of sovereignty in human rights matters-permitting domestic actions in matters involving human rights to be effectively challenged in an international forum. My own country was indeed one of the first to be challenged by this process; happily we were vindicated. I believe that if what we in the Council of Europe have developed were to become generalized, and if States in other parts of the world were to accept the same measure of derogation of sovereignty in this field that we in that Council have accepted, great progress could be made. This is an area where, it must be said, there has been a deterioration rather than an improvement in recent years as, in more and more countries-most recently in Chile- regimes have come to power lacking the consent of their peoples, and many of them hold on to power by repressive measures that undermine human rights.\n135.\tIn this year when we commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Secretary-General has very pertinently said that the credibility of the United Nations is especially at stake [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 5]. That credibility can be restored only if, as the preamble to the Universal Declaration proposes, human rights are protected by the rule of law-the rule of international law-which alone can be effective vis-\u00e0-vis domestic repression in Member States.\n136.\tHow can we make real progress in this matter? Surely by seeking to create an effective international human rights jurisdiction. Many States will, I believe, accept such a proposal \u2014 in Western Europe alone there are more than a dozen that do so already. Others can be embarrassed or shamed into doing so. And those who remain outside \u2014 or who, having joined, later renege on their obligations-will have identified themselves as unwilling to give their own citizens the guarantees that only the international rule of law can provide, without which, as the preamble to the Declaration states, the seeds of violence will be sown.\n137.\tThis problem of human rights takes on a special dimension in southern Africa. There the deprivation of individual freedom is based on race and colour. No consideration of personal achievement, level of education, or even of loyalty to the regime, influences the treatment meted out to those whose colour is different from that of the ruling minority. From birth, and because of birth, the majority are condemned to unequal treatment, humiliating to the human spirit, degrading those who impose it as much as those on whom it is imposed.\n138.\tWe condemn that policy, and believe that its intrinsically evil character makes it ultimately unworkable. Condemnation alone is not enough, however. Indeed condemnation without any attempt to understand the fears that lie behind this evil imposition may be counter-productive. We have to face the fact that because of their history white South Africans have become a dominant but fearful minority in that beautiful land. Their fears, however unreal they may appear to us, are real to them, and one way of helping to bring the curse of apartheid to an earlier demise will be to seek means of reassuring this misguided dominant minority as to its future in a free and democratic South Africa. In the policies which the United Nations adopts in relation to South Africa this consideration should have a part, without our ever for a moment relaxing our abhorrence of the evil itself or ceasing to counter the attempts by reactionary elements in some countries to mitigate or explain away this most degrading of all repressive policies.\n139.\tA separate and special problem is that of Rhodesia, where the illegal regime retains its control and where there appears to be little immediate hope of change but, rather, ominous signs of greater misery ahead. Hopes that the way to a just and peaceful society recognizing the principle of majority rule might be paved by a constitutional conference have not been fulfilled, and the illegal regime seems bent on even more intransigent and suicidal measures to preserve control by the white 5 per cent of the population. The majority have shown great patience and have continued under their chosen political leaders-some imprisoned for many years-to search for peaceful solutions. Ireland will maintain its support of the right of that people to independence, and will continue strictly to adhere to the Security Council's mandatory sanctions against the illegal regime.\n140.\tElsewhere in southern Africa, there are the problems of Namibia and of the Portuguese Territories. The attitude of the people of Namibia to the illegal South African regime-which persists in exercising authority in the region in defiance of the United Nations, which seven years ago terminated South Africa's mandate for the Territory [resolution 2145 (XXI)]-has been shown by the boycott of elections in one of the so-called \\\"homelands\\\", by industrial action, and, indeed, by rebellion against the denial of human rights. We support the United Nations in its efforts to free this country from the illegal South African regime.\n141.\tWe also support the calls made by the Security Council and the Assembly to Portugal to recognize the right of the people in the Portuguese African Territories to self-determination and independence. There is no other solution, and in the end that will be the solution. Much misery-not alone for the Africans in those Territories but also for the Portuguese in Africa and at home \u2014 could be spared if that reality were to be recognized by the Portuguese Government, which in its present policy is doing an injustice to its people, to their traditions and to their past contributions to human knowledge and culture. The tragedy of this residual colonial situation has been deepened recently by the disturbing reports of massacres in Mozambique, which have not yet been the subject of an independent investigation.\n142.\tThe problems of the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America owe a good deal to past colonialism, but by no means all their problems can fairly be attributed to that cause. In addition to past exploitation, there are also deep underlying causes of poverty in many of those countries which cannot be solved in the foreseeable future without generous recognition by the better-off States of the world of their obligation to share their wealth with countries less fortunate.\n143.\tMy country shares with other developed countries this duty and obligation of aiding our economically less fortunate neighbours in the world community. It is a duty which our membership in the United Nations has brought clearly to our attention. It is a duty and obligation which Ireland has accepted in principle but one where to date our performance does not match our duty. In the past our performance operated on an unplanned basis. My Government accepts that there is a need for real and substantial improvement in Ireland's aid to developing countries. In the current year our official financial transfers to developing countries have been doubled. The intention of my Government is to increase thereafter the annual level of this assistance in absolute terms and as a percentage of our gross national product in a planned manner over a period of years. We are developing a comprehensive and coherent programme which will show a balanced growth in its various sectors and will be designed to achieve the greatest benefit for developing countries. That will still not immediately match the generous acceptance of this obligation by some other developed countries, but it is an indication of our will to meet our United Nations obligations in this essential work.\n144.\tIn what I have said here today I have hitherto concentrated on problems which concern our Organization outside the field of peace-building, the settlement of disputes and detente. This is not because I underestimate the importance of seeking a de-escalation of tensions between States in many parts of the world; indeed, unless such relations are improved and peace preserved none of the other matters of which I have spoken will have much relevance. But we must face the fact that it is in this area of activity that world public opinion has expected more from the United Nations than it could possibly perform and where at the same time the Organization has at times performed less well than might have been expected even by realistic and reasonable people. This disparity between expectations and performance has damaged the credibility of our Organization, and I have no wish to aggravate this problem by highlighting the unresolved problems that remain in\n, relations between States. But I think it is right to remark that there is a measure of detente since at last the futility of the cold war and its sterile polemics is recognized. The major Powers do seem to be moving, however slowly, towards a measure of accommodation with each other, although the balance thus created is not yet stable since the world has yet to learn to cope with the more complex interactions between Powers and blocs in this new situation.\n145.\tThe most explosive situation remains that of the Middle East. We regret that its solution does not seem to have been brought any nearer, though we realize how grave are the problems involved end the difficulties facing diplomacy. We welcomed the visit of the Secretary-General to the countries of the Middle East, under the aegis of the Security Council. We can but hope that that visit may result in some initiatives which might break the present deadlock and help the process of diplomacy in securing peace between the parties, in finding a peaceful solution to their problems based on acceptance by all countries concerned of Security Council resolution 242(1967). In the meantime the major Powers can help towards a solution by adopting a genuinely neutral attitude towards the contending interests\nrather than, as has been the case in the past, aligning themselves with either side, thus converting this tragically divided region into a mini-cockpit of the cold war. They could also help by agreeing amongst themselves to refrain from arming the two sides in a manner that can only make a recurrence of violence more likely and more bloody if it occurs. The intransigence of the parties to this dispute has in the past been intensified rather than eased by the actions of outside States pursuing what they have conceived to be their own interests through involvement with the contending parties. Hopefully, this phase is coming to an end, and with that the chances of peace in the area should be enhanced.\n146.\tBefore concluding, I must refer to the tragic situation in Northern Ireland. The conflict that has torn apart that little community of 1.5 million people, costing almost a thousand lives and injuries to many thousands of others while reducing large areas of its urban centres to rubble, has yet to be resolved, but there are signs that a solution may be found in the months ahead. None dare put it more hopefully than that.\n147.\tThe divisions that have contributed to this tragedy owe much to history. Fear lies at the root of the situation-the fears of the majority in that area that they might against their will be forced to become a minority within an all-Ireland republic and the fears of the minority in Northern Ireland for their future in a situation dominated by a frightened majority. Those two communities in Northern Ireland, locked into a situation of apparently inevitable and endless conflict, differ somewhat in their origins. But unlike, for example, the more deeply divided communities in the island of Cyprus, they speak the same language, English. In the absence of linguistic differences, the most evident distinction between the two communities happens to be one of religion, and it is this that has given the conflict its anachronistic reputation of being a religious war. Differences on points of dogma between Christian denominations have little to do with the conflict between the two communities, however.\n148.\tThe fears of the northern majority are the key to this situation, for it is their actions in response to those fears that pose a threat to the lives and well-being of the minority in Northern Ireland. If those fears, aggravated by the uncertainties and physical distress of the past four years, could be eased, the problem of Northern Ireland would be on the way to solution. My Government has a role to play here. We do not seek to impose or to have imposed on the people of Northern Ireland any solution unacceptable to a majority there.\nJ49. We know that any attempt to impose such a solution could only multiply the bloodshed and the bitterness. It is the people of Ireland we seek to unite; the territory of Ireland is nothing without its people. And this unity of the people of Ireland can be secured only in peace and reconciliation, with the consent of a majority of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland.\n150. The solution now proposed to this terrible problem is one on which broad agreement exists between my Government and that of the United Kingdom. It entails the establishment of a new executive in Northern Ireland, comprising elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, drawn from parties representative of both communities; the reform of the police and civil service in Northern Ireland so that they may be acceptable to the minority community as well as to the majority; and the creation of a Council of Ireland, with equal representation Iat executive level for Northern Ireland-which has half the Republic's population-and functions in relation to economic co-operation between the two parts of Ireland. That Council must have the power to evolve and to undertake new functions, but the pace of any such evolution must be governed by the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. The desire of the minority to identify with the new institutions should be recognized, and also their concern that justice will be fairly administered.\n151.\tWe believe that this policy reconciles the concerns of the majority in Northern Ireland with the legitimate aspirations of the great majority of the Irish people to national unity. It is a policy of reconciliation; it is a policy which we believe we can submit to this Assembly as one in full accord with the principles of the United Nations. And I hope, and I believe, that my Government will enjoy the sympathy and understanding of the States represented here in pursuing such a policy.\n152.\tShould we fail in our efforts, together with the United Kingdom Government, to secure a solution along those lines, the situation could become grave indeed. I hope and pray that we shall not fail, and that I shall not at any time in the future have to come before the General Assembly to seek your assistance in finding a way out of the dangerous and tragic situation that could then arise.\n"

This judicious choice is a tribute paid not only to his country but also to his distinguished qualities and his great experience with international problems.\n231.\tMy congratulations are addressed also to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, of the Polish People's Republic, whose great competence made it possible for us to achieve fruitful results at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n232.\tAs for the Secretary-General, he may be assured at all times of our confidence and our .support in any actions that he may be required to undertake in the interest of the international community. I must add that we have been greatly appreciative of his presence in Addis Ababa for the celebration of the tenth anniversary of OAU. It was considered by. us as evidence of the interest he has in specific problems arising in our continent.\n233.\tThis twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly was marked immediately after its opening by an event of very great importance. I am referring to the admission to our Organization of three new Member States, namely, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of the Niger, I should like to express our great satisfaction at the decision taken by the General Assembly and welcome warmly the representatives of these three countries which have now taken their place as full-fledged Members of the world-wide Organization. We are convinced that their admission will bring to our Organization new energy and greater moral political forces.\n234.\tDuring the year that has elapsed since our last session, other encouraging facts make us optimistic with respect to the future of our international community. First of all, it is always with great satisfaction and even with some relief that we see the great Powers discussing among themselves how to put an end to their differences and to establish a co-operation that will be free from any war-like attitudes.\n235.\tThus, in the Republic of the Niger we have considered the contacts which took place between the United States and the People's Republic of China, on the one hand, and the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on the other, as salient features in modern events. A new positive step was taken on 22 June 1973 through the signing in Washington by President Nixon and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Leonid Brezhnev, of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. In our opinion, this agreement marks the birth of a new era in relations between the two super-Powers.\n236.\tIn the Asian continent the situation is much better than it was a year ago.\\\" Indeed, it is with unanimous relief that the whole world welcomed the agreements signed in\nParis on 27 January 1973, putting an end to the war in VietNam. But the cessation of hostilities does not mean necessarily the establishment of peace. It is more necessary than ever to help the Viet-Namese people to recover from one of the most difficult trials that any country has ever had in its history. More than ever, the international community ought to do everything in its power to accelerate the process of a rapid restoration of peace in this shattered country so as to make its reconstruction possible.\n237.\tThe recent agreement concluded on 28 August between India and Pakistan comes at an opportune time in putting an end finally to a situation which earlier kept enveloping the subcontinent in flames.\n238.\tMoreover, the talks that have been in progress for nearly two years between the two Koreas with a view to their reunification lead us to believe that there again ground for agreement is always possible. The Niger, faithful to its policy of dialogue and harmony, is bound to encourage all efforts undertaken to promote the self-determination of peoples in accordance with the Charter in an atmosphere of serenity and independence. The Niger therefore will give its firm support to the efforts made by these two parts of Korea with a view to a peaceful settlement of their differences.\n239.\tBut if there is reason for hope in Viet-Nam, in India, in Pakistan, in Korea and in Laos, we are bound to recognize that this is not the case in the other part of the Indo-Chinese peninsula \u2014 Cambodia. For more than three years this country has been unjustly enduring the atrocities of a devastating and deadly war imposed by foreign forces.\n240.\tThis is for us an opportunity to make a solemn appeal to all the sources of goodwill, to the great Powers in particular, to refrain from certain types of interventions that are not in conformity with the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter, but which are directed against weaker countries, interventions which can have no other result but to aggravate their state of under-development.\n241.\tWith regard to Europe, our country is gratified at the establishment of a climate of detente between East and West. We are following with keen interest the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We hope that it will show tangible results and that this will inevitably have as its consequence the establishment of a better climate of peace in this part of the world.\n242.\tBut what are we to say of the preoccupying situation in the Middle East? In spite of the mediation of Mr. Gunnar Jarring, in spite of the various resolutions of the Security Council, in spite of all manner of steps undertaken in various parts of the world, there is still not the slightest ray of hope. This impasse is due to the intransigence of Israel and to its obstinate refusal to apply Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which calls upon it to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.\n243.\tMoreover, if we are to judge by certain inhuman acts, in particular the destruction of the Libyan airliner which resulted in more than 100 innocent victims, and the hijacking of a Lebanese airliner, we are led to believe that Israel takes pleasure in adopting an aggressive attitude. That is why the Niger, imbued with a spirit of equity and\ndesirous not to maintain relations with a country which is not seeking peace and which is violating deliberately the principles of our Charter, has decided to break its diplomatic relations with Israel. The Niger, as President Diori Hamani stated, \\\"condemns all actions whose purpose is occupation or annexation of all or part of the territory of a sovereign State\\\". Moreover, it is clear that the restoration of peace can be effective in the Middle East only through the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n244.\tThe behaviour of certain Governments of southern Africa is scarcely different from that of Israel. Most recently, at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Algiers, in speaking of the tragic situation which is prevailing in this region, President Diori Hamani stated in particular:\n\\\"The wounds in the side of our continent, in Angola, in Mozambique, in Southern Rhodesia, in Namibia, in South Africa and in Guinea-Bissau are there to remind us at all times of the indescribable suffering endured daily by the African populations of these regions. The violent and criminal attacks committed by Portugal and its unquestioned allies in Rhodesia and South Africa against certain independent African States, the mass murders of innocent populations of the kind we saw perpetrated by the Portuguese colonial troops in Mozambique which the international press echoed, and, finally, the cowardly murder of Amilcar Cabral, this gallant leader of PAIGC8 whom we all esteemed, are so many facts which must incite the countries of the third world and those of Africa in particular to close their ranks even further for a decisive battle against the sworn enemies of our freedom.\n\\\"Our common action must tend towards one and the same goal, which is that of determining the best possible means not only for ensuring rapid decolonization of the African continent, but also for making the international community and the great Powers end their unpardonable inertia. The numerous resolutions voted by the General Assembly as well as by the Security Council and also by the specialized agencies, resolutions which condemn in no uncertain terms the Governments of Pretoria, Salisbury and Lisbon for their ill-considered policies, have remained dead letters and have convinced us extensively and for some considerable time of their inefficiency.\n\\\"The moral prestige of our Organization is thus seriously compromised. It is for us to take stock again, before it is too late, if we wish to prevent the United Nations from suffering the same fate as that of the defunct League of Nations. Unfailing solidarity and an energetic attitude on the part of the peoples of the third world before as crucial a problem as this are bound to wear down the guilt-tarnished inertia of certain great Powers vis-\u00e0-vis the racist and colonialist regimes.\\\"\n245.\tIt is indeed evident that if the great Powers, by placing themselves above certain petty and selfish interests, were to adopt by common agreement a more energetic attitude and were to withdraw their support from those\nscandalous regimes, the latter would be very quickly led to compromise.\n246.\tAfrica, the third world and the international organizations, thus rid of the problems of decolonization, could then embark upon nobler actions: the search for peace in the world, and the economic and social development of the poorer peoples.\n247.\tThat is why we again make a solemn appeal to the great Western Powers to halt their support of those anachronistic regimes so that a solution might be found to these agonizing problems.\n248.\tThe Niger, faithful to its commitment to African peoples that are still under foreign domination, was there to display, through the voice of its President, its solidarity with the brother people of Guinea-Bissau, which has just proclaimed its independence as a republic. The message addressed to Mr. Aristide Pereira on that occasion calls for no comment, and I merely quote it:\n\\\"I am particularly pleased to extend to you the warmest congratulations of the people, party and Government of the Niger on the solemn proclamation of independence as a republic by your great party, PAIGC.\n\\\"The people of the Niger, fully conscious of the historic importance of this event, which sounds the death-knell of Portuguese colonialism in Africa, unreservedly associates itself with the legitimate joy of the brother people of Guinea today.\n\\\"In paying a heartfelt tribute to your gallant fighters, worthy heirs of that brave and ever-lamented son of Africa, Amilcar Cabral, we wish that their fight for freedom may come to a swift and successful conclusion.\n\\\"We assure you of our unfailing support.\n\\\"While awaiting impatiently the opportunity to welcome very soon to the great African family of the Organization of African Unity your nation which has already become the object of pride of the independent African nations, we wish every success to the brother people of Guinea-Bissau, to PAIGC, to President Luis Cabral, and to yourself in the immense task of national reconstruction.\\\"\n(Signed) Diori Hamani,\n249.\tTo mark the defeat of Portuguese colonialism in Africa, our commitment goes beyond that message of support. Indeed, the Government of the Niger, on 22 September, published a communique confirming its recognition of the State of Guinea-Bissau.\n250.\tBy that recognition, it has committed itself to support any action aimed at the admission of Guinea-Bissau as an independent and sovereign State to the United Nations and to all international agencies.\n251.\tIf in political terms, in spite of a few black marks which remain on the scene, there is room for hope, the same does not hold true on the economic level, where the rich are growing richer and the poor are becoming even\npoorer, in spite of the meritorious efforts that they are daily making in the interest of their own survival.\n252.\tIndeed, since the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] in Santiago, Chile, two years have elapsed and we are still very far from the 1 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries which was considered as the minimum indispensable goal.\n253.\tMoreover, all recent statistics, particularly those of the Development Assistance Committee, clearly show that development assistance is falling off dangerously.\n254.\tFor a certain number of years, the countries of the third world have constantly, in all international forums, been calling, but in vain, for a link to be established between special drawing rights and development financing. We will soon have completed the first half of the Second Development Decade, with no indication of any improvement in the situation.\n255.\tThe most pathetic declarations, the most appealing promises by the great Powers, have unfortunately taken the form of excessive use of the right of veto each time they felt their interests to be threatened.\n256.\tAt the fifty-fifth session of the Economic and Social Council, held in Geneva in July and August last, the Director-General of FAO stated that for 20 years grain stocks had never been lower or prices higher.\n257.\tThus it is in these circumstances, dramatic in themselves, that my country, which on the morrow of its independence had set up a system of regional co-operation and of national institutions designed to ensure its economic and social development, was brutally struck, like many neighbouring Sahelian countries, by a climatic phenomenon unprecedented in the annals of its history.\n258.\tThat drought, which has now lasted for more than six years and which reached a devastating level in 1972, has brought about an enormous food deficit to which radio, press and television networks throughout the world have referred.\n259.\tThis enormous deficit has not only engendered famine, but has in its wake bred malnutrition, epidemics and a massive rural exodus towards the urban centres and even towards the neighbouring countries to the south to which nature was kinder.\n260.\tThat drought, by destroying our vast grazing lands, has brought about the loss of 50 to 100 per cent of our livestock, depending on the region, and has resulted in the drying up of most of the wells in the northern part of our country.\n261.\tBut the effect of that natural catastrophe does not stop there.\n262. The drop in agricultural exports, by virtually wiping out our foreign exchange earnings, has also brought a\nconsiderable reduction in capital and consumer goods and will deal a serious blow to our fledgling processing industries which, even under ordinary circumstances, had great difficulty in maintaining a normal growth rate.\n263.\tIn the face of this natural calamity, and to deal with the most urgent problems, my Government has created a solidarity fund supported by the voluntary contributions of our own nationals and of all men of goodwill whatever their origins. This fund has been used, and still serves, for the purchase and transportation of food-stuffs towards our afflicted populations.\n264.\tIf this national effort has been a success, we are pleased to note that international solidarity, for its part, has also turned out not to be a vain expression. Indeed, this international solidarity has been demonstrated in the dispatch of food, medicines and means of transport.\n265.\tThis is an opportunity for me to thank here, publicly, on behalf of the Government and people of the Niger, those friendly countries, governmental and non-governmental organizations, institutions and private individuals who gave generously and in a brotherly way to aid our populations afflicted by disease, hunger and thirst.\n266.\tFor my country, the coming year may well be even worse than the past one. Indeed, in several of our regions, first the rains came too late, and then they stopped in mid August, even before the plants had reached the mid point of their growth cycle.\n267.\tIn the zones where some hopes might have been cherished, this period of premature drought has resulted in the resurgence of grain-destroying caterpillars.\n268.\tMy Government, still in its search for the most efficient solutions, has resorted to modern technology for artificial rain tests.\n269.\tThese tests, while very conclusive, unfortunately were undertaken too late and were thereby unable to have any beneficial effect upon this year's harvest. They have, nevertheless, had the advantage of showing that in the future this science could be one of the keys to our problem.\n270.\tAfter the emergency measures that I have mentioned above, the Government of the Niger considered a long-term programme which is centred on three points essentially: first, water control, including rain water, surface water or ground water, the purpose of which is to make it possible to develop several millions of hectares through irrigation; secondly, reforestation, through which we hope to fight intensively against the spreading desert, which is seriously threatening a good portion of our national territory; thirdly, the restocking of 6ur livestock which, as I said earlier, was very largely decimated. Reconstitution of livestock is vital because the Niger, whose economy is essentially agricultural and pastoral, derives a substantial part of its export earnings from the sale of meat and hides.\n271.\tThis vast undertaking calls for the mobilization of enormous capital and the Niger cannot cope alone. That is why the President of the Republic of the Niger, His Excellency Diori Hamani, had advocated a type of \\\"Marshall Plan for the Great Sahel\\\" which, and I quote him:\n\\\"... should take the form of collateral and even of joint collateral given by Governments and international agencies to a large loan floated on the world, financial market.\n\\\"This formula has shown its worth at other times and in other places, both on small and very large scales. By analogy with the situation of Europe in ruins as it emerged from the war, it may be thought that the elaboration, implementation and success of such a plan are possible and desirable \u2014 possible, given the enormous mass of idle capital throughout the world, reserves of which are being threatened by monetary erosion and inflation.\\\"\n272.\tThe six countries of the Sahel struck by this natural calamity, given the similarity of their problems and the immensity of their needs, have organized themselves into subregions and have set up an interstate committee with its headquarters at Ouagadougou.\n273.\tAt the beginning of September, a conference of experts and ministers of production of the six countries, reporting to the conference of the Heads of State and Government, had given the outline of a short- and long-term programme for which we are asking financing from friendly countries and the international community.\n274.\tThat programme will be brought to the knowledge of our august Assembly by the President of Upper Volta, Mr. Sangoule Lamizana, whom his peers have appointed to perform this task.\n275.\tThe most fervent and most ardent wish of the delegation of the Niger at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is that the third world will finally see the industrialized countries in general and the superPowers in particular using their advanced technology and the power of their gross national product for the establishment of a world economically balanced, politically united and socially fraternal."

        "file_text": "\ufeff89.\tMr. President, I wonder whether I should congratulate you or sympathize with you in the onerous task ahead of you? Although, in electing you President of this session, this august Assembly has shown due recognition of your skilful diplomacy and high appreciation of your deep erudition \u2014 qualities which your country and the United Nations have had the privilege of enjoying in the most altruistic way. But, Mr. President, \\\"uneasy lies the head that wears a crown\\\". I bring you warm and fraternal greetings from my Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the Government and the people of Mauritius.\n90.\tThe outgoing President, Mr. Trepczynski, deserves our thanks and appreciation for his leadership and service during his tenure of office.\n91.\tWe are meeting at a very grave moment in the history of the United Nations, when three Member States which have pledged to abide by the United Nations Charter are at war. We members of the developing world have always dedicated ourselves to the cause of freedom and peace, and in such a spirit we pray and hope that wisdom and peace, justice and equity will soon prevail in the Middle East. It cannot rain all the time.\n92.\tWe warmly welcome the new Member States: the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n93.\tHere I would like to pay a special tribute to my friend and distinguished colleague Comrade Willy Brandt for his perseverance, dedication, conviction and positive approach to a delicate, if not at that time a thorny, situation. All his noble and persistent efforts are now happily crowned with success in bringing about the close association of both Germanys. I am sure that the pages of history will record his far-sighted vision and cool patience since his accession to power and in making his latest hope a reality with an enduring reconciliation.\n94.\tWe are indeed gratified to underline that, in admitting these new States, the United Nations is steadily progressing towards the desired goal of universality. It is only by becoming truly universal that our Organization can fully achieve the aims so clearly defined in the Charter. That is why we sincerely hope that those States which are still outside the United Nations \u2014 by choice, for political or any other reasons \u2014 will be willing to join us in the\n9\nnear future and will not hesitate to take their rightful places in the family of nations.\n95.\tBy the admission of the two German States to the United Nations as sovereign States, we have accepted prevailing realities of today with the concurrence of the two Governments concerned. But we trust that the present ideological differences between the two States will not prove irreconcilable as to render the gap unbridgeable \u2014  for, in our opinion, such differences should not divide, but should allow mutual tolerance to sustain peaceful coexistence.\n96.\tIt is in the same spirit that we view the problems concerning the Korean people. Mauritius maintains friendly relations with both South and North Korea and would support their dual representation in the United Nations, thus paving the way for the creation of favourable conditions for the reunification of the country with the mutual consent of both parties. How rightly can I say here, quoting the words of Saint Francis of Assisi:\n\\\"O Lord, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.\\\"\n97.\tMy country welcomes the agreement reached between India and Pakistan for the peaceful settlement of their neighbourly differences. May we hope that Pakistan and Bangladesh resolve the outstanding issues so as to enable this new sovereign State to become a Member of the United Nations at this session. Bangladesh is a sovereign State, which Mauritius recognized as such as early as February 1972, and it is noted with satisfaction that the majority of Members represented here have given due recognition to this fact. We should encourage India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to continue their efforts, by direct negotiations, to achieve peace and harmony in the region and the cherished universality that we all desire.\n98.\tEver since we joined the United Nations, we have noted that, session after session, Assembly after Assembly, the Organization has considered the same problems under different guises, without apparent positive results, thus causing stagnation. No communion of people can progress if it does not move with the times. The process of decolonization is at a standstill. In southern Africa, millions of people who are looking to us for assistance and help to exercise speedily and peacefully their fundamental rights to self-determination, freedom and independence are forced to resort to armed struggle against their oppressors.\n99.\tI shall deal with the relevant issues later, but let me say here that the basic problems concerning disarmament have not been settled, and hopes that a great number of countries had placed on the Second United Nations Development Decade are now being disappointed.\n100.\tIt follows that more co-ordinated efforts and concerned action are essential, made in a spirit of good faith and brotherly understanding. It is in this respect that I welcome the detente between the great Powers. This reduction of strains and tensions will allow the great Powers to concentrate on the United Nations and cooperate with the whole membership to enable the Organization to achieve the goals laid down in the Charter. So, in commending this detente in so far as it creates an atmosphere conducive to a more effective United Nations, it should not be a mere entente between those concerned for the sake of narrow and selfish interests. We are convinced that this detente in which Mr. Brezhnev, President Nixon, President Pompidou, Mr. Chou En-lai and Herr Willy Brandt have contributed, is certainly not at the expense of the developing countries. On the contrary, I hope it will enable the latter to develop their resources and channel their energies in peace and freedom, without becoming the victims of one super-Power or another. We pray and trust God that, for the sake of mankind, nuclear weapons should never be allowed to be utilized whatever may be the reason.\n101.\tIn our part of the world, decolonization and the elimination of racial discrimination are problems that are not yet resolved. We have on record all the resolutions made in this respect indicating very clearly what action should be taken to tackle those evils effectively. What is lacking therefore is the political will on the part of the great Powers, and here I indict the permanent members of the Security Council; only they can help the Council to take positive action to enforce those resolutions and thus compel South Africa to respect the political and human rights of that country's non-white majority and abandon the evil policy of that system which is not to be named among civilized people: apartheid. This Assembly has declared that apartheid is a crime against humanity. At its last session, the Commission on Human Rights adopted for the consideration of this Assembly a draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [item 53 (b)]. Mauritius, as a multiracial country, abhors racial discrimination and supports this draft convention. We trust that the right-thinking members of this august Assembly will rise up to the occasion. We believe that effective measures to eradicate apartheid will still be needed to give effect to our solemn declarations and other pronouncements concerning apartheid. Let us here remember that the white notes of the piano alone will never give us the symphony we desire if the black ones do not participate too.\n102.\tThe case for effective action is clear, is very clear, as far as Namibia is concerned, in view of the special responsibility of the international community towards the people of that country. The Secretary-General has told us that his contacts and efforts in this direction have not produced the desired results. We concur with him when he says:\n.. it is important that the competent organs of the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, should continue to seek effective approaches in their endeavour to bring about a solution based on the inalienable rights of the Namibian people to self determination, national independence and preservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.\\\" [A/9001/ Add. 1, p.4.]\n103.\tThe United Nations decided to take endorsement action for the first time \u2014 I am referring to the sanctions against Rhodesia \u2014 but the results have not been conclusive. This is a sad reflection on the first positive stand.\nThe fact that some countries can break the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the illegal, unlawful and self-imposed regime of Ian Smith, shows that the United Nations should show more determination in taking endorsement action. This colonial regime in Salisbury should not be allowed to continue to defy world opinion any longer.\n104.\tThe question of disarmament will no doubt constitute one of the most important issues before the Assembly. It is obvious that the prevailing detente has not had any bearing on the attitude of those whose co-operation is needed. Military expenditures are increasing steadily and nuclear tests are still being conducted. We believe that a comprehensive test-ban treaty and general and complete disarmament should be the ultimate goals. It is regrettable that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up by the Assembly at its last session [resolution 2930 (XXVII)\\ has been unable to function. We sincerely hope that it will be possible to find other ways and means of making some headway. It is noted with great interest that the delegation of the Soviet Union has proposed a new item entitled \\\"Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries\\\" for the consideration of the Assembly [A/9191].\n105.\tWe propose, and we pledge ourselves, to support that positive action. In this connexion I should like to refer to the Conference of the International Monetary Fund held last month in Nairobi, at which Robert McNamara, President of the World Bank, laid emphasis on the economic situation of the developing countries and went on to say:\n\\\"Despite a decade of unprecedented increase in the gross national product of the developing countries, the poorest segments of their populations have received relatively little benefit.\\\"\n\\\"Nearly 800 million individuals \u2014 40 per cent, out of a total of 2 billion \u2014 survive on incomes estimated at 30 cents per day in conditions of malnutrition, illiteracy and squalor. They are suffering poverty in the absolute sense. That absolute is no abstraction here.\\\"\n106.\tThe high hopes which the developing countries had placed in the Second Development Decade are fading fast, but we believe that new ones will grow. This session will achieve much if more importance is attached to the economic and social progress of those countries. Is not the time opportune for us to give serious thought to the proposal of the President of Mexico for a charter of economic rights and duties of States?\n107.\tThose are some of the points to which I wanted to refer, but before concluding may I state that my Government welcomes the peace agreement on Viet-Nam.  However, that will not be complete until the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Viet-Nam is allowed to pay its proper role as agreed at the Paris Conference.\nThat alone can bring about \\\"durable peace\\\", to use a phrase of President Nixon, in that part of the world.\n108.\tI reiterate the support of my Government for the liberation movements of Africa, which deserve all our encouragement and praise in their valiant struggle. My Government will give positive effect to the request of President Gowon, as President of the Organization of African Unity, with regard to the recognition of Guinea- Bissau as a sovereign and independent State.\n109.\tMay I say, as I said once before in another international forum, that it is not what we achieve which matters but the efforts we make to achieve it. To quote the words of Browning:\n\\\"This high man, with a great thing to pursue,\nDies ere he knows it.\nThat low man goes on adding one to one,\nHis hundred's soon hit.\\\"\n\n110.\tMr. President, I wholeheartedly trust that where there is war peace will return, and where there is hatred understanding will prevail."

        "file_text": "\ufeff126. From this international rostrum I have the honour of transmitting the message of fraternity and solidarity which His Excellency Colonel Michel Micombero, President of the Republic and Head of the Government of Burundi, addresses on behalf of his people \u2014 struggling to safeguard its independence and the results of its popular revolution of 28 November 1966 \u2014 to the other peoples of the world involved in the same struggle for the triumph of the ideals of peace, security, social justice and for the elimination of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and imperialism in all its forms.\n127.\tIt is also my pleasant duty to extend, on behalf of the Government of Burundi, the warmest and most sincere congratulations to President Leopoldo Benites and to the other officers of the Assembly who have just been elected to bring the work of the twenty-eighth session to a successful conclusion.\n128.\tThe choice of a distinguished diplomat like Mr. Benites, whose personality, confidence and objectivity are so highly esteemed, both in his own country and in the rest of the world, constitutes a sure pledge and an earnest of the success of this session.\n129.\tOn behalf of the active solidarity of our peoples, we know that the struggle for political and economic liberation in Latin America, Asia and Africa is something which Ambassador Benites not only cherishes, but which also constitutes for him j sacred duty.\n130.\tMy delegation will firmly support the initiatives and decisions which he will be called upon to take as President with a view to the attainment of the objectives of our Organization and in order to bring about respect for the principles of our Charter.\n131.\tPermit me to pay a well-deserved tribute to our President's predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski, who conducted our deliberations with brilliant intelligence, unshakeable faith in the Organization and high diplomatic talents. The progressive countries of the world highly esteem the stand of the Polish People's Republic for peace, decolonization and economic and social development, objectives which our outgoing President himself championed during the session and in other circumstances.\n132.\tI have, furthermore, the honour of conveying to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of the United Nations, my sincere congratulations for the record of his activities this year. Once again we should like to express to our distinguished Secretary-General our great admiration for the tact, patience and devotion which he has displayed in the difficult and delicate task of international affairs. We were particularly moved by Mr. Waldheim's efforts this year to bring about the triumph of the ideals of peace and security, and the development of friendly relations among peoples.\n133.\tOn 18 September 1973 [2117th meeting] the United Nations was strengthened by the entry of three new Member States: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. My delegation is gratified at this decision, which is so appropriate for the international community. The principle of universality of our Organization does require, in fact, the representation of the greatest possible number of States so that all peoples can feel involved in the problems of universal peace and the economic and social development of nations, whatever their location or size. That is why we greet with enthusiasm the admission of the three new Members, which, for us, constitutes a new stage on the road towards the emancipation of colonized peoples. We expect from the two German States a major contribution to the solution of problems which are paralysing international society, such as decolonization, underdevelopment, the exploitation of man by man, and the scourge of racism.\n134.\tEvery year most of us travel thousands and thousands of miles to come to this rostrum in order to take stock of the activities and results of our Organization, from both the political and the economic point of view. Our presence will also enable us to gain some insight into the future prospects for the whole of mankind.\n135.\tThe people of Burundi, peace-loving and liberty- loving, warmly greeted the victories won and the successes recorded in recent years by the other peoples of the world that have inflicted resounding defeats on the imperialist and colonialist forces. In Africa independent States have had to face divisive manoeuvres and plots of all kinds hatched by imperialists with a view to the collapse of institutions and even the dislocation of nations. But the progressive forces, supported by the revolutionary forces of the world, have- repulsed victoriously the criminal assaults of these enemies of the human race. Other sovereign States have been the victims of aggression on the part of the Portuguese colonial regimes and the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. Here again these acts of aggression and intimidation have met with the revolutionary determination of worthy and valiant peoples who are always ready to repulse triumphantly the enemy, whatever the aid granted these regimes by the imperialist and neo-colonialist Powers. Neo-colonialist Powers have done everything in their power to oppose sovereign and independent States with the purpose of weakening the anti-imperialist front, but the vigilance and wisdom of Africa have confounded them.\n136.\tThe hour of victory against economic domination and cultural alienation has arrived in other African States which have taken energetic and revolutionary measures to win their independence and safeguard their authentic cultural heritage in spite of threats and blackmail of all kinds.\n137.\tThe trends towards national emancipation have forced the colonialist regimes to decamp from vast territories seized by the national liberation movements at the cost of the blood of the worthy sons and daughters of Africa. The war waged by Israel against the Arab countries and its permanent usurpation of the land of the Palestinian people have aroused the anger and condemnation of all peace-loving and justice-loving peoples. The Arab Republic of Egypt and other Arab countries which have been the victims of imperialist and Zionist aggression have been supported by all revolutionary peoples in their just cause.\n138.\tIn Asia, the peoples of Indo-China are marching inexorably towards final victory. Imperialism at bay shrinks at nothing to shed the blood of innocent people. In spite of the dimensions of the means of destruction used in that part of the world, every day the laurel of victory is held aloft by millions of fighters for freedom and honour.\n139.\tIn Latin America, liberation movements are gaining ground in spite of the heinous and criminal acts of despair, like the event which has just occurred and afflicted the Chilean people. But the blood of President Allende constitutes the revolutionary ferment which is out of the reach of the bullets of the imperialists and their lackeys.\n140.\tThe peace-loving States and peoples of the world are determined today more than ever to wage a decisive struggle, a struggle against hegemony and political, economic and cultural expansionism. However, we consider that this evolution of the international situation should not permit us to cherish any illusions. Real dangers continue to constitute a serious threat to international peace and security, to the independence and sovereignty of States.\n141.\tThe primary objective of the United Nations is the maintenance of peace in the world and the harmonious development of all peoples, and we are forced to note that we are still far from having attained these noble principles and objectives.\n142.\tOf course, for some years now there has existed a climate of entente among the great Powers because of the strengthening and development of their mutual relations. This situation has succeeded in reducing the tensions and dangers of a generalized war. However, in spite of the provisions of the Charter, which prohibit the use of force in international relations, the threat or use of force for aggressive purposes against third-world countries is now assuming alarming proportions. The antagonisms of the super-Powers encourage wars and localized crises in certain parts of the world, thus leading to intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\n143.\tIt seems to me essential for this twenty-eighth session to lay down new bases for international relations founded on justice, security and development.\n144.\tColonialism, neo-colonialism and racism .gravely jeopardize peace and the economic development of the African continent. In Africa, colonialism, neo-colonialism and apartheid constitute a grave threat to peace and the development of the continent. For several years, resolutions have been adopted in favour of the liberation of the whole of Africa. Today, with the complicity of those very people who take those decisions, the situation has not developed in favour of liberty. On the contrary, it has deteriorated every day.\n145.\tIn South Africa, an oppressive regime is being inflicted upon the population with the full knowledge of the Members of this Organization, upon millions of human beings who are kept in the chains of slavery on the pretext that they are what are called men of colour. These barbarous crimes are encouraged by Powers which themselves only recently suffered from the scourge of mankind,\n,, namely, racism and apartheid. Have certain founding Members of our Organization already forgotten that it was to fight effectively against such scourges that the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco? Far from applying the resolutions adopted against the Pretoria regime, certain Powers encourage that regime by all available means in its horrible policy of escalation designed to achieve the moral and physical exhaustion of a helpless people. The regime of racial discrimination and apartheid has just increased its toll of victims by the massacre of African workers, which include a large number of African nationals from independent neighbouring countries. Provocations against what are called coloured men by the Pretoria regime are not even limited to the freedom fighters; the weapons of this reactionary police State cut down anyone and everyone at the whim of the South African leaders of the moment. This enslavement is supported by the NATO Powers and Israel.\n146.\tIn Namibia, while the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] had authorized the establishment of contacts in order to ascertain South African intentions, Pretoria showed by its most categorical refusal that it had no intention of withdrawing from\nNamibia. On the contrary, the racist Government has just undertaken a programme which it calls \\\"Bantustanization\\\", which constitutes a programme for the Balkanization of the Territory and for pitting Namibian against Namibian.\n147.\tThe policy of the fragmentation of Namibian territory pursued by Pretoria is tangible proof that South Africa is not ready to withdraw from international territory, but rather that Pretoria in fact wishes to extend apartheid there in its most criminal form.\n148.\tThe good faith of OAU and the United Nations did not win a favourable response from the Pretoria Government, and that is why the summit meeting of African countries held to celebrate the tenth anniversary of OAU considered that the mandate entrusted to the Secretary- General of the United Nations should be suspended because it was fruitless.\n149.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Burundi condemns once again the savage colonialism which South Africa inflicts on Namibia and the black people of South Africa. It is high time, indeed, for the Namibian people to be consulted about their own fate. The integrity and independence of the Namibian territory should be safeguarded.\n150.\tIn Zimbabwe, after almost eight years, the rebel regime of Salisbury is defying the United Nations. Indeed, in spite of the many resolutions condemning Rhodesia, in spite of Security Council resolution 253(1968) imposing economic sanctions, the racist regime of Salisbury is still in power. This situation might have changed if the United Kingdom had had good faith and if certain countries had not violated the economic embargo decided upon by the United Nations. In these circumstances, my Government requests once again that the United Kingdom should use all the means available to it, including armed force, to grant independence to the Zimbabwe people and to put an end to the rebel regime of Salisbury.\n151.\tMy Government would venture also to remind the Member States in this Assembly that countries which deliberately violate resolutions of the Security Council and the recommendations of the General Assembly are in contravention of their commitments under the United Nations Charter.\n152.\tWhat is worse, the encouraged arrogance of the . Rhodesian rebels has prompted the regime to use economic\nwarfare against Zambia, which has done nothing wrong except to be governed by Africans whose attachment to democracy and the fraternization of races is offensive to the Fascists in Salisbury.\n153.\tAll peace-loving countries, confident in the United Nations and in OAU, are behind the Government of Zambia in its valiant and noble struggle for the triumph of the objectives of peace based on the liberation of Zimbabwe.\n154.\tIn Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau the revolutionary liberation is irreversible. The blind obstinacy of Portugal has led it to perpetuate its outrageous exploitation of African territories. The arrogant and reactionary ideas of the Lisbon authorities are a disgrace to that country, which boasts of having stifled-unsuccessfully, fortunately \u2014 the\nupsurge of emancipation of the colonized peoples. It is running against the current of history still to dream of a colonial empire when independence and sovereignty have now become the inalienable rights of peoples.\n155.\tPortugal cherishes illusions by persisting in defying the recommendations of the United Nations and failing to heed the appeals of faith and goodwill which call upon it to put an end to its horrible colonial practices. The Lisbon Government is aware of the important defeats that have been meted out to it at the hand of the liberation movements. Thanks to the support of certain Powers, it believes it will stand fast for a long time to come. It should be disabused, because a people determined to win its liberty shrinks before no might or force.\n156.\tThus the fighting people of Guinea-Bissau have just proclaimed their independence. My delegation is happy to announce to this Assembly that the Government of Burundi recognized the Government of the democratic Republic of Guinea-Bissau from the very first days of its existence and will do everything in its power to support it. We would convey to the young State of Guinea-Bissau our most fraternal congratulations upon the memorable event of its liberation from the forces of colonial oppression. We now consider that the presence in Guinea-Bissau of a single Portuguese soldier constitutes an act of aggression against an independent and sovereign State. I take the opportunity offered by that well-deserved independence to pay a tribute to the promoter of the Guinean revolution, Amilcar Cabral, Secretary-General of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde, the eternal hero of the struggle for the freedom and dignity of man.\n157.\tIn the light of the recent crimes committed in the regions under Portuguese domination, the Republic of Burundi once again calls upon the General Assembly to expel Portugal from the United Nations, because the grave crimes committed by Portugal against the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau are a serious threat to peace and human dignity. Portuguese colonialism is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter.\n158.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains tense and explosive because Israel continues to oppress and humiliate the Arabs under its control and is persisting in its blind and pointless policy of provocation and aggression towards the Arab countries of the region.\n159.\tUntil very recently my country still cherished the hope that it would see Israel come to reason by committing itself \u2014 as international opinion has ceaselessly called upon it to do, and as its own interests require-to a just, equitable and lasting solution of the problem that is almost as old as our Organization.\n160.\tBut we are forced to note that Israel remains a factor for instability in the region, which it is impossible to eliminate, and Israel is doing everything in its power to oppose any attempt, whatever the source, to re-establish peace and security in the region. It has opposed with blind obstinacy the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), the unanimous adoption of which was welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the States Members of our Organization as a decisive step towards a normalization of the situation in that troubled part of our planet. On the strength of unconditional support from a super-Power, it has ceaselessly derided and disregarded the wise and pressing appeals of the international community to reconsider its attitude towards the martyred people of Palestine and neighbouring Arab countries by guaranteeing the right of the Palestinians to a worthy and decent existence and by respecting the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of its Arab neighbours.\t' .\n161.\tBut, what is worse, the world is witnessing for the first time the implementation and systematic use at the State level of piracy and terrorism as a method of government and as a norm of behaviour in international relations.\n162.\tThe innocent victims of the shooting down of a Libyan civil aircraft over occupied Sinai are there to remind us that Israeli terrorism now no longer spares anyone, even innocent passengers ignorant of all the facts of the Middle East.\n163.\tEverything is happening as if Israel were assuming that the patience of the international community is unlimited and that it has been given a blank cheque to persist in its policy of escalation of terror, violence, hate and murder.\n164.\tThe tragedy of the Middle East in general and the Palestinian people in particular deserves particular attention.\n165.\tDo we really need to remind the Assembly that the restoration to the people of Palestine of international rights constitutes the fundamental condition for the establishment of a lasting peace in the region? The struggle of the people of Palestine for its usurped territory represents the effort of a people determined to recover its self-determination and sovereignty.\n166.\tThe Member States of our international Organization should offer material and political assistance to the Palestinian people in accordance with the spirit of solidarity which should characterize Member States whenever imperialism, colonialism or neo-colonialism seeks to wound the dignity of a State and to call its existence into question.\n167.\tThat is why my delegation considers the time has come for the members of this Assembly individually or collectively to take the measures necessary to make Israel respect the international commitments it undertook in freely adhering to our Charter. For its part, the Republic of Burundi will interpret its responsibilities in that sense until Israel ceases its acts of aggression and expansionism and until the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine are restored.\n168.\tThanks to its unshakeable courage, its high sense of dignity and its fierce determination to fight for the safeguarding and strengthening of liberty, progress and independence, the valiant people of Viet-Nam has driven its enemies to capitulation.\n169.\tThe signing of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam without any doubt constitutes a brilliant victory for the\nViet-Namese people over the forces of occupation and aggression which for 12 years have unleashed their forces in successive waves over that part of Indo-China. We are particularly gratified at that happy event because my country has ceaselessly condemned the unjust, cruel, absurd and cowardly war inflicted upon the Viet-Namese people. The struggle of the Viet-Namese people proves eloquently and poignantly that the threat of violence, recourse to brutal and massive force, blackmail and intimidation avail nothing against a people which is proud and determined.\n170.\tWe call upon the imperialist and reactionary forces of this world to reflect on that example of heroism and sacrifice.\n171.\tMy delegation calls upon all parties to the Paris agreements to abide scrupulously by the spirit and letter of those agreements, as does the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. Viet-Nam, which for 28 years has known nothing but the horrors of war, will now be able to devote its time, its energies and its enthusiasm to the tasks of national reconstruction for the welfare and prosperity of its people.\nc\n172.\tThe news of the opening of dialogue between the two Koreas has filled us with joy and hope.\n173.\tThe free determination of peoples is a sacred principle of our Charter. Therefore, the United Nations should refrain from any act or initiative which might constitute an obstacle to the reunification of the Korean people.\n174.\tFor that reason, to permit the Korean people to decide freely on its fate and future, free from interference and outside pressure, my delegation considers that the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved without further delay and that all foreign occupation troops should evacuate Korean territory. The United Nations flag cannot cover acts of aggression in any part of the world.\n175.\tAt a time when the two Koreas are embarking on the road to reunification and renewal of ties, it seems to us that the idea of the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations constitutes a plot against the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people.\n176.\tThe situation in the Kingdom of Cambodia is very familiar to us. There, a legitimate and popular Government was overthrown by an imperialist Power, which everyone knows acted through Cambodian puppets. In order to give a respite to the clique of corrupt and suborned elements who usurped power at Phnom Penh, foreign troops of occupation have been landed in Cambodia and have imposed an atrocious, cruel and ruthless war on the peaceful people of that country. Cambodian patriots, in response to the appeal of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of 23 March 1970, did not hesitate a moment before launching the decisive offensive against the Cambodian traitors and foreign forces of aggression. Today, the United National Front of Cambodia and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia control more than nine-tenths of the population of the country and more than nine-tenths of Cambodian territory.\n177.\tIt is the duty of the international community to do everything in its power to see to it that Cambodia becomes once again the oasis of peace that it has always been, thanks to the wise, skilful and far-sighted policy of its illustrious Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\n178.\tIn Cambodia the restoration of peace requires, as one of its pre-conditions, the immediate withdrawal of all aggressive and occupying troops, the end of foreign intervention and strict respect for the right of the Cambodian people to self-determination.\n179.\tThe United Nations, for its part, should draw the logical inferences from the situation in Cambodia and also from the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September last [see A/9330 and Corr.l].\n180.\tSince the Government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk controls nine-tenths of Cambodian territory and the vast majority of the people of that country, and since the non-aligned countries represent two-thirds of the Members of our Organization and recognize Prince Sihanouk's Government as the legal and legitimate Government of Cambodia, the present session of the General Assembly should restore to the Government headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk its legitimate rights in the United Nations.\n181.\tIf the objectives and purposes of the Organization are still valid and relevant, the revision of the Charter becomes an urgent matter if we are to take account of new realities and developments in the international situation.\n182.\tThe right of veto, which has been accorded to five Members of the United Nations, has been used by some of them to block progress, peace and the emancipation of peoples. Without going too far back into the history of our Organization, I would simply remind the Assembly of the veto cast by the United Kingdom in February 1972 at the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa in opposition to the solution of the Rhodesian problem by constitutional and peaceful means. I would also recall the different vetoes used by the other Powers in order to oppose any attempt to break the present deadlock in the Middle East crisis.\n183.\tThe veto, besides being a flagrant violation of the principle of the equality of States, constitutes a means of keeping whole peoples and regions in a state of humiliation, injustice, oppression and agony. It should therefore be abolished because its abuse is contrary to the spirit and objectives of the Charter.\n184.\tBut, apart from the veto, the actual membership of the Council, in my delegation's view, constitutes a shocking anachronism. It is absolutely unjustifiable to entrust the tasks of peace-keeping only to the great Powers most of which, modern history shows, have been and still are involved in the conflicts and crises which have shaken our planet. We must act in accordance with the evidence: you cannot be judge and party at the same time.\n185.\tUntil the General Assembly really becomes a world parliament and has effective and increased power in the maintenance of international peace and security, we think the Security Council should be composed in such a way as to be a faithful reflection of the international community, taking strict account of geographical distribution and trends of opinion and political tendencies in the General Assembly.\n186.\tIt is only then and then alone that all the peoples of the world, duly and democratically associated in the conduct of world affairs, will be able to enjoy the benefits of peace and international security.\n187.\tMy country has no claim to possess nuclear weapons, but it has no less interest therefore in the problems of disarmament. To avoid the temptations of a large-scale war which would profit no one, the General Assembly should demand the elimination of all existing nuclear stockpiles in the world and the banning of all tests of nuclear and chemical weapons. A world conference should replace the present Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, so that the fundamental problems of disarmament should no longer be discussed outside the framework of the United Nations.\n188.\tWithin the same context, the military alliances born of the last war, which fall within the framework of the cold war, should be dissolved. Similarly, the dismantling of all military bases is a necessity, as is the withdrawal of foreign troops from all parts of the world, because we do not recognize the right of any State to appoint itself an international policeman.\n189.\tThe threat of nuclear war should be removed by the destruction of accumulated stockpiles and by a permanent ban on such stockpiles.\n190.\tThe arms race, the stockpiling and the accumulation of war material is liable to provoke such panic among those Powers which do not possess nuclear weapons that, in order to break the monopoly, additional nuclear Powers are going to emerge, a phenomenon which will lead to a permanent state of escalation and the multiplication of hotbeds of terror. The money which will be swallowed up in such rivalry will serve only to satisfy the vanity of the great Powers.\n191.\tWe firmly believe that the enormous sums of money spent on armaments could serve the highly humanitarian cause, namely, the improvement of the standard of living of all peoples and particularly the economic and social development of the third world. The Republic of Burundi is convinced that the contribution to development which could be mad? by nuclear technology used for peaceful purposes will be most useful, while the resources released by disarmament could be used to improve standards of living, to intensify the struggle against under-development, and to narrow the economic gap for the benefit of all peoples rich and poor. Without claiming to possess the monopoly of truth, we can declare, without risk of error, that there does exist a real cause-and-effect relationship between disarmament and development. The disarmament equation, the equation that disarmament equals development, has become a truth which requires no proof.\n192.\tDespite certain hotbeds of tension which threaten world peace, there exists for the time being a new political climate of detente among the great Powers. This new climate will perhaps make it possible for us to deal with greater lucidity with the problems posed by poverty, hunger and ignorance. We must, if we wish to safeguard universal peace, narrow the gap separating the rich and poor countries, a gap which for the time being is constantly on the increase- The developed countries should do more to avoid the crises which dangerously disturb international trade relations.\n193.\tIf, for two years, the United Nations has had to stress forcefully that the economic development of the world has to be planned by an appropriate strategy, it intended by this to remedy the errors of the First United Nations Development Decade and accelerate the upsurge of the poor countries over the years and in this way. to harmonize the equilibrium of our planet. This Strategy requires that the rich make certain sacrifices by using a part of their wealth to assist the developing countries to emerge from their uncomfortable economic position.\n194.\tWe are obliged to note that over the last two years the Second United Nations Development Decade has brought with it more disappointment than progress. Indeed, the donor countries for the most part continue to get poorer, while the rich countries become more and more prosperous. Furthermore, the rich countries continue to disregard the lot of the poor countries and their survival, since world trade is developing more and more to the advantage of the industries of the consumer society.\n195.\tThe present economic evolution of the world must change its course if we are in the future to ensure world economic equilibrium, the harmony of our relationships and, consequently, universal peace.\n196.\tThe failures of the first two years of the Decade have been accentuated by the world monetary crisis which has beset the Western currencies, has disorganized their exchange relations and is weakening the impact of our own reserves. Frequent periods of inflation and the unilateral measures taken by the rich countries to deal with them have affected and continue to disorganize the economies of the weak countries, although they bear no part of the responsibility for these crises. Hence, a feeling of frustration, mixed with indignation, has obliged us to ask the rich countries to control their economies and to institute machinery capable of preventing these monetary crises which have today become only too frequent. While urgent and concrete measures should be taken to reorganize the Western currency system, we think it essential that a new world monetary system should replace the existing one, because it is no longer in keeping with the interests of our planet.\n197.\tThe Burundi delegation is convinced that to have a monetary system which would safeguard the interests of the partners we can no longer confine ourselves to observing passively the changes worked out by the Club of Ten. All interested countries, small or great, rich or poor, should be not only consulted but associated intimately with the creation of a new world monetary order.\n198.\tThe international economic balance cannot be restored simply by a monetary diagnosis. It requires that other parameters be used. We are prompted, therefore, to express the wish that a healthier commercial co-operation be established in our trade.\n199.\tThe developing countries have so far been constantly suffering from a deterioration in the terms of trade. Primary products are often subject to quotas and are seldom fairly priced. The present system must change in favour of the poor countries. We hope that the major negotiations which are soon to begin will remove all the obstacles to the intensification of trade between rich and poor countries. We must establish a new system, which will open up new markets to the products of the under- industrialized countries, provide just and fair remuneration for primary products and allow healthy trade co-operation. It is in the field of trade that the developed countries can underpin the efforts of developing countries in dignity and reciprocity by a system permitting all parties to participate equally in the harmonious development of the world economy, and, in particular, the economy of the third world, so that everyone will be able to enjoy fully the fruits of his fairly remunerated efforts.\n200.\tMy delegation considers that, in order to accelerate the economic development of the poor countries, the United Nations should direct the policy of international financing organs towards respect for the strategy which it has outlined. The World Bank and its group of institutions should adopt a more flexible approach to the plans presented by the poor countries, particularly the least advanced.\n201.\tBut unfortunately we have had to witness political criteria affecting the financing of third-world plans. My delegation, therefore, unreservedly condemns that conduct on the part of international financial organs. Such an attitude constitutes intervention in the internal affairs of a nation.\n202.\tWe feel, similarly, that the criterion of profitability should be interpreted with generosity and that account should be taken particularly of the level of economic development of the recipient countries. Otherwise', the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade could be seriously jeopardized.\n203.\tCertain Governments have raised their voices in this Assembly to denounce the sinister activities of multinational companies and their bad effect on the development of their economies. We share the same concern with regard to these companies which, with the complicity of certain major Powers, have been preventing the developing countries from the exercise of their sovereignty over their own resources.\n204.\tSolutions should be adopted to permit the third- world countries to dispose fully of their own resources and freely to decide the lines of their own economic and social development.\n205.\tAmong the developing countries there is a group of 25 which have been classified as the least advanced countries on our planet. Urgent appeals have been made at meetings of international organizations to accord them privileged treatment in the provision of capital and in trade relations. But those appeals have gone unheeded. Today they are still the most underprivileged. That is a situation which, if solutions are not found, is liable to create even more serious cleavages in levels of development.\n206.\tTo help these countries emerge from their present situation, some measures should be contemplated and put into practice. The more advanced countries, in the name of universal solidarity, should help the least advanced by lifting non-tariff barriers, eliminating quota restrictions and reducing freight costs. Those measures should be taken for the land-locked countries also, particularly because most of them are also among the least advanced countries.\n207.\tAt a time when the General Assembly is meeting, a distressing situation still prevails in part of our globe. The Sahelian region has been afflicted by drought, as members are all aware. The peoples of that region continue to suffer from the effects of this natural disaster. In order to normalize the situation and to erase the painful traces of this drought, years of tireless effort will be required. Let us hope that universal solidarity will contribute even more by assisting the Governments of these regions to hasten their return to normality.\n208.\tThe search for peace, the elimination of injustice and shameless exploitation among States are without any doubt among the most important and most powerful factors in the promotion of the prosperity and progress of mankind. To succeed in this noble task which the United Nations has assumed, all the nations of the world will have to agree resolutely to march hand in hand to achieve great victories against these scourges of mankind.\n209.\tIt is in that spirit of solidarity that I express hopes for the success of this session and for the well-being and prosperity of mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff37.\tI should like first to express our warmest congratulations to Ambassador Leopoldo Benites on the occasion of his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I am certain that the outstanding personal qualities of Ambassador Benites as scholar, journalist and diplomat, which we have known and appreciated very closely, his long experience in the service of our Organization and his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations will ensure the success of our deliberations and decisions. This is the seventh time that this high office has been assumed by the Latin American countries, with which Turkey has excellent and most cordial relations.\n38.\tI wish also to express my appreciation to our outgoing President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, for the excellent work he did throughout his tenure of office.\n39.\tEqually, it is with distinct pleasure that I wish to pay here a warm tribute to my good friend Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for his unceasing efforts for the promotion of peace, concord, co-operation and security in these challenging and fast-changing times.\n40.\tAnother source of satisfaction for us is to see the growing membership of our Organization. Therefore, I join my colleagues who preceded me at this rostrum in welcoming the representatives of the three new Member States-the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas \u2014 with all our good wishes. There is no doubt that with each addition to its membership our world Organization approaches a step further towards its goal of universality. We hope that this process will continue in the future.\n41.\tIn my rather long years of association with the United Nations I have had the privilege a great number of times of taking this rostrum to expound our views on the state of affairs prevailing in our ever-shrinking planet, and I expressed our fervent hope that forthcoming developments would fall in line with the aspirations and expectations of mankind as a whole. In my addresses I have always tried to be as objective as ii was possible for a responsible representative of a country, both in the choice of subjects I touched upon and in my evaluations and analyses in so doing. Among the problems which I took up there were a few of such long duration that I have had to come back to them time and again, year after year; there were also those which were serious enough to warrant urgent and close examination, but which proved to be more manageable with the passage of time; and lastly, and most happily, events about which elation had to be voiced were not non-existent.\n42.\tIn so far as the present situation in the world as a whole is concerned, it would be over-optimistic, if not too naive, to say that the over-all pattern has undergone a very fundamental change compared to previous years. We still have a checkered one, complete with problems of all kinds\n43.\tI arrive at this conclusion proceeding from the logical rule which demands that a bottle be called half-empty or half-full according to the gradual decrease or increase of its contents. In other words, nothing being static, everything being subject to constant change in one direction or another, the main yardstick with which to appreciate a given situation ought to be the development which has led to it and the trend which it represents.\n44.\tLooking at our world of today from that angle, I would submit that we can detect, through conflicting elements, an unmistakable and continuous trend of progress for the better. It is this indeed too slow and too erratic but nevertheless new trend that makes me feel rather optimistic despite all the caution which the vicissitudes in international relations of the post-war decades teach us.\n45.\tIn point of fact, let us cast a cursory look at the developments that have taken place since the last session of our Assembly. Since their history is too recent for a clear judgement of their respective importance, let us consider these developments on a geographical basis, heading from the East towards the West.\n46.\tIn the Far East, the happiest event is no doubt the agreement reached in the Viet-Nam conflict. That long- drawn-out armed confrontation harmed all the participants and caused great human suffering. Now that it is over, we hope that the atmosphere of reconciliation which has been created by the Viet-Namese cease-fire will spread to the other neighbouring countries and that the whole region will soon have peace, calm and stability.\n47.\tSome more good news has come to us from the Asian subcontinent: the repatriation of thousands of prisoners of war held in captivity since 1971 is at last on the way to realization. The subcontinent is one of the birthplaces of civilization. With its population reaching the hundreds of millions, with its great natural resources and with its time-tested wisdom, the nations of the subcontinent are destined to have a promising future. Our wish is that this event may mark the beginning of a new era in which all remaining points of dissension can be eliminated and the foundations of a lasting co-operation with full respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and equality of all can be laid down.\n48.\tAgreements in Viet-Nam and in the subcontinent show, us that, given goodwill and perseverance, no conflict is too hard ,or too complicated to defy peaceful and honourable solution.\n49.\tComing to Europe, we again have cause for hope. As might be guessed, I am alluding mainly to the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This Conference, which was held with the' participation of 32 European countries plus the United States and Canada, has already completed its first stage successfully, and its second one is on the way. Moreover, preparatory work for the conference on mutual force reductions in Central Europe is now completed, and the conference itself is expected to start at its appointed time and place. Although it is too soon to express a firm opinion, we can already say that it will constitute a landmark in the examination of security problems.\n50.\tIn this context, I wish to underline the fact that security in the world in general, and in Europe in particular, is based on a very delicate balance. Therefore, in this process all our efforts should converge towards strengthening and stabilizing security, and not diminishing it for one or another country or group of countries.\n51.\tOf all the remnants of the Second World War, the German question proved to be perhaps the hardest one to solve. We are happy that a formula has been reached and that we can greet in our midst both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the attainment of this result, the efforts deployed by all parties are of course worthy of praise; but we can, in all equity, single out the courageous and realistic policies pursued by the present distinguished leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n52.\tI shall repeat what I said a few minutes ago, namely, that even the most arduous difficulties can be overcome when goodwill and mutual understanding prevail. It is precisely because we have this observation in mind that we do not fall into undue pessimism as regards the Cyprus question-a question which is of paramount importance for both the Turkish nation as a whole and the Turkish community on the island. Although we view with deep concern some developments that are taking place on the Greek Cypriot side, we still hope that the enlarged intercommunal talks which are being held between the representatives of the two communities with the participation of experts on constitutional law from Greece and Turkey and the Special Representative of the Secretary- General will yield results acceptable to all interested parties and defuse once and for all a potentially explosive situation.\n53.\tWe have always favoured a peaceful and lasting solution for the Cyprus question-one which would safeguard the partnership status of the two communities in the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of that bicommunal State and which would be based on local autonomy, in accordance with the justified aspiration of the Turkish population of the island. Here I would like again to express our appreciation to all those Governments which are contributing to the peace-keeping activities in Cyprus, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus.\n54.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers, which more than 70 countries attended, has once more demonstrated the importance of the role the third world can play in international relations. We believe that the conclusions of that Conference will give impetus and add a new dimension to the prospects for peace and development.\n55.\tSo much for the relatively bright side of the present- day world scene. As for the darker sides, they are numerous.\n56.\tFirst of all, the phenomenon which has come to be known as the arms race and which is not only the reflection of the uneasiness and insecurity felt by all nations but also, in its turn, one of the reasons for that same uneasiness and insecurity, goes on unchecked and unabated. In spite of the favourable atmosphere created by the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for new endeavours in the field of disarmament, no relaxation is observed in the upward swing of arms production. It is really sad that on this tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban Treaty2 both the quality and the quantity of nuclear as well as conventional weapons should be constantly progressing, swallowing up huge amounts of riches and energy most needed for the betterment of- the human condition, and forcing mankind to live under the threat of unprecedented disaster.\n57.\tIf this most serious problem is not tackled courageously and realistically, and if, as a beginning at least, a partial solution cannot be arrived at, arrangements to be achieved in the political field alone are bound to be rootless, and the climate of detente to be created will accordingly be fragile.\n58.\tA no less dark image seen in the international kaleidoscope is indeed the survival of that most heinous practice called colonialism. Colonialism, as implemented nowadays, is rooted in slavery and bases itself on man's exploitation by man. Therefore, it cannot be justified by any measure of historical distortion. In this year of 1973, when we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and when the United Nations counts among its Members scores of former colonial countries, ' the most lenient judgement to be passed on the fact that some 28 million people continue to live under the colonial yoke and still others suffer from racial discrimination is that this clearly denotes a mentality cruelly behind the times. The Republic of Turkey, which emerged from a struggle for liberation, will always be on the side of those who fight for their independence and freedom.\n59.\tIt is a good omen for the future that efforts in the international field against colonialism never cease to be deployed, as witness the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in southern Africa, held at Oslo in April 1973, sponsored jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.\n60.\tHowever, another source of deep anxiety in the present world panorama is the continuation of the Middle East question, with no solution in sight as yet. This unhappy and stagnant situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" should not be viewed only in the light of its negative effects on the search for a solution, but should also be considered carefully, as it carries in itself the seeds of violence and thus maintains its highly explosive character. It must be recalled that peace means a lot more than a negative definition, such as the lack of war suggests.\n61.\tIt must equally be recalled that no amount of rhetoric should be able to supply with a cloak of legitimacy any attempt at gaining territory or political prestige by the use of force or by means of forcible faits accomplis, on the one hand, and the delaying of the evacuation of territories thus gained, on the other. We believe that the world community is in duty bound to do whatever it can in order to break this deadlock.\n62.\tTurkey, being in the region involved and having traditionally close and friendly ties with the Arab countries, wishes to see this problem solved as soon as possible in conformity with the principles of justice and equity. We continue to believe that Security Council resolution 242(1967) contains the necessary elements for the attainment of a lasting and honourable settlement. The establishment of a just peace should safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned, including, naturally, those of the Palestinians. We hold the view that the status of Jerusalem, a Holy City for three major religions of mankind, should not be changed by unilateral actions.\n63.\tI now wish to dwell briefly on a different subject which should retain the attention of our Assembly. I refer to acts of violence and terrorism. It must be more than a truism to underline the fact that recourse to violence with its underhanded methods such as terrorism, sabotage, the hijack. of aircraft and so on, far from solving problems complicates them still more and engenders new ones.\n64.\tHere I want to make one point absolutely clear. Terrorism can in no way be condoned. I should even add that of all acts of violence terroristic acts must be condemned with particular emphasis because of the cowardliness inherent in them. The justness of the cause they are supposed to serve must never be considered an excuse. But we should never lose sight of the very important fact that the reverse is valid too. That is, we should never be unduly influenced in our judgement on a given cause by our abhorrence of the means used for its furtherance.\n65.\tWe must earnestly hope that the present Assembly will through its concurrent efforts be able to prepare a draft convention for the prevention and suppression of international terrorism. We think that it falls equally to us to consider seriously and adopt at this session the draft convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons [item 90]. It is also important that a large number of countries should be parties to the Tokyo, The Hague and the Montreal Conventions.\n66.\tHere I note with regret that the extraordinary session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization  and the International Conference on Air Law closed recently without any positive results.\n67.\tWe are looking forward to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with great expectations. The outcome of the Conference is of extreme importance for the international community. We shall either open a new era of international co-operation or move towards possible chaos in that field. The main \nquestion in our efforts in the preparation of new international norms for the law of the sea is the determination of the limits of national jurisdiction of sovereign States. In our opinion, a solution of this problem does not infringe the sovereign rights of States or relate to the division of those rights. The creation of a new order must be based on justice and equity and must take into account the peculiarities and realities of different regions of the world which have particular problems that can be solved only through mutual agreement.\n68.\tIf I have so far dwelt mostly on political questions and prospects for the future, it should not be construed that we attribute less importance to economic problems. On the contrary, we believe that the roots of many of the political problems encountered are of an economic nature. International co-operation is an absolute must when we look forward to the improvement of the well-being of the masses.\n69.\tA preliminary assessment of the progress achieved so far during the Second United Nations Development Decade does not give rise to much optimism, especially for countries in the process of development. Yet the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations lead us away from falling into complete pessimism. The prolongation of the uncertainties in the world monetary system seriously endanger world trade as a whole and particularly the trade of the developing countries. Therefore we urge the completion of the work being carried out for the improvement of the international monetary system without delay. International economic relations need to be salvaged from their present insecure atmosphere. Much remains to be done in the sharing of the benefits accrued through technological progress.\n70.\tRecent drought and natural disasters in many parts of the world have led us to think more seriously about the alarming situation of the world food problem. In this age of Igreat technological advancement, it is paradoxical still to witness men dying of hunger and men being overwhelmed by the forces of nature. The need for assistance from the international community is urgent, especially for the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Upper Volta in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Furthermore, the heavy floods which devastated life and property in Pakistan, with which we have fraternal ties of friendship, have left that great country in need of immediate assistance.\n71.\tWhile we are sure that all possible aid will continue to flow expeditiously to those fellow member countries, timely realization of that vital assistance should not relieve our minds of the long-term problems of poor agricultural production. We therefore find the convening of a world food conference, as proposed by the Secretary of State of the United States [2124th meeting], timely and appropriate.\n72.\tMoreover, serious consideration should be given to the problems of the environment and to the immediate and long-term problems of energy, which are inseparable from the future of mankind.\n73.\tA month from now, almost to the day, on 29 October, Turkey will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic. That means, above all, the beginning of a new era for our nation.\n74.\tThe political philosophy of this era has been characterized more than anything by the justly renowned principle of the founder of the new Turkey, the great Kemal Ataturk, which demands, \\\"Peace at home, peace in the world\\\". The latter part of this principle which Ataturk bequeathed to his nation is clear enough to need no comment. Throughout history, many great thinkers have perceived and expressed the necessity of peace for human happiness. Whereas the first part, which takes up peace as an element of progress in the internal life of a nation', contains truly original and far-sighted thought, when Ataturk insisted that peace at home should flourish together with peace in the world Turkey was emerging from a long series of wars. On the other hand, it was preparing itself for the complete eradication of the remnants of exploitation in economic and other fields which had for such a long time distorted both its relations with the outside world and its day-to-day life.\n75.\tAtaturk, who was the first to take up the sword when the nation had to fight a life-and-death struggle, taught his people that, although any undue foreign influence was not to be tolerated, the orderly social and economic development of the national life depended nevertheless on the achievement of a climate of peace in both internal and external relations. Foreign interference should be supplanted by co-operation, hostility should give way to friendship, and peace should prevail both at home and in the world. Those principles are enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.\n76.\tThose same principles led Turkey to establish and maintain throughout this half-century a policy of good- neighbourliness and friendship with all the countries of the region and the world. That policy is also the basis of the fraternal ties existing between Turkey, Iran and Pakistan.\n77.\tHaving espoused as sincerely as we have the principle of our great leader, it should be no accident that Turkey has during the course of the five last decades, which were full of turbulent events in international life, withstood the vicissitudes of the era and remained a loyal member of the world community in the promotion of peace, security and co-operation in its region as well as in the world at large. My country is determined to remain faithful to its traditional policy of peace and co-operation.\n78.\tInspired by this experience of ours. I shall now try to think aloud on what can be done about the positive and negative elements which combine to form the present international political fabric, with a view to fostering the former and weeding out the latter. What do we have at our disposal for our guidance?\n79.\tFirst of all, we have the fundamental purposes and principles of our Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)].\n80.\tThen there are international agreements which are valid under the generally recognized principles and rules of international law, and which stipulate obligations to be fulfilled in good faith by every nation.\n81.\tAll those documents are inspired by the fact that peace and security represent the fundamental aspirations of mankind, and for that reason their maintenance and strengthening acquire paramount importance.\n82.\tWe can be guided also by the solemn declarations of intent made during the July 1973 Helsinki session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to strive for the establishment of conditions of detente and co-operation in that region of the world. We can bear in mind that genuine detente can be achieved only by eliminating the causes of international conflicts, armed confrontations and open hostility.\n83.\tAgain, we can bear in mind mankind's impressive achievements in science and technology, on the one hand, and the consequent problems of a political, economic, environmental and social nature, on the other. And, last but not least, we can bear in mind the laudable efforts made by the United Nations in dedicating decades to particular causes in the fields of disarmament and development, as well as prospectively in the field of action to combat racism and racial discrimination.\n84.\tWith all that in mind I ventured to suggest last year the possibility of declaring a \\\"decade of political conciliation\\\". The basis this year for such a declaration, which I still regard as useful, could be a text in which the relevant principles of the Charter should be emphasized, giving due consideration to the inalienable rights of colonial peoples to self-determination and independence and strongly condemning colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. In this text, after having unequivocally underlined the inadmissibility of acquisition of territorial or political advantages through the use or threat of force in international relations, we might, for the promotion of the purposes of this \\\"decade of political conciliation\\\", ask the Secretary- General to co-operate with interested specialized agencies, intergovernmental organizations and institutions renowned for their impartial expertise on the subject, and to take into consideration the valuable work already accomplished in this field in order to prepare a study on the implications of such a decade and to propose appropriate machinery within the United Nations system for the implementation of its exigencies.\n85.\tI think that, if these ideas meet the support of my colleagues, our Secretary-General and his able staff may be trusted to produce a document on the subject and present it for the consideration of the next session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "\ufeff106.\t I find it a source of great pleasure to preface my statement this afternoon by expressing to the President my very warm felicitations upon his election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We regard his unanimous and well-deserved election not only as a personal tribute to his eminent qualities as an accomplished diplomat of great skill and experience and as a man of great devotion to the ideals of universal peace and human dignity, but also as a recognition of Ecuador's belief in the unreserved support for the principles that inspire the United Nations. I wish to seize this opportunity to assure him that my delegation stands prepared to place its complete co-operation at his disposal as he endeavours to fulfil the high duties with which this Assembly has entrusted him.\n107.\tHis predecessor in the post of President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepzcynski, deserves our gratitude for the competent manner in which he presided over the work of the General Assembly at its last session. Through you, Sir, I am happy to extend to him the appreciation of the Ethiopian delegation.\n108.\tThe current session of the General Assembly has, through the: happy enlargement of the United Nations roster, witnessed a further positive development towards the achievement of the principle of universality of membership in our Organization. It is from that perspective, therefore, that my delegation views the admission of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. To all three, I extend the warm welcome of my delegation and wish to assure them of our co-operation and friendship as they join us here in the United Nations to work together towards the attainment of our common objectives of international peace and co-operation.\n109.\tThe admission to membership in the United Nations of the two Germanys, in particular, is not without its historic significance. As we all know, both East and West Germany are not States which acceded to sovereign and independent political existence immediately preceding their admission to membership, as has been the case with the preponderant majority of States which joined the United Nations as Members since the signing of the Charter in San Francisco 28 years ago. Rather, the prolonged exclusion of those States from membership in the United Nations has been a consequence of the rigidities of the polarized cold-war diplomacy that had hitherto characterized the conduct of international political intercourse. The approval without dissent of the application for membership of the two Germanys by the Security Council is therefore an event which we must all applaud and welcome as it not only appreciably contributed towards the strengthening of the United Nations itself but also established a pattern for the future resolution of the yet unsettled questions of membership in the United Nations of the remaining divided States. The significance of the admission of the two Germanys could be viewed as an added evidence of the changing nature of the. international political climate, which is witnessing the steady replacement of the era of confrontation by an era of accommodation based on the perception of mutual self-interest. In this regard, it remains our firm conviction that if the United Nations is to be capable of playing the role of a constructive and effective international Organization, it must be representative and open, and not discriminatory or exclusive in its membership.\n110.\tAs in the past, the current session of the Genera! Assembly has afforded Members yet another opportunity not only to review and examine the questions with which the United Nations is currently seized but also to address themselves to some others which, in their respective views, relate, in some manner, to the achievement the overall aims of our Organization. Quite naturally, I feel that such an exercise could commence with some general references to some of the more important developments in the international scene during the past year.\n111.\tAt the outset, I am satisfied to note that the trend towards the over-all relaxation of tension in inter-State relations, and, in particular, in relations affecting the major Powers of the world, began only recently and has continued to show steady improvement. My Government attaches great importance to this welcome development as we believe that, in the present era of astounding technological refinements which, inter alia, have given man the unprecedented capability for instant self-destruction, every minute step taken in the direction of mutual understanding and accommodation amongst friends and adversaries alike is a positive evolution worth acclaiming. The risk to world peace \u2014 a peace whose fortunes are solely based on uncertain hopes and mere assumptions that the worst might somehow be avoided-is, to say the least, enormous. It is therefore such an appreciation, coupled with an awareness of the stark reality of the physical and political interdependence of international life today that prompts my Government to evaluate as positive, and to support, any development on the international scene that contributes towards the establishment of an enduring peace in the world. In this context, I wish to refer to some events that have occurred since we last met here which, in the view of my delegation, can be considered as developments of positive significance to international stability.\n112.\tThe effort not long ago initiated to establish a more stable international system increasingly free of the risks of nuclear confrontation was given further impetus by the official visit to Washington last June of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Leonid Brezhnev. Although it may be premature to evaluate with precision the over-all impact of the various agreements signed by President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev subsequent to their summit talks, we can nevertheless venture to assert that the spirit which underlay those accords was a further positive development in strengthening international peace and security. We believe that the code of conduct signed by the two leaders to reduce the risk of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union and between either party and other countries is, in particular, a major contribution to the preservation of peace in the world.\n113.\tThe convening in Helsinki, Finland, of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the beginning of July this year was another event which we consider to be of significance. Viewed against the background of the seemingly unbridgeable political and economic schism that had characterized Europe after the Second World War, indeed the recent attempt at Helsinki to establish a better foundation for improved and mutually advantageous relations was one that must be commended. Unless for emphasis, the obvious fact that Europe had for over two decades, remained a potential flash-point for war need not be restated here. We hope the desire to reduce tension in this part of the world will find further concrete expressions in the years to come.\n114.\tAs we ushered in the new year, an important agreement was signed in Paris which sought to terminate the active hostilities which had raged mercilessly in Indochina for over a decade, causing untold sufferings to the inhabitants of that peninsula. The Paris agreement of last January, which called for a general cease-fire in Viet-Nam, also provided for the withdrawal of foreign troops, thus paving the way for the people of Viet-Nam to exercise their inalienable right to determine for themselves, without any outside interference, the future of their political destiny. My Government I is satisfied that it has at last become possible for the parties in the Viet-Nam conflict to resolve their differences by negotiation and mutual agreement rather than through recourse to destructive violence., the continuation and escalation of which had posed a serious and dangerous threat to international peace and harmony. We are all the more pleased at the outcome, as we had, in this and other international forums, repeatedly advocated, as the sine qua non for ending the war in Viet-Nam, the same cardinal elements eventually incorporated in the Paris Agreement. It is the earnest hope of my Government that, with the end of the hostilities, the people of Viet-Nam will begin to enjoy the peace and tranquillity in their land denied them for over a quarter of a century and will now have the unhampered opportunity to channel their energies into the pursuit of their social and economic goals.\n115.\tSimilarly, we have taken note of the pact of Vientiane-the agreement signed last February on restoring peace and achieving national concord in Laos. Indeed, it has been gratifying for us to observe that the contagion of peace in Viet-Nam has spilled over into neighbouring Laos. We hope that agreement will continue to be respected so that peace will prevail in the country.\n116.\tThe situation in Cambodia, unfortunately, continues to be the anomaly of the trend in the rest of Indo-China. The military conflict, continues unabated and with it the anguish and suffering of the people of Cambodia, It is our hope that the people of Cambodia will be left to themselves to find appropriate solutions to their own-political problems.\n117.\tWhile it is true that we take satisfaction from witnessing the accelerated tempo in the normalization of relations among the great Powers, as well as from the observation that some of the pressing international problems in some regions of the world, notably those in Europe and in South-East Asia, are being resolved, we cannot nevertheless, hide our dismay and serious concern at the lack of concomitant progress in the search for solutions to such vital issues as decolonization, the Middle East, disarmament, and economic development.\n118.\tThat the United Nations efforts to bring freedom and dignity to the millions of Africans still suffering from colonial and racial oppression have not registered any single perceptible success within the past year needs no emphasis. Nor does the sad and well-known fact of the escalation of the brutal repression of the African masses by the colonial- racist regimes of southern Africa require any detailed recitation on the part of my delegation.\n119.\tMy Government notes with profound regret that the continued stifling of the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa to freedom and dignity by those who hold their own selfish and misguided interests of surpassing importance has not caused sufficient moral indignation in the international community to compel it to act in concert not only in the defence of the rights of the peoples of southern Africa, but, more importantly, in the supreme interest of the overriding principles that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is the considered view of my delegation that it is this apparent neglect of the anguish and sufferings of the peoples of southern Africa by the international community that has encouraged the colonialists to engage in unconscionable excesses in order to guarantee their position of controlling the lives and destinies of the peoples they remorselessly subjugate and exploit. The incalculable death and destruction that are now being perpetrated by the colonialists in southern Africa as well as in Guinea (Bissau) are the direct consequence of the failure of the international community to which I have just referred.\n120.\tIn the face of the regrettable complacency on the part of the allies and trading partners of Portugal regarding the plight of the peoples under Portuguese subjugation, it is indeed no surprise that Portugal has continued to prosecute its colonial wars in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau with ever more ferocity. The recent revelation of the massacre of 400 innocent men, women and children at Wiriyamu in Mozambique is but one more example of the depth to which Portugal is prepared to sink in its vain attempt to force the surrender of the liberation struggle, How many horrifying massacres of the type that took place at Wiriyamu are needed before the friends and allies of Portugal realize their responsibilities and begin to deny their support to a country that insists on enslaving millions of Africans and exploiting the resources of their territories?\n121.\tThe situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate as the rebel regime, in co-operation with Portuguese and South African forces, increases its military offensive against the liberation struggle, thereby escalating tension in the colony. In an apparent attempt to emulate the policy of apartheid as practised in South Africa, the rebel regime announced, in Salisbury last March, plans for the establishment of \\\"Bantustans\\\", which it euphemistically called \\\"regional authorities\\\", thus confirming our suspicions that the rebels are determined to impose apartheid on the African masses of Zimbabwe, In spite of such a turn for the worse in the situation in the colony, what we now hear is not of any new resolve on the part of the administering Power to rectify its mishandling of the insurrection in the colony, but rather of further disquieting reports of contacts between Britain and the rebels, the purpose of which could only be to legitimize the rebellion of the racist minority in power and to relegate the overwhelming African majority to perpetual subjugation.\n122.\tAs for the sanctions imposed against the Territory by the Security Council, their ineffectiveness continues to be starkly demonstrated by the defiant survival of the Salisbury regime itself as well as by the increase in the number of breaches that are taking place. The recent sale of three Boeing jet aircraft to the regime clearly underscores the urgent need for a critical reappraisal of the sanctions policy if the effort to restore legality in the Territory is to be successful. \n123.\tThe question of Namibia has remained deadlocked as the South African Government continues to manipulate the opportunity provided by the decision of the Security Council in its resolution 309 (1972) that requested the Secretary-General to initiate contacts with it. After repeated and patient attempts to probe the South African intention with respect to the political future of Namibia, the Secretary-General has, in his latest report,  confirmed the failure of the South African Government to provide an unambiguous response in regard to the question of granting to the people of Namibia the right of self-determination and independence envisaged under resolution 323 (1972). This South African equivocation comes to us as no surprise since we had nurtured no illusions to begin with about South Africa's true designs and intentions with respect to Namibia. It is our belief that the United Nations must abandon forthwith any false hopes and consider the adoption of other means to extricate the Namibian people from the illegal colonial occupation of South Africa.\n124.\tThe armed struggle now under way in southern Africa as well as in Guinea-Bissau between those who are in legitimate pursuit of their freedom and dignity and those who insist on continuing their colonial and racial domination has reached a new and dangerous level. As the liberation forces intensify their armed struggle to dislodge the oppressors, the colonialists in unholy alliance among themselves have stepped up their vicious and indiscriminate wars of oppression. We believe that the United Nations has a responsibility to assist those who, by fighting for their rights to self-determination and independence, are also fighting for the respect of the principles that are embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. The recognition by the United Nations of the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples must be coupled with the resolve to render not only moral but also material assistance to the liberation struggle, We consider the decision adopted at the last session of the General Assembly to grant observer status to African liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to be of great political importance to the anti-colonial struggle. In this regard we also consider the convening of a conference in Oslo, Norway, last April in support of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa to be of significance particularly from the point of view of its advantage in creating international public awareness regarding the gravity of the problem prevailing in southern Africa.\n125.\tThat colonialism and racialism have denied Africa peace and tranquillity has now become too obvious a fact. In this connexion I cannot emphasize too much the urgent necessity of effective pressures being exercised on the culprits of southern Africa, particularly by those States Members of this Organization which, by virtue of their close friendship, have the leverage to persuade and prevail upon them to put an end to the wanton killings and mass destruction they are perpetrating in that part of the world.\n126.\tSince the founding of OAU 10 years ago last May, African States have co-ordinated their efforts in the unremitting struggle against the colonialist-racialist alliance. As a concrete harmonization of African policies to combat effectively the oppressions and injustices which are being perpetrated on African soil, the positive role which is being played by OAU has indeed been significant. The consolidation of the freedom struggle in Africa owes as much to OAU as it does to the sacrifices which the various African national liberation movements themselves are making to liberate their land from ruthless subjugators. To this extent it will be no exaggeration to say that OAU has been complementing United Nations efforts in the sphere of decolonization.\n127.\tAll men of good conscience must realize that the liberation struggle in Africa is essentially a struggle for human rights. As States Members of the United Nations prepare to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I wonder how much thought will be given to the plight of the peoples of southern Africa who have for long been denied the most rudimentary individual liberties which many of us take for granted.\n128.\tWe note that no progress has been achieved in the past year in the effort to bring peace to another area of potential danger to international stability. I am, of course, referring to the situation in the Middle East, where the task of finding a just and lasting solution to the problem continues to be stalemated. A hazardous state of suspended hostilities has characterized the area ever since the cease-fire agreement went into effect in August 1970. In the meantime, violence and retribution continue to be perpetrated, as what has come to be described as \\\"the Arab- Israeli secret war\\\" assumes new scope and dimensions with its inevitable hazards to those innocent bystanders who are unrelated in any way to the conflict in the Middle East.\n129.\tOn the diplomatic front, the recent broad review conducted by the Security Council of the situation in the Middle East has failed to yield any new direction which might have been pursued in the important search for an acceptable and durable peace in the Middle East.\n130.\tBecause of our close proximity to the area of hostilities, I cannot help but declare our most profound distress at the fact that the quest for peace has become as elusive as ever. Our support for Security Council resolution 242(1967) was prompted by our strong desire to ensure that an acceptable formula was established as a framework for resolving the central issues that have remained at the root of the Arab-Israeli problem. In this context, I wish to refer to the statement made by my august Sovereign, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries:\n\\\"The peoples of that region require a just and lasting peace to realize their human potential and develop the natural resources of the area for the betterment of their lives. As a condition to a lasting solution, we \\\"must call upon Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories she occupied six years ago.\\\"\n131. Let me now turn briefly to another important issue which, because of its increasingly enormous bearing on world peace, has been of great concern to our Organization ever since its inception. It is universally agreed that among the means of ensuring international peace, one of exceptional importance is that of disarmament. Yet, in spite of this recognition, progress over the years towards the goal of both conventional and nuclear disarmament has become painfully slow. Nevertheless, we note with satisfaction the agreements signed last June between the United States and the USSR on the prevention of nuclear war and the limitation of strategic armaments. The expressed intention of achieving agreement from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks within 18 months is also encouraging.\n132.\tThe hope we expressed last year for an early conclusion of an agreement to ban chemical weapons has not, regrettably, been realized. My Government would like to urge once again that no effort should be spared to reach agreement not only on a comprehensive prohibition of all chemical weapons, but also on a provision to ensure the destruction of the existing arsenal of chemical weapons.\n\n133.\tLast August marked the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Moscow11 \u2014 a treaty which banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, on the surface of the ground and under water. It would have been most appropriate if during this anniversary year, it had been possible to eliminate the two defects of the Treaty-firstly, its implicit legitimization of underground nuclear tests and, secondly, the absence of the other nuclear Powers from the roster of the signatories of the Treaty. In this regard, we wish to emphasize the extreme importance of making every effort to prevent any further radioactive defilement of the atmosphere.\n134.\tThe armaments race has proved to be not only a drain on vital resources which could have been employed to improve the quality of life for mankind, but also a paramount reason for the erosion of mutual trust and confidence among States. It has often been stated that it is the balance of terror that has somehow reduced the possibility of a nuclear confrontation among the great Powers. For our part, we should like to see peace assured, not by virtue of a hazardous balance of terror, but by positive and effective measures of disarmament. And, in this regard, no doubt a carefully prepared and properly convened world disarmament conference could be a useful exercise. But, as the experience of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has so far shown, the understanding and co-operation of all nuclear weapon States becomes indispensable if any progress is to be registered in the effort to halt and reverse the armaments race.\n135.\tAmong the problems which continue to tax the energy and imagination of our Organization is the area of international economic and social development. The recent review and appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has shown that even the modest and agreed targets we had set out to achieve are proving to be extremely difficult if not altogether impossible to attain. The statistics in this regard are, at the very least, discouraging. While of all the developing countries of the world only one third exceeded the over-all target of a 6 per cent annual growth rate in 1972, one half of them could not even register a growth rate of 5 per cent. Indeed, to make matters worse, in about one fifth of the developing countries a decline in per capita income was evident.\n136.\tThe gap between the developed and the developing nations is thus increasing rather than decreasing as had hopefully been anticipated with the launching of the Second Development Decade. That there is a direct correlation between both economic and social development, on the one hand, and international stability, on the other, is a fact which has now become accepted. In view of this, it therefore becomes incumbent upon all members of the international community to renew their solemn commitments to the struggle against the basic economic and social ills impeding the achievement of an improved quality of life for all mankind. In the interdependent world of today we simply cannot afford to falter in our courage to rise up to meet such rudimentary challenges affecting the daily lives and over-all welfare of the human family.\n137.\tThe United Nations, as an international institution dedicated to the service of all mankind, has, over the years, evolved in response to the demand of changing times. We thus see it today grappling increasingly not only with issues of international peace and security \u2014 to which it accords high priority-but also with problems of trade, development, outer space, the sea-bed, population, environment and human rights. Many of these are staggering problems whose effects transcend the confines of geography and political ideology. They are problems with wider and, in some instances, global implications. And, as such, they can only be tackled effectively within an integrated international response. I believe that the United Nations has the basic institutional set-up needed to facilitate such an international co-operative endeavour. Obviously the United Nations can be improved institutionally to better meet the challenges of contemporary times.\n138.\tBut it is no use to decry ,the United Nations for failing in this or that sphere of endeavour while we ourselves fail to live up to the commitments voluntarily assumed by the fact of our membership in this Organization. If the United Nations has failed to meet many of the expectations of international public opinion it is because its components-the States that comprise its membership- have been unwilling to give it all the support and co-operation it needs in the discharge if the tasks entrusted to it. And if it is at all possible to affix blame to any single factor for the ills of the United Nations, it can perhaps be ascribed to the general paralysis of the political will of the membership.\n139.\tThat the world needs an effective and strengthened United Nations is a fact that no one can controvert. Let us therefore make this recognition our point of departure and resolve to rededicate ourselves not only to the letter but also to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations so that the world will be a secure and better place to live in for present as well as future generations of mankind."

He is a distinguished son of Latin America, and his election therefore constitutes a source of pride to all of us in the third world, particularly the countries of Latin America that are struggling against difficult circumstances to achieve progress for their people. Despite the tragic events in Chile and the overthrow and cruel murder of President Salvador Allende, we are confident that the peoples of Latin America will continue their efforts to make progress and to gain complete control over their national resources.\n62.\tPermit me also to express our consummate admiration to Ambassador Benites' predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski for his efforts while presiding over the affairs of the last session of this Assembly.\n63.\tIn the name of the Libyan Arab Republic, I should like to welcome from this rostrum the declaration of independence of the State of Guinea-Bissau, a country in Africa that is very close to our hearts. We look forward to the day when that country can take its rightful place in this Organization.\n64.\tMy delegation also takes this occasion to welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization. However, we cannot fail to deplore the policies pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany in maintaining relations with the racist and Nazi regimes in occupied Palestine, South Africa and Rhodesia.\n65.\tThe events that have occurred in the course of the past year still confirm the determination of colonialism and imperialism to pursue policies of threat, domination and extortion. Imperialism still employs all its resources to maintain a grasp over peoples. How else can one interpret the latest criminal aggression by Zionist gangs on 6 October than as one in a series of repeated aggression? within the over-all international imperialist and colonialist plot? The establishment of the puppet Zionist clique in the midst of the Arab nation was directed towards the control of the area and its resources. They also sought to impose on peoples of the area a state of fear and terror in order to prevent them from devoting all their attention to development and progress. This puppet clique was established through an international and colonial conspiracy, and the Arab people of Palestine were and remain today one of its victims. The Arab people of Palestine were expelled from their homes and their country and were dispersed to different parts of the world. They were replaced by hordes assembled from different parts of the world with no common purpose other than blind fanaticism and false slogans not based on any religious, historical, or national foundation.\n66.\tThe Zionist gangs took as their example chapters in United States history to establish the machinery that perpetuates itself through treachery, plunder and mass slaughter. They employed the same criminal methods that were used by the white settlers on this continent in subduing and exterminating the American Indian people. The record of the conduct of this clique and their United States supporters is overflowing with acts of aggression and conspiracy against the Arab nation. The current events in the Arab region illustrate just one further chapter in a series of aggressions oft repeated over the last 25 years.\n67.\tThis Zionist clique would not have been able to continue its aggression and expansion were it not for the material support of the United States of America, its partner in mass murder, extermination, and expulsion of the indigenous people of Palestine.\n68.\tIt has become very clear to the world that the United States of America has placed in the service of the Zionist gangs all its military and material potential, without any limit. Moreover, it has become a matter of fact that the same member of the Security Council has placed its right of veto in the hands of the Zionist gang, challenging the conscience of the world community in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations.\n69.\tThe Zionist gang, with the connivance of the United Stat<. , terrorizes, murders, annexes and expands with the inter, ion of imposing on the Arab nation a policy of defeatism and acquiescence. When the Arab nation defends itself by liberating its territories, the Zionist gangs and their supporters deny us our legitimate rights.\n70.\tIn the context of the latest aggressions against the Arab nation, is it not strange that the partner of the Zionist gangs, in its naked insolence, should demand the withdrawal of the forces to the positions they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on 6 October 1973? The United States of America, abusing its seat in the Security Council as one of the five permanent members, has the audacity to demand that the Arabs withdraw from their own territories, evacuating them to accommodate Zionist immigrants. It backs up this audacious demand by threatening to use its Sixth Fleet, based in the Mediterranean, in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the Arab nation.\n71.\tThis ugly logic of domineering colonialism is based on deception, treachery and distortion of facts.\n72.\tWith these facts in mind, we can easily understand the motives behind these aggressions and the collaboration of the United States with the Zionist gangs. In plain terms, it is the lust for domination of the area, subjugation of its people and the exploitation of their resources.\n73.\tThe situation in Palestine can be dealt with neither from the approach of who it was who did or did not start the hostilities nor from that of finding superficial temporary Solutions. The problem can be dealt with only in its real essence and historical roots, which are that the Palestinian people have been expelled from their homes and their land and have been deprived of all their legitimate rights. Any solution that ignores this basic fact will be doomed to failure, whatever the magnitude of the Power that seeks to impose it.\n74.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic, which commits all that is in its power to the cause of the Palestinian people, calls upon the international community to support the Palestinian struggle against Zionist and colonialist forces. It is high time for the international community to raise its voice demanding the restoration to the Palestinian people of the inalienable rights of which they have been dispossessed in their usurped land.\n75.\tIt is all too clear that there is a threefold unholy alliance between, first, the forces of the Zionist clique, second, the colonialist regimes and, third, the regimes of apartheid and racial discrimination in Africa. They devise the same conspiracies, practise the same methods and pursue the same objectives, namely, close collaboration with international monopolies, suppression of the aspirations of legitimate indigenous peoples, imposition of alien settlements, and the practice of racial and religious discrimination. The struggle of the peoples of Angola, Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, the Saquia el Hamra, so-called Spanish Sahara, and Palestine for the liberation of their homelands encounters every day a greater deployment of force and terrorism on the part of the colonialist and racist regimes, supported by all the war machinery of the NATO Powers. The Libyan Arab Republic has stood and always will stand ready to place all its material and moral resources in support of the African and other struggles in the liberation movements in the world.\n76.\tColonialism and its agents perpetrate to this day acts of international terrorism. The determination of national liberation movements to achieve their objectives is confronted with even greater use of force and violence on the part of colonialist forces. This use of force has reached an unprecedented level in the practice of organized international terrorism, leading to mass murder and political assassination of such martyrs as Amilcar Cabral, Edouardo Mondelane, Kamal Adwan, Abu Yusuf and Kamal Nasser.\n77.\tThe recent developments in the international relations of the super-Powers, which have resulted in what has been called detente, should not be at the expense of the interests of the small countries. The developing countries have suffered expensively, during the period of international confrontation between the major Powers, from the policies of domination and division of the world as pursued against colonized and small nations alike. We are afraid that this detente is an agreement among the super-Powers to divide the world into permanent spheres of influence and to resolve international disputes among themselves without due regard to the interests of the international community, where the small countries constitute an overwhelming majority. At a time when it is said that the world has entered into a period of detente, we witness the consolidation of the bases of colonialism in Africa and Asia. We also witness conspiracies to exploit the natural resources of developing countries which are becoming increasingly extensive and devious. The methods of monopoly have reached the level of armed attack against the sovereignty of States to undermine the social and political systems of these countries.\n78.\tIn order that international peace and security based on equity and justice among nations may prevail, the non- aligned countries, in awareness of their responsibility to international society, have consolidated the:- efforts to destroy the monopolies and the political domination of the, major Powers. These efforts are also aimed at rectifying the imbalance prevailing in the international, political, economic and social scene, especially with regard to narrowing the gap between the have and the have-not nations.\n79.\tUnfortunately, it is a fact that there are among us those who question the right of peoples and nations to exercise full control over their natural resources. This right constitutes an integral element in the exercise of national sovereignty by all States. It is high time for those who still undermine such national sovereignty because of their greed to recognize this legitimate right. The gravity of the situation becomes even more alarming when the States that are incited by international monopolies begin devising conspiracies, threatening to use force, and fabricating reasons in order to enlist other States in defiance of the recognized principle of national sovereignty over natural resources.\n80.\tThe situations in Indo-China, in the Arab region, and in the African continent are a constant reminder that the peace we seek remains elusive. The great victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam against the forces of aggression and treachery is a triumph for all people struggling against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. Despite their great victory, the heroic people of Viet-Nam still suffer because of the violation by the United States and by the Saigon administration of the provisions of the Paris agreements, as well as of other international instruments related to the question of Viet-Nam. The situation in Cambodia is no better than that in Viet-Nam. The forces of colonialism remain represented in the puppet regime of Phnom Penh, which, with the support of the United States, still pursues inhuman policies against the people of Cambodia, struggling under the leadership of the Royal Government of Norodom Sihanouk.\n81.\tOne of the results of detente has been the imposition of partition on peoples and nations; and, what is worse, the United Nations has been used to consolidate and give legal status to such partition. Yesterday it was Germany, today it is Korea, and tomorrow it will be Viet-Nam.\n82.\tThe right to self-determination is the inalienable right of all nations, and can be exercised only in a context of free will, devoid of foreign interference and pressure.\n83.\tInternational security is indivisible, and any disturbance in one area will result in disturbance of the international peace and security of the whole world. The current attempts of European countries to create in their continent new conditions of peace will not meet with the expected success unless Europe achieves self-reliance and terminates its reliance on foreign force, dismantling all foreign military bases, pacts, alliances and treaties.\n84.\tIn this context the presence of foreign fleets and foreign military bases in the Mediterranean area constitutes in itself a direct threat to the peace and security of the littoral States.\n85.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic, in raising this basic issue, wishes to draw the attention of all peace-loving States to the dangerous situation that resulted from the acts of aggression and provocation perpetrated by the United States of America in order to intimidate the people of the Libyan Arab Republic and prevent them from exercising their legitimate rights over their territorial waters and natural resources. The provocations of the Sixth Fleet and its repeated infringements of our territorial waters are just one further chapter in a long series of American aggressions against our coasts. The first attempt to realize this colonialist dream began in the early years of the nineteenth century and is, in fact, still embodied in the official anthem of the United States Marine Corps, which begins \\\"From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli\\\".\n86. The Libyan Arab Republic, in informing the international community of these provocations, assures it that it\nreserves its unequivocal right to protect its national sovereignty against all aggressors, however mighty.\n87. In conclusion, I should like to hail the heroic people of Egypt, Syria and Palestine, as well as the peoples of the third world, for their struggle to restore their rights and their land. This is an historic, crucial moment that will always be remembered in the annals of human history as one of the most noble missions of mankind in his struggle to achieve  justice and peace on earth."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I wish to begin by expressing the gratification of the Government of Brazil and my own at your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your vast diplomatic experience and the brilliant services you have always rendered to your country, to the inter-American system and to the international community assure us that our work during this session will be guided by your proven lucidity and political acumen. As a Brazilian, I recognize among your attributes the outstanding values of the noble people of Ecuador, a country which has always been linked to Brazil through friendship, mutual respect and a co-operation which we are today expanding more than ever; as a Latin American, I am aware that your personal attributes are highly representative of the long lineage of statesmen and internationalists who have built up the cultural and political heritage of our continent. The historic deeds of those statesmen and leaders mirrored the common cultural origins of Iberia \u2014 that discoverer of seas and continents, sower of civilizations, and heiress to and propagator of the Mediterranean cultures. Luso-Spanish Iberia intermingled with the aboriginal races of America and acquired a new dimension through the contribution of the blood and cultural values of Africa. This is exemplified by my own country, Brazil, where all these influences were amalgamated, rendering it for that very reason so profoundly Latin American and so much part and parcel of the Latin American world which nominated you, Sir, as an authentic representative of our continent, to the presidency of this Assembly. \n\n3.\tThe presence in this hall of the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, resulting from a long and patient process of political evolution, is a positive sign of the detente now sought by contemporary diplomacy. My country, which did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of its sons to defend the ideals of freedom and democracy on European battlefields, can well appreciate the true significance of the admission to the United Nations of both those States. To the United Nations, founded as an alternative to the use of force in inter-State relations, this event overcomes one of the most acute problems of the political balance-sheet of the post-war era. Brazil maintains with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany relations that I dare to describe as exemplary. Wide-ranging common interests have for many years been drawing our two countries together again, under reciprocally and increasingly advantageous conditions.\n4.\tIt is my hope that negotiations in progress with the German Democratic Republic, with which we have been sustaining fruitful commercial relations for over a decade, will result very soon in a reciprocally beneficial relationship based on mutual respect.\n5.\tIt is with the greatest pleasure that I welcome in a very special way the delegation of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, a sister country from our continent, which we shall receive with an open heart into our Latin American group and with which we wish to develop increasingly broad and cordial co-operation.\n6.\tNo one in good faith can fail to applaud a policy of detente which seeks and propounds understanding and co-operation as alternatives to mistrustful isolation and to latent conflict. We look upon this relaxation of tensions with renewed hopes that inspired diplomatic action may gather momentum and reach all the existing hotbeds of crisis and eliminate them. None the less, while squarely facing the political, economic and social realities of our times, we are bound to ask objectively: detente for whom, detente for what?\n7.\tWe view as the source of the policies of detente a willingness on the part of the super-Powers and the great Powers to launch a process of peace-seeking and understanding which has brought about a National and pragmatic placation of the conflicts of interests in the vast field of the political-strategic balance as well as in the area of dominant influences \u2014 dominant because they are built on objective conditions of unmatched power. That willingness to desist from further confrontation has motivated and rendered possible new European developments \u2014 as evidenced in recently concluded treaties and in other agreements still under way \u2014 aimed at establishing peace in Europe and creating a European security system, envisaging the reduction of arsenals and troops and also serving the purpose of stimulating closer economic co-operation. Although laudable, meritorious and of extreme importance, this detente none the less cannot-by inference be a regional goal, nor can it be thought of as a temporary arrangement to accommodate certain conveniences and interests.\n8.\tWe hope that this determination to desist from confrontation, this rationalization of what is politically viable and diplomatically feasible, will provide elements of action to extend those processes of peace-bringing and understanding to all areas of conflict, thereby safeguarding and rendering compatible the mutual interests of the parties directly concerned.\n9.\tDetente, as we envisage it, should be the extension to the whole of the international scene of this political will to pacify and co-operate. It should inject this political will into the body and system of our Organization. It should offer opportunity for finally implementing the purposes and principles of the Charter, and for the United Nations to pay its ethical debt to itself \u2014 namely, the eradication of underdevelopment. To reduce detente to a rationale for the use, and for the balance, of power, to regionalize its scope and objectives \u2014  and hence to forgo using it as an instrument for normative reconstruction and as an inspiration and guide line for a policy of global relaxation \u2014 would be tantamount to reviving the fallacy of arrangements based on considerations of power which are transient and fleeting because they fail to comprehend the dynamics of internatiotial problems and because they are uninspired by any sense of the future.\n10.\tFrom the renewed diplomatic interaction which these first steps in the process of detente may set in motion, a more equitable international order must emerge, one which should foster an effective system of collective political and economic security based neither on oppression nor on the alleged acquired rights of the strongest but on the recognition of the just claims and interests of all States, their sovereign right to full economic development and social well-being, and their participation on an equal footing in the institutionalization of the rules of collective behavior. It is hard, if not impossible, to believe that the policy of relaxation of tensions will succeed outside those parameters. The past is teeming with examples of the fragility of arrangements contrived merely to serve the momentary interests of the exercise of power or to allocate such interests within the fallacious framework of spheres of influence. These arrangements have never survived the wear and tear inflicted by crises and contradictions of policies inspired by the myth of power and its alleged rights and hence policies which are unequitable and unjust, What we need today \u2014 now that we would appear to be more experienced and more convinced of the frailty of the exclusivist concepts of international security \u2014 what we need today, I repeat, more than a temporary harmonization of means, is a common and global concept of the ends we seek.\n11. As a means or an instrument, the policy of relaxation of tensions will either achieve greatness or demean itself, depending on the ultimate aims it pursues. As it is not endowed with mechanisms for automatic control and adjustments, the success of detente will be contingent on our capacity to expand it so that its long-term aims are not lost sight of and so that it does not become an instrument for the imposition of hegemonic arrangements. I am ready to agree that such is not the purpose. Since it is not, let us stand guard to prevent it from being reduced to such a purpose by temptations along its course and by unforeseen crises. It is our belief, furthermore, that the new orientation that is being sought for international relations will be meaningless in the long term if those attempts aim at no more than drafting a charter to discipline inter-State interests in the affluent areas of mankind and fail, therefore, to meet the very legitimate claims of countries outside that area.\n12.\tThis is an ovemding concern of Brazil's foreign policy which, conscious of its global responsibilities and commitments, assigns priority to close co-operation with all developing countries, and especially those of Latin America.\n13.\tDuring the last few years, it has been my duty to translate into diplomatic action the instructions and directives laid down by President Medici to foster and expand the political, economic and cultural ties between Brazil and the sister nations of our continent. Bilaterally and multilaterally, Brazil's inter-American policy will firmly continue to seek the goals of solidarity, reciprocal assistance, understanding and the minimization of sporadic dissidences, since Brazil is averse to rivalries, resentments and hegemonies which have no place among us.\n14.\tIt is our conviction, however, that while regional scenarios must be dealt with in accordance with their specific needs, they should be seen in perspective within the system of the United Nations. The lines of negotiation now prevailing cannot run parallel to the normative system of the Charter but on the contrary must be geared to it; otherwise, they will lack consistency and will not profit from the constructive evaluation and invigorating support of the community of States joined together in this Organization in the search of peace for all, security for all and collective progress .\n15.\tIt is for this forum to decide on the compatibility between instruments laterally negotiated and the purposes and principles of the Charter, so that the convenience of some will not be construed as the measure of the interests of all the others. Thus, once submitted to the scrutiny of our General Assembly, the agreements on the non-use of force in international relations and on the prevention of nuclear war, which are timely and valid in principle, will gain a new normative dimension, thereby allaying the suspicion that they may become an instrument for the imposition of a tutelage system by the great Powers. The expectations aroused by the policy of ddtente will materialize only if the relaxation of tensions puts an end to the nuclear arms race and if effective measures of general and complete disarmament are not confined to the secret negotiation of agreements that do not go beyond disciplining the expansion and sophistication of nuclear devices.\n16.\tLike so many other Member States, Brazil hopes that the relaxation of tensions in critical areas will prevent the interrelated questions of disarmament and collective security from remaining intractable and unsettled in this forum, as they have been to date. The task of achieving disarmament and arms control was assigned to this General Assembly by the founders of our Organization as one of its primary responsibilities. I would be less than candid were I not to express my Government's disappointment at the lack of concrete results of disarmament negotiations, particularly during the last two years, both in this Assembly and in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Vitiated by its original flaws, the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has not really come into being.\n17.\tIn the specific case of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, we are led to the conclusion that it has increasingly eluded its tasks, or to say the least, that it has been incapable of carrying them out. Notwithstanding a much-touted spirit of conciliation, the meetings of the Conference and the negotiating process itself have been handicapped by political restrictions that have blocked the \npossibility of reaching meaningful decisions. What is the explanation for the frustrating results of so many efforts? It seems clear that the work of the Conference has not been as attuned to international trends as one would hope or wish. The ambiguous relationship between the General Assembly and the Conference, which has existed since the very inception of the Disarmament Committee \u2014 that is, since the Zorin-Stevenson Declaration of 1961' \u2014 may perhaps have been the greatest obstacle to our goal of making its work more responsive to the aspirations and desires of the community of nations. In reality, the important bilateral understandings between the major nuclear Powers have been arrived at, and continue to be arrived at, outside the Conference. As a result, obviously, the Conference is gradually transforming itself into a mere advisory body.\n18.\tBut the widening gap between the General Assembly and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament does not stem solely or exclusively from a question of deficient machinery or structure. As it happens, negotiations on the most vital disarmament issue, namely, nuclear disarmament, have proceeded without the involvement of all the nuclear Powers, as though the main responsibility for the arms race did not devolve upon all those Powers, individually and collectively. Unless effective steps are taken to ensure the presence and co-operation of all of them around the negotiating table, the quest for disarmament, irrespective of the negotiating machinery available, faces the threat of becoming politically irrelevant or being reduced to a subject of merely academic interest.\n19.\tBrazil believes, therefore, that the time has come for the General Assembly to rededicate itself with renewed vigour and zeal to the disarmament purposes enshrined in the Charter. This would thus appear to be the opportune time for a debate in the Political and Security Committee focusing on the existing machinery for negotiation on disarmament and on the methods of improving it. I am well aware that various proposals to that end have already been put forward and that they all deserve careful study. If a broad exchange of ideas is to prove of value, the General Assembly should consider the advisability of reconvening its own Disarmament Commission, where the full membership of this Organization is represented, to seek new and effective instruments for collective negotiation. The Disarmament Commission could act as a kind of preparatory body for the world disarmament conference.\n20.\tIn today's world, political security is intertwined with collective economic security. I have already dwelt on ddtente, which is undoubtedly one of the major political facts of the 1970s. If it is not allowed to degenerate by having its scope reduced to that of mere political accommodation, if it maintains momentum and creative spirit, the current relaxation of tensions may well open up new and extraordinary prospects for international economic co-operation. To that end, it should go hand in hand with the global objectives of expansion and economic development and should ensure economic security, with which political security will thrive.\n21.\tThe world's economy indeed is passing through a critical transitional period; in order to expand, international trade needs new rules to correct present-day distortions in this field; concurrently, the monetary crisis persists unchecked. It would be absurd and dangerous to suppose that minor plastic surgery or superficial measures, unrelated to each other and to the root cause of such evils, might eradicate them. I believe, none the less, that in these times,\n\nso deeply marked by a collective malaise in economic and financial relationships, the elements of disruption and distortion will finally, however paradoxically, arouse our consciences to the need for more effective world-wide solidarity and collective participation in the global enterprise of development and expansion.\n22.\tThe complexity of the world's economic and financial system and the growing importance of the external sectors of national economies have made of the adjustments and harmonization of existing diverse interests basic factors conditioning the global security process. The prevailing political situation and the series of bold initiatives which are being taken at the major conceptual and operative levels encourage us to believe that the embryonic awareness of joint responsibility for the settlement of important international economic and financial questions will begin to supersede the view that the affluence and well-being of a few can coexist indefinitely with the under-development of the destitute two thirds of mankind.\n23.\tThe trade negotiations which have begun in Tokyo under the auspices of the Genera] Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] should provide the world with an opportunity to ascertain whether the principles of solidarity and cooperation which ought to inspire a concerted effort towards development and expansion remain mere dreams, mere abstract expressions of contemporary political semantics, or whether, on the contrary, they will act as a driving force in the reformulation of the world trade system, so as to afford a fair and equitable division of labour, which is an essential condition for the growth of world productivity. The aggregate growth of the world product and its improved distribution call for a recognition of the need to accord special treatment to the developing world so that it may increase its participation in international trade and cease to be a minor, statistical and decreasing part of it. It would be a tragic mistake to believe that only or chiefly the interests of mature economies will be in play in those negotiations, or that the fate of the world's economy is linked merely to the harmonization of the currently conflicting conveniences of those who, as of now, weigh more decisively in international trade. If the multilateral trade negotiations confine themselves to these purposes, they will have rendered a disservice to the international community and will have the effect of curtailing the objectives of global development and expansion. This was the conviction that emerged from the last meeting of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination held in Brasilia, in connexion with the coordinated position of the Latin American countries in regard to these negotiations.\n24.\tI believe that, on another level, the same can be said for the crisis that assails the international monetary system and the need to reform it. It would be impossible and futile to conceive of this reform, which is so urgent, without taking into full account the claims of the developing countries, without seeing to it that their needs are met and without affording them solutions for their problems that neither the Bretton Woods Conference nor, more recently, the unproductive and short-lived Smithsonian Agreement could find.\n25.\tThe Brazilian Government' is gratified at seeing that the reinvigoration of the Economic and Social Council is taking place concurrently with events of such great importance in the trade and monetary fields. Now that it has gained renewed vigour and is disposed to exercise the normative role in the field of international economic relations envisaged for it by the Charter, the Council has demonstrated, both in New York and in Geneva, that it has resumed its functions within the panorama of the United Nations. These functions relate essentially to its right to oversee all matters pertinent to social, economic and financial co-operation, a right which will make it a central negotiating forum within our Organization.\n26.\tParallel to these institutional developments, which augur a more active participation of the United Nations in rendering international economic co-operation more dynamic, we have been given the opportunity in this year of 1973 to embark on a comprehensive review of the nature and range of this co-operation, through the first exercise of review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXVj] as concluded a month ago by the Economic and Social Council. The balance sheet for the first two years of the Decade is not encouraging, to say the least. The gap between developed and developing countries has widened, and even among the developing countries the performance of individual economies has been extremely uneven.\n27.\tWhile some very positive results have been registered in certain regions or countries, the over-all picture continues to be gloomy. What is worse, the flow of development assistance and financial transfers has lost the momentum reached in the late 1960s. The industrialized world seems more and more concerned with its own internal conflicts.\n28.\tBrazil has taken the initiative of reviving the concept of collective economic security. We see in this economic counterpart of political security the synthesis of our aspirations for a better world, one in which global development, expansion and social progress may become additional components of our concept of peace and security. The Economic and Social Council has already had the opportunity to begin a very timely debate on the subject and should now study the concept and its institutional and functional implications in greater depth.\n29.\tThe definition of this concept in terms of doctrine and practical potentialities requires prolonged examination, analysis and critical evaluation. On the basis of the existing interrelationship between political and economic security, one of the possibilities worthy of consideration is a study of ways and means to endow u\\e United Nations with the faculty to launch economic peace-making and peacekeeping operations to prevent or remedy critical situations. Once ideas have matured and the elements of the concept, together with its operational capabilities, are broadly identified and accepted, an effort at negotiation to that end would render the Organization even more active in one of the areas in which it has, it is only fair to say, distinguished itself in these 28 years of its existence.\n30.\tAmong the issues attracting the growing attention of the international community, there stand out the peaceful uses and practical applications of outer space in promoting development.\n31.\tThe Brazilian Government is convinced that in this area, as in so many others, it is indispensable that the interests of all countries be duly taken into account, regardless of their respective stages of development in the area of space research. Moreover, at this point, it is necessary to discipline activities in the fields of remote sensing by satellite of the natural resources of the earth and of space communications, so as to ensure strict respect of the sovereign rights of States. On the basis of these principles, which uphold, after all, our international system, it should be possible to ensure that the progressive results of the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space are equitably shared among the members of the world community.\n32.\tWhile addressing the Assembly last year, I referred broadly to the question of review of the United Nations Charter and I stated that, in the opinion of Brazil, the review or reform of the Charter remains an essential element in the process of the political and diplomatic reactivation of the United Nations. I consider it essential that the General Assembly at its next session finally assert its willingness to study this subject with imagination and political foresight in order to enable us to adjust our constitutional instrument to the realities and the needs of today's world. Brazil will continue to press this point precisely because it believes in the destiny of this Organization.\n33.\tThe unrestricted adherence to the ideals, purposes and principles of the United Nations is, and will remain, a fundamental premise of Brazil's foreign policy."

        "file_text": "\ufeff9.\tI am very pleased to be able to associate my delegation with the congratulations that have already been addressed to Ambassador Benites on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The fact that an eminent son of Latin America is this year presiding over our deliberations is a fitting tribute to the ever more important role that the countries and peoples of that continent are playing in world affairs.\n10.\tThe prevention of war is the primary task of the United Nations. War means human suffering. The wars in \nour time not only affect the men at the battlefront; they are also a threat to the entire civilian population. The longer a war, the greater the risk of ever-escalating violence and of the use of more brutal methods of warfare. There is also an increased risk that the war may spread to other countries. The international community is shocked by what is now happening in the Middle East. The immediate reaction must be a passionate appeal for peace.\n11.\tThe fact that war is now raging in the Middle East represents a failure for the United Nations. The area concerned has for more than 25 years attracted the special attention of the world Organization. The competent United Nations organs have throughout this period sought roads to a durable peace in the Middle East. The point of departure was the creation of the State of Israel, which was based on a decision of the General Assembly [resolution 181 (II)]. The existence of Israel is a long-established fact.\n12.\tEver since the founding of Israel the future of the Palestinian Arabs has been uncertain. Israel and its neighbours have lived in a state of permanent tension with repeated outbreaks of violence. The aim must be a settlement which takes account of the legitimate interests of all the peoples concerned and which establishes security for all States in the region within recognized frontiers. No solution to this problem will be found by one party or another demonstrating its military superiority. Whatever the outcome of the present war, the risk of renewed military confrontations will remain as long as the parties are not able to agree on a common political solution.\n13.\tThe guiding principles for such a solution are expressed in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), of November 1967. These principles retain their full validity. But time has been allowed to pass and the possibilities contained in that resolution have not been explored in earnest.\n14.\tWhat is now happening in the Middle East was preceded by large-scale acts of warfare and by serious violations of State sovereignty. It was also preceded by a wave of terror and counter-terror, which left no part of the world \\\"untouched. The fact that the United Nations so far has proved unable to solve the serious problems of international terrorism is to a large extent due to the lack of a settlement of the conflict in the Middle East.\n15.\tThe situation in the Middle East places a heavy responsibility on the parties to the conflict. But an important part of the responsibility also falls on the great Powers which for a long time have been deeply involved in the area. Several of them have played important roles in the military build-up. Now that full-scale war has broken out, they must contribute effectively towards a political solution of the conflict. At the same time, it is in the interest of everyone that the involvement of the super-Powers should not lead to a confrontation between them. If one dares discern any encouraging clement in today's sombre picture, it is the attitude of relative restraint that has been shown by the super-Powers during the present conflict. Their wish to pursue the policy of detente might facilitate the efforts to find a solution.\n16. There is every reason to welcome the desire of the super-Powers to replace, in their mutual relations, confrontations with dialogue. Their effort towards detente has manifested itself in various parts of the world.\n17.\tThe war that has ravaged Indo-China for so long has deeply engaged world opinion. It must be a source of satisfaction to us all that last January in Paris the parties to the war reached an agreement  leading to the withdrawal of the American forces and creating hopes of peace in all the Indo-Chinese States. Subsequently, the American bombings in Cambodia have also ceased under pressure from strong public opinion within and outside the United States. It has been possible to start reconstruction work in North Viet-Nam after the devastation of the war, and the parties in Laos have agreed to a peaceful settlement; but fighting still goes on in South Viet-Nam and in Cambodia. It is necessary to find a solution to the political problems of South VietNam in accordance with the stipulations of the Paris agreement. In the first instance, the many political prisoners must be released and the hundreds of thousands of refugees must be given the right and the possibility of returning to their homes. The hard-hit people of Cambodia must have the right to shape their own future free from outside interference.\n18.\tIn Europe the most important result of detente is that it has made a settlement between the two German States possible. This settlement has in turn been an important contribution to the continued process of detente. The Swedish Government is happy to welcome the entry of the two German States as Members of the world Organization. This event does not affect the right of the German people to achieve reunification by negotiation.\n19.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is an essential element of the continued trend towards detente. The Conference must be seen as a complement to the efforts of the United Nations to safeguard international peace. It is important to stress that the task of the Conference is to solve problems in Europe, not to promote the interests of European States in other parts of the world.\n20.\tThe very fact that 35 States, at the initial stage of that Conference in Helsinki, were able to agree on a programme for the continued work of the Conference is an important step forward. However, patience and hard work will be needed if the Conference is to fulfil what international opinion expects from it.\n21.\tI At the Conference Sweden has stressed that, in discussions on security in Europe, the question of disarmament cannot reasonably be ignored and that the policy of detente ought to be supported and confirmed by measures in the field of disarmament.\n22.\tAlthough they are not directly connected with the Conference, preparations are now under way for negotiations on the reduction of armed forces in Central Europe. The Swedish Government hopes that in this field concrete results will be achieved that will be designed to increase security, not least for the small European States.\n23.\tAs regards the efforts within the framework of the United Nations to reach results in the field of disarmament, the situation is deeply discouraging. For the second consecutive year the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament comes empty-handed to the General Assembly. Ten years ago the partial test-ban Treaty1 was signed. In that Treaty the parties clearly committed themselves to trying, by continued negotiations, to achieve a complete ban on all nuclear tests. In spite of the unequivocal request made by the General Assembly last year, no progress has been made towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\n24.\tThe General Assembly should now carefully consider by what methods new impetus could be given to the disarmament work. This is a task in which all Member States must actively involve themselves. It appears more and more absurd that such a large part of the material and scientific resources that should be seen as common to all mankind are now allocated to the arms race.\n25.\tSo long as we are not successful in our endeavours to avoid armed conflicts, it is all the more urgent to use every opportunity of limiting brutality and of protecting non- combatants. The rules of international law have not been adjusted to new types of conflict and new weapons or to new methods of warfare created by an accelerating evolution of military technology. The world conference to be held in Geneva early next year to deal with these matters  is therefore of greatest importance.\n26.\tThe monstrous effects of air warfare on civilians must be limited by a ban on area bombing and on acts of destruction which threaten the survival of the civilian population.\n27.\tThe conference should not content itself with a mere confirmation of the present general ban on the use of conventional weapons which cause unnecessary suffering or of weapons which, by their construction or use, lead to indiscriminate destruction. To be truly effective, such general rules must be supplemented by special bans, for instance on napalm and other incendiary weapons, as well as on the equivalent in our time of the dumdum bullet, namely, high- velocity weapons.\n28.\tIn southern Africa the demands of the peoples for freedom and self-determination are countered by oppression and by an increasingly brutal use of force. There are ever more frequent reports about Portugal's inhuman warfare in Africa. Testimony concerning the massacres in Mozambique last summer caused the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to demand an international investigation. Consultations are now under way among Member States to prepare for such an investigation to be decided upon by the General Assembly. The pressure of public opinion against the colonial policy of Portugal grows ever stronger. The increased humanitarian assistance to the liberation movements in Africa is an expression of international opposition to the remnants of colonialism.\n29.\tThe General Assembly has before it the report of the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa, held at Oslo from 9 to 14 April 1973 [A/9061], organized by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We are confident that the Assembly will welcome this report as an important contribution to the discussion of how to solve the problem in southern Africa.\n30.\tPortugal has ignored the request of the Security Council to start negotiations with all parties concerned for the purpose of enabling the African peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. It is now up to the Security Council to decide what attitude to take in the face of this open defiance of its own earlier request.\n31.\tThe situation in southern Africa is particularly serious because of the co-operation between Portugal, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. This co-operation grows more evident every day in the political, economic and military fields. The sanctions against Southern Rhodesia are being systematically violated by Portugal and South Africa. The people of Namibia is still being denied the right to self- determination, which has been explicitly recognized by the world Organization. In South Africa the policy of apartheid is being pursued and the growing opposition of the majority is met with new acts of violence.\n32. All States which are dedicated to human rights, democracy and national independence ought to find it natural to give moral and material support to the realization of these principles in southern Africa.\n33.\tIn recent years world opinion has become increasingly aware of the use of torture in connexion with armed conflicts and internal political conflicts in different countries. The efforts to ban torture must never stop. One of the achievements of the great French Revolution was an explicit ban on torture. Since then, nearly two centuries have passed, but the fact remains that these abominable methods are accepted by Governments in various parts of the world. In its Universal Declaration on Human Rights the United Nations has decreed an absolute ban on torture. This ban has been repeated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]. All Members of the United Nations voted in favour of this ban, which, consequently, is now part of common international law. If all States ratify this Covenant, protection against torture will be strengthened, especially if individuals are given the right to appeal to the international body to be established in accordance with the Covenant. And we should also consider whether, in order to make the ban effective, the question of torture should not be discussed also as a separate matter, not only as part of the said Covenant.\n34.\tNot so many years ago Governments in the East and in the West proudly pointed to the fact that they had abolished capital punishment. Only two years ago the General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing the desirability of the abolition of capital punishment in all countries [resolution 2857 (XXVI)]. The renaissance of capital punishment, which appears to be under way, can only be described as a historic setback. It is important that the United Nations\nbe instrumental in creating a strong public opinion against superstitious ideas as to the effectiveness of capital punishment and against the contempt for human life of which the application of capital punishment is an expression.\n35.\tThe defence of human rights is clearly linked to the defence of peace. It is therefore a concern of all States. For this Organization, the protection of human rights has been a central issue ever since it was founded. But we can make no progress in this field without the support of a vigilant public opinion which condemns all forms of violence. The strivings for detente must not lead us to refrain from creating such an opinion. When we succeed in crystallizing this opinion in international recommendations or conventions which gain adherence from a significant number of countries, we are then making an important contribution to the long-term stabilization of peace. Essential progress in this area has already been achieved through various United Nations conventions and through the growing number of adhering countries.\n36.\tThe use of force within States can manifest itself in many forms. Particularly serious are those cases in which brutal military intervention in favour of privileged groups is directed against Governments which strive to bring about a more equitable society. The latest example is Chile, where the fight against the popularly elected Government finally took the form of naked military violence. Economic interests outside the country also contributed to the evolution which led to the coup. Salvador Allende has given his life for the sake of the poor. Members of his government have been arrested, Parliament has been dissolved and political parties have been banned. Resistance-fighters are being persecuted and killed.\n37.\tEvents in Chile have aroused a wave of protest around the world. That this has happened is important. That the protest does not die down is important. This Organization and its Member States are faced with the immediate and pressing obligation to assist the victims of oppression. A large-scale humanitarian endeavour is needed to provide\n\u00ab. safe haven for refugees of various nationalities. The appeal of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to Member States to receive refugees from Chile should be met by their speedy and positive reaction.\n38.\tThe developing countries, which represent an overwhelming part of the world population, are today struggling with enormous political and economic problems. The readiness of the industrialized countries to support them in their efforts is clearly inadequate. In fact, the policies of the rich countries tend to counteract in important respects the goal of international equality. As long as the deep gulf between the industrialized and the developing countries remains, there will be unrest and tension, which can spark new conflicts. From this point of view too it is urgent that the development strategy of the United Nations be pursued forcefully.\n39.\tThe General Assembly meets at a time when the distribution and utilization of the world's resources confront us with ever more serious problems. Catastrophic famine occurs ever more frequently in certain parts of the world. Support for the World Food Programme must therefore be strengthened. Immediate action is required to create, reserves of foodstuffs. The proposals made by the Director- General of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO\\ should be fully supported. It is the hope of the Swedish Government that these proposals will be made more concrete at the FAO conference later this autumn. The proposal of the United States Secretary of State for the convening of a global food conference in 1974 under the auspices of the United Nations [2124th meeting] is welcome as part of the efforts to attract world attention to the problem of hunger. The countries and regions hit by famine have in common, besides difficult climatic conditions, underdevelopment and generally low productivity. A long- term solution to the food problem of the developing countries can only be reached through increased production of foodstuffs within these countries. Such increased production is in turn dependent upon fundamental structural reforms combined with social and economic rural development.\n40.\tThere is strongly increasing awareness of the dangers which threaten the human environment. The immediate threats are greatest where industrial development has been most rapid. As environmental standards are raised, industrialization in the developing countries is burdened by a cost factor which today's rich nations did not have to cope with in the corresponding phase of their history. The rising cost of energy creates similar problems. The questions of environment and energy demonstrate the interdependence of nations, but views and interests must inevitably vary according to the particular conditions of each country. In the environmental field the United Nations has already made important contributions towards the formulation of an international policy. This work can now be pursued through the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme. Also in the case of the energy crisis there should be a role for the United Nations in searching for solutions which take account of the interests of the smaller and economically weaker States.\n41.\tMany of the problems, which I have only been able to outline in my statement, are being studied and discussed very thoroughly within the United Nations family. This takes place against the background of the new possibilities and risks created by rapid technological development. When the world Organization\u00bbincreasingly devotes itself to those questions, it is the expression of a realistic awareness of the interrelationship between economics and politics,\nI between the distribution of wealth and peace, between freedom from hunger and freedom from fear. Perhaps many people regard it as over ambitious when our Organization strives to encompass this entire field. But an Organization whose task it is to represent all mankind cannot but involve itself in all the problems which concern the peoples in the various parts of the world. The solving of these problems is the prerequisite for the realization of the goals which are contained in the Charter of this Organization. The United Nations is to serve man's longing for peace both by efforts to prevent breaches of the peace and by promoting developments which lessen the risk of conflicts. In the settlement of problems which concern the basic living conditions of people everywhere, all States, large and small, have a right to participate. The task of the United Nations is therefore more important than ever."

        "file_text": "\ufeff117.\t Mr. President, it is my privilege to add my voice to those of the speakers who preceded me in congratulating you on your election to the high office of the presidency. I would also wish to express my hope and belief that under your wise stewardship the work of this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly will be carried out with maturity and expedition. I am delighted that a distinguished son of Latin America is now at the helm.\n118.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski, for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly.\n119.\tWe are meeting today in a situation of ominous gravity. Full-fledged fighting is raging once again in the Middle East, underscoring the enormity of Israeli aggression and its seizure of the national soils of three Member States \u2014 Egypt, Syria and Jordan \u2014 since the earlier aggression of 5 June 1967.\n120.\tPrecious lives, representing the cream of their countries, are being offered for the national survival in dignity and peace.\n121.\tIt is unnecessary and irrelevant to attempt to refute Israeli allegations as to how the firing started. It started as a culmination of a condition of continuing aggression and occupation. Suffice it here to state that fighting is raging on the national soils of Egypt and Syria and that the sons of these sisterly countries are operating in their own homelands.\n122.\tThe blood of those innocent youths stains the hands of the Israeli leadership, whose motto all along has been, as this Assembly knows all too well, that might is right; that the only measure of justice is the intensity of fire-power and the intricacies of modern mechanical gadgets.\n123.\tWhatever the fortunes of war might be, the United Nations represented in this Assembly should continue to shoulder the supreme responsibility for ensuring that Israeli aggression shall be terminated and that the territories of Egypt, Syria and Jordan, occupied for well over six years, shall be restored to their rightful owners.\n124.\tIn the meantime, let us all hope and pray that the long ordeal which has been imposed upon our countries by Israel's wanton aggression, will at last come to an end, enabling our peoples to resume their onward march on the road to progress, development, and peaceful existence.\n125.\tThe concerns of the world are also our concerns. What I had intended to speak on in this general debate encompassed the whole spectrum of your Assembly's concerns, political, economic and humanitarian. But the urgency of the events in my area necessitates a departure from the conventional review of international concerns and achievements to a more direct focusing on the present agonies of our peoples at war.\n'.26. It is agonizingly hard for us to go on repeating year in and year out the painful story of the aggression to which the peoples of the Middle East have fallen victim since the 1967 conflict. It also must be agonizing to this world body to be reminded constantly of its inability to deal effectively with it. And yet, at the cost of repetition, the facts as they stand today must be reaffirmed in this general debate on the world situation. What I intend to state I will do so without acrimony or rhetoric. It is rather the facts, the bare facts, as they exist today and they are as follows:\n127.\tFirst, since June 1967 Israel has been in occupation of the national soil of Jordan, Egypt and Syria, and under its military rule it enslaves over a million of the indigenous inhabitants of the occupied lands. This is in addition to the one and a half million Palestinian Arabs rendered homeless refugees by the gross injustice and convulsions of 1948. It is a sad epilogue to the great chapter of liberation which the United Nations has witnessed and has helped to forge through over the past 25 years.\n128.\tSecondly, notwithstanding the fundamental principles of the Charter and the multitude of definitive resolutions of the United Nations in opposing conquest, Israel adamantly refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories. In the early years of the occupation, the refusal was based on procedural and mechanical pleas. When these became no longer tenable, Israel came out unrestrained in its penchant for territorial expansion. No longer are the claims for annexation the irresponsible urges of the fanatics and the few. They recently have been incorporated into the official platform of the ruling party, in preparation for the forthcoming elections. If one adds up the territories claimed by the various members of Israel's ruling establishment, they would amount to practically the whole of the occupied lands.\n129.\tThirdly, virtually every part of the occupied lands has been earmarked for eventual, if not immediate, annexation and colonization, either on grounds of alleged security or of the Zionist mythology. Although the weight of colonization has fallen more heavily on some parts than on others, it is now generally conceded that the tempo of colonization is less inhibited by considerations of international law than by the absorptive capacity of the new colonial Power.\n130.\tWithin the over-all strategy of colonization, programmed in practical stages, Israel feverishly is engaged in absorbing and settling the occupied lands. Settlements are mushrooming everywhere, whether in occupied Egypt, Syria or Jordan. The national character of these centuries-old Arab lands is being destroyed systematically.\n131.\tJerusalem, the city of peace and of eternal history, to which hundreds of millions of people belonging to all religions and denominations look with the reverence which it deserves, is being disfigured beyond recognition, the victim of parochial and heedless fanaticism. And while this blasphemy against civilization continues unabated, the world watches with subdued anger and\nhelplessness. Even the Security Council's specific resolutions to save the city have remained no more than ink on paper.\n132.\tThe Israelis are carrying out these acts of despoliation, confiscation of lands and property and the eviction of the inhabitants of Jerusalem under one false pretext or the other. It is a situation where the occupying Power is devouring by every means the occupied city and destroying its historical, cultural, physical, and human character. What else can this be but the most naked act of conquest and annexation which heeds nothing but its own brute force and its utter insensitivity to the beliefs and welfare of the world at large?\n133.\tIt should be recalled that immediately after the 1967 conflict one of the first acts of the General Assembly was the adoption of a resolution [2253 (ES-V)] for the preservation of the historic character and the status quo of the City as a trust of civilization. That trust has been totally abused, the resolution callously ignored. Should the United Nations continue to watch in suspended animation while the process of devouring the Holy City and its people continues unchecked? But the suffering of occupation does not end there.\n134.\tThe economies of the occupied territories are being made appendages for the purpose of serving the designs of occupation and the eventual absorption of those territories and their peoples. Large areas of arable land on the west bank of the river Jordan are forcibly made idle by the ever-expanding \\\"military zones\\\" and Israeli armed settlements. The gun is replacing the tractor, and the farmers are left with no alternative but to be herded into Israeli farms and industries, only to be discarded when the time is ripe for their eventual expulsion.\n135.\tNo one knows better the direct destructive effects of the occupation than my own country and countrymen. Jordan is a country torn asunder by occupation. Well over one third of its citizens are the victim, of that occupation. Hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and residents of other occupied Arab lands have formed another category of misery on its eastern bank, under the name of \\\"displaced persons\\\". The economic and social burdens of the occupation are as heavy as the pain of dismemberment is acute: Jordan continues to bear the enormous burden of supporting by every means, economic and otherwise, the determined efforts of its citizens to survive economically, culturally and demo-graphically under an occupation of displacement.\n\n\n136. Fourthly, less tangible but perhaps psychologically more devastating is the climate of extreme uncertainty that surrounds the lives of the masses of people in their occupied homeland. Noone can be sure when the dual pressure of Zionist xenophobia and massive Israeli immigration will create conditions which will transform the policy of gradual displacement into one of outright expulsion. The perpetual fear of such an occurrence is understandably traumatic. The sense of living on borrowed time can end only with termination of the occupation. \n\n137. Fifthly, it may be argued by those who have not had the opportunity to follow closely the sequence of events that a mere compilation of grievances, no matter how just, does not in itself lead to a solution.  the answer is that in November 1967 Jordan accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which outlines the basis of just settlement in the Middle East. By that resolution, the Arab parties accepting it committed themselves to the establishment of a lasting peace in a framework of Israeli withdrawal, mutual guarantees and a just solution to the tragedy of the first victims of Israeli violence, the homeless and dispossessed Palestine Arabs.\n\n138. Within that context, we extended full cooperation to the sincere and dedicated efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, the Special representative of the Secretary-General, who has been entrusted with the task of working with the parties the modalities of implementation. \n\n139. When the secretary-general, Kurt Waldheim, undertook his commendable initiative and visited the area recently, Jordan expressed a genuine and unmistaken resolve to work for a just and lasting peace, provided our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not tampered with. But at every juncture in the process of the peace making, the Israeli government obstructed the process. Israel's negativism has been widely revealed to the world at large despite its deliberate obscurantism, as Israel's designs against the occupied lands unfolded in their full ferocity. it is clear now that Israel, in spite of all its claims to the contrary, is not seeking a just and lasting settlement, but territorial expansion and political hegemony in the area. \n\n140. Moreover, it is becoming the adjacent Arab countries that instead of making  amends for the ruthless dismemberment the displacement of its people, Israel is only determined to do more of the same.\n141. We listened the other day to the statement of the Foreign Minister of Israel before this assembly, in which he outlined Israel's policies towards the tragic situation prevailing in the Middle East. That statement, of course, contained no new departures and revelations, except for its attempt to use language to conceal real aims. It would be futile exercise to engage in polemics, and equally futile to dismiss lightly a statement so fraught with the most serious policy contents. Let me cite just one examples in the manipulation of semantics to which this Assembly was subjected by Israel's Foreign Minister. \n142. The Charter of the aggression against States and the annexation of their national soil. And yet, because Israel occupies the territories of three Member states and has evidently no intention of relinquishing such occupation, the Foreign Minister of Israel declared, using the technique of the double negative, that Israel did not declare that it did not intend to relinquish all or even most of the occupied territories. In plain English it means that Israel does intend to annex portions of the occupied lands and enslave their people. This is the crux of the matter. \n\n\n143.\tThat those portions already victims of annexation and colonization include Jerusalem \u2014 a continually expanding Jerusalem: to the north, to the south, to the east and to the west, one which practically devours the heartland of the occupied west bank and leaves the rest as virtually isolated pockets \u2014 does not seem to evoke much remorse in the Israeli assessment. That the lands annexed or earmarked for annexation include large areas of the fertile Jordan valley, to serve as a security belt, does not seem to impel the Israeli Foreign Minister to ask himself about the hundreds of thousands of human souls for whom such exercises in map-drawing mean a death sentence in the form of displacement, suffering, enslavement and alienation of themselves and of generations yet unborn and the loss of their past, present and future.\n\n144.\tThe trouble is that, underlying the whole of Israel's statement is an arrogant dismissal of any consideration of humanity or of other people's entitlement to God's grace and justice on this earth. The aggrieved inhabitants are simply impediments to be removed or shuttled around \u2014  not human beings to be accorded the inalienable human rights to which they are entitled, as are other human beings and communities.\n145.\tThe Israeli Foreign Minister told this Assembly that the Israelis have their roots deeper in that region, in tongue and in spirit, than all the rest. Do we have to remind Israel that when the Hebrew tribes set foot in Palestine some 2,000 years ago, and for a short interlude, they did not descend upon an empty wasteland? They came to the highly developed land of the forefathers of the present victims of the Israeli onslaught, only to marvel in exhilaration at the land of milk and honey which was the product of the toil of the indigenous inhabitants of the land. Palestine was their homeland ages before those tribes ever came there, and has remained their homeland up to the present day \u2014 or remained so at least until the Israelis, by brute force and violence, caused their displacement over the past 25 years.\n146.\tJordan and its Arab brethren have been faced since the occupation with a situation which cannot be accepted. They are for a just and lasting peace, but they cannot accept as its price the loss of their national soil or the permanent enslavement of their people. The Charter of the United Nations precludes any such diktat; the resolutions of the United Nations preclude it no less vehemently. And the spirit of the age marching forward to rid humanity of colonial domination and conquest is irrevocably aligned against it.\n147.\tWhile we are adamant in our determination to hold on to our rights and national soil, we have a clear vision of how a just settlement can be established. These are its bases: first, Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in June 1967; secondly, action to redress the injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian Arabs who were forced out of their homes in Palestine and dispossessed in 1947-1948 and whose rights have been recognized repeatedly since 1948 by the General Assembly; and thirdly, the enforcement of the principles\nof a just peace envisaged in and defined by the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n148.\tPeace, to be lasting, must be based on justice. Without that no genuine peace can be achieved.\n149.\tI shall end my statement, as I opened it, by urging the General Assembly, to unite in action to end the tragic ordeal of the peoples of the Middle East. The way to end, it is not by side-tracking the fundamental issues which have given rise to it over the past 25 years, and more specifically over the past six years.\n150.\tThe fundamental principles involved are clear-cut and overwhelming. They are sustained by the Charter which pledges support for every Member State which falls victim to aggression.\n151.\tLet us, therefore, unite all our efforts and our wills to save the Middle East, which is the cradle of civilization, from the scourge of war and aggression by reaffirming justice, freedom and peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeff210.\t Mr. President, your unanimous election to preside over this new session of the General Assembly is a token of recognition of your qualities as a diplomat, your competence in international affairs, and of the zeal and interest that you have always shown in your participation in dealing with the complex problems that confront our Organization. Thus, I wish my first words before this General Assembly to go beyond the mere ritualistic dictates of the usual courtesy, and serve to pay the tribute of my delegation to one who for so long has been an honour to his country, to Latin America and to the United Nations itself.\n211.\tThis election, futhermore, fills us with personal satisfaction, since we know of the great affection that Mr. Benites \u2014 the man of the Pacific \u2014 feels for the land of the River Plate, where he served for so long and left the indelible mark of his friendship and his brilliant work. I whole-heartedly trust that success will continue to crown your endeavours in the delicate duties that you have assumed, and I am happy to assure you of the full cooperation of my delegation in your important task.\n212.\tI am vested with the representation of a Government that is the result of the express will of a people that has recently, and by an overwhelming majority, endorsed the three banners of social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty. That firm determination bespeaks the irreversible commitment to eliminate for all time the socio-political systems of dependency.\n213.\tMy country is going through an unprecedented historic period whose starting point lies in the union of all Argentineans around the objective of national liberation. By means of the effective exercise of representative democracy, the Government and the people of Argentina have set out, at one and together, on the road that is to lead us to the establishment of a social order in which man may fulfil himself wholly, safeguarded by law against any form of exploitation. His rights and aspirations to a happy life will thus merge with those of the community.\n214.\tAll have a place in this great undertaking, from those who resolutely embrace the cause of justicialismo to those who advocate other tendencies, but who, in an atmosphere of peace and legality, are ready to be partners in the common effort.\n215.\tArgentina is fully aware that respect for the plurality of ideas and obedience to the popular will are indispensable conditions in which to build a community organized on the basis of solid and lasting values.\n216.\tIn this spirit, my Government has decided to carry out a peaceful revolution \u2014 one that will profoundly change the Argentine society in order to meet the desires for justice and liberation that imbue our people.\n217.\tThis new orientation which guides the Argentine Government within our borders is also projected beyond\nthem and will govern our conduct within the framework of our international relations.\n218.\tOur foreign thoughts, when crossing our borders, must be directed first of all to our own Latin America. We are convinced that in the future, we shall have to unite our forces and our resources in order to confront the difficulties that lie in wait for any who seek to ensure their freedom of action in a world beset by new imperialist threats. That convergence of efforts must logically start with those of us that possess the most obviously similar characteristics; and despite their powerful national personalities, our countries of Latin America do, in fact, possess a significant and real highest common denominator.\n219.\tSince the very dawn of our emancipation we have been divided by varied outside interests in order that they might more easily obtain supplies of the raw materials so necessary for the progress of more advanced societies. I am most disturbed to have to state here that that quest for profit has not been abandoned and that certain power centres \u2014  Governments and multinational corporations \u2014 still have their sights set on the vast region which our countries make up.\n220.\tFor that reason, now more than ever, union is a categorical imperative today. We must labour without flagging with one idea in mind: a single and indissoluble Latin America. We know that that cannot be achieved overnight, but we also know that if that is not our aim the end result will be an even greater splintering and thus a weakening that will render us unable to defend ourselves against any form of ambition on the part of foreign Powers.\n221.\tEach must play his vital role in this process. It was in Latin America itself that the legal principle of the sovereign equality of States gained the fullest respect, but unfortunately that very principle has far too often been set aside. On the strength of mature awareness we can today reaffirm that all the States of Latin America must contribute to the common cause on a footing of absolute parity.\n222.\tWe share similar needs and identical hopes. Nor are the obstacles to our progress different, We are all players in the same drama: that of living with searing needs unsatisfied in a continent flowing with resources. Thus it is hard to imagine individual solutions, unless we are ready to make do with mere palliatives. Faced by common problems, our solutions must be general and for the whole and framed by the ideas of international social justice to which all the peoples meeting here aspire.\n223.\tVery possibly some country may alone manage a beginning of liberation. But it can never secure it if it is isolated from the rest. That is why we see the process of Latin American liberation as a joint undertaking intended to benefit all.\n224.\tNo ideological barrier must be allowed to prevail over motives sprung from the very roots of our peoples. We can assume our role in world affairs only through pluralist understanding and union.\n225.\tThere can be no doubt that we are heading towards an international system possessing continental features, and\nto reach our goal we must fulfil our responsibilities with faith and optimism and by bringing to bear all the energies and reserves of the Latin American people. It is only thus that we shall all together approach our target, which has been defined for us by our common origin and an inevitable historical imperative. On this road we are prepared to cooperate with those who understand our yearnings and desires and wish to make their open and sincere contribution to the building of a politically, economically and socially just continent.\n226.\tOur concern over the future of Latin America fits squarely within the wider concept of the third world.\n227.\tWe are deeply convinced that the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America are basically facing the same problems.\n228.\t\\\"Nations rich or poor\\\"; \\\"developed or developing countries\\\"; \\\"advanced or backward nations\\\"; \\\"the haves and the have-nots\\\" \u2014 all are similar ways of disguising a single, crude and dramatic reality: domination or dependency.\n229.\tBut to shatter that alternative and obtain more just and equitable conditions the third world does possess a powerful instrument \u2014 solidarity. Numerically we are many, and we are imbued with principles that arm us with unchallengeable moral strength. But we must counteract our own lack of individual power by bringing to bear the vitality of our unity.\n230.\tThat process is already under way. It must now be extended and consolidated in all fields. But the struggle is not and will not be simple. Powerful interests will continue to fan futile divisions and to create artificial antagonisms.\n231.\tIt would be paradoxical for our countries to lose their united stand precisely at the time when the great Powers are strengthening their understandings to preserve their privileges.\n232.\tTo think exclusively in terms of individual interests would be to open the way to the designs of those who oppose our progress. It would be even worse to conspire against the common interest, preservation of which is our sole guarantee of survival as truly independent States.\n233.\tThe profound changes taking place in the political, economic and social structures of nations point, to the threshold of a new stage in the development of mankind.\n234.\tTo be worthy of the evolution that is altering the concept of modern life to its very foundations, we must muster all our energies to create the kind of society that our national, regional and cultural idiosyncrasies require, rejecting the foreign patterns foisted on us from outside, which are nothing but the refurbished attempts of certain Powers to fulfil their own desires of economic or ideological domination.\n235.\tThat possibility was foreseen by the leader of justicialismo, Lieutenant-General Juan Peron, when, three decades ahead of today's reality, he defined the humanistic and revolutionary doctrine of the \\\"third position\\\", which,\napart from depicting a special plan for the organization of the Argentine community, represented the first open confrontation on an international level of the imperialisms of the left and of the right.\n236.\tFortunately, today, a number of nations share this viewpoint, and proof was clearly given at the historic meeting recently held in Algiers, the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries, where the non-aligned nations reiterated their unwavering determination to continue and to strengthen that movement, based on principles that are very comparable to those of the \\\"third position\\\".\n237.\tThe Government of the people of Argentina did not want to remain outside that undertaking which constitutes one of the greatest joint movements for liberation, cooperation and solidarity of this century. And so it brought the Argentine Republic into the movement of the non-aligned nations as a full member, and pledged all its efforts to contribute to the triumph of its objectives.\n238.\tThis is a good opportunity to reiterate our appreciation for the warm welcome given and the many signs of friendship shown to the Argentine delegation on the occasion of its admission to the movement. We should also like to place on record our thanks for the unanimous understanding and support shown on a number of questions which my country raised for examination by that great gathering.\n239.\tIn the field of shared natural resources and the human environment, to which my country attaches special importance, that support was particularly significant. Guided by noble motives of solidarity and co-operation, while it reaffirmed the principle of sovereignty over nations' own natural resources, the Conference recognized the principle of solidarity and of co-ordinated and joint action in the exploitation and use of the natural resources shared by two or more States. Thus the Algiers Declaration  sets forth the principle that co-operation between countries in the exploitation of their common resources shall be on the basis of a system of information and prior consultation, all within the framework of the normal relations existing between the States concerned.\n240.\tThe spirit of Algiers led also to the establishment of the rights of the coastal State to the exploitation of the natural resources of its seas and the protection of other related interests to a distance of 200 miles. For the first time, a group composed of the majority of the international community has proclaimed this important root of an agreement, which is in turn complemented by the recognition of the need to legislate on the regime of the continental shelf beyond the 200-mile limit in accordance with existing international law.\n241.\tIn Algiers, Argentina felt it was among brothers. But even more, it felt that it was understood, and in turn felt that it understood, in their diversity, the aspirations of all the other non-aligned nations. And yet, above even that, Argentina felt that it was a partner in an integrating current that was destined to change the future of the world.\n242. But, to conclude these pleasant reminiscences, may I publicly express our thanks to the Government and the people of Algeria for the generous hospitality they showed us and for their untiring efforts to ensure the success of that outstanding Conference.\n,243. The bipolar world, which was the main characteristic of the last decades, ceased to exist with the appearance of new centres of power in Europe and Asia. The agreements recently concluded among the great Powers are further positive elements that have contributed greatly to clarifying the world picture. We were among the first to welcome those events that put an end once and for all to the cold war, charged as it was with so many threats to mankind, and mark the beginning of a new and constructive era in the life of peoples. Convergence and co-operation among those who until yesterday had seemed irreconcilable antagonists are doubtless an indispensable condition for the reduction of tensions in the world.\n244.\tHowever, for the atmosphere of peace to be stable and to benefit all, this convergence must not be achieved behind the backs or at the expense of the other countries. World opinion today could not tolerate it if, under the guise of a sound policy of detente, the great Powers were to be hammering out an up-to-date version of Yalta \u2014 in other words, if they were readying themselves for a new distribution of spheres of influence over which to wield their respective hegemonies.\n245.\tThe third world cannot be left out when the great Powers adopt their decisions, for those decisions must, obviously, affect it either directly or indirectly. In order to clarify the doubts and disquiet felt by many Governments it is essential to allow them to play their true role in the search for solutions to various problems.\n246.\tAnd this participation can best be played out within the United Nations. But it must be a United Nations that is revitalized and strengthened in order fully to carry out its noble and worthy objectives. It is an irrefutable fact that the body created in 1945 does not meet the needs of the present day. And this can be clearly understood from the excellent introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization submitted by the Secretary-General. This outstanding document also makes clear that the Organization can be improved in many of its aspects, so that it may achieve, in the words of Mr. Waldheim, \\\"a potential unmatched by any human institution which has existed before\\\".\n247.\tPersonally, we consider that very soon it will be necessary to make certain changes in order to achieve a true democratization that will be more consonant with its growing universality. Among others, there is the basic change of eliminating the privileges that the five great Powers assumed in San Francisco.\n248.\tThis desire to democratize and update the Organization is particularly timely when the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have just joined our ranks \u2014 surely a significant event that is a source of satisfaction to those of us who have always advocated the universality of the United Nations.\n249.\tWe most cordially welcome the two representatives of the German people, with whom we are tied by a deep and traditional friendship. I also wish to welcome among us the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, a new independent State that is now added to our Latin American family.\n250.\tWe have asserted that we are now entering on a stage of international relations that is lit with the sign of cooperation and understanding. We are gratified at the promising atmosphere thus engendered and would hope that it might be extended to all corners of the earth. Yet we are very much afraid that the continuation of certain existing conflicts may jeopardize the encouraging prospects before us.\n251.\tOur first concern is over the continued existence of anachronistic colonial issues that still upset world peace. The situation is particularly serious in the African continent where, in some areas, colonial oppression at its worst is still being practised. The eradication of colonialism \u2014 to use Mr. Waldheim's words again \u2014 is \\\"painfully slow\\\" [ibid., p. 4].\n252.\tIn the Territories under Portuguese domination, the obstinacy of the colonial Power has created an arena for a harsh war \u2014 gestated over many years because of the unyielding attitude of those possessing the duty to assist those peoples to achieve their destiny of independence and sovereign integration in the community of nations.\n253.\tThis same picture is seen in Southern Rhodesia and in Namibia, where the minorities refuse to yield to the legitimate rights of the subjected peoples.\n254.\tAt a time when man is working under the sign of a spirit of liberation, the peoples of those Territories must be guaranteed the unconditional exercise of their right to self-determination in order to put an end to a cruelly anachronistic situation, whose anti-historic subsistence is an affront to the very essence of all human beings.\n255.\tThe practices of apartheid in southern Africa add one of the most reprehensible aspects to colonialism: that of an inhuman racism that is obsolete and yet has been raised to the level of an institution. In this way the Government of South Africa is showing utter contempt for the most basic human rights that this world Organization has advocated since its very inception.\n256.\tThe doctrine of justicialismo of my Government, interpreting the deepest essence of the Argentine community, most vehemently rejects any type of discrimination which, although always unacceptable, becomes inconceivable when made the official policy of the State, to the detriment of the majority of the population.\n257.\tThe Argentine Government sympathizes with all the millions of victims of apartheid and with those who fight to eradicate it. We shall take every appropriate opportunity to give proof of our will to co-operate actively in the international effort to put an end to such a situation.\n258.\tOur concern ranges over the entire gamut of colonial situations that still persist in the world and overshadow relations among States. Within this context, the attention of the Argentine Republic is centred on the question of the Malvinas Islands.\n259.\tIn a note addressed to the Secretary-General by the Argentine Government on 15 August 1973 [A/9121 and Corr.11, we described the prevailing state of the question and the stagnation in which the matter finds itself due to the stand adopted by the British Government on the negotiations urged by General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in order that they might settle the dispute between our two countries over the sovereignty of the islands. Those negotiations, for whose renewal we have always been ready, must take into account the special nature of the problem and the unique characteristics of the issue which make it impossible for generalizations or for analogies to be invoked.\n260.\tWhen a country sees its territorial integrity dismembered by an act of pure aggression typically imperialist in style, when the authorities of a Territory first, and then the population itself, are ousted and the State to which the Territory belongs has never at any moment accepted that usurpation, then it becomes impossible for anyone to tolerate the subsistence, at a time when the United Nations is in full spate, of a remnant of the nineteenth century power-politics as typical as is that of the Malvinas Islands.\n261.\tNo one is unaware of the subterfuge indulged in to pretend to consolidate the colonial aggression by evicting the original population and replacing them by others brought in by the imperialist Power. The tragic experience of the past and what is today taking place in southern Africa and the Middle East are present-day examples of those reprehensible practices,\n262.\tIt is thus paradoxical for the Government of the United Kingdom, after its criticisms of resolution 1514 (XV), which spelt the culmination of the process of the elimination of colonialism, today to invoke it in part and with ulterior motives, for no other purpose than to support one of the many episodes of colonial expansion of that country.\n263.\tDespite the obstacles that the United Kingdom may try to place in the road to the decolonization of the Malvinas Islands, our position towards the population of the islands has not varied and is always fully consonant with the decisions of the United Nations. The interests of the persons at present inhabiting the islands will be fully taken into account, according to the spirit and the letter of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX), as well as of the recent resolution unanimously adopted by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on 21 August 1973 [see A/9023/Rev.l, chap. XXVII, sect. E], The Argentine Government has already given valid proof of its policy by means of a series of measures that ease the communications and contribute to the welfare of the settlers on the Islands, and reiterates, from this rostrum, its desire to give wide and adequate guarantees for the interests of those settlers once the islands have been returned to the national heritage of the Argentine Republic.\n264.\tMy country has adhered \u2014 and continues to adhere \u2014  to the path of negotiation with the occupying Power, but is forced to state that the procedure cannot be indefinitely\nprolonged, thus serving as a means of maintaining the present situation. If the negative stance of the United Kingdom leads us into a stalemate, the Argentine Government will be forced to re-examine the policy which thus far has been based on goodwill and on respect for the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of our Organization. If that be the case, it will be up to the United Nations to determine the way in which the terms of resolution 2065 (XX) have been vitiated due to the lack of real willingness on the part of one of the parties to negotiate.\n265.\tOnce again it is my duty to state that the Argentine Government and people, more at one in this than ever before, will not retreat in their determination to recover that part of our national territory that was wrested from us in an act of imperialism by the United Kingdom, an act that history has condemned. The survival of such a situation at this stage of the twentieth century, when the process of decolonization is reaching its end, is both inexplicable and indefensible. To put an end to such an intolerable anachronism is a matter that brooks no delay, and it can be achieved only through the full restoration of the islands to the land from which they were torn and of which they are and always will be an integral part.\n266.\tAnother source of concern to us is the continuation of the crisis in the Middle East, which continues to be the most serious threat to international peace and security.\n267.\tWe believe it to be indispensable that, within the next few months, and in connexion with the visit of the Secretary-General to the countries in the region, efforts should be redoubled to solve this delicate question. We have often stated before, and reiterate now, that in this case time is not the best ally for a peaceful settlement.\n268.\tOn the contrary, the lack of a solution to a conflict can at any moment generate frustration that may, in turn, light the fuse of a new armed conflict.\n269.\tWe have stated and reaffirmed our conviction that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) offers the best means of an honourable settlement for both parties. We continue to hold that same view. Yet, quite frankly and impartially, we believe that Israel must understand that the balance that that resolution advocated cannot be achieved while the Arab territories are still occupied by force.\n270.\tSeven years after the adoption of that resolution, it is not a matter of trying further to interpret its meaning or to analyse its terms, it is a question of opting between establishing the just and lasting peace it advocates or maintaining an unyielding stand which, sooner or later, must lead to another armed confrontation.\n271.\tWe trust that common sense will prevail. And common sense clearly indicates that it is far better to achieve today an agreement acceptable to all parties than to count on indefinitely retaining the fruits of a military conquest.\n272.\tDuring the debate on the important question of Korea, the Argentine delegation will make known its views in detail. However, I do feel constrained to state in advance that we shall not support any resolution of this Assembly\nwhich, directly or indirectly, may affect the territorial integrity of that country or that may deprive the Korean people of its right to self-determination \u2014 in other words, to decide on its destiny for itself and without any form of outside interference.\n273.\tI could not conclude my statement without reaffirming our faith in the permanent values of man, our hopes for the establishment of a just human society and our determination to work with dedication so that the United Nations will be able to play its role today on the road to the universalist world of tomorrow."

        "file_text": "\ufeff122.\tMr. President, I bring to you and to all our colleagues assembled here the greetings and good wishes of the Government and the people of India. I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your accession to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In selecting you as its candidate for President, the continent of Latin America has shown its appreciation of your ability and experience and has helped the Assembly in choosing a man whose faith, competence and devoted services to the United Nations can assure us of a successful session. You can always depend on the full co-operation of my delegation in carrying out your tasks as President.\n123.\tI should like to record our appreciation of the outgoing President, Mr. Trepczynski of Poland, for the skill and patience with which he discharged his responsibilities. With his leadership we accomplished much that was valuable in the work of the United Nations.\n124.\tOur distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has now been in office for nearly two years. We have admired his dynamism, and the sense of purpose he has brought to his work. We look forward to his wise counsel and assessment on many of the issues we shall deal with during the current session.\n125.\tWe deeply mourn the death of the President of Chile, Dr. Allende, in such violent and tragic circumstances. I do not intend to comment on internal developments of a sovereign State. In the wider context, however, I must express profound regret and concern over the setback that the democratic tradition of the people of Chile has suffered as a result of his overthrow, and over the violence, bloodshed and deprivation of human rights and infringement of diplomatic obligations which have recently been reported from that country. We earnestly hope that peace and harmony will be restored soon so that the people of Chile can resume their work of national reconstruction and reconciliation without any outside intervention and without further violence.\n126.\tThe Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001 /Add. IJ, has indicated the value of the United Nations in the present-day world, and has emphasized once again that the United Nations can only be what its Member States wish it to be. Few delegations will disagree with that assessment; the universal desire to render the United Nations a more effective instrument for promoting international peace and co-operation will depend on the willingness and ability of the States represented here to appreciate and reconcile different points of view and to arrive at decisions which serve those interests which are shared by most of us. Surely, our effort should be to extend the area of co-operation through identification of those interests. At the same time, in discussing any problems we must look at them in their totality and apply the Charter provisions in all their aspects and not selectively or in a piecemeal fashion.\n127.\tThe year that has just passed since we last met has seen important, though uneven, developments, but, on the whole, the world has moved forward, however haltingly and however slightly, towards our goal of peace, justice and progress. The gradual reduction of tension between rival blocs, which many of us had long been urging, is now clearly noticeable. The recent improvement of relations between the great Powers and the increase in contacts between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, and the United States of America and China, are important in themselves, and also as an indication that the trend that developed last year has maintained its momentum. The Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, concluded between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in June of this year, and the understandings between them in several other fields are welcome. We are also gratified that this steady search for international peace and security has led to important developments in Europe: in the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, in the treaties between the two German States and between the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries in Eastern Europe, and in the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n128.\tWe join others in welcoming the process of mutual accommodation and co-operation and the consequent reduction of tension. However, this spirit of detente has yet to extend to all parts of the world and should not be limited to mere coexistence among the major Powers. Regrettably, such concepts as the balance of power, spheres of influence and power vacuum are yet to be discarded. Unfortunately also, the great Power rivalry continues to show itself in many ways and in many areas; this brings severe stress and strain in international relations. The power of the strong is still to be placed at the common service of mankind. Only through genuine co-operation can the peoples of the world move forward towards a better future, in accordance with their own wishes and without any feeling of subordination and dependence, or of imposition or pressure from outside.\n129.\tI was privileged to take part in the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers, where those problems received the most careful and comprehensive examination from the largest gathering of Heads of State or Government ever held. The most significant feature of that great Conference was the confidence it created and the will it generated to work together for realizing our common objectives. Those States are determined to achieve, together with all nations of the world and with a spirit of constructive co-operation, equality among all nations and an equitable exploitation of resources of the world. We shall thus encourage the march forward of man for peace and for a better life. Political understanding and economic co-operation among major\nPowers are therefore to be so arranged and channelled that they do not become, even unintentionally, instruments of new forms of domination and dependence.\n130.\tThe maintenance of world peace and security will depend to a large extent on the speedy removal of economic and social disparities, both nationally and internationally. The non-aligned countries wish to build, together with other developing States, a collective self- reliance within the framework of international understanding. They are determined to remove all forms and manifestations of injustice and inequality, discrimination and oppression wherever they may exist. Their dedication to this cause should not be mistaken as a confrontation with any particular country or a group of countries. They have reaffirmed their firm resolve to strengthen the United Nations, which remains the best available machinery for world-wide co-operation.\n131.\tThe world has changed a great deal since our Charter was signed in San Francisco nearly 30 years ago. The Charter must evolve with the times in order to remain an effective and dynamic force for peace and progress. Thus, there is an understandable desire for a comprehensive review of it. We believe, however, that in the prevailing climate of international politics, it would be premature to do more than examine the Charter in certain fields.\n132.\tWe welcome this year three new Members: the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We have excellent relations with those States and look forward to working with them in the United Nations. The Bahamas joins us as the newest Member State from the Caribbean within a few weeks of attaining freedom. We cannot forget in this connexion that there are still a number of countries which are to be freed from colonial rule.\n133.\tThe simultaneous admission of the two German States to the United Nations may well signal the disappearance of tensions and hostilities of the past and the beginning of a new era of understanding and co-operation in Central Europe. We welcome the new pattern of relationship. The two German States, as Members of this Organization, could indeed make a significant contribution to world peace and development.\n134.\tThe admission of these States marks an important step in achieving the goal of universality of membership of the United Nations. This makes it all the more regrettable that Bangladesh, a sovereign State recognized by over 100 Members of the United Nations and with a population of over 75 million people, has not yet been able to take its rightful place among us. I should like to emphasize the call made by the Algiers Conference for the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations. Member States will no doubt recognize that the continuing denial of Bangladesh's right to be in the United Nations injures, if not defeats, the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization.\n135.\tIndia seeks friendship and co-operation with all nations on the basis of equality, reciprocity and mutual respect. With over 75 States of the different continents of the world we share the common ideals of non-alignment. Together with these and many other developing countries we face the common problem of economic development and are working for a better world order.\n136.\tWith western Europe our links go back for centuries and the future holds bright prospects for greater exchanges in various fields. Our political and economic relations with the countries of eastern Europe have shown steady and fruitful development. With the Soviet Union we have achieved a close and co-operative friendship, based on mutual trust and understanding, which we greatly cherish. Both the United States and India have a strong faith in democratic systems and we share many common values. Our contacts and associations with Britain have lasted for hundreds of years and now continue to develop on a basis of mutual respect and equality. Our common cultural values and liberal traditions provide a strong base for our growing friendship with France. As close neighbours, India and China have to live in peace and amity, and we hope that our relations will soon move in that direction.\n137.\tJapan's rapid industrial advance is a lesson for us, and we welcome that country's co-operation in various fields. We are glad that Australia, Canada and New Zealand an: sharing, more and more, our values and attitudes and are showing greater awareness of Asian and African aspirations. In Ottawa, we had a successful meeting of the Commonwealth countries about six weeks ago.\n138.\tWith our most immediate neighbours -Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka \u2014 we maintain and seek the closest friendship and wide-ranging co-operation. We are making all possible efforts to end the era of confrontation with Pakistan.'\n139.\tThe most significant development in our subcontinent has been the search through direct negotiations for normalization of relations. The New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973 provides for the settlement of the humanitarian problems left over from the conflict of 1971. It represents yet another step in the fulfilment of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, which had set out the framework for the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent.\n140.\tEver since independence, India has tried its utmost to live in peace and friendship with Pakistan. In spite of many setbacks and frustrations, this has remained, and will remain, a fundamental objective of our foreign policy.\n141.\tThe tragic events in the subcontinent in 1971 were a direct consequence of the short-sighted policies and adventurist actions of the Pakistani military rulers to which the President, now Prime Minister, Mr. Bhutto himself has made repeated references. The military oligarchy, having failed to crush the determination of 75 million Bangalis, involved India in a war by suddenly bombing from the air several places in western India on 3 December 1971.1 state these simple facts only to give a proper perspective, and not with any desire to dwell on the past. Our purpose is to look forward.\n142.\tThe war lasted about two weeks and the fighting stopped in Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. From that moment onwards, we took a series of steps to restore normalcy and achieve durable peace in the Indian subcontinent.\n143.\tIn the eastern sector, all Indian troops were withdrawn from Bangladesh within a period of 90 days by agreement between the two Governments; all the prisoners taken in Bangladesh were transferred to India as a result of a decision by the joint Indo-Bangladesh command; and all the refugees-nearly 10 million of them \u2014 returned from India to Bangladesh in three months' time, by the end of March 1972. In the western sector, the unilateral cease-fire declared by India came into effect on 17 December 1971.\n144.\tSoon after the cease-fire, we sought negotiations with Pakistan. As a result of the initiative taken by Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi a summit meeting was held in Simla. An agreement was arrived at on 2 July 1972, which, among other things, provided for, first, a line of control in Jammu and Kashmir, secondly, evacuation of territories occupied during the conflict; and thirdly, troop withdrawals. All these decisions were implemented in less than six months. An area of over 5,000 square miles occupied during the conflict was vacated and restored to Pakistan. In addition, all the prisoners of war taken by either side in the western sector returned home.\n145.\tOur next initiative was to make a joint declaration with Bangladesh on 17 April 1973 for solving the major humanitarian problems which arose as a result of the 1971 conflict. Three groups of people were affected: (a) hundreds of thousands of Bangalis stranded in Pakistan and prevented from returning to Bangladesh; (b)  hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis in Bangladesh whom Pakistan was refusing to receive; and (c) about 90,000 prisoners of war and civilian internees held in India. Bangladesh showed a spirit of accommodation and statesmanship in delinking the humanitarian problems from the unresolved political issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n146.\tFollowing negotiations with Pakistan on the basis of this joint declaration, an agreement between India and Bangladesh, with the full concurrence of Bangladesh, was arrived at and signed in Delhi on 28 August 1973. This agreement provides for simultaneous repatriation of all the three groups I have just mentioned.\n147.\tAs regards the 195 prisoners of war, all three Governments agreed that they should be kept in India pending a final settlement. The Delhi Agreement further provides, and I quote:\n\\\"On completion of repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian internees in India, Bengalis in Pakistan and Pakistanis in Bangladesh referred to in Clause (v) above, or earlier if they so agree, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan will discuss and settle the question of 195 prisoners of war. Bangladesh has made it clear that it can participate in such a meeting only on the basis of sovereign equality.\\\"\n148.\tWe hope that the Delhi Agreement will be fully, speedily and smoothly implemented with goodwill on all sides. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Simultaneous repatriation of Bengalis from Pakistan, Pakistanis from Bangladesh, and prisoners of war and civilian internees from India has already started.\n149.\tI doubt if there is any comparable instance in modern history where a cease-fire, demarcation, troop\nwithdrawal, evacuation of occupied territories and repatriation of persons detained or stranded, following an international armed conflict of significant character, has been brought about within such a short period. All this has been achieved through direct negotiations, and as a result of the understanding shown on all sides, after taking into account all aspects of the problems. Therefore, to discuss now piecemeal and in isolation any of these problems from the point of view of any single party would be, to say the least, of little profit.\n150.\tThese concrete facts clearly show that our search for normalization of relations and the establishment of a durable peace in the subcontinent has continued and has produced significant results. Our commitment to this goal is unequivocal. If we succeed in making the subcontinent an area of peace and co-operation, it not only will lead to a better life for over 700 millions of its people, but also will have a salutary impact on other areas as well.\n151.\tThe Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam was signed in Paris this year. For many years we had repeatedly expressed our conviction that a military solution in this area was not feasible. Therefore, the massive and what seemed to be avoidable destruction of life and property in Indo-China shocked and pained us. The final terms of settlement, including provisions for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Indo-China and for bringing about a workable cease-fire in that area, are not much different from what we have been advocating all these years. The tragic sufferings of the people of Viet-Nam must come to an end and the full implementation of the Paris Agreement offers a challenge as well as an opportunity; every effort should be made to ensure lasting peace and to promote full and speedy reconstruction.\n152.\tAs with the people of Viet-Nam, so with the people of Laos and Cambodia, India has always had close historical, cultural and emotional links. They can always depend on our sympathy, understanding and support. In this context, we welcome the recently concluded agreement\n among the parties in Laos. We hope that the people of Laos will soon be able to set up a national coalition government in accordance with their legitimate aspirations without any outside interference.\n153.\tThe peace in Indo-China will not be complete until the war in Cambodia has also been brought to an end. We are deeply distressed at the suffering which the people of Cambodia are still undergoing and the heavy toll of lives that is still taking place. We would urge that the people of Cambodia should be enabled to determine freely, and without any outside interference, their own future so that peace can return to that unhappy and tortured land. The international community can best assist this process by respecting fully the legitimate right to freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of Indo-China.\n154.\tThe comprehensive debate on the situation in the Middle East in the Security Council this summer showed once more, and most convincingly, that there can be no solution to this problem until Israel withdraws from the territories it has occupied by force as a consequence of the 1967 war. Israel's persistent refusal to vacate the occupied Arab lands and its violation of the rights of the inhabitants of the territories occupied by force are the direct causes of tension and conflict in this area. A just solution based on the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians can lead to an enduring peace in this region. The Secretary-General's visit to the Middle East must have brought into clearer focus the views of the contestants. His analysis may well help the parties and the Security Council to continue the search for a just and speedy solution to this explosive situation. We, on our part, will be guided by the principles we have always followed in regard to the problem of the Middle East; they are: the non-acquisition of territories by force of arms, the right of all States in the area to exist, and the inalienable rights of the Palestinians.\n155.\tWe have noted with satisfaction the direct dialogue established between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea for the intensification of contacts to solve humanitarian problems and the eventual reunification of the Korean people. In these talks, as indeed in the whole of Korea, the less outside interference there is the better will be the chances of the parties leaching agreement. Any proposal before the United Nations on this subject will be examined by us with these considerations in mind.\n156.\tThe twin phenomena of colonial domination and racial bigotry in Africa are the greatest burden on the conscience of the contemporary world.\n157.\tThe situation of the people under Portuguese domination was tragically highlighted by the disclosures in the international press of the gruesome massacres in Mozambique. We must continue to expose the criminal character of Portuguese colonialism.\n158.\tWe welcome the declaration of independence by the people of Guinea-Bissau and extend our support to Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde in its work of national integration and consolidation. We have no doubt that the peoples of Angola and Mozambique will soon succeed in their struggle for independence.\n159.\tThe will to be independent must be sustained by the United Nations not only in the areas I have specifically mentioned, but in many others which we shall consider during these three months. We were disappointed, therefore, that when the question of terrorism was discussed in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, the\n refusal by some to admit the possibility of freedom fighters using all means to achieve their objectives, prevented the Committee from coming to any conclusion.\n160.\tIn Zimbabwe, the racist regime continues to maintain its illegal administration in defiance of world opinion. We regret that the Security Council has been prevented from taking any .decisive action for applying the existing sanctions. In addition to improving the effectiveness of sanctions, their extension and strengthening is necessary. The breach of sanctions by some countries and trading interests is most regrettable, particularly when we recall that the sanctions were imposed by a unanimous decision of the Security Council.\n161.\tNowhere are the obligations of trust vested in the United Nations more binding than in Namibia. The people\nof Namibia have demonstrated the greatest courage in asserting their own rights by boycotting the recent so-called elections in Ovamboland. Clearly, the South African Government is not willing to work with the United Nations in bringing about Namibian independence and unity. The efforts made through the United Nations Council for Namibia, its High Commissioner, and the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa could, if their activities are planned and co-ordinated in a well-thought-out manner, contribute effectively to the political independence of the Namibian people as a whole.\n162.\tIn this session, the General Assembly will consider the adoption of the Draft Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [item 53 (b)/. We shall support all measures to intensify and widen action for outlawing this intolerable and inhuman doctrine which has brought so much suffering to millions of human beings in South Africa. Only recently, the world was shocked with the brutal killing in Carletonville.\n\n163.\tToday is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, and I recall that he was the first man to rise and revolt against the cruel practices of the Government of South Africa. He led a movement for improving the lot of the coloured people in that country, even before he launched the civil disobedience movement in India for obtaining our freedom and independence. Since India raised this question in the United Nations in 1946, practically every Member of this Organization, including South Africa's allies, has denounced apartheid. We shall continue to co-operate with all other Member States until South Africa gives up its intolerable policies of racial discrimination.\n164.\tWhile recent developments on the limitation of nuclear armaments and the prohibition of certain categories of weapons of mass destruction are important, enduring world peace and security can be based only on total disarmament. However, the goal of general and complete disarmament, including, in particular, nuclear disarmament, remains as distant as ever. We have long urged the convening of a world conference on disarmament with the participation of all countries so as to focus attention on this urgent problem. Unfortunately, the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, set up after the last General Assembly session, could not proceed with any substantive work. Given goodwill on all sides, the difficulties which arose can be removed by the present session of the Assembly so that a world conference on disarmament can be prepared for and convened as early as possible.\n165.\tMy delegation has noted with interest the new item proposed by the delegation of the USSR for a reduction in the military budgets [item 102]. The intention seems to be that the permanent members of the Security Council and other militarily significant States should use a part of the savings for providing assistance to developing countries. We have been stressing that savings from disarmament should be diverted to development assistance. We shall therefore co-operate with other delegations in a constructive effort to consider how this proposal, which will no doubt be elaborated in course of discussion, could serve the interest of disarmament and also enhance development assistance.\n166.\tThe declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)J was a significant step in our efforts to reduce great Power rivalries and tensions in the different regions of the world and forms a part of our desire to eliminate military alliances and bases. I should take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the statesmanship of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka in mobilizing international opinion for this purpose. Useful work has been initiated by the 15-member Ad Hoc, Committee on the Indian Ocean established by the last session of the Assembly [resolution 2992 (XXVII)] for considering measures for implementing the Declaration. This Declaration cannot be effective unless the great Powers and other major maritime Powers co-operate fully with the littoral and hinterland States.\n167.\tWe look forward with utmost interest to the forthcoming plenipotentiary Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The meetings of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction this year have brought out certain difficulties, none of which need prove insurmountable. By working together with all other countries we could achieve a just and equitable law of the sea and sea-bed which would provide for and ensure an orderly exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and a rational management of its resources, bearing in mind the special needs and interests of the developing countries, whether coastal or land-locked. A fair and viable law of the sea should also provide a framework of regulations for other uses of the sea, including those relating to the exploitation of its living and other resources by establishing an exclusive fishery and economic zone for the coastal States.\n168.\tThe concept of world-wide partnership in economic and social development has been accepted. However, the progress towards full implementation of the International Development Strategy for the 1970s [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has been extremely disappointing. Some developed countries, particularly the smaller among them, have responded well, but little success has been achieved in even its most publicized goals. The dismal fact is that the Second Development Decade is going the way of the first, and with far less excuse. The growth of most developing countries is well below the targets set. The growth in the least developed countries has been slower still. The benefits of world economic growth are not being shared equitably and the rich societies are becoming richer and the poor poorer. Full recognition of the interdependence of the world community and adoption of measures conducive to the attainment of a more balanced growth in the world economy is still lacking.\n169.\tMany developing countries have already spoken of a real and imminent danger that, owing to the preoccupation of developed countries with readjustment of their mutual relations, the urgent need to implement policy measures in favour of developing countries may not receive the attention it deserves. The first biennial review and appraisal of the Strategy has so far been inconclusive. If agreed conclusions could be reached during this session, remedial measures to improve performance in the remaining years of the Decade would be easier to take. In the developing countries the struggle for greater equality and justice must\ncontinue. Equally, we have to seek wider economic co-operation among the developing countries themselves. The important measures outlined recently at Algiers for this purpose should prove most useful.\n170.\tContrary to earlier expectations, agreement on international monetary reform has not been reached. Stability in international monetary arrangements is not yet within our grasp. The issues are undoubtedly complex. Non-aligned countries have reiterated that the new international monetary system, in the establishment and working of which the developing countries should participate as equals, should be universal. The system should guarantee the stability of international trade flows and conditions of financing; it has to recognize the specific situation and needs of the developing countries for preferential treatment.\n171.\tThe growth of world trade and the rightful share of the developing countries in it will be facilitated by the establishment of special drawing rights as the principal reserve asset, for the phasing out of the monetary role of gold, for an adjustment mechanism which is both efficient and equitable and, above all, for the establishment of a link between the special drawing rights and development finance, in order to provide for the adequate transfer of additional real resources to the developing countries. All these measures will create an orderly arrangement for adequate liquidity.\n172.\tThe Declaration adopted a few days ago at Tokyo will soon be followed by a round of multilateral trade negotiations. The trend towards liberalization of world trade is to be welcomed, but the developing countries should not emerge from these negotiations as net losers. Specific measures must be taken to secure additional benefits for the international trade of developing countries. This has indeed been agreed to in Tokyo.\n173.\tTo achieve this, the concept of preferential treatment for developing countries in all sectors of the negotiations has to be accepted. Moreover, we must ensure that the enlargement of the preferential arrangements among the\n developed countries, as well as the reduction of industrial tariffs following the multilateral trade negotiations, do not erode the meagre benefits which the developing countries have secured under the generalized scheme of preferences. To make this scheme fully operational will require its implementation by those who have not yet done so and substantial improvements in the arrangements already in operation.\n174.\tThe delicate and precarious balance between-world food supply and demand during the last few years has emphasized the urgent need for a global strategy for food security. Widespread drought in several countries has brought to the forefront the problem of matching world resources and technology for production of food with global needs, in normal as also in abnormal years. We support the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization to work out an effective solution to this problem.\n175.\tIn stressing the essential link between economic development and environmental improvement we have\nconsistently underlined that there is no contradiction between the solution of ecological problems and the interests of developing countries. We have, therefore, spoken against ecological considerations being used to curtail aid, erect trade barriers and prevent the transfer of technology. This could be the result of a short-sighted desire to protect economic advantages: restraints on economic growth must not be adopted to the detriment of the developing world.\n176.\tWe are confident, therefore, that the United Nations Environment Programme under Mr. Maurice Strong will keep all these aspects in mind in working out a plan of action for the betterment of mankind as a whole. In this context, the development of human settlements is of particular importance to developing countries.\n177.\tI have followed with great interest the many important views expressed by distinguished ministers and leaders of delegations gathered here. Today, I have taken the time of the Assembly to set forth our ideas on some of the important issues before us. We must ponder over the many valuable ideas presented to us by men of thought, and we must bend our energies to collective effort as men of action. The Charter provides the mechanism for translating these ideas into action. Let us, if we can, gather enough courage and wisdom and seize this opportunity to serve our fellow men.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff101.\tO temporal O mores! We could not have found a better place than this nor could we have selected a better occasion than this to take up again this cry of alarm, more than 20 centuries after Cicero, in view of the present way social, political and economic world mores are developing.\n102. By your leave, may I first recall here, by way of explaining our attitude, a text which is well known and reads as follows:\n\\\"We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and\nto establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and\nto promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\nand for these ends\nto practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and\nto unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and\nto ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and\nto employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,\nhave resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims\\\".\nThus our elders express themselves in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed on 26 June 1945.\n103.\tIt is true that there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip. And this may continue to be so as long as nations remain what they are.\n104.\tIt is true also that the history of mankind has always been that of a permanent struggle between the wisdom and the folly of men. But more than at any other time in history, we consider that today it is essential that one day man brings his wisdom up to the level of his power if he wishes to save the world.\n105.\tO temporal O mores! That cry alarm is amply justified by the lowering of morals in the present-day world. The mind of any thinking man is completely disturbed at the present time. It would seem, as has been frequently said, that the origin of this unusual mental crisis should be seen as the giddy, almost anarchic, development of technology and science, which enslave the men they were designed to serve. And they have engendered a consumer society which makes man more selfish, which reinforces the egocentricity of nations and exacerbates the excessive cult of material wealth and the desperate search for profit.\n106.\tMan is disoriented by so much immoderation and has sought evasion in many ways. Hence, we have a excessive consumption of all sorts of stimulants such as alcohol, drugs, erotic films and pornography, sexual perversion, excess of speed, bright lights and noise. All these are factors which favour the decline of morality and the increase of criminality.\n107.\tMan, now appears, because of the progress of science, to be capable of a number of technological achievements and of responding to all the technical problems that exist; but he is so lamentably disarmed in the face of purely human problems such as racism, hunger, the environment, social justice, peace. Our technical civilization seems even to have further complicated these problems without having been able to give human wisdom new means of resolving them.\n108.\tO temporal O mores! That cry is also amply justified in the face of our incapacity to resolve international political problems.\n109.\tLet us take a look together at the situation of our Organization, without flattering ourselves. Theoretically, the United Nations should be resorted to whenever any serious crisis appears on the international scene. Unfortunately, we must painfully recognize that the role of the United Nations and of international organizations remains a desperately secondary one.\n110.\tJust as it was between the two world wars, when major conflicts such as the war in Spain, the Japanese attack against China, the aggressions of Nazi Germany, were not submitted to the League of Nations, similarly no decisive role was played by the United Nations in settling the two Viet-Nam wars, the conflicts in Nigeria and in Pakistan, or even the Cuban crisis. But even worse, the resolutions of the United Nations on the Middle East, particularly the well-known resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council, have remained a dead letter.\n111.\tIsrael spurns the decisions of our Organization \u2014 this very Organization which gave birth to it \u2014 emboldened by the support which it invariably finds from certain great Powers.\n112.\tResolution 242 (1967), once we supported it with the ultimate degree of verbal vehemence, allayed our consciences. It is not even put into effect! And even if it were put into effect, it would not solve the fundamental problem, which it completely overlooks, namely, the inalienable right of the Palestine people to existence and self-determination.\n113.\tIn the course of a television programme, two French broadcasters imagined a tourist poster for Israel for the year 2000, which would read:\n\\\"Visit Israel and its pyramids.\\\"\n114.\tWhat appears to us as an artists' joke is perhaps already a definite plan in the minds of the international Zionists if we are not careful, as would seem to be suggested by the present gradual annexation of the West Bank through the confiscation of land by the Israeli Government, the purchase of lands by para-State organizations, such as the KKL (Jewish National Fund) and other private land speculations and transactions.\n115.\tThis is also suggested by the geometric progression of the area covered by Israel since its creation in 1948.\n116.\tIn fact, the evanescence of the responsibilities of the international community, the notorious impotence of the United Nations, the arrogance of power, State terrorism or preventive reprisals \u2014 which are, by the way, a concept inadmissible in international law \u2014 the occupation of foreign territories and the colonization of those territories, repression of civilian populations, denial of the rights of the disinherited Palestinian people, whose only choice is to resort to violence in the face of a self-satisfied and intransigent power, the impatience of the Arab peoples who have been despoiled and who object to the fait accompli of the occupation of their territories by force \u2014 all the conditions exist for a new armed confrontation, with incalculable consequences for international peace and security.\n117.\tAre we finally going to react in the proper way to prevent a conflagration which might well involve our planet's catching fire?\n118.\tAt the risk of disappointing some and shocking others \u2014 because sometimes things have to be said if we really wish to get out of an impasse \u2014 this is how we have tried to grasp the complex problem of the Middle East.\n119.\tThe Larousse dictionary gives the following definition of Palestine:\n\\\"A country in the Middle East between Lebanon in the north, the Dead Sea in the south, the Mediterranean in the west and the Syrian desert in the east. It is a narrow strip of land between Lebanon and the sea, and the Jordan River runs through it.\\\"\nThe same Larousse gives the following definition of Israel \u2014  of course, it depends on the edition one reads:\n\\\"Israel comprises that part of Palestine where the Jewish population is predominant, but its frontiers, which are the result of an armistice, are arbitrary\\\".\nThus, at first blush, juridically speaking, the State of Israel is-without frontiers and does not exist.\n120.\tWe said last year, and repeat today, that we have nothing against the Jews. The sufferings that they endured are sufficiently repellent for them still to be fresh in our memories.\n121.\tHowever, we are trying objectively to analyse the facts and to arrange them logically and consistently.\n122.\tRepresentatives are aware of the Projekt Madagaskar of Hitler that Theo Denneker addressed to Rademacber in August of 1940. It was a question, no more and no less, of deporting 4 million Jews to Madagascar, At that time there were 3.8 million Malagasies, and this would have turned our island into a vast concentration camp, an enormous Jewish homeland.\n123.\tI do not think I am mistaken when I affirm that the Malagasy people \u2014 which has never accepted colonialism since the time of the Menalamba and the Vy Vato Sakelika, in 1947 and 1971-1972 to actual independence in 1973 \u2014  would have had any different reactions from those of the Palestinians today. We therefore understand their plight.\n124.\tAs Mr. Pinhas Sapir himself said, \\\"Israel today occupies Arab territories not by force of law, but by the law of force\\\", and that is something that we could never accept and that prompts us to support the cause of the Arab countries.\n125.\tBut we must go further in our analysis of this puzzle.\n126.\tBy what absurd logic, by what strange aberration, did Balfour and Britain imagine that this strip of land, this narrow strip between Lebanon and the sea, could welcome millions of Jews previously scattered throughout the world, without subsequent expansion? How could they have conceived mutatis mutandis, that England could receive all Americans of British origin as well as all Europeans, Australians, New Zealanders, Rhodesians and Canadians of English lineage? How could they have imagined that a State like Israel, surrounded on all sides by hostile States, could live in any degree of stability or peace?\n127.\tIn fact, the reply is simple. The imperialists did not want peace in that region. And the reason is this: there are in that area of the Middle East vast supplies of oil.\n128.\tBut in this case would the Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs be only pawns in the hands of the great Powers? Would they be simply the tools of an underhanded struggle for economic domination of the area?\n129.\tIf that is so, the necessary conclusions must be drawn.\n130.\tThe situation is even more complicated because the Israeli population also grows according to a geometric progression; from the few tens of thousands which they were originally, they have now grown to several million, thanks to Jewish emigration from the four corners of the world, Thus we are simply witnessing a new form of settler colonization.\n131.\tMay we dare to carry our analysis to its logical conclusion by asking a simple question. What if the underlying reason for the creation of the State of Israel was simply the anti-Semitism of the great Powers? In that case we might risk the following reasoning: Europeans do not like Jews; Hitler was not able to carry out his \\\"final solution\\\"; but since the Jewish question remains extant, the former anti-Nazi Powers found it more elegant and more useful for their long-term global strategy to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n132.\tThat is why we say the Israelis must cease to be only an international problem. They should cease to be the simple tools of zionism and customers of arms dealers; they must look reality squarely in the face and try to understand the Palestinian people.\n133.\tTurning now to the situation in southern Africa, we know as well as anybody that the resolutions of our Organization have changed nothing in the area. In point of fact, in that quarter of the world where it would be really indecent to speak of peace, security or justice \u2014 because they are conspicuous by their absence or, if they do exist, they are interpreted in a distorting mirror, unilaterally, in favour of\nusurping minorities and of their near or distant allies \u2014 the situation remains the same.\n134.\tThe joint and archaic alliance of illegality, of usurpation, of apartheid and imperialism continues to oppress and dominate the peoples of that area, in scorn or ignorance of the black man and with a pathological taste for half truth, It continues to give social, political, economic and cultural relations the same hollow justification directly inherited from the nineteenth century, according to the notorious theory of \\\"continuity in evolution\\\", which could be called more accurately \\\"continuity in stagnation\\\".\n135.\tUndo the increasingly threadbare cover of \\\"the defence of the free world\\\", this neo-colonialist, paternalistic, traditional or doctrinaire policy, though condemned in words, is in fact supported by the NATO Powers and the forces of capitalist imperialism.\n136.\tIt is in fact quite evident that southern Africa remains one of the last bastions of lost causes and of minorities who call themselves the torch-bearers of a \\\"civilizing mission\\\". And it is in the name of that mission that we see perpetrated every day outrages, summary executions, massacres such as the one at Wiriyamu, genocide in Mozambique \u2014 all with the silent complicity of some and the material assistance of others, and all against the background of United Nations paralysis.\n137.\tWe reject this alleged policy of appeasement consisting of an uninterrupted series of evasions based on a so-called differentiation among cases. In fact, such a policy could be justified only if we were to recognize the primacy of the inalienable rights of peoples over the dubious and uncertain right of States. On the basis of this last hypothesis, all is possible. Unfortunately, we are confronted with bad faith and inertia, which leads us to demand that an end be put to the sterile negotiations with South Africa concerning Namibia.\n138.\tIn South-East Asia, just as similar causes produce similar effects, the setting is different but the substance of the problem is the same.\n139.\tIn Indo-China we find ourselves faced with a striking example of a situation which some believed on the way to settlement following the Agreement of 27 January 1973,7 but one which carries within itself the seeds of a third war in Indo-China. The reasons for this precarious and ambiguous situation are varied: They are inherent in the very nature of the Agreement \u2014 this is an agreement which is fundamentally political but which has been thwarted by reservations that have served to encourage contractual agreements. They are inherent in the foreign interventions that continue in subtle forms, in the form, for instance, of \\\"civilian advisers\\\" to assist in the war effort in Viet-Nam and in the unjustifiable raids and bombardments and the scarcely disguised invasion of Cambodia, in support of regimes hardly to be called representative. These direct foreign interferences demonstrate in fact an unquenchable thirst for the maintenance of political and economic bastions, and thus the urge to dominate and the selfishness of certain Powers that still dream nostalgically of influence.\n\n140.\tThe solutions proposed in this context can be at best improvised and unrealistic.\n141.\tThe fundamental principles underlying a peaceful, just and lasting solution remain: equality of rights among peoples, as recognized by the Charter; the right of those same peoples to self-determination, and full respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n142.\tHence we hold it to be indispensable, first, that there be complete and genuine withdrawal of all forces of foreign intervention, whether in Indo-China, in Korea or in Cambodia; that the task of determining the conditions for participation in national and international political life be left to the peoples of those areas themselves, according to their own standards and not according to models imposed from outside; that the desire of those peoples to live in peace in accord with their own genius be recognized, so that they may live in a coherent society, not a society artificially held together or divided by any insincere allegiance to the sullied values of a foreign civilization; that an end be put to the chauvinism that has been elevated by some to a political principle, international in application but completely untenable because it runs contrary to the sovereignty of peoples.\n143.\tUnless these conditions arc achieved and respected, security in the Indo-Chinese peninsula and in South-East Asia will remain precarious and illusory,\n144.\tO temporal O mores! This feeling is further justified by our inability to ensure security throughout the world. The development and progress that have been achieved in weapons of mass destruction and the perfection of their means of delivery are such, in our time, that a generalized nuclear war seems, unless there is a miscalculation, highly improbable. The unleashing of a nuclear war by one or other of the super-Powers would inevitably end in genocide and collective suicide. All the great Powers can do now is engage in so-called \\\"conventional\\\" warfare. It is curious that the term \\\"conventional\\\" is used to describe a war that is so unconventional. In any case, a limited, classic type of war among great Powers, despite all the theories of \\\"flexible response\\\" or other theories, run the risk, in accordance with the \\\"domino theory\\\", of rapidly developing into a generalized nuclear war. We all know that no interest from now on is sufficiently great to justify such a holocaust. Consequently, the great Powers are forced to reach agreement. It is the end of the cold war and the beginning of detente.\n145.\tThus the great Powers have become aware of the absurdity of their struggle and the sterility of their direct military confrontation. And thus we see yesterday's enemies renouncing what divided them, looking for things they have in common so that they may join forces and collaborate. This is true of Germany and Italy, which come into the Common Market beside Great Britain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. This is the case of the United States of America, of Japan and of the Soviet Union, which are already beginning to co-operate beyond their ideological divisions. But since the political interests of the great Powers are not yet entirely identical, they wage war by proxy, with the third world in between. At any rate, they have to sell their armaments and keep their arms factories going.\n146.\tThis is why we welcome, as we should, the efforts made by the Europeans in the field of organizing their\nsecurity, for this approach to the problem is in fact in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter. It responds, furthermore, to European concerns and, where their interests are identical with those of others, to the concerns of all peoples.\n147. But in spite of all, we cannot refrain from a certain scepticism in more general terms. In point of fact, the tendency of the great Powers and the super-Powers to negotiate among themselves has not improved or guaranteed in any absolute way the security of small and medium-size nations. The organization of co-operation, as we see it now in its exploratory and preliminary stages, may be carried out without the third world, at the latter's expense or even against its interests. The great Powers and the superpowers seem to be turning toward a consolidation of their positions and their respective advantages. Is it not, furthermore, symbolic and is it not one of the great paradoxes of our times, that the same small countries that previously were so noisily demanding the end of the cold war are today beginning to denounce the Russian-American rapproachement, which they regard as collusion? In the face of this contradiction between intentions and interpretations \u2014 a completely normal and healthy reaction on the part of a world disabused because often abused \u2014 it will be necessary, we believe, as the Preamble to the Charter tells us, to reaffirm and make real the equality of the rights of States through collective steps in connexion with security and international co-operation, and to create a new, more egalitarian order among peoples, large, medium-sized, or small, which would be tantamount to internationalizing social justice.\n148.\tLet us now turn to disarmament. We are, of course, gratified that a bipartite agreement has been reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on the prevention of nuclear war.8 But here again we cannot give way to unqualified jubilation. That agreement does not in particular solve, in a global way and with respect for the sovereignty and equality of all States, large, medium-sized or small, the problem of the diversification of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction or their stockpiling, nor does it solve the problem of nuclear testing. In this connexion, we expect the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to produce more positive results; otherwise security may well turn out to be an illusion. Military disengagement, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the liquidation of bases on foreign soil remain very much on the agenda, and progress achieved in these areas remains marginal.\n149.\tThe small and medium-sized Powers, particularly those that are peripheral and belong to no alliance or military pact, feel rather frustrated by the role of mere spectators to which they have been relegated. Since disarmament is something that concerns us all, and not only the superpowers and the military blocs, we are more than ever convinced of the need to create conditions that will be propitious for the achievement of complete and immediate disarmament.\n150.\tThe creation of zones of peace similar to that which is planned for the Indian Ocean would undoubtedly be one of\nthe instruments which we could use to achieve our goals of disarmament, peace and security. Actually, in the case of the Indian Ocean, the creation of a zone of peace will make it possible: for the countries concerned to get together in order to establish co-operation based on genuine mutual trust; to outlaw the present race, which in fact draws heavily on the theory of spheres of influence; to utilize the human and material resources of the countries in that area for purely peaceful purposes; to guarantee independence and the genuine sovereignty for those countries without risk of direct of indirect interference.\n151.\tBut, again, there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip, because the great Powers are putting forward the following objections to this generous and peaceful project: first, that the zone of peace might impede freedom of navigation on the high seas, and secondly that this liberty is generally recognized and will be defined at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n152.\tThat is why certain great Powers advocate, purely and simply, that the creation of zones of peace should await the convening of the Conference of the Law of the Sea \u2014 as if the freedom of the high seas and its exercise were incompatible with the desire for peace of the peoples of that area, and as if they did not know that the conclusions of that Conference will be legal and economic in nature and thus will not in any way take precedence over the collective political will of the littoral countries of the Indian Ocean.\n153.\tAs far as we are concerned, last year we announced that the emergence of Madagascar to full sovereignty and to completely national and international responsibility make it imperative henceforth that it play fully the role which belongs to it in that part of the Indian Ocean where it is located.\n154.\tHow has the Malagasy Government tried to live up to this role? First, by creating conditions for genuine national independence in all areas: the creation of an autonomous currency and central bank; the adoption of an outward-looking policy of friendship with all; the severance of alienating links with foreign countries, particularly with South Africa; and the evacuation of foreign troops and bases from its territory.\n155.\tThe last two points should be particularly emphasized and analysed. In point of fact, by eliminating foreign bases and troops from its soil and by refusing to join the Southern Defence Pact, Madagascar has contributed in a significant way to creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area, a position which is in accordance with the desires of non-aligned countries.\n156.\tThe Malagasy Government has taken its place on the world scene particularly by being more active in international affairs \u2014 with the non-aligned countries, in OAU, in the United Nations and so on. Thus the Malagasy Government is helping liberation movements in Africa and elsewhere. It welcomes the proclamation of the independence of the former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, It considers that that new State is juridically and morally entitled to international recognition and to participate in our work, if our Organization intends\nto remain faithful to its ideals of freedom, progress and justice.\n157. The Malagasy Government considers that the solution of the Korean problem depends on the determination of the Korean people itself to diminish tension and internal friction, to promote co-operation in all areas, to forge awareness of a common destiny, as set forth in the proposals of the North Korean Government, which we entirely support.\nJ58. The Malagasy Government also recognizes the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the only .legitimate and legal Government, and supports the idea of the urgent need to restore in the United Nations and its system the rights of the Cambodian people to be represented by a Government free from any form of dependence or foreign allegiance.\n159.\tIt also recognizes, with some 40 other States, that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Viet-Nam is the authentic representative of the South Viet-Namese people. The Government and the people of Madagascar can never forget that they in fact owe their present independence to the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people; to the historic \\\"No\\\" of the fraternal people of Guinea; and to the brave combat waged by the dauntless people of Algeria.\n160.\tThe Malagasy Government has followed with some sympathy the experience of the Government of Popular Unity of Chile. The policies of Salvador Allende were in accordance with the aspirations of the people, which has long been enslaved and frustrated by the alliance of reactionaries and monopolists. We pay a tribute to Mr. Allende, his courage, his honest and universal vision, and his universalism in the defence of genuinely independent nations and completely liberated peoples.\n161.\tFinally, the Malagasy Government is making its voice heard in international bodies on questions of monetary reform and in the Economic and Social Council, particularly on questions relating to the environment and the law of the sea.\n162.\tThus we consider that the concept of the continental shelf and the definition which has been suggested are valid only for the great Powers. In point of fact, the criterion of the 200-metre isobath for the delimitation of the continental shelf is not applicable to a number of countries of the third world. The hydrography of that area has either not been carried out at all or has been done in summary fashion. Furthermore, there are a number of countries which have no or very little continental shelf. For example, a few miles from our coast one frequently finds the abyssal depths. Consequently, we would prefer the idea of an exclusive economic zone based on a distance, rather than a depth, criterion.\n163.\tWith regard to the idea of the territorial sea, here again our position has been dictated by our desire to adapt everything to the realities instead of submitting to decisions imposed from outside. Up to now, the great Powers have determined the breadth of this territorial sea on the basis of cannon range. Thus, they adopted three nautical miles; and then \u2014 we do not know why or how \u2014 they decided to\nincrease that distance to 6 and then 12 miles  \u2014  perhaps because the range of their ordnance grew accordingly. Nevertheless, at a time of intercontinental ballistic missiles and rockets, the criterion of the range of armaments for the delimitation of territorial waters no longer makes any sense,\n164.\tFor a small island country such as ours, we prefer to choose another criterion in delimiting that area. Since we wish to protect, in so far as possible, our island from any possible intrusion, landing or invasion, we chose the concept of the time it takes for us to summon our coastal or air forces. That is why the Madagascar Government decided to increase the breadth of its territorial waters to 50 nautical miles, starting from the baseline, and the exclusive economic zone to 150 miles, starting from the same point.\n165.\tO temporal O mores! Our pessimism is finally justified by the iniquitous organization of present international economic relations. The political liberation of all continents is being achieved. But this political liberation could only be a delusion if it were bereft of any economic content.\n166.\tAll delegations here stress as a Leitmotiv that the growing gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" may seriously compromise international peace and security.\n167.\tWe feel it is our duty to reaffirm that underdevelopment is not backwardness in development. It is, more or less, the result of an historical process \u2014 colonial and then neo-colonial exploitation by means of which developed countries empty the economies of the poor peripheral countries of their substance.\n168.\tSome euphemistically describe this colonial depredation as \\\"deterioration in the terms of trade\\\". It remains true that pillage of the resources of the third world continues in ever-more subtle forms. That is why these so-called developing countries are actually under-developing countries. They are in a state of perpetual under-development because the conditions which brought about this situation are continually recurring.\n169.\tAn eminent person said that development is now the new name of peace.\n170.\tBut we refuse categorically to follow those who support development by incantation, as if it were sufficient to speak about development for it to materialize. \\\"Disarmed laws\\\", said Cardinal de Retz, \\\"are not to be respected\\\". To overcome under-development we have to dismantle the whole machinery and bring about a drastic transformation in relations between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" and also in the social relationships existing in our countries.\n171.\tTo decolonize, to democratize, to make more moral international relations and trade is, of course, excellent; but we know that States never willingly renounce their interests. It is up to us, the countries of the third world, to force the rich countries to accept our points of view. We have the material ways and means of imposing the ideas which we believe are fair, since our countries contain in their soil and sub-soil the main natural resources of our planet, resources which are indispensable to the economic growth of the industrialized countries.\n172.\tWe have the opportunity to organize ourselves and to adopt clear options on the basis of our common interests, despite our differences in civilization, language, ideology, religion or political systems.\n173.\tFurthermore, the developed countries themselves can set aside their differences and they do not hesitate to decide to sacrifice us to their strategies.\n174.\tAs far as we are concerned, we henceforth refuse to entertain that dichotomy, that Manichaean division of the earth into rival East and West blocs, That is no longer in accordance with reality.\n175.\tAs long as the developed countries have a common interest and a common goal \u2014 to assure their economic development, to the detriment of the poor countries \u2014 the world is naturally divided into two camps: the imperialist exploiters on the one hand and the exploited on the other. But as long as we are content to demand, to exhort, to make pressing appeals and to beg the great Powers to do certain things, we will not achieve results.\n176.\tAs long as the richer countries continue to freeze their assets in London, Paris, Bonn, New York and Tokyo, the sums which the imperialists then lend to us at very high rates, or use to finance and arm Zionist armies, although they could be used to hasten the development of the third world; as long as we are content to mouth words such as \\\"the freedom of peoples to determine their own destiny\\\" \u2014  which is only, after all, the freedom granted by imperialism to Governments which dispose of our peoples as they will, Governments which are docile \u2014 without giving any genuine economic and cultural content to that liberty; as long as we former colonized peoples remain in the wake of Europe, by clinging to the Commonwealth, by following the French or the European Community, by joining regional organizations dominated by a particular great Power; as long as we have not understood, as the Europeans have, that our strength comes from organized unity; as long as we, the peoples of the third world, are content simply to ask the rich countries to stabilize the prices of primary commodities, whereas we have the means to get together to impose and fix ourselves the sale price of our commodities; as long as we do not assist each other in our struggle for economic liberation as we did in our struggle for political liberation, we, the countries of the third world, will always remain peoples who are mere objects, because the rich countries, the self-styled democracies, have not hesitated and will not hesitate to send colonial expeditions, such as those sent to Indo-China, Algeria, Suez, Mozambique and Angola. They will not balk at aggression and economic exploitation and they will let us have, at best, the crumbs of their unprecedented development.\n177.\tFinally, it is obvious that our salvation will come from ourselves. We have to count on ourselves, rely on ourselves. We must not shuffle off our responsibilities onto others. We have to overcome our own weaknesses. It is a question of political will and determination.\n178.\tThose were the anxieties and preoccupations contained in our cry, \\\"0 temporal O mores!\\\" I think, Mr. President, you will understand why we pay a heartfelt tribute to the competence, skill and devotion of your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, a citizen of a great country which suffered particularly from war, racism and man's folly, who was able in such a masterly way to conduct the work of the twenty-seventh session.\n179: It is also fitting that we should wish the Secretary-General and all his co-workers to continue to serve with devotion the noble causes of our Organization, which, according to the words of the Secretary-General, should be \\\"a reliable instrument of world order and co-operation, accepted and respected by all Governments.\\\"\n180.\tBut we are particularly happy to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election to preside over this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. That, following the Fourth Conference of Heads of States and Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers, the representative of Ecuador, a developing country, should be elected to the presidency of the General Assembly \u2014 you, Mr. Benites, with your experience of international affairs and the aptitude and objectivity which we know are part of your character \u2014 is for us small countries full of significance. We see it as an earnest of the fact that the problems of the developing countries, which have been left outside the deliberations of mankind, will be examined with all the attention they deserve, because those countries represent the overwhelming majority of our planet.\n181.\t. We are pleased to offer you our entire co-operation, so that the work of this session will lead not only to a few more resolutions but also to concrete and significant results, so that the world may one day see wisdom victorious over man's folly."

        "file_text": "\ufeff86.\tMr. President, on behalf of the People's Republic of Albania I should like first of all to express my warmest congratulations to Mr. Leopoldo Benites on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly.\n87.\tThe events that have taken place in the course of the year that has just elapsed show that, basically, the positive changes that we witness today in the world are the result of the just struggle of peoples, which, despite the complexity of the problems created by imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and other reactionary forces, is progressing irresistibly forward. The efforts of sovereign States to counter the policy of aggression and hegemony and the threats, pressures and blackmail practised against them have led to a continuing growth of their role in international relations in favour of the cause of freedom and independence, peace and social progress. The peoples of Indo-China have won important victories over the American aggressors and their lackeys. The Arab peoples are pursuing with determination their struggle against imperialist-Zionist aggression and the plots hatched against them. The liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America are strengthening and are spreading to new areas. An ever- increasing number of countries on these continents are taking measures and co-ordinating their actions in the struggle for the defence of their independence, their sovereignty and their national interests against the rapacious designs of the imperialist Powers; and, in the first instance, I refer to the two super-Powers, which are seeking to place them under their trusteeship. The wave of anger and resistance against American imperialism and Soviet imperialism has mounted even higher. This development in the international situation is encouraging to peace-loving peoples and States and is increasing their confidence in the triumph of their just cause.\n88.\tHowever, we feel that it would be rather unrealistic to overlook the obvious and not-so-obvious dangers which continue to threaten the freedom and independence of sovereign peoples and States and true peace and security. Here, in this very Assembly, efforts have been made to induce us to believe that at the present time the world is relieved of the threat of war, that relations among States are governed by a spirit of understanding, and that the prospects for peace are very encouraging. But the reality does not justify such an evaluation. In the world there still exist a good number of serious problems which are awaiting solution. In Viet-Nam, acts of war have not come to an end and there is no true peace. In Cambodia, aggression by American imperialism and its lackeys is continuing. In the Middle East, one finds a tense, explosive situation which is fraught with dangerous consequences. The Portuguese colonialists and the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia are unceasingly perpetrating barbarous crimes against many African territories. National and social oppression is being practised in grand style by the imperialist Powers and their instruments in many countries of the world. And, above all, nothing has changed in the essence and content of the aggressive policy and aims of the United States and the Soviet Union to bring about world hegemony. The two super-Powers are spreading their political, economic, cultural and military expansion to every corner of the globe.\n89.\tFor a long time there have been spreading certain concepts to the effect that peace and stability in the world depend in the first instance on relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and that it is on the American-Soviet balance that any world balance will rest. It is alleged that the two super-Powers, as the great and powerful States which they are, should assume a particular responsibility and role in international life and that, under this responsibility, they also have the right to act in full freedom wherever and with whomever they please. Such ideas are inadmissible. The time is long past when the great imperialist Powers decided the fate of the world and of peoples. Very often attempts have been made to frighten peoples by the force of the two super-Powers, by their atomic teeth, but these attempts have remained fruitless. Many facts testify to the fact that the super-Powers are only powerful in appearance, that they carry within them real weaknesses. They are in a decline and in a continuing state of disintegration. However, at the same time, the peace-loving peoples and countries are unceasingly and steadily growing and becoming stronger.\n90.\tThe policy of violence and aggression, oppression and exploitation which is practised by the United States and the Soviet Union, the armaments race and the continuing increase in their war budgets have created great difficulties both internally and externally for these Powers. In the United States the dollar crisis, inflation and unemployment, and, in the Soviet Union, continuing economic setbacks, the phenomena of disintegration and confusion in the political and social system, as well as the worsening of conflicts between nationalities, have now become chronic ills. The Watergate affair and other political scandals and the hardening of the methods of oppression and violence that have been displayed are just so many phenomena which testify to the basically reactionary nature and the continuing weakening of the system of the two superpowers.\n91.\tAt the present time both of them are trying to overcome their difficulties by casting part of the burden on others; in the first instance, on the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The United States and the Soviet Union, through the credits they have granted and their alleged aid, the unequal trade deals and discrimination in respect of trade, investments, pillage of natural wealth, and by other neo-colonialist methods, are engaged in a frenetic course of economic aggression, seeking to ensure to themselves privileged positions and to enrich themselves at the expense of the developing countries, to sabotage their efforts at progress, to keep them in a state of dependence and thus to counteract the struggles which these countries are conducting in order to liquidate the after-effects of colonial domination, to put an end to the division of the world into rich countries and poor countries, into exploiter countries and exploited countries.\n92.\tIn recent times the two super-Powers have been intensifying their measures of constraint in order - to preserve their positions of hegemony and have been seeking to relieve themselves of some of these difficulties by shifting them to the backs of their partners and allies. The United States has submitted the draft of a new Atlantic charter or a declaration on the principles of the Atlantic Treaty as an effort to offset the attempts of the countries of Western Europe to strengthen themselves as a separate force, freed of American dependence. The Soviet Union, for its part, with the intention of halting the efforts of the countries of Eastern Europe to escape its control, has intensified its efforts in order to bring about as quickly as possible the complete political, economic and military integration of those countries within the framework of the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and to monopolize in its own hands the direction of all foreign relations of those countries, in accordance with the imperialist theory of \\\"limited sovereignty\\\".\n93.\tAt the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union, in order to cope with the problems confronting them in their own zones of influence and to put into application their global strategy, have come to an understanding and are assisting each other. They are intensifying their collaboration in all areas and in all parts of the world.\n94.\tNone the less, deep-rooted contradictions divide those two imperialist Powers that aspire to world hegemony. In the efforts of those Powers to establish their domination throughout the world, those contradictions, sooner or later, will end by breaking out into bloody conflicts, and those conflicts will lead the world to destruction, suffering and privation even greater than those which it has known heretofore. It is because they think and are prepared for such confrontations that the two super-Powers do not want to disarm. Collaboration is not and never can be absolute in relations between imperialist Powers. Their agreements are temporary and their rivalries eternal.\n95.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union try to convince us that the world is embarked upon an \\\"era of peace\\\" and that we are witnessing the introduction of a new system of international relations and that the \\\"balance of terror\\\" has given way to the \\\"balance of security\\\". According to them, that has been made possible owing to the extension of relations, the atmosphere of understanding and the agreements concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union, which will prove to be the guarantors of peace and security in the world. In fostering such a spirit of demobilization and compromise, the two super-Powers are seeking to create in peoples a pacifist psychosis and dangerous illusions to compel them, allegedly in the name of \\\"peaceful coexistence\\\" and the \\\"settlement of disputes by means of negotiations\\\", to make concessions and renounce the struggle to defend their national interests.\n96.\tBut no one allows himself to be taken in by this Soviet-American demagogy. The peace which the United States and the Soviet Union are extolling is illusory; behind their verbiage about peace are concealed their dangerous plans directed against sovereign peoples and countries, and their plans to repress and stifle any revolt or any resistance against them and any progressive and national liberation movement.\n97.\tOne is then entitled to ask oneself, How can one believe that peace and security are being strengthened when the two super-Powers are pursuing their relentless arms race, when they are unceasingly and steadily swelling their military budgets and are manufacturing new, more perfect weapons of mass destruction? Since people claim that war is remote, then why does anyone wish to organize those threatening military manoeuvres, and why do the United States and Soviet navies roam the seas in every direction? And why do they brandish all those weapons, and why are those war preparations being made?\n98.\tConsidering things as they are, we cannot fail to bring out the fact that the freedom and independence of sovereign countries, general peace and security, are increasingly threatened by the hegemonistic expansionist policy of the two imperialisms which are the most dangerous of our era, American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism, and that there is actually no real international detente in the world. As has been said by the well-loved leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, and I quote:\n\\\"Even if actually there is a certain degree of detente, that is true only as it applies between the imperialist super-Powers. But there is not and there will be no detente between them and us, between the peoples on the one hand and the imperialists and the social-imperialists on the other. For us it is abundantly clear that the imperialist-revisionist strategy, designed to stifle struggles and revolutionary movements as well as any resistance to their hegemony, to destroy and repress any force, any State or party which opposes the domination of the super-Powers, has remained unchanged. Only the tactics have changed and the means used, which have been multiplied in number and have been perfected\\\".\nThe detente that we are witnessing between the United States and the Soviet Union, which is accompanied by an accentuation of co-operation, compromise and bargaining between them, far from diminishing the danger of war and armed conflict, on the contrary enables the two superpowers to increase their pressures vis-\u00e0-vis the small independent countries, to intensify their efforts to intervene in the domestic affairs of peoples and sovereign countries, and creates dangerous situations and new hotbeds of tension on all continents.\n99.\tFresh proof of this is to be found in the recent summit meeting of the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. The agreements reached in the course of that meeting, as well as all the ultra-chauvinistic Nixonian or Brezhnevian concepts and doctrines which the two superpowers seek to propagate, are designed to legitimize their arbitrary acts, their arrogance and their diktats in international relations. They want to arrogate to themselves the attributes of a world super-Government and to become the arbiters and the masters of all international life, whereas sovereign peoples and countries would see themselves denied the right to participate on a footing of equality in the solution of problems of the hour and questions which, directly or indirectly, affect their vital interests.\n100.\tIn particular such an attitude finds its expression in summary form in the Soviet-American agreement on what is called the prevention of nuclear warfare.  Under the fallacious pretext that it is appropriate to take measures to ward off the threat of a nuclear war and prevent all forms of military confrontation, the two super-Powers are actually trying, through this agreement, to make sacrosanct at the present time in legal terms their right to intervene jointly at a time and a place they consider appropriate and to define the terms of this intervention. They are thus envisaging playing together the role of international gendarme.\n\n101.\tThe Soviet-American agreements which have already been concluded, like those which will be concluded in the framework of the so-called SALT negotiations-the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks-do not in any way set aside the danger of nuclear conflict and guarantee in no way that the considerable stockpiles of nuclear and strategic weapons will not be used against other countries. Through those agreements the United States and the Soviet Union do not intend to touch their nuclear strike-force, or to contribute to complete and general disarmament. They propose only to set up a balance which is acceptable to them, to preserve their nuclear monopoly and, above all, to impose on other States a whole series of restrictions in order to prevent any strengthening of their national defence potential and to compel them to place themselves under the American or Soviet atomic umbrella.\n102.\tIf the United States and the Soviet Union were sincerely interested in warding off the danger of a nuclear war, in dispelling the danger and threat of the use of atomic weapons, they should have accepted the clear and constructive proposals put forward for many long years now by the People's Republic of China. The commitment never to be the first to use nuclear weapons against other countries and the permanent prohibition of the manufacture and use of these weapons, together with the destruction of existing stockpiles thereof, would constitute the only specific steps towards disarmament and would create real guarantees for the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war. We believe that, so long as the two super-Powers continue to amass and steadily improve their nuclear armaments, together with those of other types, and so long as they use them as a means of exerting pressure and practising blackmail, countries have the unquestionable and legitimate right to take all the measures they deem appropriate and necessary for their defence.\n103.\tThe People's Republic of Albania, as a peace-loving European country, is interested in the just solution of the problems that concern the peoples of Europe and of the world. Albania has on numerous occasions clearly set forth its point of view on these problems, in particular with respect to European security.\n104.\tGuaranteeing the peace and security of Europe is an ardent and legitimate wish of the peoples of Europe. After two world wars that were particularly devastating to Europe, that continent should have been able to achieve its own stability and equilibrium. The great and historic victory over fascism aroused great hopes and created good reason to assume that a lasting peace would be brought to Europe and that true security would be achieved. But although 28 years have gone by since the day of victory, the peoples of Europe have not seen their aspirations realized.\n105.\tThe first to sabotage the establishment of true European security was the United States, which, taking advantage of the difficult time through which the countries of Western Europe were going, weakened as they were and seriously devastated by the war, succeeded in securing for itself privileged political, economic and military positions in those countries. In order to safeguard its imperialist interests and transform Western Europe into a base for attacking the socialist countries, the United States set up the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance and armed the Federal Republic of Germany and turned it into a great revanchist Power. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] became an organ for the domination of Western Europe by the United States. Thus for Europe there emerged the danger of new wars, and for the countries members of NATO the danger of losing their independence. One of the eminent statesmen of modern France, Charles de Gaulle, was well aware of the danger for the countries of Western Europe, particularly France, inherent in their integration into NATO and in due course he took steps to get the American troops out of France and to withdraw his own country from the military organization of that bloc.\n106.\tThe aggressive aims and activities of NATO, the rebirth of West German revanchism and the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty compelled the Soviet Union and the socialist countries to envisage the measures necessary for guaranteeing their security and to create the Warsaw Pact as a defensive alliance. For a certain time, that Pact served to contain within bounds the aims of the United States and NATO; but when the leaders of the Soviet Union abandoned the just anti-imperialist policy that had been followed in the post-war years under the leadership of Stalin, the Warsaw Pact, too, was transformed into an aggressive alliance, and the countries and peoples of Europe found themselves confronted with a fresh danger.\n107.\tMoreover, by not concluding a peace treaty with Germany, a treaty that should have been completed with the participation of all the countries that had contributed to the defeat of nazism, one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of balance in Europe was allowed to remain. The conclusion of that treaty was sabotaged first by the United States and later by the two super-Powers working together. The American imperialists did everything possible to bring West Germany out of the state of isolation in which it found itself as a conquered -nation, and they busied themselves in compelling it to follow a line that served the purposes of German revanchism within the framework of American strategy. At the present time, with the establishment of Soviet-West German co-operation, new conditions have been created enabling the Federal Republic of Germany to emerge as the greatest political, economic and military force in Western Europe and to affirm itself as the principal partner of the two super-Powers. Thus there have been created new ties, new imperialist alliances and a new threat to peace and security in Europe.\n108.\tSuch a state of affairs could not but appal the peoples of Europe, could not fail to awaken concern and arouse opposition among them. The fact is that a great many of the allies of the two super-Powers, especially those of Western Europe, no longer wish to see imposed upon them attitudes and objectives contrary to their interests. However, we do find in Western Europe one State which has traditionally followed a \\\"balancing\\\" policy. Although that policy has notoriously not brought any benefit to that State or to its partners, it continues to pursue that policy at the present juncture, thus helping the super-Powers and creating a favourable ground for them to manoeuvre in such fashion as to enable them to dictate their will with regard to European questions.\n109.\tThe achievement of European security certainly is a lofty objective, one for which all European countries should strive; but the road for reaching that objective cannot be that recommended by the two super-Powers. The events that have taken place in Europe, and particularly the preparatory consultations at Helsinki, together with the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe itself, have fully confirmed the view that the conditions necessary for convening an intra-European conference and for the establishment of genuine peace and security have not been created. These facts have served to dash the hope that such meetings might compel the two super-Powers to respect the rights of the sovereign countries of Europe. What took place at those meetings and the results achieved have confirmed the view of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania as expressed particularly in its memorandum of 29 June 1973, where it was emphasized that\n\\\"... the Soviet Union and the United States are attempting to channel the question of European security along lines that are dangerous for the interests of peace and of peoples, and that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, as a product of Soviet-American collusion, will serve the two super-Powers, and that it will not be able to escape from their control and their manipulations or go beyond the framework of the discussions between the aggressive blocs over which they preside\\\".\n110.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union have used the Helsinki negotiations to conceal from the peoples of Europe where the danger to them really lies and who is threatening them, and to set themselves up as defenders and guarantors of the peace and security of Europe. They have missed no opportunity to exert pressure and engage in demagogic manoeuvres to force that Conference to turn its back on the present-day reality of Europe and set out on the path which they themselves have laid down in advance. And beyond all question, it is thus that they will continue to act in the future as well.\n111.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Albania adheres to its viewpoint that an intra-European conference which does not deal with fundamental problems that concern the peoples and the States of Europe is not in a position to create the conditions which would make it possible to prevent or repel armed aggression. It cannot serve to bring about true peace and security on the continent. On the contrary, it serves only to increase insecurity in Europe and to create new dangers for European States, and enables the two super-Powers to draw political consequences from the situation. How can anyone talk about the establishment of lasting peace and the creation of an atmosphere of understanding and collaboration on the continent when the United States and the Soviet Union are intensifying their policy of hegemony, and are maintaining and strengthening aggressive blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and when they maintain their bases and their troops on the territory of several European countries? The United States and the Soviet Union are organizing the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe not by any means to contribute to the realization of the lofty aspirations of the peoples and countries of Europe who love freedom, but rather to preserve their zones of influence and to create in Europe a situation of relative tranquillity in order to enable them to spread their activities to other zones where their interests require their presence.\n112.\tThis conviction is even strengthened by the fact that, concomitantly with the Conference on \\\"European security\\\", there was convened another conference on the alleged reciprocal reduction of military forces in Europe. The purpose of the two super-Powers in this matter is to establish, within the framework of close negotiations between one bloc and another, a balance of their troops and their respective weapons in Europe and to weaken the defensive capacity of the European countries. At the same time we must see in this manoeuvre a farce staged by the United States and the Soviet Union to allay the anger which the European peoples feel at the presence of their troops, to perpetuate the stationing of these troops and to sanction the permanent violation of the sovereignty of European States. Any symbolic reduction of these troops in Europe will not diminish or set aside the threat and the danger which the policy of the two super-Powers represents for European peace and security.\n113.\tThis reduction in no way reduces their military power in Europe and does not affect their superiority over other countries in view of the. continuing perfecting of their means of combat. The interests of peace and security for the countries and peoples of Europe in general, and in particular those who, so many years after the end of the Second World War, still see foreign troops on their own home soil, call not for the reduction but for the complete evacuation and withdrawal of these troops, and a withdrawal from Europe of all military installations by the United States and the Soviet Union and the wiping out of all unequal agreements which enable these troops to enter and leave when and how they wish.\n114.\tThe European peoples and countries cannot in any way feel themselves in a state of assurance just so long as tensions subsist in other parts of the world and just so long as the aggressive navies of the United States and the Soviet Union are cruising in the Mediterranean basin, with their action being openly directed against the freedom and independence of the peoples and countries of this region of the world, and just so long as the super-Powers try to convert the Mediterranean into a base for aggression against the countries of Europe and other continents.\n115.\tThe Mediterranean peoples and countries that aspire to see the Mediterranean free of foreign navies and bases are opposed to this policy of aggressive hegemony by the two super-Powers and call for a removal of the United States and the Soviet navies from this sea. We have never ceased to feel that this legitimate aspiration could be achieved if such concrete and effective measures were taken as would make impossible the subsequent presence of the aggressive navies of the United States and the Soviet Union in those waters; in other words, if all foreign military bases were dismantled and if we prevented the creation of new bases, if no facility\n\nwas provided and no aid lent to the United States and the Soviet navies, and if those navies were refused the right to dock and to make visits to the ports of Mediterranean countries.\n116.\tThe situation created in Europe and in the Mediterranean cannot fail to command the attention of the peoples and countries of the Balkans, above all at a time when the great imperialist Powers are engaged in penetrating and spreading their influence in the Balkans. The Albanian Government has been and is still interested in seeing true peace and stability established in the Balkan peninsula, and it is convinced that this can be brought about, thanks to the efforts of the peoples of this region themselves, without entrusting to anyone else the defence and the guarantee of their interests. The ties of friendship and understanding between the peoples and countries of the Balkans, based on known principles which govern the relations between sovereign States and the policy of good-neighbourliness, should serve as a solid basis to achieve this end. It is necessary to oppose any effort by the superpowers or by anyone, whoever he may be, to speculate on the problems of this region of the world and to intervene in its domestic affairs, directly or through other means, as they are endeavouring to do now through the Conference on European Security and the Vienna negotiations, or as they would seek to do by taking advantage of another similar occasion if this possibility were opened to them.\n117.\tThe maintenance of a situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East testifies to the false nature of the allegations to the effect that throughout the world now we have witnessed a great positive change which will enable us to make progress towards solving the most burning problems of the hour, and that, as a result of the goodwill and concern of the two super-Powers, all of this will be brought about. It is with good reason that the peoples and States of the Arab world, victims of imperialist-Zionist aggression, while pursuing their struggle, demand that an end should be put to such a situation, that the vestiges of aggression should be wiped out as soon as possible and that all their rights that have been trampled' under foot should be fully restored. But these legitimate demands encounter the criminal opposition of Israel and the deeply hostile anti-Arab attitude of the two super-Powers. While the Israeli Zionists obstinately and arrogantly press their annexationist claims and while they intensify their acts of war and armed provocation against Egypt, Syria and other Arab States, the United States and the Soviet Union, in various forms, are supporting and encouraging Israel and exerting pressure on the Arab countries to bring them to make concessions and sacrifice their sovereign rights. They are hatching intrigues against Arab unity, creating internal and foreign difficulties for the Arab States and engaging in plots against them. The Soviet-American summit meeting this year and other events have shown more clearly than ever before that the two super-Powers are opposed to a just solution of the Middle East question and are seeking to preserve at any cost the status quo and their neo-colonialist interests in that part of the world. The Israeli plots and the plots of the two super-Powers, as well as their efforts to destroy the Palestine movement and to eradicate the Palestine problem completely, at the same time are directed against all the Arab nations because the Palestine people is fighting also for the common cause of the Arabs.\n118.\tThe Albanian Government and people have supported and will continue to support firmly our brother Arab peoples. They will vigorously support the Palestine people, which has made and is continuing to accept vast sacrifices to preserve its national existence and to reconquer its homeland, which has been seized from it. The Palestine people is carrying out a just and heroic struggle and nothing will cause it to bend, neither violence and plots, nor the diabolical slanders and outrageous labels which the Israeli- Zionists and their supporters try to apply to them. We firmly believe that it will continue the struggle until final victory and that it will never accept the fate that its enemies are seeking to prepare for it, to condemn it to live forever as a people of refugees, or to pile it up in a desert corner of a so-called Palestine State, or to place it under the power of any traitorous Arab sovereign.\n119.\tThe People's Republic of Albania demands that an end should be put as quickly as possible to the serious and ominous situation existing in the Middle East as the result of the pursuit of imperialist-Zionist aggression. The Israeli aggressors should unconditionally withdraw from all occupied Arab territories and cease all forms of provocations, acts of war and terrorism against the Arab countries. We should bar the way to any imperialist intervention in this part of the world and restore all the sovereign rights of the Palestine people.\n120.\tIn Indo-China, as a result of the fortunate development of the legendary struggle for their national independence which the heroic peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia have been carrying on for many years against the armed aggression of the United States, a new situation has been created. In January of this year the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  was concluded. The withdrawal of the United States troops, which the United States had been compelled to agree to, constitutes a great victory for the people of Viet-Nam and a heavy political and military defeat for the American imperialists. This victory of the people of Viet-Nam has been hailed by all the peoples of the world, which are inspired and will always be inspired by its heroic struggle and its lofty spirit of sacrifice. Viet-Nam will go down in history as a great example of what can be accomplished by a people, no matter how small it might be, when it is determined to fight to the very end for its just cause.\n121.\tAt the present time the United States of America, without renouncing its aggressive aims in Viet-Nam and throughout Indo-China, is manoeuvring in every possible I way to maintain for ever its presence in South Viet-Nam and to prevent the people of Viet-Nam from achieving its supreme aspirations. It is systematically violating the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam; it is supporting and steadily arming the puppet regime of Saigon and it is inciting people to engage in new acts of war and provocations against the liberated zone of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. In fact,\nit is pursuing its military commitment and its intervention in the domestic affairs of the people of Viet-Nam and the other peoples of Indo-China, and placing serious obstacles in the path of the establishment of true peace in Viet-Nam.\n122.\tThe interests of peace and stability in Viet-Nam and throughout Indo-China require that the United States and\nthe Saigon regime, which is under its orders, put an end once and for all, and without delay, to all the violations of the agreements on Viet-Nam, and that they strictly respect the commitments they have undertaken in accordance with these agreements, as is being done by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, which is the only legal Government of South Viet-Nam. If the United States and the puppet regime of Saigon stubbornly persist in their designs of aggression, they will certainly experience new defeats which will be even more overwhelming. The people of Viet-Nam, which is continually standing vigil over the. defence of the victories that it has won, is determined to wage its just struggle to the very end, until it has won a complete triumph.\n123.\tFor more than three years the valiant Cambodian people has been involved in a heroic armed struggle for its national independence against the American imperialist aggressors and the traitorous clique of Lon Nol. Under the leadership of the United National Front of Cambodia, it has won overwhelming victories on the battlefield and it has become invincible. Neither the unprecedented intensification of the United States armed aggression and the barbarous air bombardments nor the efforts of the United States to \\\"Khmerize\\\" the war in Cambodia, nor the plots and political combinations which are worked out against it have succeeded in causing it to yield. The new victory which it has won by compelling the United States to cease its air bombardment over Cambodia is one more evidence of its determination and its invincibility. At present the initiative lies entirely in the hands of the Cambodian people and the armed liberation forces. The United States plans to transform Cambodia into a colony and to maintain in being the puppet regime of Phnom Penh are doomed to imminent and complete failure.\n124.\tDespite all this, the United States has not given up its efforts to impose on the people of Cambodia the tricky solution of a \\\"cessation of fighting\\\" and \\\"peaceful settlement\\\" American-style. What it wants is to compel that people to renounce the complete liberation of the country and thus save the bankrupt clique of Phnom Penh, to compel the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia to share power with the traitors and, finally, to create in Cambodia a de facto division into two zones or two States, two Governments or two administrations. In this connexion, the United States enjoys the support of the Soviet Government, which, from the very outset, has maintained a hostile attitude towards the just struggle of the people of Cambodia. Refusing to recognize the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, the Soviet Government has maintained and still maintains diplomatic relations with the puppets of Phnom Penh, thus taking a position against the just struggle of the people of Cambodia. The Soviet leaders, completely discredited by their attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Cambodian problem, now claim with shameless cynicism to support the struggle of the liberation forces of Cambodia, and are seeking directly to intervene in the domestic affairs of the Cambodian people.\n125.\tBut the freedom-loving Cambodian people is determined, courageously and without falling back, to pursue its armed struggle until the complete liberation of its country and until the just demands formulated in the historic five-point declaration of the legal Head of State, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, on 23 March 1970 have been satisfied; that declaration is the only basis of a just settlement of the Cambodian problem.\n126.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Albania considers it necessary to emphasize that it is completely illegal and manifestly contrary to the Charter to deny to the Cambodian people its legitimate rights to be represented in the United Nations and to maintain in its stead the puppet clique of Phnom Penh, which represents nothing, neither a people nor a State. The only legitimate representatives of the people of Cambodia are the United National Front and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. Only that Government, which exercises complete and unquestioned power over more than 90 per cent of the territory and 80 per cent of the population of Cambodia, which has set up its agencies everywhere, which directs and organizes the life of almost the whole of the country and which enjoys the support and help of the entire Cambodian people, has the capacity and the attributes necessary to represent the latter in international relations and in the United Nations.\n127.\tThe trip which Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the legal Head of State and President of the United National Front of Cambodia, made last spring to Cambodia and the National Congress held recently clearly confirm the effective power of the United National Front and of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia throughout the country and have increased their prestige and their authority in the international arena. Clear evidence of this 's to be found, inter alia, in the fact that 48 countries have established and maintained diplomatic relations with the Royal Government of National Union and that the participants in the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September, recognized that Government as the only legal Government of Cambodia.\n128.\tIn order to put an end as soon as possible to the great injustice done to the people of Cambodia, it is necessary that the General Assembly, without delay, take the decision immediately to expel the representatives of the puppet Lon Nol clique and to invite the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia to take its rightful seat.\n129.\tAlthough 20 years have elapsed since it was compelled to put an end to its aggressive war in Korea and to sign an armistice agreement, the United States none the less continues to maintain its occupation troops in South Korea and to incite the Seoul regime to engage in excessive acts of armed provocation against the peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For 20 years the United Nations has been intervening in this matter without taking any concrete measure to put an end to such a situation. The maintenance of such a state of affairs constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereign rights of the Korean people; it hampers its efforts for the reunification of the country, increases tension in Korea, seriously endangers peace and stability in the surrounding zone and seriously undermines the prestige of the United Nations.\n130.\tThe achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people and the interests of peace and stability in the Far East demand that as soon as possible a remedy should be found for this intolerable situation, and that the United States should withdraw its troops and its bases from South Korea and cease all military engagements in that country, that the illegal United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved immediately, and that any intervention by the United Nations in the domestic affairs of the Korean people should cease.\n131.\tPeace-loving Members of the Organization, acting in the spirit of the Charter, should try to ensure that the General Assembly takes the proper decision along these lines in order that these important and urgent steps can be taken, as called for in the draft resolution submitted by Algeria and a certain number of other Member countries [A/C.1/L.644 and Corr.1]. The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania fully supports the draft resolution.\n132.\tIn recent times the United States and the Seoul administration, without heeding these demands and the need to provide a just solution to the question, worked out the plot of the \\\"two Koreas\\\" and they are attempting to impose that settlement on the Korean people and also on Member States through the discussion of the question concerning the so-called \\\"dual representation of Korea\\\". By this manoeuvre they are attempting to legalize and perpetuate the division of Korea into two States, to perpetuate the United States colonial domination in South Korea, and to divert the attention of the General Assembly from the substance of the Korean problem in order to get the discussion bogged down in an impasse.\n133.\tThere is only one Korea that exists in the world. Its division into two parts is a result of the hostile and aggressive policy that the United States has been pursuing for many years against the Korean people and an end should be put to this situation as soon as possible. The Korean people has constituted and continues to constitute one single nation. It must live again united. The Korean people has the supreme and sovereign right to decide for itself all the questions that concern it without intervention from outside, and that is something that no one has the right to deny to that people.\n134.\tThe Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the only legal representative of the Korean people, has steadily attempted efforts and has taken a series of important and reasonable initiatives in order to bring about the realization of this right and of this ardent aspiration of the people of Korea. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania supports the constructive proposals contained in the five-point programme presented by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 23 June last [see A[9027, para. 19], proposals which testify once again to its desire to see created an atmosphere of understanding, collaboration and national unity in Korea with a view to a just solution of the Korean problem and which tear the mask from those who press for division and prepare for war in this country. We vehemently condemn the plot of the \\\"two Koreas\\\" and any steps which the United States, alone or with the aid of its accomplices, may undertake to legalize this state of affairs through the United Nations. The question of the representation of Korea in the United Nations is a domestic matter for the Korean people and it is only for that people to decide this question and for no one else. The most recent five-point proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sketches the proper course for the solution of this problem in accordance with the aspirations of the entire Korean people and in the light of the conditions obtaining in that country.\n135.\tNot only in Indo-China and in the Far East but also in other parts of the Asian continent \u2014 in the Arabian Gulf and in the Indo-Pakistani peninsula, in the Indian and in the Pacific Oceans-the two imperialist super-Powers are collaborating and rivalling each other in their expansionist aggressive activities, increasing tension and threatening the interests of sovereign peoples and countries. A succession of events has not ceased to provide us with evidence of this fact. And clear evidence is also to be found at present in the intensification of the efforts of the Soviet Union to impose on Asian peoples and countries its plan for \\\"collective security in Asia\\\", which is just as dangerous as their so-called scheme for European security or international security.\n136.\tHow can anyone talk about \\\"collective security in Asia\\\" when the authors of that plan, the Soviet social imperialists, have encouraged and are supporting Indian aggression against Pakistan, when they have engaged in armed provocation against the People's Republic of China, when, preparing war, they have at present massed numerous troops on the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian frontiers, when they are constantly whipping up anti-Chinese hysteria and strengthening their naval forces in the Indian Ocean, and when they are engaging in subversive activities and stirring up quarrels and conflicts among the Asian countries?\n137.\tThe so-called collective security in Asia is directed against the freedom and independence of the sovereign peoples and countries of that continent, and against the national and revolutionary liberation movement in that part of the world. It is directed first of all against the People's Republic of China, which is the stalwart bulwark of socialism, the most powerful defender of the struggle of peoples for freedom and national independence, the country which most sincerely supports the effort of sovereign States for their independent development and progress, and which fights with determination against the policy of hegemony of the two super-Powers.\n138.\tNone the less, the imperialists and social imperialists and other reactionaries of all kinds and colours have failed and will continue to fail in their anti-Chinese activity. That great country, the People's Republic of China, a powerful socialist State which enjoys great prestige and plays a tremendous role in the international arena, is pursuing a revolutionary policy both at home and abroad and, in accordance with the principles of that policy, is developing and strengthening continuously, thus advancing firmly along the path of socialism and revolution. That is a source . of pleasure and encouragement to all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples.\n139.\tThe People's Republic of Albania will always stand side by side with peoples and countries fighting for freedom, independence and national sovereignty against imperialism, both old and new, colonialism and neocolonialism. My delegation wishes to express the feelings of friendship and solidarity of the Albanian people towards peoples who are suffering from colonial oppression and the policy of genocide and racial discrimination; it denounces the bloody crimes of the Portuguese colonizers and the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, it demands that resolutions and decisions which for many long years have been adopted by the United Nations along these lines should not be trampled underfoot but should be put into effect. It hails the just struggle of these peoples and is firmly convinced that they will triumph.\n140.\tThe Albanian people, like all progressive peoples and progressive public opinion throughout the world, condemns the coup d'etat organized in Chile by the rightist forces incited and supported by American imperialism. We express our support and solidarity with the Chilean people, which at the present time is going through a difficult moment of its history because of the campaign of violence and terror which has been raging throughout the country.\n141.\tWe vigorously support the efforts of a great many independent developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America that are making efforts to strengthen their political and economic independence, to defend their national rights and national resources, to consolidate their sovereignty and to preserve their territorial integrity.\n142.\tThe People's Republic of Albania is a peace-loving State. It has fought and will continue to fight with determination to defend its freedom, its independence and its sovereignty and it is determined to stand up against, and to bring to nought, all plans and all the aggressive aims and threats of the United States imperialists and the social imperialists in the Soviet Union which are directed against it. Albania will continue always to act as a factor of peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe and it will pursue, as always, and in consistent fashion, its foreign policy, which is unchanging and one of principle in the service of the cause of socialism, freedom, the independence of sovereign peoples and countries, and general peace and security throughout the world.\n143.\tAt the outset of the work of this session the General Assembly decided to admit to membership the two German States, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as Members of the United Nations. In voting in favour of that decision the Albanian delegation explained [2119th meeting] the attitude of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania in connexion with certain aspects of the German problem which heretofore have not met with a just and final solution because of the failure to conclude a peace treaty between vanquished Germany and the victors of the anti-Fascist coalition, a treaty which should include the necessary clauses and obligations so that we can prevent a renaissance of militarism and German revanchism and in order to ensure that indemnities are paid for all of the damage experienced by those countries because of the occupation or aggression to which they were subjected by Hitlerite Germany.\n144.\tThe Albanian delegation affirms once again in this Assembly the views it expressed a few days ago, and it wishes to emphasize that the People's Republic of Albania does not give up its demand that Germany satisfy all the rights which Albania acquired as a country which participated in the anti-Fascist coalition.\n145.\tThe Albanian people was one of the first victims of Fascist aggression, and the occupation of our country by Germany during the Second World War brought it immense suffering and privation, damage and vast destruction. Because of this fact, 28,000 Albanians were killed  \u2014  3 per cent of the population of the country at that time - 12,600 were wounded, and 12,150 deported. Tens of thousands of other persons were used as forced labour by the German occupying forces. The economy and all sectors of the life of the country suffered vast losses. Suffice it to recall that 100,000 homes or buildings were set fire to or reduced to ashes, 1,850 towns and villages out of the 2,500 which Albania had at that time were destroyed. The losses in livestock, large and small, which were killed or carried off amounted to 800,000 head. Agriculture, forests, mines, ports, roads, bridges and means of transport and communication were destroyed. Monetary treasure and great quantities of objects of art and archaeological treasures were pillaged. Estimates made by the competent State commissions after the war show that the monetary value of the loss suffered by our country because of German occupation amounts to approximately $2,000 million, calculated at the value of the dollar in 1938.\n146.\tBecause of its heroic struggle side by side with other peoples and countries of the anti-Fascist coalition, the Albanian people made a valuable contribution to the historic victory won over fascism. In proportion to the area of its territory, which is 28,000 square kilometres, and its population at the-time, 1 million inhabitants, Albania, in terms of losses in manpower and cultural and material property, is in the forefront of the countries which fought fascism.\n147.\tThe Albanian people, by its struggle and by the blood which was shed by thousands of its sons and daughters, won the undeniable and imprescriptible right to payment of the damages inflicted upon it by Germany. As was stipulated in particular in Potsdam:\n\\\"In accordance with the Crimea decision that Germany be compelled to compensate to the greatest possible extent for the loss and suffering that she has caused to the United Nations and for which the German people cannot escape responsibility . . .\\\"\nthe People's Republic of Albania declares before this Assembly that it demands that it should be paid as soon as possible the full measure of reparations for the damage which the troops and occupation authorities of Hitlerite Germany inflicted upon Albania during the Second World War, as well as for the losses suffered because of the postponement of the payment of these reparations.\n148.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express my delegation's conviction that Member States which have at heart the interests of national independence and freedom and general peace and security will firmly oppose the pressures and intrigues of the two super-Powers, that they will reject their secret diplomacy carried out through this Organization and outside it, and that they will not allow them to prevent the present session of the General Assembly from looking objectively and seriously at the important problems confronting it. With that goal in mind, the delegation of the People's Republic of Albania will spare no effort, in the course of this session also, to make its modest contribution towards that end.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff27.\tOn behalf of the Norwegian delegation I have the honour to extend to Mr. Leopoldo Benites our best congratulations upon his election as President of this Assembly. I can assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation in his important task.\n28.\tWe are meeting at a time when international relations are marked by a general trend towards rapprochement and detente. As a result of this process of detente and normalization this Assembly has just welcomed the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic as full Members of the United Nations. I should like to join the preceding speakers in expressing my Government's satisfaction that the two German States and the Bahamas will now participate fully in the work of our Organization.\n29.\tThe process towards normalization and detente has been particularly encouraging in East-West relations. Global as well as European trends, great-Power interests as well as European aspirations, have interacted to prepare the ground for taking up unsolved questions through talks in different forums and on different levels. The rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and States of Eastern Europe represent particularly valuable contributions to the process towards normalization of relations and relaxation of tension in Europe.\n30.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a further confirmation that this positive process is continuing. My Government considers it particularly important that that Conference should enable all interested States in the region, large or small, to engage themselves actively in the work for relaxation of tension and for security and co-operation. We view the Conference not as an end in itself but as an important opening up of a new multilateral phase of East-West negotiations which we sincerely hope will progressively lead to more stable and co-operative relationships in Europe.\n31.\tThe process of detente in Europe is, however, only in its first stages. It has not so far had any direct effect on the high level of armaments, nor has it brought a solution to the underlying causes of conflict. Determination and strong political will indeed will be needed to carry forward the trend toward security and cooperation. There is a close relationship between political detente on the one hand and concrete measures for arms control and disarmament on the other. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the forthcoming negotiations on force reductions in Central Europe represent important steps in the right direction. My Government fully and actively supports those steps.\n32.\tAs to the broader question of the need for further efforts for arms control and disarmament, my delegation will at a later stage give a comprehensive presentation of Norwegian views on those vital issues. On this occasion I shall confine myself to underlining the importance which my Government attaches to the necessity of associating all States-and particularly all nuclear-weapon States-in both current and future negotiations on arms control and disarmament.\n33.\tReverting to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, my Government has repeatedly stated that the Conference should base itself on a generous and outward-looking philosophy and should see to it that the increased co-operation between the States participating in the Conference will also benefit the developing countries and the world community. It is my conviction that it is in the best interest of Europe and the world at large that the process which has been started in Europe should continue. It is my sincere hope that this process might serve as an example and contribute to more stable relationships, increased security and more comprehensive co-operation between all States represented here.\n3A. Unfortunately, those general trends towards detente and rapprochement are not reflected in all parts of the world. Today, at the sixth General Assembly since the six-day war, my Government strongly regrets that the situation in the Middle East has not yet been brought nearer to a peaceful solution. The international community should not allow this rather dangerous state of affairs to persist. We should all urge the parties directly concerned and the great Powers, which all have a special responsibility, to exert every possible effort in order to break the present deadlock and move towards a comprehensive solution, as anticipated in Security Council resolution 242(1967). My Government holds the opinion that the basic principles contained in that resolution still constitute the best basis for a lasting and just peace in the region; that the acquisition of territory by war cannot be accepted; that every State in the area should have the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and that due regard must be paid to the rights of the Palestinians.\n35.\tWhile dealing with the situation in the Middle East I should like also to pay a tribute to the work done by the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA] and his staff. It is important that all Member countries now contribute towards providing UNRWA with a more solid financial basis for its work, which is important not only from a humanitarian point of view but also in a political context. In Norway, we attach special importance to the forward-looking aspects of its work, particularly in the field of education.\n36.\tTurning now to South-East Asia, my Government is deeply, disappointed that, despite the agreements reached, the parties to the conflicts in Indo-China have not yet created conditions which would secure the rights of the Indo-Chinese peoples to determine freely their own future. It is imperative that further efforts be made towards that aim. The uncertain destiny of the civilian political prisoners should be of deep concern to all of us. For humanitarian reasons we urge that all prisoners now be released and repatriated according to their free will.\n37.\tThe situation in southern Africa, where still large parts of the African population are denied their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, is another discouraging aspect of the present world situation.\n38.\tIn April this year Norway had the privilege of being host to the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa, held at Oslo, and arranged jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The Conference itself did not formulate any formal recommendations, but it highlighted a number of proposals for a comprehensive plan of action for solving the problems of southern Africa. Those proposals will be before the General Assembly at this session. We hope that the Assembly will welcome the report from the Oslo Conference, and consider it in a positive way. The Norwegian delegation will participate fully in the following up of the Conference in a realistic and constructive manner.\n39.\tMy Government's general position as regards the problems of southern Africa is well known. We will continue to support the oppressed peoples who are struggling for independence, self-determination and liberation. Our humanitarian and other forms of economic aid to the liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity will be increased.\n40.\tIn line with the general principles guiding our foreign policy, we should have preferred to see the process of\nliberation of southern Africa taking peaceful forms through negotiations. We realize, however, that when one of the parties refuses persistently to negotiate, the possibilities for peaceful change are frustrated, and sooner or later armed struggle becomes inevitable. In cases where channels for negotiations are still open and available we would, therefore, strongly recommend that these be used before it is too late.\n41.\tWorld opinion has been appalled by recent reports of atrocities committed by Portuguese forces in Mozambique. My Government deeply regrets that the Portuguese Government has rejected suggestions presented to it by a number of Governments \u2014 including my own \u2014 to let the reported atrocities be investigated by a broadly composed, impartial international commission of inquiry, preferably under the auspices of the United Nations. This rejection on the part of the Portuguese Government cannot but strengthen the concern caused by these reports.\n42.\tThese reports have -also strengthened our conviction that an end must be brought to this war and to Portuguese colonial rule. We find it difficult to understand that\nPortugal, in this part of the twentieth century, in contrast to other former colonial Powers, does not realize the futility of fighting the colonial peoples' irresistible urge for independence and justice. We appeal to Portugal to abandon its colonial policies and to enter into negotiations with representatives of the liberation movements, recognizing the rights of the African peoples to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n43.\tTurning now to the Indian subcontinent, Norway welcomes the recent agreements between the three countries in the area on the repatriation of prisoners of war and the exchange of displaced civilians. The implementation of these agreements will demand substantial financial resources, towards which the international community should contribute. Norway will for its part assist in providing the necessary funds.\n44.\tWe hope the agreements concluded will pave the way for normalization of the relations between the three countries and also of their relations with the outside world. Such a normalization would serve the interests of the subcontinent itself and the world at large. We hope that Bangladesh will this year take its place in our Organization,\n45.\tWe take it that this Assembly will have a comprehensive debate on the Korean question. My Government holds the view that the two Korean Governments should be invited to take part in this debate without any pre-conditions. Although the results of the bilateral talks between North and South Korea have so far not been too encouraging, the direct contacts established between them and the general trend towards relaxation of international tension should facilitate progress in the Korean question. The role of the United Nations in Korea should now be adjusted in accordance with current developments. This should be done in an orderly manner which will not affect the legal and political basis for the policies pursued hitherto by the United Nations in Korea. We should also constantly bear in mind that the basic aim of our discussion and decisions is to promote peace and detente on the Korean peninsula.\n46.\tNorway and the other Nordic countries have now normalized their relations with both Korean Governments. I should like to reiterate from this rostrum the wish expressed by the Nordic Foreign Ministers in the communiqu\u00e9s from their meetings in Oslo and Stockholm this year that as many States as possible should normalize their relations with the two Korean Governments in order that those Governments may play their proper role in the international community.\n47.\tI should now like to turn to some of the more general problems confronting our Organization today.\n48.\tThe Secretary-General reminds us in his latest report [A/9001/Add.l] that Governments have a tendency to pursue their strict and narrow national aims in the United Nations without regard to the Organization as such. We should all consider ourselves addressees of this warning. We should no doubt devote more time and energy to strengthening our Organization. The objective must be a strong and vigorous world Organization as the main basis of an international legal system and a global collective security system.\n49.\tProposals have been made for a general revision of the Charter. That the Charter is far from being a perfect document is no doubt true. On the other hand, it is difficult to see any genuine need for a general revision. The Charter has shown itself to be a flexible instrument. Through a forward-looking and pragmatic interpretation of the Charter it should be possible also in the future to give a dynamic thrust to our Organization.\n50.\tNorway has always supported the principle of universality. If the United Nations is today to play the role of an effective world organization it must be open and representative, not closed and exclusive. In our opinion no useful purpose is served by excluding any country from participation in the United Nations. This general consideration ought to apply even to a Member State which fails to fulfil its commitments under the Charter or under resolutions passed by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Also with regard to such countries it is essential that we preserve for the world community the important means of influence and persuasion inherent in United Nations membership.\n51.\tIn the many specialized agencies of the United Nations extensive technical co-operation is carried on which is of great value to all member countries. In recent years, however, we have experienced an increasing tendency to introduce political issues into the work. We realize, of course, that these organizations cannot isolate themselves from contemporary political currents and events. We must, however, see to it that progress in the many specialized agencies is not hampered by an inappropriate introduction of political issues. Such issues should not be dealt with in the specialized agencies but should be referred to the principal political body of the United Nations, the General Assembly, for discussion there.\n52.\tThe development of the United Nations has in many ways emphasized some fundamental contradictions and paradoxes in the structure of the Organization. I should like to draw the attention of this Assembly to one of them.\n53.\tIn principle the Charter prohibits intervention, in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any Member State. At the same time the United Nations is committed to work for securing human rights for all. This cannot be done without some interference in what are traditionally regarded as \\\"domestic affairs\\\". Over and over again we see States invoking the argument of \\\"domestic affairs\\\" when attention is drawn to violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms. The Secretary-General has in his last report rightly pointed to the fact that the protection of human rights is an area where the credibility of the United Nations is especially at stake [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 5]. All States should realize that the impact of violations of human rights transcends national borders and influences in a rather negative way not only relations between nations but also the international climate in general. Such violations, wherever they occur, are consequently the concern of the international community as a whole and cannot be considered merely a domestic affair.\n54.\tIn this connexion I want to say a few words also about recent developments in Chile. Through free and democratic elections three years ago, Salvador Allende was given the mandate to govern Chile on the basis of a progressive reformist programme aiming at social justice. This has now been brought to an end through the use of force. Thus the hopes of millions of people have been frustrated. We deeply regret these developments and we appeal for democracy to be restored in Chile.\n55.\tWe are also concerned about reports of mistreatment and persecution of supporters of President Allende's Government in Chile. The international community has the right to expect that human rights will be respected and that all political prisoners will be released immediately.\n56.\tI shall now turn to some specific questions which will be discussed at this General Assembly and to which Norway attaches special importance. The first of these questions concerns international terrorism [item 94].\n.57. The serious problems caused by international terrorism are of a global nature and should therefore be' dealt with within the United Nations or other world-wide organizations.\n58.\tTo be frank, we are disappointed with the outcome of the work so far done by the United Nations in this field. In our view the highest possible priority should now be given by the United Nations to the work aiming at effective measures for the combat of terrorism. Substantial progress towards co-ordinated international action should be made as-early as this session of the General Assembly.\n59.\tWe realize that it will be a difficult and time-consuming process to reach a comprehensive international agreement for the prevention of all kinds of terrorism. The best way of handling the matter would .perhaps be to deal with the different categories of acts of international terrorism and connected problems in separate conventions or other international instruments. Norway will support motions to give high priority at this session of the Assembly to the completion of a convention for the protection of diplomats [item 90]. Such a convention will, like the Conventions on safety in the air which have now been ratified or acceded to by the Nordic countries, form the basis for a global combat against specific acts of terrorism.\n60.\tWhen drafting conventions or other international instruments in this field, we should also have the following points in mind: first, conventions must respect the exclusive competence of the Security Council with regard to sanctions; second, conventions must not lend themselves to the interpretation that they are directed against the legitimate struggle of the African liberation movements for independence and freedom. We fully agree that, in accordance with the decision taken by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the underlying causes for international terrorism should be studied [resolution 3034 (XXVII)]. But I should like to emphasize that these studies or any other study of, for instance, the definition of international terrorism should not in any way be permitted to delay efforts to devise effective measures against international terrorism.\n61.\tLet me now turn to another subject to which this Assembly should give high priority. I am referring to the question of human rights in armed conflicts [item 54].\n62.\tNorway will continue to play an active role in the work\\\" of the United Nations and the Red Cross expert conferences for the reaffirmation and development of the international legal rules regarding the protection of human rights in armed conflicts. We support the initiative taken by the Swiss Federal Council in convening a first session of a diplomatic conference on this important question in Geneva in 1974.  New and complex conflict situations- guerrilla and counter-guerrilla, technological and electronic warfare-have made it imperative to study the question of an improved legal protection of civilians, prisoners and combatants in such kinds of conflicts. New legal restraints should be imposed on the use of weapons and weapon systems that may cause unnecessary suffering, have indiscriminate effects or lead to ecological changes. The applicability of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 should be confirmed as regards all kinds of armed conflict, including wars of national liberation.\n63.\tThe United Nations not only is an organization for peace and security, but is also meant to be an instrument for international economic and social co-operation and solidarity in a global perspective. The promotion of economic and social growth and the ensuring of access to resources and their consumption, thereby improving the standard of living for the have-nots of the world, should be one of the main tasks of the United Nations today. In this field, however, we must admit that the world community has so far only managed to make a very modest beginning. The gap between the poor and the rich in the world is steadily widening, and this state of affairs could in the future come to represent a very serious source of conflict. I think we should all be willing to admit that none of us in our practical policies has been willing to recognize the full consequences of this steadily deepening gulf between the industrialized and the developing countries as well as of the widening disparities between and within the developing countries. We are here faced with a challenge which seems to require a fundamentally new way of thinking, and sacrifices far beyond those that the industrialized countries and the privileged few in the developing countries have been willing to make so far. In the years ahead it will be an important task to convince public opinion in our countries of the necessity of such sacrifices.\n64.\tSpecial attention should be paid to the least developed countries. Furthermore, due consideration should be given to the willingness on the part of the recipient countries to pursue a policy of economic and social justice.\n65.\tNorway shares the view recently expressed in different international bodies \u2014 particularly in the Committee for Development Planning-that the development process should include, in addition to economic elements, certain basic social components, such as nutrition, health and education.\n66.\tNorway has fully endorsed the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. With regard to the quantitative goal, my Government has decided to exclude private transfers from the 1 per cent target for total transfers, because such transfers consist of rather diverse elements and because governments have a limited influence on the volume of such transfers. Consideration of the poor countries' increasing indebtedness has played an important role in this regard.\n67.\tThe Norwegian Government has, with the approval of the Norwegian Parliament, established a new set of basic principles and a new quantitative target for our development co-operation. Norway intends to reach 1 per cent of gross national- product in official development assistance by 1978. A part of this goal is the achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in 1975 as stipulated in the International Development Strategy. With very- minor qualifications, all of this assistance is to be untied and on a grant basis. Furthermore, Norway intends to continue to channel about 50 per cent of its assistance through multilateral organizations.\n68.\tAs regards the comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations officially opened in Tokyo recently, I would like to reconfirm my Government's full support for the aims of these negotiations. The benefits to the world economy as a whole of an expansion of international trade through reductions of tariffs and other barriers are obvious. However, the wider purpose of the negotiations cannot be achieved if we do not also consider the position of those countries which are not likely to benefit much from a general removal of barriers. For developing countries to achieve a reasonable balance of advantage, a new and imaginative attack upon commodity problems is definitely called for.\n69.\tNext year will be the World Population Year. It is my hope that the forthcoming World Population Conference will lead to an action-oriented programme which can bring humanity closer to a solution of the fundamental problem of how to bring the population explosion under control. If we should not succeed in this task, our common endeavours to create decent conditions of life on this planet will probably be doomed to failure. The question also has a strong bearing on the individual human being's legitimate claim to a decent existence and to a minimum standard of nutrition, health, housing and education. In reality, we are here dealing with a question of human rights and of .the freedom and dignity of the individual.\n70.\tIn conclusion, I would like to address myself to the problems of the law of the sea. I shall not in my intervention today go closely into the substance of these problems. I would like, however, to emphasize the great urgency and the pressing need for solutions which characterize all the law of the sea issues. We must bear this urgency in mind when later in the session we carry out our review-as foreseen in last year's resolution [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)] -of the decision on the arrangements for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n71.\tThe rapid advances of modern technology are increasingly posing new problems as regards the protection and distribution of the marine resources and the marine environment generally. These are problems with which all our Governments are daily struggling and which, in the absence of agreed international solutions, carry in them seeds of international conflict.\n72.\tSeen in that context the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea has a bearing also on world peace. It is therefore essential that the Conference should result in solutions which can command the broadest possible support and which can reflect and accommodate the needs of the various groups of States.\n73.\tOne such solution would, in the view of the Norwegian Government, be the adoption of the proposal for an economic zone limited to 200 nautical miles, in which the coastal State would have sovereign rights over the natural resources, while guaranteeing at the same time the right of freedom of navigation and over flight in the zone. Only a solution on these lines could, in our view, provide a sufficient basis for effective resource management- including the need to allocate the exploitation of the resources in a way which takes the interest of coastal populations sufficiently into account. The coastal State's rights under the treaty should, however, in our view, be coupled with a corresponding duty to exercise those rights in a way which ensures that the living resources are not endangered through over-exploitation, and which makes it mandatory for the coastal State to co-operate with the appropriate regional and global organizations to that end.\n74.\tIt is furthermore of importance to remember that a treaty on economic zones would not by itself establish such zones. All it would do would be to ensure a recognized legal basis for their establishment, and this only to the extent that it would not be contrary to regional or bilateral agreements. Whether and to what extent the individual coastal State would wish to avail itself of this right would be for each State to decide in the light of the totality of its interests and circumstances. There would therefore be room under the treaty for regional and bilateral agreements with a view to meeting the particular circumstances of each region.\n75.\tAs far as the natural resources on the ocean floor outside national jurisdiction are concerned, my Government believes that only the creation of a strong international authority with broad regulatory powers can answer the challenge which the situation gives rise to. Norway strongly supports the concept of the international sea-bed area as \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\" and would like to see the new international machinery established in a way which would reflect that concept as fully as possible. And this must be done before an uncontrolled race for the resources concerned gets under way. Afterwards it may be too late.\n76.\tIn line with the general consideration that the coastal State should be given extended jurisdiction over the natural resources in the coastal area, the Norwegian Government has expressed understanding of the reasons behind Iceland's decision to extend its fishery limits. Given Iceland's overwhelming dependence for its livelihood on coastal fisheries, we have shown understanding of the fact that Iceland did find it difficult to await the outcome of the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea. Today we welcome the fact that temporary agreements have been or are about to be concluded, through peaceful negotiations between Iceland and certain other countries, among them Norway. We sincerely hope that the necessary conditions will soon be created for the resumption of talks about similar arrangements between Iceland and the United Kingdom in order that a very unfortunate conflict which tends in fact to disturb the general atmosphere and stability in the area may be brought to is end.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff120.\t Mr. President, the Tunisian delegation would like to associate itself with the tribute which has been paid to you, to your career, which is well known in Tunisia, and also to your qualities of heart and of mind; all these are equally well known. That is why your well-deserved election appears to us to honour you at the same time as it honours your country and your part of the world. We are extremely gratified to be able to co-operate with you to ensure that our work proceeds smoothly at this General Assembly.\n121.\tWe have emerged from a state of false peace into a state of genuine war, without any major upheavals, and perhaps with less noise and fuss than would be engendered by a brief meeting between the two super-Powers in connexion with the vague and mysterious question of international detente.\n122.\tThis conclusion is born neither of moroseness nor of the acrimony of which we are generally and unfairly accused. It describes a fact. The historic day that marks the Middle East war has been a matter of daily occurrence. It is only now, here and elsewhere, particularly within the area of world public opinion \u2014 although certain newspapers continue to surround us by silence \u2014 it is only now that people are beginning to grasp the serious nature of the war and what is at stake. It is true that this time it is the war of the humble man who has had enough of being vilified; of the person who has suffered aggression and has had enough of occupation; of the simple refugee who has had enough of suffering despair and desolation.\n123.\tYes, it is the war of the Palestinians, that nameless people, the Syrians and the Egyptians, who have been suffering in the shadows of poverty and enslavement. Refusing injustice and dishonour, they have launched a struggle for deliverance. For most of them it appears in the form of death \u2014 a just death that will contribute to the brotherly and worthy life of their peoples.\n124.\tIn fact, these are stoic fighters who are waging war against war, against those responsible for aggression. They fight, showing to the entire world that man is, despite everything, better than this monstrous occupier \u2014  all the more monstrous because Zionism has perverted it, and the power of money has spoiled it to such an extent that it believes it belongs to the race of lords and masters who are permitted everything, including the arrogance to thwart the United Nations, its Security Council and its permanent members, its General Assembly, its Secretary- General and all its resolutions.\n125.\tThe ideal of these stoic Egyptian and Syrian fighters is something that has not fallen into this morbid mould which motivates their Zionist enemies and which consists of considering war as a perfected razzia and of setting records of atrocity and humiliation, thanks to sophisticated weaponry.\n126.\tTheir ideal is beyond war; it is part and parcel of the concept of coexistence and fraternity \u2014 we repeat: coexistence and fraternity \u2014 between a Jewish community, de-Zionized and reconciled with itself, and that Christian-Arab community and Moslem community, rid of its complexes.\n127.\tThe ideal of these fighters is to make sure that justice triumphs, even above heroes!\n128.\tSuch an ideal means that one may be cast down but never overcome.\n129.\tWhatever the incantations we hear in the Assembly about detente, whatever the calumnies, the slanders and the ridiculous things that are said to deafen us, we will not be prevented from crying out this simple truth, the truth of the Egyptian and Syrian fighters, which is becoming an ever more evident truth as the days go by: that people cannot be occupied for decades against their will, whatever the military supremacy that is available to their occupiers. Today, in the Golan Heights and in the holy places of Sinai, hope is still felt where freedom has once again been restored through these valiant Syrian and Egyptian fighters.\n130.\tWe in Tunisia are not fanatics or partisans of all-out war or peace at any cost. At the present stage of the struggle, no one can say whether this freedom which has gradually started to make its way in Sinai will accelerate progress towards justice and fraternity. No one can say whether this faint glimmer which we can see through the smoke of battle is the dawning of a new day on this earth where God once resided or a twilight that may bury new dead and our hopes once for all.\n131.\tThe outcome of the war is still uncertain. But what is certain is that the Arab peoples will remain in the battle, because they are convinced that truth is on their side. If today our brothers of Egypt and Syria, although less trained and less versed in the techniques of modern war and perhaps under-equipped, are waging war against the forces of war with so much faith and courage, it is precisely because they know they are sustained by this wave of support from international public opinion, the opinion of valiant and right-thinking men, and because they know that, as General de Gaulle said, at the individual and State levels and at the level of any human community, the end of hope is the beginning of death.\n132.\tEverything, even decadence, ends. The Arab peoples of Palestine and elsewhere have passed beyond despair. It is by overcoming their despair that today they have encountered the highest possible form of hope: that which gives confidence to leaders, that which is synonymous with risk \u2014 because hope is also a question of risk.\n133. Sooner or later sympathy, goodwill \u2014 or simply will \u2014 will gradually become polarized around these three principles which President Bourguiba listed in Geneva before the International Labour Conference, namely: the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and to a State, the right of the Arab countries not to be occupied and humiliated, and the right of the Israeli people not to be thrown into the sea.\n134.\tThose three principles will, sooner or later, form the just and lasting foundation for settlement of the conflict that for more than a quarter of a century has been ravaging that area. On that basis and on the basis of the 1947 resolution [resolution 181(H)] \u2014 by which our Organization approved and legalized the birth of Israel \u2014 our President was even prepared to undertake, open-handedly and frankly, a dialogue with Israel. Israel thought that was a ruse and responded by polemics. Once again Israel missed availing itself of a reasonable initiative.\n135.\tNeither the subtleties nor the verbal tics of Mr. Abba Eban, nor the thunderclaps and threats of Mr. Moshe Dayan, nor the cold and cynical calculations of Mrs. Golda Meir can deceive us. Because they are buried in the sarcophagus of their prejudices, because they do not want to change and even prevent themselves from changing, they are lost in a maze of procedure and formalism for fear of entering into the substance of the debate; they condemn themselves; and they discourage their warmest supporters. They have not yet understood that to maintain occupied territories as direct guarantees, to create faits accomplis in some places and to cause an exodus in other places, to organize repression against Palestinians is to take out for themselves and for the entire region an insurance that their future will be an unhappy one. It is to opt for a kind of man and a kind of society bathed in chauvinism; it is to proclaim intolerance and fanaticism and to practise violence and contempt.\n136.\tMr. Abba Eban, let me repeat what I have already said from this very platform. We believe that you are sincere in certain statements that you have made to the Assembly and it is this which gives us pause. Yes, we really begin to wonder whether it is in the nature of Israel, of its regime and of its leaders to be able to make peace. You have referred eloquently to certain international precedents and have concluded that only the Arabs and the Palestinians shirk dialogue for peace. But everybody is speaking. You know that under conditions of war there can only be people who talk further about war. The West and East Germans \u2014 whose admission to membership of our Organization we would like to welcome \u2014 managed to coexist in peace and fraternity only after they had clarified and spelled out the basic principles existing between them and between the great Powers. As far as North and South Korea are concerned, both of which we should be very pleased to see admitted to the United Nations too, if they have not yet arrived at that stage of unity and homogeneity which is so desired, it is solely because everything is not yet clear and agreed \u2014 at least as far as principles and objectives are concerned.\n137.\tLeave all the occupied territories, therefore, including Jerusalem; put forward yourself valid conditions for peace; accept the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations, particularly that of 1947; and you will be surprised at the sense of responsibility and the constructive spirit which will be manifested by the most intransigent Arab leaders, including those among the Palestinians.\n138.\tMeetings, direct negotiations, international precedents, logic, a scale of values, your logic, your scale of values \u2014 these are all nothing but words. It is not because you use these words that we should fear them. It is not because you have failed to bring about peace that we should fail to regenerate that peace. It is not because you' wish to exterminate the Palestinians that we have to exterminate you. Only a tolerant Palestine, where there would be coexistence between the Jews and the Palestinians in ways which remain to be determined, only an open society whose laws would be common to all and whose power would be assumed by its permanent members, Christian, Moslems and Jews \u2014 only this will make it possible for you no longer to be \u2014 in this tortured Middle East which has deserved better of mankind \u2014 the engenderer of hate, of fear and violence, a sort of pot which is ready to boil over. It is a question of time, perhaps, but it is also a question of the blood which is flowing in this tortured Middle East. Above all, it is a question of behaviour and commitment. Let the Israelis behave in a way which will bring about proper coexistence between Jews and Arabs, as has been the case and is the case in the Arab and Moslem countries; let the Zionists put an end to this dual and hateful tendency to suspect all other religions \u2014 even all other philosophies which do not believe in God \u2014 and to consider that the Jews, the citizens of other nations, are their own subjects, who can be mobilized whenever they see fit, in order to serve Israel hand and foot. Let them take care not to add to the bitterness of armed confrontation, the blindness of injured faith and religious passion.\n139.\tLet us not commit the crime of transforming, in the name of the Jewish faith, Jews here and our brothers and those of our colleagues in the General Assembly into perjurers, into mercenaries or traitors to their own country. Israel is not, after all, the homeland of all Jews. Have not the leaders of Tel Aviv committed the arrogance of giving Israeli nationality collectively to an entire African tribe living in Ethiopia? And this must be an aberration from the point of view of international law. Henceforth, with the present Zionist practices and requirements, let us be on our guard; any Jewish community living in Africa, Europe or America might simply wake up one day relabelled as a Zionist homeland. Thus any country which practises tolerance and coexistence between races and religions runs the risk of becoming one day the Palestine of a new Israel.\n140.\tWhen we realize that South Africa, Rhodesia and Portugal in particular are the unconditional allies of Israel, when we are aware that these countries help each other to practise scorn, arrogance and all the most abject forms of segregation, we can then understand the dangers which are lurking, particularly in Africa. In the structure of conquest and domination where the policy of Israel, as well as that of the racists of South Africa, Rhodesia and Portugal, is rooted, any defeat is considered as possibly being fatal. Thus, these protagonists of hate, scorn, colonialism and racism are quite naturally predisposed to violence by their very nature. Hence their desire to defy all reason and to thwart all peaceful efforts. They are predisposed to be more vain than heroic, more obstinate than prudent. They try to surround us in a dialectic of despair. As far as we Tunisians are concerned, the world is a witness of the fact that President Bourguiba, who has taught us the desire for fraternity, love, tolerance and co-operation, has never ceased tirelessly to seek practical ways to bring about peace and understanding. In 1946 \u2014 before the wars and before the atrocities \u2014 warned by the tragic experience of the German people with Hitler, he called upon the forces of good and progress, which were the Allies at the time, to help the Jews of Palestine to become de-Zionized, as the Germans of that time were being helped to become de-Nazified. We are happy to welcome here the great German nation which has been cured of its destructive demons. It now occupies the place which is due to it in the international community. Even if it takes the form of two Germanys, the joint effort of its worthy representatives is remarkable in all respects. Chancellor Brandt, while speaking fervently for peace, as he did here [2128th meeting], also deserved peace, as the prestigious Nobel Prize awarded him has emphasized. There is more than one precedent to be thought about by the Israelis if they are really looking for peace, and also by the friends of Israel. Perhaps there we can find some precious indication of the way which will lead to salvation. The Israelis might aspire to coexist with us, as the Germans are doing in Europe and throughout the world, if they were to take the step of de-Zionizing themselves. But to de- Zionize in Israel is something quite different.\n141.\tIn the Middle East, where the sky touches the earth and has made it fertile with tremendous grace, one day all this hate will be succeeded by love; so much war must be succeeded by peace; so many tears must be followed by smiles; so many crises and sacrifices by a little joy and happiness. How can we help? The Egyptian fighters are dying even now to recover their territories, but also to revive the Suez Canal for international trade and peaceful commerce. It is important that all those in Europe and elsewhere who have suffered from the closure of the Canal because of Israeli aggression should assure Egypt of their sympathy and their support. For security throughout the world, for the development of trade and for the strengthening of the currents of fluidity to which man aspires, we demand that all countries, both great and small, should finally take action to ensure that the Suez Canal is reopened and that no longer will this path of peace be closed. A time will come when the instigators of war, the Israelis and the Zionists in particular, who have caused so much damage not only to the Arab nations but also to humanity, will have to answer for their crimes before men and before . God.\n142.\tUnfortunately, Israel continues to commit these crimes. It is attacking civilians, children, women and diplomats, particularly in Syria. While the Egyptians and the Syrians are sacrificing themselves and are dying, and are confining their combat to the occupied territories; while they regard themselves as occupied people, the Israelis not only do not regard themselves as occupiers but are making civilians targets in the battle.\n143.\tMay I convey our condolences to all civilian victims of these indescribable acts, primarily to the Secretary- General for the United Nations victims and also to the Soviet Union, to its people, to its Government and to its delegation.\n144.\tWe denounce this tendency to practise war along pure Hitlerite lines. We denounce this with particular force because Jews were among the first victims of the Nazi follies.\n145.\tHave the Arabs these days become a sort of Jew themselves? Have the Zionists themselves today become neo-Nazis? It is with horror that I ask that question.\n146.\tHas unreason taken hold of the Israelis to such an extent that they are no longer content with the honour they had of having been victims of the Nazis but are now so ignominious as to justify these Nazi practices by themselves attacking civilians?\n147.\tToday, the non-aligned countries, through their representatives, have been moved by the trials inflicted upon the civilian population and foreigners in Damascus. They held a meeting; they adopted a resolution and they have asked me to read it out, and with your permission, Mr. President, I should like to read it out:\n\\\"The heads of delegations of non-aligned countries, who met at the United Nations on Wednesday, 10 October 1973, considered the recent developments of the situation in the Middle East.\n\\\"They condemn the aggression of Israel against Egypt and Syria and express to both those countries their total support in their just struggle and in their heroic efforts to liberate their occupied territories.\n\\\"Recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the Algiers Summit Conference,  they demand that Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab territories as the prior condition for any solution being found to the crisis in the Middle East.\n\\\"The heads of delegations of the non-aligned countries condemn the blind bombing of the civilian population of Syria by Israel, bombings which have caused the death of hundreds of innocent civilians, men, women and children, including foreign diplomats, United Nations officials and members of their families.\n\\\"They particularly denounce the fact that Israel has carried the war to the civilian population and it condemns these acts of barbarism which gives an already painful conflict an inhumanity which cannot be tolerated by the international community.\n\\\"The heads of the delegations of the non-aligned . countries have decided to remain in close contact with each other and with the representatives of Egypt and Syria in order to define what they may subsequently have to do, in accordance with the policies established by their Heads of States at the Algiers Conference.\\\"\n148.\tIn this Organization we feel ourselves at a crossroads of anguish and anxiety. Every year, as new Members are admitted, our Organization gains in universality what it loses in effectiveness. Israel, Portugal and South Africa are simply burying, as they say themselves, the resolutions of the United Nations in what Israel has called \\\"the cemetery of aborted decisions\\\". Thus, they contribute to gravely harming public opinion regarding the United Nations.\n149.\tWhat can we do about that? That was something which was referred to by the previous speaker and it is a question I ask myself. It is one of the most serious problems which is being faced by our Organization. What can we do with those who refuse, and persistent in their refusal, to abide by United Nations resolutions?\n150.\tIn the midst of these storms which are reverberating throughout the third world, facing these difficulties which are becoming increasingly many and complex as days pass, and despite the super-Powers who do not always give us encouragement and despite the \\\"small\\\" Powers which often harass and defy us, without forgetting the budgetary concerns and difficulties which are endless, we are very grateful to our Secretary-General for the way he is coping and is continuing imperturbably to proceed along the lines of innovation and research. A great deal has been said about our Organization, but it is a miracle that it has not yet stumbled and continues to spread its effect throughout the world by bringing about detente and peace.\n151.\tThe contract which we have with the United Nations and by which we shall always be bound is possibly the sort of tacit contract which children, because of some mysterious far-sightedness, give to something which seems to incarnate their careless seriousness, their calm innocence, their intelligence and the tremendous promise of their future. That is the great favour which the United Nations gives to those people who have \\\"just emerged from childhood\\\" \u2014 as is often said with a certain amount of scorn.\n152.\tThe real greatness of the United Nations is not to give wealth to the world but to maintain hope in the world. The surest star in the firmament of the United Nations in these stormy times is its faithfulness to its vocation.\n153.\tIn Addis Ababa on the tenth anniversary of OAU, at Algiers at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, we have applied ourselves to basing our action on studying a rigorous analysis of the situation in order better to understand men and situations. In doing so it seems to us that we have acted for the best in order to ensure that the cause which we serve, peace, the ideal of the United Nations, will have light, warmth and strength brought to it, which is the only way to bring about events and which alone can modify events sooner or later.\n154.\tThe African voice has been heard here through two prestigious heads of State: President Gowon of Nigeria and President Mobutu of Zaire [2140th meeting]. That of the non-aligned countries, which are the majority of this Assembly, will shortly make itself heard through the voice of President Houari Boumediene whose name alone evokes seriousness, lucidity, refusal to be cast down and commitment to genuine peace, peace for all.\n155.\tTo succeed in making the United Nations equal to the requirements of our times, to ensure that there is this contribution of light, strength and warmth, undoubtedly we need this sense of restraint, this sense of reality, this penchant for the concrete which is so typical of those peoples who have only just left childhood behind: in other words, these virtues which illuminate audacity, which ensure that things are thought out and which make action fruitful.\n156.\tPresident Mobutu expressed here what we Tunisians believe, both authentically and eloquently \u2014 virtues which he proved that he possessed when he showed us what his plans were. He also showed us, in a masterly way, that he was operating as a builder and that he was not one of those who built merely by abstraction. In his frank words there was a great freshness, a spontaneity which is. so characteristic of young peoples and which tomorrow could become the new sap which will rise and which will help us to rid ourselves of outworn slogans and all these complications produced by the interests of the great Powers and calculated strategies of detente.\n157.\tWe represent in the United Nations peoples who in Africa, Asia and in America seem to be overshadowed by suffering and death but who continue to multiply their yearning for hope.\n158.\tWe are very concerned about detente. We are particularly sensitive to the spirit underlying it, the tendencies rather than those old well-used incantations which often sound false. We would have deserved detente if only we could have injected some concern into this indifference towards us which is sometimes characteristic of the superpowers. We would be mad if we were not in favour of detente. But we know what detente means and should mean. We are in favour of genuine detente which would be effective everywhere and for all.\n159.\tDetente would be genuine if the arms race were brought to a halt, if total nuclear and conventional disarmament were brought about, if we no longer had to fulminate against those who test weapons, and if the force of law were restored and when we have the necessary remedies in order to reinforce the United Nations and bring about a more harmonious and balanced economic and financial order.\n160.\tIt is true that detente would be everywhere and for all if it were to benefit, first, the countries of the third world, and if it made it possible for the Arabs to recover their territories, if it made it possible for the Palestinians to recover their homeland, for the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Guinea-Bissau and Cambodia and others finally to know what peace is, by recovering their full rights to live as they want.\n161.\tDetente would be universal and for all if useful and necessary steps were taken in order to banish famine and its scourges, which only ravage the soil of the third world. Human life, man, in our country, seems to have two extra risks \u2014 the risk of death by enslavement and death by famine. It will be understood that our needs pertain to life and death and we are aware that they are both easy and difficult to satisfy. We do not want to offend anybody. We do not want to ask the impossible of anyone, and that is why we welcome any sign of detente, even if it is limited to the great Powers. However, it does have to be real, not something which disguises dark designs.\n162.\tA genuine detente between the USSR and the United States would contribute to liberating for those of us in the poor countries some of the resources which are now completely taken up in the arms competition, and a little tranquillity for mankind as well.\n163.\tMy delegation welcomes the initiative of the Soviet Union in revising the proposal which it had the merit of making as early as the General Assembly session of 1958 and which consists of taking 10 per cent from the military budgets of the five great Powers, permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191].\n164.\tThe representative of the great Soviet Union will. I hope, allow us to say that since 1958 currency has depreciated considerably and that the Soviet offer would be better if it kept pace with present-day prices, and particularly if it had broad support, if only to prevent it from becoming a sort of common coin. May I add that we have not really understood why the Soviet delegation placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that all five permanent members of the Security Council should agree, without a single exception. Does this mean that, if one of them did not agree, the offer would be completely void? We know that there is at least one who does not agree. However, we continue to believe that this is a genuine offer on the part of the Soviet Union, and not just an empty promise.\n165.\tWe are aware that we, the small Powers, the unsatisfied and troubled countries of the third world, are often outside the decisions taken in the major capitals of the world and are often the object of these agreements, the thing at stake. We know the specific weight of each country and the attendant authority and responsibilities, and there is some justice that the super-Powers should feel more responsible and more involved in managing the affairs of the world. In fact, however, the behaviour of various countries does not always obey these laws of good conduct. Excessive use of the right of veto in some circumstances really gives us pause. Can we not say that the contemporary spirit is somewhat disturbed by the survival of the right of veto? It is true that, as Andre Malraux said, for the mind there is no minor nation; the mind recognizes only brother nations.\n166.\tWe should have liked to have had the same sort of active affection embracing America, whose help we shall not forget in difficult moments in our existence; the Soviet Union, whose great contribution we appreciate; the countries of Europe, our allies, our natural partners. And in this regard I will begin by mentioning that country with which we have particularly privileged relations: France, the value of its teachings, its humanism and its desire for independence; the United Kingdom, with its ability to stand up to adversity; Germany, with its impressive degree of development; Italy, with its history; the Scandinavian countries with their devotion to peace; Japan, with its spectacular recovery; Canada which, with its contributions, helped to allay suffering; Australia, with its desire to heed the voice of the small and the weak; and not forgetting the tremendous country of China which is so fascinating, so rich in its wealth of teaching and which has such remarkable intelligence and aptitude, gauging as it can the precise feelings of the third world. We should like to have had equal and active affection for all those nations which, in their own way, have to a certain extent helped the countries of the third world. But is it not really time for these nations to revise the criteria for assistance, co-operation and active solidarity with the poor countries?\n167.\tWe are full of admiration for so much moral and material strength in our Organization. We are full of admiration for all the reserves, the imagination, the talent and the creative power. At the same time, how can I disguise the fact that we are sorry to see so many seeds of division? And what a waste of energy is taking place among these nations.\n168.\tSometimes we feel obliged to make a choice between the notion of exigency and interest represented by these nations, and alignment with one of the concepts of life they represent. The fourth Algerian summit conference said firmly and clearly that we refuse to choose in order not to accentuate these antagonisms, and we modestly, but tirelessly, seek to promote pluralism in our countries \u2014 each in his own way according to our national temperament, originality and national genius \u2014 and we do this to affirm our desire to practise in our way the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n169.\tI should like to conclude by asking a question which is particularly important to the hearts not only of Tunisians, but of others as well. Never has it been so obvious that the history of Jerusalem is linked with the history of our times. There can be no genuine peaceful coexistence in the world, no valid detente in the world, if fraternity and concord do not become necessities in this city of light, the only city where God chose to reside on earth, the only city which was chosen by providence so that three times in the history of mankind messages should resound in the ears of men through Jews, Christians and Moslems.\n170.\tThere are places where, more than anywhere else, the Divine spirit can help to bring about tolerance and understanding among peoples. There are cities which teach faith and help to lift spirits which are tired and devoid of hope. They are predestined for dialogue between man and God, between man and man. Jerusalem is such a place; it is one of those cities and, in the present situation, when Israel obstinately blasphemes Jerusalem, the past and the future of Jerusalem turn their eyes towards us. We say: save Jerusalem!\n171.\tYou, the representatives of the great nations with whom we wish to work together to try to overcome suffering, to restore dignity, to spread hope, if you often dislike getting involved in our small conflicts, and if you sometimes give us strength to settle our quarrels, if sometimes you quarrel to defend your own interests, if your words of detente and peace are not always in accordance with your actions, at least let Jerusalem give you an opportunity to co-ordinate your actions with us so that we can join our efforts to defend Jerusalem, to save the spirit of Jerusalem, to preserve what is dearest to us, what is most sacred to us, to help God and men, and to warn off those who disfigure Jerusalem and who commit a crime against man and God.\n172.\tLet us try together to produce a motion before this General Assembly concerning Jerusalem; let us all meet together to serve Jerusalem; perhaps only in this way can we save ourselves, can we save our countries, can we save the ideals of the United Nations, peaceful coexistence and the spirit of civilization of which we are all such staunch protagonists."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tIn unanimously electing the President of the twenty-eighth session, the General Assembly has not only honoured a distinguished son of Latin America but also recognized his great skill and wisdom as a seasoned diplomat. My country has always had admiration for the friendly peoples of Latin America, and I wish to assure the President of our fullest co-operation in the discharge of his responsibilities. We are confident that under his wise leadership, we will be able to accomplish the tasks we have set ourselves.\n2.\tI should also like to take this opportunity of associating my delegation with those who have expressed their appreciation for the patience, devotion and the great ability with which the outgoing President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland, guided our deliberations during the last session.\n3.\tWe are happy to welcome in our midst today the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Bhutan believes in the universality of the United Nations and we are convinced that the admission to the United Nations of these three States will mark an important step towards making our Organization not only more representative but more effective. The Federal Republic of' Germany and the German Democratic\nRepublic, with their great economic strength and impressive record of post-war achievement, are bound to play an important role in the United Nations. The newly independent nation of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas will undoubtedly bring to bear its healing touch on the problems facing the world body.\n4.\tWe look forward very much to co-operating with the delegations of these States both within and outside the United Nations. However, let me hasten to add that the process of universality of the United Nations will only be complete when all countries are represented in this great Organization. We hope, therefore, that the General Assembly will be able to act in a similar manner when dealing with the admission of other States to the United Nations.\n5.\tWe in Bhutan are just recovering from the irreparable loss we suffered last year in the demise of our great King, His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. We were indeed fortunate in having a person of his wisdom and vision to guide the destiny of our country at a momentous juncture in our history. Our-present King, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has reiterated his firm resolve to continue the great task started by his late father to build a modern Bhutan in which the people will enjoy social justice and economic prosperity. As we end the official period of national mourning for our late King, we realize, with even greater urgency than before, the unfulfilled tasks to which we have to address ourselves. We are, however, determined to forge ahead and complete the task of building our nation. In the external sphere we are convinced that a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence based on friendship with all countries is the only practical policy for Bhutan.\n6.\tWe, therefore, have become a member of the non- aligned group during the recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers. This, however, does not mean that Bhutan does not wish to play its rightful role in the comity of nations. Our policy of non-alignment is not a negative concept; it is in fact a policy based on the foundations of. independence of thought and action. We believe this policy is consistent with the United Nations objectives of reducing tensions and building a world in which relations between countries are based on the principle of mutual respect, sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.\n7.\tLast year, in our statement before this Assembly [2053rd meeting], we had the occasion to welcome the signs of detente which had begun to emerge on the international scene. As we meet this year, we have reason to be satisfied with the hopeful change in international relationships between nations and particularly between the major Powers of the world. In this context we welcome the development of normal relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. The normalization of relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China will, in our view, undoubtedly contribute to stability in East Asia. The visit of Mr. Brezhnev to the United States this summer is yet another milestone along the road of reducing international tension and promoting a better understanding between the most powerful nations of the world. We welcome as a constructive development the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the stabilizing agreements among Central European States. These are undoubtedly significant developments which have brought Europe out of the dark days of the cold war and also contributed substantially to promoting peace and harmony in Europe and throughout the world.\n8.\tUnfortunately, the improved climate so noticeably visible in Europe has not had a comparable effect in Asia and several other parts of the world. Although the conclusion of the peace agreements in Viet-Nam and Laos is a major step, Indo-China is not yet completely free from war and its disastrous consequences. The aftermath of war is as terrible as the war itself, as it involves the enormous task of reconstruction and the rehabilitation of the people in Indo-China which we hope will gain the co-operation of all the peace-loving nations. We therefore hope that the peace so assiduously achieved in Laos and Viet-Nam will be an enduring one and that it will be extended to Cambodia, too, by peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned.\n9.\tMy delegation welcomed the promising signs of dialogue and understanding between the representatives of North and South Korea last year and we expressed the hope that that dialogue would lead to an understanding between the two Koreas for the eventual reunification of that country. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that both North and South Korea will continue their efforts to arrive at an amicable understanding so that the people of that peninsula will be able to devote their energies to the more pressing tasks before them. Bhutan fully supports the aspirations of the Korean people for reunification of their desire to live in peace and harmony, and hopes that the dialogue and conciliation between North and South Korea will be further promoted.\n10.\tNearer home to us in Bhutan is the situation on the Indian subcontinent. The agreement on resolving the humanitarian problems flowing from the 1971 conflict, signed recently, clears the way for giving shape to the hopes of peace upheld in the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972. We in Bhutan welcome that agreement between India and Pakistan with the concurrence of Bangladesh as a vital step for bringing about the much desired durable peace on the subcontinent. The parties concerned have indeed shown a great sense of urgency, accommodation and understanding for the solution of the unfortunate humanitarian problems.\n11.\tIn that spirit we hope that the reality of Bangladesh will also be recognized. It is a reality recognized by over 100 Members of the United Nations. If we sincerely subscribe to the principle of universality, then the doors of the United Nations cannot be kept closed to the 75 million people of Bangladesh. We hope that before long it will be possible for the representatives of Bangladesh to take their rightful place in this Assembly of nations as full members.\n12.\tAt a time when we welcome international detente and look with great expectation for a durable world peace it is unfortunate that armed conflict and hostilities have broken out once again in the Middle East. The underlying cause of that tragic event is, we believe, the continued occupation of Arab territories by Israel and the failure to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which formed the basis for a just settlement. It is, however, gratifying to note that the Security Council is mindful of its responsibility and its commitments towards international peace and security in general and the Middle East situation in particular. We sincerely hope that the Security Council will take all possible steps and effective measures for the restoration of peace in the region. My delegation also feels that it is necessary to recognize the legitimate rights of all the States in the region to their existence within recognized boundaries, in the interests of a just and durable peace.\n13.\tOne other area which continues to cause concern to my Government and to pose a threat to world peace and security is southern Africa. The people of Namibia have been denied the basic right to live in freedom and dignity. The policies of apartheid and racialism continue to be followed unremittingly in South Africa, in violation of all canons of civilized behaviour. In Southern Rhodesia the minority regime continues to rule the majority population by force of arms. It is regrettable that the illegal racist regime of Southern Rhodesia should survive, with the support of certain vested interests. We believe that all peace-loving countries which uphold the cause of justice, freedom and human dignity based on equality should accept and intensify sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. The policy of repression being followed by the Portuguese Government in its colonies in Africa continues to pose a serious threat to peace and security. Bhutan supports the struggle for independence being carried on by the peoples of all colonial territories. We believe that the solution of those problems requires a determined international effort, and we for our part are ready to join with others in any practical action that the United Nations may pursue in that regard.\n14.\tIn the field of disarmament Bhutan welcomes the series of agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union, including preliminary arms limitation measures and the historic Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, signed at Washington on 22 June. We are convinced that those agreements will contribute greatly to peace and security in the world and provide a further impetus for progress in the direction of complete nuclear disarmament. We are hopeful that as a result of those agreements we shall be able to achieve the ultimate goal of the total destruction of all nuclear and thermonuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In that connexion we reiterate our support for the convening of a world disarmament conference and express the hope that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up last year [resolution 2930 (X VII)] will be able to make sufficient progress so that such a conference may be convened at an early date.\n15.\tBhutan has always supported the creation of zones or areas of peace, and last year we had occasion to express our support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2382 (XXVI)]. We hope that it will be possible for the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean [resolution 2992 (XXVII)] to complete its preliminary work so that the much desired consultations with the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean may commence at an early date. It is important for the peace and security of the countries of the Indian Ocean area that the Indian Ocean be kept free from great-Power military rivalries and interventions. In this connexion it is also important that all foreign bases should be removed from the area. We for our part are willing to co-operate with the countries of the region to give practical shape to the proposal.\n16.\tBhutan is looking forward to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with great interest and expectation. It is the hope of my delegation that as a result of the preparatory work done by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction the Conference will be able to take a decision on some of the outstanding issues pertaining to the law of the sea. As a land-locked country, Bhutan has a vital stake in the resources of the sea. We believe that this common heritage of mankind must be so exploited as to give each one of us an equitable share. The potentialities of the sea, as yet unassessed, may prove to be of immense value to all countries, and more particularly to the developing countries.\n17.\tWhen the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade was adopted in 1970, there were great expectations that the Strategy would be fully implemented for the benefit of the developing countries. We are, therefore, disappointed that the commitments assumed by the international community are not being implemented fully. It is important to review the progress made in the implementation of the strategy so that the interests of the developing and, particularly the least developed countries, can be given consideration.\n18.\tI cannot end my statement without paying a tribute to the work being done by our distinguished Secretary- General. During the short period that he has been in office, he has demonstrated beyond doubt his rare ability, capacity for hard work and devotion to duty. We wish him well and express the hope that he will be able to accomplish the great task before him. We on our part pledge our co-operation to him."

        "file_text": "\ufeff28.\tMr. President, it gives me the greatest pleasure to offer you, on my behalf and in the name of the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic, our warm congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The fact that you were chosen for this high office is a genuine expression of the appreciation and esteem in which the international community holds your country and people.\n29.\tI am happy to welcome the new Members, the Democratic Republic of Germany, the German Federal Republic and the Bahamas. With their entry into the United Nations the principle of universality essential to the world Organization, which since the inception of the United Nations we have actively supported and have constantly striven to achieve, has been greatly enhanced. In this connexion, we wish to formulate the hope that the affiliation of the German Federal Republic with the Organization will usher in a greater understanding on its part of the problems of the third world, and particularly those of the Middle East.\n30.\tThe convening of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly comes on the heels of an event which stirred world-wide interest: the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, the greatest summit meeting human society has witnessed in the last decade.\n31.\tThe declarations and resolutions of that Conference [see A/9330] incarnated the drive of the non-aligned nations towards self-fulfilment and the assertion of their identity, and to a reaffirmation of the principles of non-alignment, proven to be universal principles aiming at achieving justice, equality, coexistence and peace among nations.\n32.\tThe basic significance of that Conference lay in the fact that it embodied the determination of over half the inhabitants of the world to be freed from unequal relations, to establish instead among nations a democratic relationship both in politics and economics, to eradicate colonialism in all its forms and to eliminate hegemony, foreign occupation, backwardness and deprivation.\n33.\tIf the non-alignment movement has been described in the past as an expression of world conscience, the Fourth Conference revealed that that movement is proceeding with a firm pace towards achieving freedom in the world. That Conference, with the clarity of vision which characterized its work, was able to adjust to the international changes, affirming and developing their positive aspects without swerving from the principles on which the non-alignment movement rests.\n34.\tThe Algiers Conference was a gathering that took a global view, at which it was pledged anew to realize the basic aims of the non-alignment movement \u2014 those universal goals conceiving world peace as a unit indivisible, centred on eliminating tension everywhere, increasing international co-operation, developing the innate capacities of\ndeveloping countries, ending privation, backwardness, and unequal relations between peoples.\n35.\tWe hope the General Assembly of the United Nations will support the principal demands made in the declarations and resolutions of the Algiers Conference, because they are all fully compatible with the United Nations Charter.\n36.\tThe relationship between the Conference of non- aligned countries and the United Nations arises not only from the fact that the non-aligned nations form half the membership of the international Organization, but also from the determination of the non-aligned countries to strengthen the role of the United Nations and within its framework to take upon themselves the work of realizing its goals and the objectives of the Charter in such way as to benefit all mankind.\n37.\tIn our review of the international situation, special emphasis should, of course, be given to the new developments that have had an important impact on international relations. Aiming at eliminating the dangers of confrontation between the two great Powers and abating the tension in Europe, those developments nevertheless will be of limited effect and uncertain results so long as their benefits do not extend to all parts of the world, eradicating the oppressive conditions still prevalent in the third world, such as colonialism, exploitation, racism, occupation and aggression at the hands of imperialism and foreign control.\n38.\tInternational concord will remain an elaborate fiction if it means the monopoly of the big decisions ruling our destiny in the hands of a few and the consolidation of unjust conditions to which the peoples of the developing world are subjected, or if it is to be achieved at the expense of peoples and their rights to freedom, progress and self- determination. In those circumstances detente would be tantamount to extinguishing the focuses of dispute in a certain region of the world while feeding the elements of conflict in some other areas.\n39.\tIn this connexion it is disappointing to see the United States of America bent on exploiting the international climate of relaxation in order to consolidate its interests at the expense of the interests of other peoples and sustaining aggression in all areas of the third world, especially in the Middle East.\n40.\tThe state of international security today is far from permitting the majority of nations to achieve their aspirations for freedom, independence, peace, and progress. Imperialist aggression continues in important areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n41.\tFaithful in its support of the principles of the freedom of peoples and their right to self-determination without foreign interference, and their right to territorial integrity, regional unity and permanent sovereignty over natural resources: faithful in its struggle against colonialism, imperialist control and exploitation, against discrimination on the basis of colour, race or creed; faithful to the Charter of the United Nations, the Syrian Arab Republic demands a cessation of imperialist interference and aggression against the people of Cambodia and considers that the five points of the Government of National Union are a practical and just basis for the solution of the Cambodian problem.\n42.\tWe further demand the solution of the problem of Korea through the creation of appropriate conditions to hasten the union of Korea as an independent, peaceful nation. .We demand the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the southern Korean territories and the dissolution of\nI the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We believe that this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations should work towards uniting, not consecrating, the division of Korea.\n43.\tWe welcome the Agreement on the restoration of peace in Viet-Nam.' We believe that the safeguarding of peace in this area is absolutely necessary for the carrying out in good faith of all the clauses of this Agreement. We therefore deplore the repeated violations of the provisions of the Agreement on the part of the imperialists and their agents, and we hope that the heroic Viet-Namese will  achieve complete success in their struggle to restore the social and economic structure of their country.\n44.\tWe emphatically support the struggle of the national liberation movements in Africa, America and Asia. We strongly condemn the role of the racist minority in Rhodesia and in South Africa and the imperialist manoeuvres calculated to overthrow national governments in these countries.\n45.\tWe warmly welcome the struggle of movements for national liberation bearing arms in the four quarters of Africa against the forces of racial discrimination and colonialist exploitation, and we offer them our support and\nencouragement. We wish them the early attainment of their aims.\n46.\tIn this connexion let me welcome the rise of that valiant country Guinea-Bissau to the status of independence through the struggle of its sons assisted by the great African continent and justice-loving peoples. It is high time that the Portuguese regime reviewed its reactionary policy and conceded the right of Mozambique and Angola to self-determination and independence. The admission of Guinea-Bissau \u2014 soon, we hope \u2014 to the ranks of the Organization's membership will be a landmark in the universal struggle for freedom and justice.\n47.\tWorld opinion endorses the fact that the Middle East problem now poses the greatest thereat to international peace and security. It is the one problem that bears within itself the seeds of a world war.\n48.\tThe origins of the question, its tragedies and dimensions are known to everyone. Its ugly traces leap to the eye in the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine in 1948, which has uprooted its inhabitants and deprived them of all their national and human rights. These ugly traces were further manifested in the expanded Israeli occupation of June 1967, which was an extension of settler colonialism and an imperialist conspiracy against the Arab nation.\n49.\tMore than six years have passed since the Israeli occupation of territories of three Arab countries that are Members of the United Nations, and the imperialist forces are still striving hard to consolidate this occupation by the consecration of this aggressive fait accompli. The unlimited support offered by the United States of America to the Israeli aggressor has enabled Israel to defy the whole world and to deride the United Nations, its resolutions and its Charter.\n50.\tBut peace-loving nations have come to perceive the dangers inherent in the continuance of this menacing situation, with the result that American imperialism and its Zionist creature are now lined up on one side facing all other nations on the other.\n51.\tThe isolation of Israel and American imperialism in the United Nations and elsewhere in the international sphere has become one of the distinctive features of the present era in international relations. It reflects the attitude of rejection which the international community takes against aggression and the protectors of aggression.\n52.\tWe place again before this international Organization the case of Israeli aggression because we are convinced that the United Nations, despite its shortcomings, is capable of playing a useful role in opposing imperialism, and in eliminating the consequences of aggression and protecting world peace.\n53.\tIn a world of such intertwined interests, a world of common destiny, no responsible Government can be indifferent when its land and the peace of its people are threatened with destruction.\n54.\tThe Middle East crisis does not threaten international peace and security alone; it is a menace also to the economic security of nations. In addition to this area being the most important route of communications by land, sea and air between three continents, it has the greatest known reserves of petroleum in the world \u2014 oil constituting the main prop of life with respect to any advance in civilization during our era.\n55.\tSigns and statistics indicate that the wheel of life in this world, and particularly in the advanced industrial nations, will for a long time and increasingly be dependent on. sources of energy in the Middle East. Accordingly, a view of the Middle East crisis from this perspective should prompt nations to intensify their efforts to eliminate the focuses of explosion in the region and to put an end to the reckless playing by Zion with the destinies of its peoples. Men everywhere have commenced to understand that their national wealth is one of the elements of their inherent strength and must play a role in protecting their independence and the integrity of their lands.\n56.\tConsequently, the situation in the Middle East calls for prompt, effective treatment by the United Nations and its Members. It requires that every effort be put forth to keep the Israeli aggressor from reaping the fruits of aggression. Condoning aggression by allowing the fait accompli to prosper threatens a continual erosion of the prestige of the United Nations and encourages aggression and expansion in every place upon the earth.\n57.\tIt has been demonstrated in recent years that Israel, prospering through illegality, and adopting violence, terror, war and occupation to serve the objectives of its settler colonialism, has no regard whatsoever for the resolutions of the United Nations, no respect for any international or human or moral law. Israel's leaders have gone so far as to consider the resolutions taken by the United Nations as a sign of the bankruptcy of the Organization, morally, politically and legally.\n58.\tThis Israeli arrogance and contempt for international law and custom has led Israel to embark on hideous practices that arouse the aversion and condemnation of the entire world. On 8 January 1973 Israeli planes undertook a brutal assault upon civilian targets in the Syrian Arab Republic, resulting in the slaughter of hundreds of civilians, old people, women and children. On 21 February 1973 Israeli forces raided the refugee camps in A1 Baddawi and A1 Barid in north Lebanon, killing a great number of women, old men and children. On 22 February this year Israeli armoured planes shot down a Libyan civil aircraft that had lost its way over Sinai. This resulted in the death of 108 innocent passengers. During the night of 9-10 April 1973 Israeli commando forces raided the city of Beirut. They murdered three Palestinian leaders in their sleeping quarters and slew a number of Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians. It was a real Mafia operation, yet it was perpetrated not by outlaw gangs but by the authorities of a Member State of the United Nations.\n59.\tWithin this period Israel committed a series of deliberate murders of Arab individuals in Paris and Rome on the pretext that they supported the Palestinian cause or that they were suspected of supporting this cause. I think we all remember the murder of the Moroccan citizen Bouchiki in Oslo by Israeli intelligence staff and the ensuing expulsion of one of the members of the Israeli mission in Norway.\n60.\tOn 5 August 1973 Israeli armoured planes abducted an Iraqi civil aircraft flying in Beirut skies to Lydda airport, endangering the lives of 76 passengers and gravely violating Lebanese sovereignty and the safety of international civil aviation. In its resolution 337 (1973) the Security Council condemned this aggression, as did the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nc\n61.\tOn 13 September 1973,64 Israeli war planes of American manufacture undertook the most serious operation of violation of Syrian air space in a: attempt to strike at civilian targets. They were only prevented from achieving their objective by the opposition of our fighting planes. It is highly ironical that the leaders of Israel claim their planes were on routine patrol when our planes attacked them. Israeli arrogance goes as far as considering that Israeli fighter planes flying at a depth of a hundred kilometres within Syrian skies to be performing merely a routine flight.\n62.\tIsraeli authorities have elevated terror to the level of the State's official policy in pursuance of the principle that the end justifies the means, with no regard to international law and without respect for the sovereignty of other nations. It is odd that such conduct by Israel, whereby it arrogates to itself the right to infringe the sovereignty of nations, has not\n^aroused the foreign States that have suffered from it to take effectual counter-measures. Consequently, we find Golda Meir and Dayan announcing without trepidation that Israel will continue on its course, whatever the results.\n63.\tWe must ask what the United Nations should do in the face of this situation, which constitutes a grave challenge to the international Organization and to the international and human community as a whole.\n64.\tThe United States has impaired the competence of the Security Council by abusing the right of veto, which it has exercised to encourage Israeli aggression and the consolidation of the Israeli occupation of Arab lands, as reinforcement to American imperialist interests in the Middle East. It was natural that such conduct on the part of the United States should lead to the phenomenon of shifting the centre of gravity of United Nations activities and effectiveness from the Security Council to the General Assembly.\n65.\tThe General Assembly, therefore, must bear its responsibilities under the Charter, it must make specific practical recommendations in the face of a situation which threatens international peace and security. The situation in the Middle East, menacing the peace and security of every nation, requires from the General Assembly that it adopt such resolutions as will exert real restraining pressure on Israel, in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Organization's Charter.\n66.\tThe passage of six years since the Israeli aggression and occupation of the territories of three Arab nations is a clear indication that the leaders of Israel are not influenced a hair's breadth by the counsels and recommendations thus far embodied in the General Assembly resolutions, and that there is no alternative but to give such resolutions a new content.\n67.\tThe Organization of African Unity \\OAU\\ comprehended this fact thoroughly and acted accordingly when in May 1973 it adopted a resolution stating that the attitude of Israel might lead OAU member States to take, at the African level, individually or collectively, political and economic measures against it, in conformity with the principles contained in the OAU and United Nations Charters. Further, the Fourth Conference of non-aligned nations held in Algiers in September 1973 called upon member States to take steps to boycott Israel diplomatically, economically, militarily and culturally, as well as in the field of sea and air transport.\n68.\tI wish in this connexion to hail the dynamic, progressive step proclaimed at the 2140th meeting by the President of the Republic of Zaire, General Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, before the Assembly and the world. This is the most genuine expression of deep respect for the principles of the Charter of our Organization. It is an affirmation of the commitment of our peoples to support the struggle for freedom, justice and self-determination, and to act together in solidarity and determination against injustice.\n69.\tWe welcome the spirit of courage and justice shown by all the States which, perceiving the aggressive expansionist nature of Israel, have severed relations with it. We call upon the General Assembly to adopt a resolution with such restraining provisions as will induce Israel to end its aggression, in accord with the provisions of the Charter. We remind the General Assembly, in this context, that Israel is the unique Member which has been received conditionally into the .United Nations. The General Assembly's resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949 further recalls the two resolutions concerning Palestine and- repatriation of the Palestinian refugees [resolutions 181 (II) and 194 (III)]. Israel has continued to violate those resolutions from the day of its entry into the Organization up to this very day.\n70.\tWith this stand, Israel has put itself outside the pale of United Nations membership from a legal aspect, and there is no doubt that its repeated violations of the Organization's Charter have made it the more justifiable that Israel should have its membership stripped from it. We ask ourselves how the Organization can protect its existence from the fate encountered by the. League of Nations if it does not cast out from its ranks any Member that is insubordinate to its constitution; that tramples on its prestige, and announces, with the tongue of responsible authority, that morally, politically and legally it is a bankrupt Organization.\n71.\tWe call upon the General Assembly, in defence of the international Organization's prestige and its very existence and out of respect for the principles of right and justice, to approve a resolution divesting Israel of membership and boycotting it diplomatically, economically, militarily, culturally, and in sea, air and land communications; demanding the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967, and that all measures taken by Israel in those territories to alter their demographic and geographic features be considered void, with non-recognition of the consequences of those measures; further, that it recognize the right of the Palestinian Arab people to the restoration of all its national rights in its homeland.\n72.\tThe authorities of Tel Aviv try to .ad world public opinion by promoting the idea of negotiations and secure boundaries. The world, however, saw the spuriousness of the Israeli position when Israel announced that it would not accept withdrawal from the Golan Heights or the Gaza Strip or Old Jerusalem or Sharm el Sheikh or the areas of Sinai, behind a line drawn from Sharm el Sheikh to Rafah; that the West Bank, though to be restored in a large part to the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Jordan according to the Israeli plan, should remain open to the citizens of Israel, who should enjoy the right to own land and work there, and that Israel would retain a number of army sites along the length of the Jordan river. Israel sees all these as sine qua non premises on the basis of which any negotiations must start, though it does not consider them prior conditions. The very fact of continuous Israeli occupation during a period of over six years, in itself, constitutes a condition which hangs heavily over us, and in the shade of which equal negotiations between, the occupier and the victim of occupation cannot take place. Any negotiations proceeding in such circumstances can lead only to submission and acceptance of the occupier's terms. This is what Israel and the forces behind her actually desire and are working toward.\n73.\tAs for the idea of \\\"secure boundaries\\\", as Israel calls them, this is a mere ruse. Israel is contemptuous of the intelligence of us all when it justifies its expansionist greed by terming it an effort to obtain secure boundaries. In our day is there in truth such a thing as secure geographic boundaries? Technological advance and the new developments in weapons \u2014 of which Israel possesses the most advanced types \u2014 have erased boundaries, and there remain no geographical barriers on land or water of any significant effect in the face of these weapons. There is not one nation in the world, therefore, that can claim for itself secure geographical boundaries.\n74.\tTrue security is that which is built upon justice, on remedying any sense of injustice entertained by neighbouring countries, on respect for law and adherence to the principles of the Charter. This kind of security is naturally inconsistent with the expansionist goals of Israel. The \\\"secure boundaries\\\" which Israel is trying to promote for itself are expanded, movable boundaries which it carves out by altering the demographic, economic and geographic features of occupied territories and by bringing in millions of settlers from all quarters of the globe for conversion of the occupied territories into a Jewish land and preparatory to occupation of new territory at the expense of the Arabs.\n75.\tFollowing a debate held in the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency three days before the creation of Israel was announced, Ben-Gurion said:\n\\\"Take, for instance, the American Declaration of Independence. They did not mention in it specific boundaries, and we are not obliged to mention boundaries for the area of Israel.\\\"\nThat shows the intentions of Israel; those are its aims.\n76.\tThe position of the Syrian Arab Republic with respect to the Palestine problem and the imperialist Zionist aggression against our territories is a firm stand upon principle, consistent with the Charter of this Organization and with all international law and the rules of justice and right. There are two basic conditions for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: firstly, recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to their lands and homeland and their full right to self-determination; and, secondly, immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories.\n77.\tOur determination to struggle for the liberation of all occupied Arab territories and the restoration of all the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people has never been stronger than it is today. We are certain that liberation of Arab earth from the Zionist imperialist aggression is a part of the universal struggle to create a world built on equality, justice and freedom, and that the realization of our goal of liberation enhances the aims of the United Nations and its lofty objectives."

        "file_text": "\ufeff276.\t We, the representatives of the international community of nations, meet again in this hall under the terms of the Charter. We have come from every country in the world in the name of all races, all peoples, who speak the most diverse languages and profess the most different faiths, but we do so prompted by a common desire for understanding for the sake of peace and justice on earth. Thus, the United Nations possesses the necessary condition of universality and is an expression of the natural and healthy principle of unity in diversity.\n277.\tI wish before this distinguished gathering to convey a message of friendship from the people and Government of Bolivia to all the nations represented\nhere: our solidarity with their efforts and sacrifices to forge the destiny of man; our satisfaction at their achievements in the economic, political and social fields; and our sincere desire for a greater rapprochement so that we may get to know each other better and help each other more in effectively supporting so many shared ideals.\n278.\tAs a Latin American, and in particular as a citizen of the favourite child of Bolivar, which with Ecuador maintains a lengthy and beautiful tradition of sharing the same glorious and historic sufferings, I am particularly gratified to see raised to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly an enlightened Ecuadorian statesman and diplomat, Mr. Leopoldo Benites. His wise election is a continuation of the presence of Latin America in the United Nations which began with the Foreign Minister of Brazil, Mr. Oswaldo Aranha, followed wisely by Mr. Luis Padilla Nervo of Mexico, Mr. Jose Maza of Chile, Mr. Victor Andres Belaunde of Peru, Mr. Carlos Sosa Rodriguez of Venezuela and Mr. Emilio Arenales Catalan of Guatemala. We are convinced that the difficult task that the world has entrusted to you, Mr. President, = will be crowned by success.\n279.\tMay I also express my cordial congratulations to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for his wise and able conduct of the past session. In truth, his election was a wise decision, for in the course of our deliberations he guided us with great skill and talent.\n\n280.\tI am also particularly gratified to express my sincere appreciation of the valuable and fruitful work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose strong personality enhances the prestige of our Organization and confers the seal of seriousness and responsibility on his very difficult and special tasks.\n281.\tMy delegation is sincerely pleased at the admission to our Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the case of the latter, my Government has recently established diplomatic and trade relations.\n282.\tThe presence of both Germanys, a single nation divided into two States, is a living and consistent expression of a pragmatic policy with a great capacity to adapt to contemporary realities and an important contribution to the ideals of peace nurtured by mankind.\n283.\tI am convinced that both Germanys, representing a people who have known as much as any other the hardships of war, will make a valuable contribution to our work, a contribution that brings with it an age-old flow of wisdom, discipline and creative sense.\n284.\tSimilarly, I extend the most fraternal welcome to the State of the Bahamas which not long ago proclaimed its independence and is a new member of the Caribbean group of nations within the American system. This young nation so full of vitality and hope will, I am convinced, inject new\nstrength into the visionary action of Latin America in our Organization.\n285.\tMy country is living the drama inherent in all countries suffering from limitations in the exploitation of their natural resources. Rather than a problem of dependence, it is a matter of means and of the use of adequate technology. That is why we seek in international co-operation the way to fill these gaps.\n286.\tLike other nations both in our own geographic area and in other parts of the world, we struggle against the chronic evils of fiscal deficit and monetary instability. The constant deterioration of the terms of trade has a direct bearing on this economic phenomenon.\n287.\tThe situation to which we have referred leads to a progressive increase in the cost of living and its inevitable counterpart, popular discontent and systematized subversion. But it is worth while stressing that, as we have said, this is not due to bad or ineffective administration.\n288.\tOurs is the fate of the poverty and backwardness that characterizes so many countries side by side with strong, powerful and wealthy nations. The solution, then, is not so much in ourselves as in the highly industrialized rich countries, which are called upon to show with deeds the solidarity they claim and the global approach they advocate.\n289.\tInternational social justice is not to be based on the indifference of prosperous States in the face of the afflicting situation of needy nations, nor can it stem from an international division of labour which condemns the latter to produce in favour of the former. In human societies it is no longer admitted that man should work for the exclusive benefit of a fortunate few.\n290.\tJust as we seek to consolidate world peace, we must guarantee social peace among our peoples. The former must be built on mutual respect, the balance of power and the observance of the institutions and the principles that govern them; the latter can be based only on a communal society in which the concept of the dignity of the human person prevails and which is spared the misery, the poverty and the acute social ills of our time.\n291.\tSo long as we do not achieve a structuring of the world society in which resources and the resulting benefits of their application are for the benefit of all, we shall need international financial assistance and a rationalized transfer of technology. This is what my country needs to achieve a relative well-being for its people and to create with the other countries on the continent and in the world a better future. Whatever happens in the private context of nations also happens in the international sphere.\n292.\tIf financial assistance to carry out development works is curtailed or\\\" denied, Governments may feel tempted to resort to illegal sources of foreign currency in\nthe black market \u2014 sources that hurt the image of the dignity of States because of the particular profit they produce and the humiliation they impose on those who engage in such practices.\n293.\tAfter the Revolution of August 1971 it is true that Bolivia received substantial support from the Government of the United States of America to overcome the crisis and establish a process of growing democratization, which culminated in the convening of elections for next year. We must sensibly finance our five-year development plan, which is to give our country a great new start in life.\n294.\tSo much is said of the popular explosion on earth and of the shortage of food-stuffs that one wonders why the necessary assistance is not provided so that these may be produced in abundant quantities in countries like Bolivia. Irrigation schemes such as that of Abapo-Izozog have been conceived to irrigate initially 300,000 hectares, with prospects of arriving at the ambitious figure of 2 million. The El Bala dam, on the Beni river basin, in the gorges of the eastern Andean mountains in the Department of La Paz, was declared at the last Conference of Foreign Ministers in Lima as being of interest for all the countries in the Andean basin. Other minor projects, like the Oquitas project, also await the magic wand of international contributions and financing from regional and world credit institutions.\n295.\tOne problem that disturbs the Bolivian people because it affects its sovereignty and hampers its free progress is that of its status as a land-locked country. As regards this important question, we are not making complaints. We place ourselves in the current of modern trends which seek, in the last analysis, to establish a world community of nations. To embark upon this road, which may appear Utopian to some, is in fact to solve many of the peremptory needs which exist in the world, such as that of Bolivia.\n296.\tWe have always maintained that Chile and my country complement each other. The nation of O'Higgins appears to me to be more imprisoned between the sea and the Andes than my own country, which has direct contact through five open frontiers with five Republics. An outlet to the Pacific would firmly establish friendship between Chile and Bolivia and dispel so much mistrust which darkens the future of the southern tip of America.\n297.\tInspired by the most laudable American sentiments, we have proposed a dialogue so that through direct talks we may devise a solution which is in keeping with our great problem and which will enable Chile, by way of reciprocity, to obtain benefits in keeping with its interests and which would guarantee the welfare of its people, the prosperity of backward regions and the security of northern Chile. We nourish the hope that now that its present Government is devoted to tasks of moral and material reconstruction, soon the necessary favourable conditions to open negotiations will exist so that these two countries may arrive at an important agreement governing their future.\n298.\tIn the regional context, Latin America continues its inevitable course towards unity. There is a general awareness of this. It began in the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama convened by Bolivar in 1826. Before that, both extremes of South America had met, with the same desire for universality, in the famous interview of Guayaquil, which brought together Bolivar, the Liberator and San Martin, the Saint of the Sword.\n299.\tThat unionist trend gained renewed topicality and importance with the Continental Treaty of 1854 and the Union and Defensive Alliance of 1865, concluded in Lima. With the subsequent constitution of the Pan-American Union and the present Organization of American States, Latin America succeeded in creating a Central American Common Market and the subregional organizations of the River Plate basin, the Andean Pact and the Amazon countries.\n300.\tThe Latin American Free Trade Association [LAFTA], that is, the Latin American common market, despite its shortcomings, pursues the achievement of its laudable purposes. CECLA, that is, the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination, is achieving the purposes for which it was established.\n301.\tAll these bodies reflect pressing needs and undeniable realities, although there is a general demand to make their structures adequate to the requirements of a changing world and to the challenges of human intelligence with its awe-inspiring creations and daring feats in space, which are leaving behind and unsolved the most acute problems of our world.\n302.\tWe agree with what was said by the most enlightened statesmen on our continent in this world forum to the effect that the great problem of Latin America is the problem of under-development. To overcome this condition, we have been striving to create broader markets in a joint effort of economic association.\n303.\tThe marginal condition of vast masses of mankind is another of its conflicting realities. Social and economic structures must be changed, beginning with an agrarian reform, a policy for the distribution of national revenue for the benefit of man's health, housing, education and food.\n304.\tPolitical stability, on which the progress of Latin American countries is based, does not depend on the will of its leaders, but on the economic and social conditions in which their peoples live. That is why there is urgent need to contribute collectively to the improvement of such conditions if truly we seek to take a long leap in history. The criticisms levelled against the instability of many of our Governments must go hand in hand with co-operation and aid. Anything else is like regretting the fate of a patient to whom we do not give the medicine he needs to get well.\n305.\tApart from Bolivia's problems of access to the sea, we have in Latin America the case of the Panama Canal, sovereignty over which Panama claims and in this it is backed by the other Governments of the continent. The\nsame thing happens with the sacrosanct cause of the Bolivians which has found such great understanding among the Governments of Caracas, Bogota, Quito and Lima, on the occasion of the recent tour of those countries by my country's President, General Don Hugo Banzer Suarez.\n306.\tWith regard to the colonialism subsisting in our region, our nations are at one in demanding its total elimination and the protection of the right to self-determination of our peoples.\n307.\tI could not end this part of my statement without expressing my feelings upon the tragic death of the President of Chile, Mr. Salvador Allende, whom I had the honour to meet in the interview we had in the city of Buenos Aires when General Lanusse handed over power to ex-President Campora. That death recalls that of Balmaceda, another distinguished Chilean President, and reveals a profound human quality in President Allende. The leader of Chilean socialism fell like a courageous captain at the head of his cause and in defence of his Government, like Mayor Gualberto Villarroel, a leader of nationalism in my country, immolated in the Quemado Palace on the altar of his ideals, and of Oscar Unzaga de la Vega, founder and leader of the Bolivian Socialist Falange, who lost his life in an open fight for freedom, justice and democracy.\n308.\tNow let me speak of America, but not of its special peculiarities. Historically and geographically its unity is. absolute. Columbus and Americo Vespucio discovered it and gave it its name. It is unnatural to exclude from it North America. We cannot conceive of a unit without one of its parts. We constitute a hemisphere, the hemisphere of human hope. Why not think rather of adding Canada, which shares our common territorial heritage and, like all our countries, emerged from the same historic adventure of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries? Let us move forward rather than backward.\n309.\tI have been particularly concerned about the situation of the relatively less developed countries in South America, namely, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay. That is why, in the Andean Pact, we came to an agreement on the holding of a meeting between these countries to assess the meaning of the integration agreements, the treatment of these countries in the UNCTAD classification, the forthcoming negotiations to be held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and the financial co-operation of international institutions, as well as the general progress achieved in this policy of development.\n310.\tThe aforementioned analysis within the continental, framework must cover the Central American and Caribbean nations, members of the Central American Common Market [CACM] and the Caribbean Free Trade Association [CARIFTA].\n311.\tTo that meeting, to be held in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba in the second half of January 1974, representatives of LAFTA, the Andean subregion, the River Plate Basin, the Economic Commission for Latin America, the Latin-American Institute for Economic and Social Planning, UNCTAD, GATT, FAO, the United\nNations Development Programme [UNDP], the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International Labour Organisation and the International Monetary Fund. The financial institutions to be represented are the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation, and, as special guests, representatives of the CACM and CARIFTA with their regional banks and financial institutions and the International Union of Catholic Employers' Associations.\n312.\tWe believe that this event, which is to be held under the auspices of the economically less developed among the countries of South America, on the initiative of the Foreign Ministry of Bolivia, will be crowned with success. A vast organic and rational agenda, which has already been transmitted to the parties concerned, will highlight the historic importance of this international forum.\n313.\tUntil not long ago the human spirit was disturbed by the doubt that it might not be able \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" \u2014 one of the most noble principles in our Charter.\n314.\tIt would appear that we did not feel able \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\\\" and \\\"to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security\\\" as also prescribed by the Charter.\n315.\tHowever, thanks to the innovating initiative of President Nixon and his personal aid, Mr. Kissinger, the present Secretary of State, there has been a relaxation in international relations between the great Powers and peace has been brought to areas of the world that were either beset or threatened by war.\n316.\tThe policy of decolonization is also being strengthened and it is possible that in the near future all forms of political, religious or racial discrimination will disappear.\n317.\tFratricidal violence and inhuman terrorism, cloaked in apparently altruistic aims, calls for common legislation to characterize them and sanction them. Sectarian convenience or electoral interests should not be allowed to protect them or to mask them under the cloak of feigned ignorance when such facts are objective and condemned by universal conscience.\n318.\tAs regards international pending problems and latent conflicts, a desire for war, or the wish of the strong to dictate to the weaker, serve no purpose. What we need is a negotiated solution which is beneficial to all and falls within the framework of the Charter.\n319.\tNo one can maintain that conquest gives rights. Before the United Nations, the American doctrine of 3 August 1932, which condemns territorial acquisition derived from war, had anticipated this concept.\n320.\tBut there are essential elements in the life and sovereignty of a country, elements without which a State cannot feel secure. Bolivia claims its frontier on the Pacific\nOcean, There, in the beginning of the universal road of the seas, it finds its security.\n321.\tThe Organization must watch over the subsistence of its Member States and must assimilate all the national entities that are not yet Members or have been left outside the Organization.\n322.\tThe right to international life does not depend on the vote of a council or the consensus of an assembly. Nations, like' men, have a right to respect for their existence.\n323.\tReason does not obey the dictates of the strong or the whim of the majorities. The truth is one, luminous, undistortable, like the sun that gives us light.\nJ24. You may divide nations but you cannot change nature. When you try to change nature it reacts with greater violence. It is like history, which is presided over by the law of Karma, of which the thinker, Lin Yutang, speaks so eloquently.\n325.\tJustice, human and international, cannot be fettered. It is the beacon that lights the way of universal conscience and guides man along the paths of history. There are entelechies, like justice, that are stronger than the power of the dominators.\n326.\tIn view of all this, there is a hope in the minds of hungering peoples and of nations in subjection, a hope that they may achieve their liberation and come under the benevolent regime of free and civilized coexistence.\n327.\tInstigation to violence, material assistance to subversive underground warfare, concealment of terrorism \u2014 all these in fact do not favour peace or contribute to justice. Warlike actions are just as tragic as those deriving from violent and treacherous conspiracies.\n328.\tOccurrences involving bloodshed, systematic hatred and destruction must be prevented in all countries. Such is the unavoidable necessity for all who are born into this world and for all who do not wish to perish in the whirlpool of senseless human passions.\n329.\tThe greatness of nations does not reside in the capacity to dominate our planet or to conquer outer space, but in the careful consideration and wisdom they should contribute in guiding mankind to the full realization of its destiny.\n330.\tMan does not base his happiness on the heady wine of material victories at the expense of his fellow men, but rather on the subjective realization of relative well-being and on the search for his origin and his destiny. All else is an affront to the freedom of his conscience and reduces him to the lowest level of the zoological scale.\n331.\tAlong with all of this, we hear a great deal about detente. After the relaxation of international tension, where do we go? To smother danger is not to build a new order.\n332.\tMankind must go to the root of its troubles. Resources can be found by Powers to arm themselves and to explore outer space; but there are no means to be found to\ncombat disease, illiteracy, the hardship n: which millions of human beings must live, hung* unemployment and poverty.\n333.\tIt is proposed that military expenditure be reduced by 10 per cent for the purpose of assistance to developing countries. Armaments, as everyone knows, are a prelude to war. This phenomenon is taking place, paradoxically, in the present-day world, where some go begging for their bread while others waste their money on weapons. It is to be hoped that the aforementioned suggestive idea will not remain simply a demagogic playing with words or a mere lyrical pose. Let us arrive at an agreement in this regard and let even the medium-sized and small nations participate in that endeavour \u2014 those very nations which should not, in addition to the misfortune of their under-development, have to suffer the catastrophe of an armed struggle.\n334.\tIn ancient times, as is well known, people armed to prepare themselves for war. Some centuries have gone by and it may be hoped that the human mind has changed in some respects. Peace is secured by suppressing wars at their very root. There is neither justice nor virtue in poverty. The source for brotherly human coexistence is to be found in well-being. Let us therefore cultivate the earth rather than produce in our factories the tools for destroying and cutting short human lives.\n335.\tIf happiness is the magnetic north that guides mankind, freedom is the natural atmosphere in which the life of nations is lived. International relaxation of tension can thus be reflected in economic relations, but it is anachronistic indeed if there remain captive peoples as a consequence of a war.\n336.\tThere are Powers that have decided on how not to interfere in the internal life of other countries. Their trick consists in converting other countries into satellite nations through armed occupation. It is of no help if the victims maintain the contrary in praise of their executioners.\n337.\tMan is free by nature and he broke the chains that enslaved him many years ago. We cannot condone the existence of subject peoples. It is not true that self-determination encourages a retreat from independent life and from the autonomous and sovereign right of people to govern themselves.\n338.\tIt is usual to see the mote in the other's eye but not the beam in one's own, as the Holy Scriptures tell us. It is for that reason that some call for the withdrawal of certain armies from occupied territories. But we see no example of such withdrawals on the part of the forces which are subjugating nations that have been free for centuries.\n339.\tSome are loud in denunciation of armies that overthrow governments. It is commonly forgotten that the armed forces of a nation form a substantial part of the people. Much more serious is the case of the troops, the tanks and aircraft that invade countries and conquer peoples with age-old cultures and independent traditions.\n340.\tThe history of peoples cannot be enclosed in chapters, as happens with the citizens of a country when they are placed in concentration camps and prisons and\nsubjected to torture. The life of nations is continuous and permanent. Their lands and their right to govern themselves can be taken from them, but never their life, never their presence as stars in the wide firmament of mankind and of time itself.\n341.\tThe time has come to think more seriously about a sort of universal human society on earth. With the elimination of international rivalries and the quenching of the mad thirst for universal domination, there will come about a joining of efforts, of technologies and resources in the exclusive service of all mankind.\n342.\tGovernments do not last for ever. All our traditions confirm this. The elements of power vary with the passage of time and the effects of circumstances. Powers decline and new ones emerge. The balance of power varies and we must seek therefore to avoid as far as possible its periodic fluctuations. This does not mean we must try to stratify history, which would be deadly for man, but rather that we must avoid using national resources for wasteful purposes of conquest and domination.\n343.\tIt is important that international coexistence be safeguarded. Ideological pluralism is a fact and a doctrine, if you will. We are compelled to respect other peoples. They have the right to choose whatever form of political life is best suited to them. What must be fought against is precisely any disregard of the right to self-determination. It is this that separates Governments and not the nature of the regime that rules.\n344.\tInternational organizations base their existence on constitutions. There are declarations recognizing the rights of men and of citizens. There is need for the Mexican document which defines the economic rights and duties of States. There is much to be said concerning this and it is both logical and proper for the small countries to go before the great countries in a dramatic demand for international justice together with effective and sincere co-operation in development.\n345.\tSeveral nations of America, Europe, Africa and Asia are awaiting the establishment of rules that will define and guarantee the inherent powers enjoyed by land-locked countries. The legislation in this regard must apply to all universally. Just as with the sea-bed freedom of navigation and direct access to coasts and fisheries cannot remain within the framework of mere declarations.\n346.\tPreferences are established in favour of the economically less developed countries with regard to subregional, regional and world bodies. This has been stated in Tokyo to the Director-General of GATT and the representatives there assembled. Bolivia, with justice and good reason, requests the special consideration of this matter, one that will embrace all the peoples which, furthermore, lack a sea coast.\n347.\tAmong the rights of man there is the right of free transit and residence. It is a law of men that cannot be restricted as it is recognized throughout the world. The contrary would be to recognize slavery and to prevent children from returning to the homes of their elders.\n348.\tMy delegation cannot but express its concern over the debates in our Organization. It could be said that we often forget the spirit of the Charter. We seek conciliation among men, yet we are accustomed here not to employ the dialectic of intelligence, but rather that of frozen attitudes.\n349.\tThe clearest and purest essence of democracy lies in the right to dissent. To be able to exercise this right without the risk of annihilation, man has shed his blood throughout his journey through history.\n350.\tThe right to express one's view is as precious as the right to existence and a worthwhile life. Only animals produce sounds without meaning for us, like the roaring of the blind tempests of nature. To deny that right is equivalent to turning man into an animal.\n351.\tThe policy of special privilege is contrary to justice. A few cannot live at the expense of the poverty of the great majority of mankind. Nor does exploitation by industrialized countries of the producers of raw materials contribute anything to peace.\n352.\tNational income should be distributed among the ordinary citizens, just as it is necessary to adopt a policy of equitable regulation of what is bought and sold by countries of differing economic conditions.\n353.\tFinally, we must talk about faith \u2014 about the faith of man in himself, about the faith of peoples in their creative capacities, about the faith of the international community in its organizations and the precepts that nourish them. I wish to state, in the name of my Government, that the Bolivian people believes in the effectiveness of the subregional and regional groupings to which it belongs. It believes in the River Plate Basin and the Andean Group. It believes in the Organization of American States. And, finally, it believes in the United Nations, the Organization to which we look to guarantee universal peace and without which there would be no security for either man or nations. And the Bolivian people expresses the hope that it will be able, moreover, to stop the resumption of operations in the Middle East."

        "file_text": "\ufeff31.\tIt is my privilege and pleasure to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the Indonesian delegation, our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are all aware of your competence and vast experience in international affairs, and my delegation is fully confident that under your guidance this Assembly will be able to conclude its work successfully.\n32.\tIt is a matter of particular poignancy to me to acclaim the elevation of a distinguished son of Latin America to this high office at a time when turmoil and tragedy have again struck part of the continent he represents. The world has been shocked by the untimely death of President Allende of Chile. While my delegation feels that it should not pass judgement on what is essentially the internal affair of a friendly country, we sincerely hope that the Chilean people may soon see the restoration of national harmony and stability in their country so that they may be enabled to continue efforts to achieve progress, prosperity and social justice.\n33.\tI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their admission to our Organization. My delegation welcomes their entry into our midst as an event of great significance for the realization of the principle of true universality of membership of the United Nations.\n34.\tThis event also symbolizes the success of the process of normalization of relations in Europe, which we hope will further stimulate efforts towards easing international tensions. My delegation would like to pay a tribute to the far-sighted and courageous statesmanship that has succeeded in putting aside past enmity and distrust and opening the way to a new era of dialogue and peaceful co-operation in Europe.\n35.\tThe admission of the two German States to the United Nations may set an example for other divided countries, if and when the peoples concerned agree to undertake a similar step.\n36.\tMy delegation would, further, like to extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, a sister archipelagic State, on its admission to the United Nations. I am confident that the commitment of the Bahamas to peace and peaceful development on the basis of the principles of the Charter will contribute to the efficacy of our Organization. We look forward to fruitful co-operation with the Bahamas in the United Nations and all its bodies.\n37.\tMy delegation would like to thank the Secretary- General for the excellent report on the work of our Organization. We wish to underline his statement that \\\"an institution works and develops only if there exists among its members the political will to make it work and develop\\\" [A/9001/Add.1, p. 15}. If today we face the sobering reality of the increasing ineffectiveness of the United Nations role in world politics, if the failures of the United\nNations seem to overshadow its achievements, it is time for us to recognize that it is not so much the failures and shortcomings of the Organization itself that are to be blamed as we ourselves, the constituent sovereign States. It is high time that all of us, all the 135 Members of the United Nations, instead of criticizing the Organization and everyone else, exercised the wisdom of introspection and self-criticism.\n38.\tMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for the reference he has made in the introduction to his report to the importance of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in' Algiers on the eve of the present session of the Assembly. No one can deny the contributions of the non-aligned movement towards the reduction of international tensions and the establishment of a more peaceful world.\n39.\tMy delegation is convinced that in the days to come non-alignment will play an even more significant role than it has in the past, as the movement addresses itself, with growing maturity and sense of purpose, to the realistic solution of the great problems faced by all nations.\n40.\tLike others in this Assembly, Indonesia welcomes the detente. We hope, however, that its blessings will be felt not only in Europe, where the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has started its laudable efforts to end the post-war era of cold-war strife and to organize a new structure of peaceful coexistence and co-operation on the continent; its positive and beneficial influence must spread to other parts of the world also. We hope that detente will usher in a new international climate in which the solution of problems such as the Middle East and Indo-China may become less intractable. We expect that it may accelerate efforts to end the existence of illegal minority regimes and eliminate the remnants of colonialism, eradicate apartheid and racialism and contribute decisively to the success of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We also hope that the atmosphere of detente will not encourage the apparent tendency of big Powers to bypass the United Nations in efforts to find solutions for international problems affecting the entire world community.\n41.\tOn the issue of disarmament, my delegation feels that progress has been painfully slow despite the vital interests that are at stake for all mankind. However, prospects for an abatement of the arms race are not entirely without promise. The recent agreements reached between the United States and the USSR on the limitation of strategic arms, although still limited in scope, deserve our commendation.\n42.\tThe resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 concerning a future world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)) increases our hopes regarding the prospects of general and complete disarmament. My delegation notes with regret, however, that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, set up under General Assembly resolution 2930 (XXVII), has not been able to start its work because some of the nuclear Powers \u2014 whose participation is most important for the success of the Committee's work \u2014 are not yet prepared to associate themselves with its activities.\n43.\tAllow me now to deal briefly with the problem of the Middle East, a problem for which the United Nations has shown profound concern and to which it has devoted \u2014  though as yet in vain \u2014 considerable time and effort in the search for a just solution, satisfactory to all parties concerned. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its full support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people to secure their inalienable rights and the efforts of the Arab countries to bring about the withdrawal of Israel from all the territories it is now occupying as a result of the 1967 war.\n44.\tWhile we continue to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remains the realistic basis for a solution of the Middle East problem, new avenues should be explored in order that continued efforts by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to implement that resolution may have a chance of achieving concrete results. At the same time, my delegation realizes that the search for a solution of the Middle East problem will be enormously facilitated if the big Powers are prepared to co-operate and make their positive contribution.\n45.\tThe past year has witnessed further progress in the process of decolonization. As I have noted, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has attained independence since we last met, while the Territory of Papua-New Guinea will shortly be self-governing, with full independence to be attained not later than in 1975. Though we may rejoice at these advances, the situation elsewhere, particularly in southern Africa, gives us little reason to expect that the provisions of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] will soon be implemented there. On the contrary, we must in candour admit that the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning the racist and colonialist policies of the Portuguese and South African Governments and the illegal Smith regime have remained largely ignored.\n46.\tRecent events have again demonstrated the stubborn refusal of those regimes to desist from their condemnable policies and practices. Increased repression in the Portuguese-administered Territories of Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Angola, mass reprisals in Rhodesia, dissolution of the territorial integrity of Namibia and the recent killings at Carletonville in South Africa continue to defy the conscience of the world community. The persistent denial to the vast majority of the people in those Territories of their most elementary rights has created a situation fraught with the gravest danger to the peace of the continent and of the world. The United Nations must not slacken its efforts to take effective steps to enable the people of Africa to exercise the right of self-determination and to attain their fundamental rights to independence and human dignity.\n47.\tWhile on the subject of the struggle for national independence, allow me to touch briefly on the question of national liberation movements and wars of independence. As a nation born out of a war of independence, Indonesia has supported and will continue to support to the maximum of its capacities all national liberation movements against colonial oppressors everywhere in the world. We must, however, never allow the concept of wars of\nliberation to be used as a device to instigate or to perpetuate civil war in an independent and sovereign country or, worse, to sanction with it the interference by foreign Powers in the internal affairs of another country. If we were ever to allow this to happen not only would we violate one of the basic principles of the Charter, that of non-interference, but this might also pose a serious threat to the territorial integrity, national unity and sovereignty of the majority of countries gathered here in this Assembly.\n48.\tAlthough a formal end to war has come to Viet-Nam, actual peace still remains elusive. When we consider the recent developments in Viet-Nam it is important for us to be guided by the overriding objective of creating conditions that would make real peace possible in Viet-Nam. As manifested by the Paris agreements the Viet-Namese parties to the conflict, as well as the big Powers involved, have shown a community of interest in accepting the road of peaceful settlement rather than continuing war. In the actual implementation of the accords, however \u2014 which has been far from satisfactory \u2014 real peace can come about only if the political will on the part of those directly involved is there.\n49.\tIndonesia's acceptance of membership in the International Commission of Control and Supervision and our formal endorsement of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam require that we act as impartially as possible in the implementation of the terms of those agreements and in our relations with all parties to the conflict. We cannot, therefore, act in any manner that would appear not to take into account these considerations, or the ongoing process towards finding just and lasting peace in Viet-Nam. To do so would mean prejudging that process and could be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of others.\n50.\tThe tragic events in Cambodia revolve, in our view, primarily around the question of contending national leaderships, further compounded by foreign interference and conflicting major-Power interests. It is hoped that a peaceful solution to the Khmer problem will be brought about through negotiations among the parties concerned. In\n* the final analysis it is for the Khmer people themselves to decide on the leadership they want and the system of government under which they choose to live. Therefore my delegation is of the view that we should not take any action which might prejudge the decision of the Khmer people themselves and might prolong the tragic suffering and loss of life and property in Cambodia.\n51.\tWe welcome the Vientiane Agreement  recently concluded between the Laotian parties. We hope that that agreement will indeed mean an end to the fighting in Laos and that the Laotian people will be able to start rebuilding their country which for so long has been ravaged by war.\n52.\tThe Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace was adopted by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXV!}] and in the course of the twenty-seventh session an Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, consisting of 15 members, was established to consider the implications of the Declaration\n[resolution 2992 (XXVII)}. Given the differences of interests between the many countries, the littoral and hinterland States, the major maritime and naval Powers, the task of the Committee is undoubtedly difficult. As the successful implementation of the Declaration would strengthen the conditions of peace, security and co-operation in this important region of the world, the Ad Hoc Committee deserves our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of its task.\n53.\tIt is the concern which the countries of South-East Asia have for peace and security in their region that has prompted the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia to support the proposal of Malaysia for the neutralization of South-East Asia. The concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, as embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration,  recognizes the legitimate interests of all Powers concerned in the region and the necessity to undertake efforts to harmonize those interests in order to enable the peoples of the region to create conditions for peaceful developments.\n54.\tIt is increasingly obvious that in the very near future international peace and security will be affected by the manner in which the international community faces and solves the intricate problems of the law of the sea. The forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will be burdened with the heavy responsibility of trying to accommodate differences and conflicts of national interests created by outdated rules of the law of the sea or by the existence of legal vacuums. It is hoped that the Conference will be able to create new rules of the law of the sea that will not only guarantee the sound management and equitable distribution of the oceans' wealth but also respect the economic interests, national sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity of coastal States. To realize those expectations it is imperative that in formulating new rules of the law of the sea the Conference should take due regard of the vital and just interests of Member States deriving from their special geographical circumstances. A realistic and pragmatic approach in dealing with the complex problems of the law of the sea is very much needed. Any new rules of the law of the sea will surely lack effectiveness if they do not take into account the physical, economic and political realities faced by Member States.\n55.\tOur preoccupation with the problems I have just mentioned should not prevent us from giving our urgent attention also to a range of other equally important and fundamental problems in the economic, social and humanitarian fields, which may perhaps require even greater concentration and intensity of efforts. The population explosion, mass poverty, the growing threat of world famine, the destruction of human ecology are in my view some of the major issues which will determine man's very capacity to survive in the decades to come.\n56.\tThe food crisis that is at present being faced by the world as the result of grain shortages everywhere is becoming an acute problem not only for the developing countries, where food shortages caused by floods, droughts and crop failures are already chronic phenomena, but also for the rich and developed countries. Unless the international community gives this problem the attention commensurate with the seriousness of its implications the world may soon be faced by an unprecedented challenge to its very peace and security.\n57.\tAnother problem that has lately assumed alarming proportions, affecting nations in all regions of the world, is that of narcotics and illegal drug trafficking, especially in connexion with the youth of the world. The widespread use of drugs among young people and the related question of juvenile delinquency clearly strike at the very roots of our common efforts at nation-building. Let us therefore join hands in a common cause to eradicate this scourge and lend our full co-operation to all international agencies concerned with the problem.\n58.\tThe question of external development assistance and private foreign investments also deserves our thoughtful security. It is undeniably true that the economic development of a nation should remain the primary responsibility of that nation itself and that co-operation with outside interests should respect the principles of national sovereignty, including permanent sovereignty over natural resources. It has also become clear, however, that foreign assistance and investment, in the form of transfer of capital, technology and modern skills from the developed to the developing countries, if handled properly and with the necessary safeguards, can be useful in accelerating the process of national development. For such external assistance and investment to remain effective and to the mutual benefit of all concerned, we must see to it that such assistance only supplements, and in no way supplants, the national effort. Furthermore, the foreign investor must be able to reconcile his interests with the national development goals of the host country.\n59.\tClosely related to the question of foreign investment is the emergence of multinational or transnational corporations as a new dynamic factor in the world economy which poses a dilemma to most developing countries. The relevance here seems to be that their size, flexibility and financial capacities often place multinational corporations in too powerful a bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis the developing country, thus posing a real threat to its national sovereignty. Here again the problem is not simply one of outright rejection but rather of the need for world-wide regulation of rights and responsibilities for the common benefit and justice for all concerned. We look forward to the results of the deliberations of the United Nations Group of Eminent Persons to Study the Impact of Multinational Corporations on Development and on International Relations.\n60.\tAnother development which I should like to mention is the growing trend towards larger economic groupings among the developed countries and the concentration of trading strength in a number of agglomerations of economic power. While we can understand the advantages of such greater economic integration, we are equally concerned about the adverse repercussions it might have on the interests of developing countries. Whether or not such groupings and agglomerations will prove on balance to be \\\"trade creating\\\" rather than \\\"trade diverting\\\" will depend on the interplay of various factors, the net impact of which is difficult to predict.\n7\n61.\tAs a response to that development, countries in the developing world, joined together into regional or sub- regional groupings, have taken steps to cope with its negative aspects. In South-East Asia the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] has initially formed associations of producers of primary products to maintain its competitive position in world markets and has lately gone further in strengthening economic interdependence in two directions.\n62.\tFirst, ASEAN has taken preparatory steps towards the creation of its own regional market. Studies have been undertaken on a number of projects with a view to rationalizing investment decisions within the regional market formed by the member countries. This is a beginning of a common industrialization programme which can be initiated in the region.\n63.\tSecondly, since June of last year ASEAN has established and institutionalized a dialogue on a continuing basis with the European Economic Community. That marked a significant step forward for ASEAN because it was the beginning of the forging of a common position in negotiations with a major trading partner. The Association is of necessity outward-looking by virtue of the economic and social structures of the member countries and, their geographical location. It intends to keep an open mind in maintaining and improving its relations with centres of economic power, but it rejects schemes which would make South-East Asia nothing more than a mere producer and supplier of raw materials operating under conditions of distorted power relationships with the industrialized countries and of continued singular decline in its terms of trade with them.\n64.\tOther recent developments in the economic and monetary fields continue to give us cause for deep concern. The recurrent international monetary crisis indicates that the world economy is still faced with considerable uncertainties which badly affect, in particular, the development efforts of the developing countries. These crises have caused further deterioration in the already precarious position of the developing countries. Despite determined efforts to improve their lot, we continue to witness the ever widening prosperity and welfare gap between the developed and the developing countries.\n65.\tThe United Nations proclaimed the 1970s to be the Second Development Decade, and the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)J was adopted to guide the nations of the world in co-operating in their development efforts. Yet an over-all view of the performance over the first two years of the Strategy clearly indicates that we are nowhere nearer our goal of creating conditions of peaceful well-being that would ensure a standard of living compatible with human dignity for the larger part of mankind living in the developing countries.\n66.\tThe key targets of the Strategy, crucial to its goals and objectives, have not been realized. This has led the Committee for Development Planning to conclude that the International Development Strategy remains much more a wish than a policy.\n67.\tIt is, however, enlightening to note the growing awareness that continuing inequalities in the international distribution of wealth are morally unacceptable and materially incompatible with world peace and security. The problem which has now assumed urgent relevance is how to evolve the right relationship between developed and developing countries, conducive to the progressive elimination of these inequalities through a more rapid development in the developing countries.\n68.\tIt is in the context of evolving such a new international relationship that we have to view the practical significance of two important and interrelated negotiations, namely, the multilateral trade negotiations and the negotiations on international monetary reform. The results of these two negotiations should, in our view, be assessed on the basis of their respective contributions to the building of a better and more equal pattern of international distribution of wealth and to the acceleration of the development process in the developing world.\n69.\tThe multilateral trade negotiations will be conducted within the basic framework of the Tokyo Declaration which was recently adopted by the ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Tokyo. While these trade negotiations are rightly aimed, as the Declaration states, at \\\"the expansion and ever greater liberalization of world trade through the progressive dismantling of obstacles of trade\\\", I should like to emphasize that our final goal is to raise the standard of living and welfare of the people of the world, particularly the people of the developing countries. It is the living standards in those countries that urgently need to be raised progressively, since most of their people are still living at a very low subsistence level. It is, therefore, imperative that any preferential treatment to be accorded to them be on a non-reciprocal basis.\n70.\tThe same is true with the negotiations on international monetary reform. The new international monetary system, to be negotiated on the basis of the work of the International Monetary Fund's Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues, not .only should make possible an expansion of international\ntrade and the smooth operation of international payment settlements, but should also facilitate the development process in the developing countries through providing additional liquidity to them. A link between the special drawing rights and development aid should therefore be established. It is regrettable that major decisions on this important matter have to be postponed until next year, since the recent Nairobi meeting of the Committee could not agree on the key issues for reform.\n71.\tThe developing countries have an enormous stake in the outcome of these two negotiations. We earnestly hope, therefore, that the international community can summon the courage and goodwill needed to make these negotiations successful.\n72.\tThe process of reordering the international social and economic relationships, now under way, undoubtedly presents the United Nations, particularly the Economic and Social Council, with the challenge to assume more effectively and efficiently the functions entrusted, to it by the United Nations Charter. To meet this challenge it has been the considered opinion of my delegation that the Council should be revitalized and its role strengthened. Efforts which have been made so far include inter alia the enlargement of membership in the Council in order to increase its representative character. The Council should be made fully responsive to the challenges of our time, and the review and appraisal of the Development Strategy should become one of its major tasks.\n73.\tThe Economic and Social Council, together with the other operational bodies of the United Nations, must be able to play a decisive role in evolving more effective concepts of international development co-operation. The activities of United Nations operational bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Food Programme should, in our view, also be strengthened and consolidated. A more dynamic growth in their over-all resources will enable these bodies to respond quickly and adequately to the ever increasing demand for their services.\n74.\tThe challenges and problems we face in the coming decades cannot be met by one nation or a particular group of nations, no matter how rich or powerful they may be. The destruction caused by a nuclear war is not going to be limited to the territory of the warring Powers alone. No nation-can be secure as long as another is beset with a sense of insecurity or of injustice. No nation can enjoy the fruits of material abundance or social welfare as long as other nations remain destitute, for the economic fabric of the world is like an indivisible chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. Every nation will suffer when the earth is unable to provide its inhabitants with those basic resources necessary for a life in peace and human dignity for all.\n75.\tIn pledging Indonesia's continued dedication to the ideals and aims of the Charter, therefore, we commit ourselves not only to contributing our share in facing up to mankind's immense task of shaping a new and better world of tomorrow, but simultaneously also to enhancing the viability of the United Nations as the best instrument for global co-operation in quest of that goal."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the Soviet delegation I should like to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In discharging your duties, you may be assured of our firm intention to help make this session a successful one. The Soviet Union seeks to ensure that every session of the General Assembly yields practical results in strengthening peace and the security of peoples.\n2.\tThe past year has been crowded with major international events. Some of them, even if viewed separately, represent historic milestones. However, what chiefly characterizes this entire set of events is the development and strengthening of the shift from an extended period of tension in the world to detente and business-like co-operation. From this standpoint, the past year can in a sense be described as having marked a turning-point.\n3.\tThe war in Viet-Nam was brought to an end. The flames of one of the most dangerous breeding grounds of war were stamped out. The just cause of the Viet-Namese people gained a major victory.\n4.\tIn southern Asia, steps are being taken to bring about a further easing of the tension which several times in the past has led to open hostilities. It is gratifying that all three of the States on the subcontinent-India, Pakistan and Bangladesh-are involved in this process.\n5.\tThe positive changes in the situation in Europe are even more clearly apparent. The task of normalizing relations between the States of Eastern and Western Europe is virtually complete, and we hope that no one will create artificial obstacles to the completion of this process. The convening of the all-European conference'' marked the opening of a new and extremely important stage in the work of guaranteeing security and organizing peaceful co-operation on a continent-wide scale.\n6.\tThe danger of a global clash between the two world-wide social systems which would inevitably result in a terrible catastrophe for all mankind has been lessened. That is how the entire world views the Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War,  which was concluded during the visit to the United States by L. I. Brezhnev, tire General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n7.\tToday, the principle of peaceful coexistence is not only recognized as the only possible basis for relations between the socialist and capitalist countries but is increasingly being given practical effect and embodied in treaties and agreements. The process of detente is a broad and deep one which is involving an increasing number of States and affecting more and more important areas of the relations between them.\n8.\tThis gives us reason to hope that, as Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev noted in a recent statement, \\\"the present detente is not a temporary phenomenon but the beginning of a fundamental reorientation of international relations\\\".\n9.\tThe changes for the better in international affairs arouse particular satisfaction in the Soviet Union. Not, of course, that other peoples are any less interested in peace than the Soviet Union, It is just that to us the increasing trend towards detente and co-operation is also confirmation of the correctness and consistency of the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union.\n10.\tPeace and friendship between peoples have always been the watchword of Soviet foreign policy and its unchanging goal. That goal was defined by V. I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Socialist State and head of its first Government. It has been and continues to be the basis of the foreign policy guidelines laid down at all Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our country has taken this position under all circumstances, regardless of the configuration of the international situation. It must be clear by now to any unprejudiced person that this is the long-range, permanent policy of the Soviet Union and is not merely a response to immediate circumstances. It is determined by the very nature of our social system.\n11.\tThe shift in the course of international events in the last few years indicates clearly that ensuring a lasting peace on earth is not simply a noble but remote ideal; it is, rather a completely attainable goal of practical politics.\n12.\tAnother fact is no less obvious. The positive results that hive been achieved up to now did not come about of themselves.\n13.\tA great deal of intensive effort has gone into the various international measures which led to detente. Sometimes the result is a treaty of agreement drawn up on a page or two of official stationery, but how much labour has gone into every article and paragraph! These agreements are generally preceded by an intensive process of feeling out, by discussions and intensive negotiations. A State visit or international conference lasting no more than a few days crowns the labour of many years.\n14.\tObviously, there is no Government that will not say it wants peace, lasting peace, indeed eternal peace. If such pronouncements are not to remain an idle dream, however, they must be backed up by unremitting efforts that go on day after day.\n15.\tThe Soviet Union exhorts its allies as well to follow this course. Indeed, we go beyond exhortations; acting in close co-ordination and in the light of international developments, we take concrete initiatives. At the recent Crimean meeting of leaders of the Communist and workers parties of the socialist countries, it was emphasized that all the States concerned must now join efforts in consolidating the favourable changes that have come about in international affairs, must consistently give practical effect to the treaties and agreements that have been concluded and must advance steadily towards the main objective, which is that of ensuring a lasting peace.\n16.\tIt is a secret .to no one that detente has its enemies whose resistance must not be underestimated. There is also a certain inertia to be overcome. After all, what we are trying to do is to solve problems that have built up over a period of years or even decades.\n17.\tHowever, the supporters of detente are more numerous, and what matters is that their efforts should increase and not slacken.\n18.\tIn a number of capitalist countries, a trend towards broader co-operation with socialist States has emerged and is becoming increasingly apparent. Far-sighted political figures in those countries, taking a realistic, responsible view of the world situation, show a willingness to join efforts in working out solutions which give equal weight to the interests of all concerned. It goes without saying that this benefits not only the States directly concerned but the entire cause of peace.\n19.\tDetente gives the non-aligned and neutral States a greater opportunity to exert a positive influence on international developments, A good many useful ventures, including some within the framework of the United Nations, got their start because of the political influence which these countries exercise. The results of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries at Algiers showed once again that when the Conference participants speak out in favour of detente and co-operation and against the forces of aggression and oppression of peoples, their voice is convincing and authoritative.\n20.\tBy its very nature, detente cannot simply be a matter of improving relations between a few States or certain geographical regions. If it is to become irreversible, it must be a matter of concern to all States and ultimately become universal.\n21.\tThe United Nations has 135 Member States, all of which, when they joined the Organization, assumed an obligation under the Charter to maintain international peace and security. If that entire potential for peace was translated into action, it would indeed give powerful impetus to the advance towards a reliable system of security for all peoples.\n22.\tOne sometimes hears it said that now that the Soviet Union and the United States are improving their relations and concluding important agreements which help to lessen international tension, there is nothing left for other States to do but to stand by passively. Some go further than that and try to foster the false notion that all of this damages the interests of other countries.\n23.\tApart from the fact that such assertions,, whether intentionally or unintentionally, distort the actual state of affairs, their practical effect can only be to paralyse initiative and hamper detente.\n24.\tIs it possible to conceive of a broader sphere in which energies can be brought to bear than that of peace? Peace offers vast scope for all countries. Every State, large or small, bears responsibility for maintaining security throughout the world. The whole question is where its policy leads to \u2014 whether it helps detente or hinders it.\n25.\tIt is important to mark out the political paths to further detente. However, it is no less important that meaningful activities should be undertaken. These efforts cannot remain shut up in government offices. They must be supported by broad, tireless work on behalf of peace by the most varied social forces. Parliamentarians and businessmen, political parties and trade-union, youth, women's and veterans' groups, scientists and artists-all can play a part if there is a determination to work for peace. Millions upon millions of people must be drawn into the movement for a lasting peace.\n26.\tYes, the situation in the world has definitely improved in the past year. It is incomparably better than 5 or 10 years ago. But does that mean that all is bright on the international horizon? No, not by any means.\n27.\tIn several parts of the world, the danger of war still exists. In some the guns are already speaking, while in others the finger is poised on the trigger.\n28.\tThe situation in Indo-China is still a complicated one. Military operations are now of a relatively limited nature, but tensions cannot be completely cleared away in that area unless the political settlement if fully implemented in keeping with the legitimate rights and interests of all the peoples of Indo-China.\n29.\tThe key to this lies in strict compliance by all parties to the Paris agreements on ending the war and restoring peace m Viet Nam. in respect for the agreements reached in Laos, and in permitting the people of Cambodia to settle their internal affairs as they see fit and without foreign interference.\n30.\tTrue to its internationalist convictions, the Soviet Union will continue to give the necessary aid and support of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and to stand beside the patriotic forces in Indo-China.\n31.\tAgain and again we find ourselves returning to the situation in the Middle East, which, it must be stated bluntly, presents a danger because of the continuing Israeli aggression. Surely we cannot lake comfort in the fact that right now the breeding ground of war is not aflame but merely smouldering. The flames of war may shoot up at any moment, and who can say what the result will be'?\n32.\tThe aggressor seized foreign lands before the eyes of the entire world and is holding on to them by force. In doing so, he is flagrantly violating the rules of international law. One need only recall the latest acts of provocation against neighbouring Arab countries, which were just recently the object of renewed condemnation by the Security Council. Furthermore, all this is not simply a gesture of recklessness or desperation by a handful of people, but the calculated policy of the State of Israel.\n33.\tNo Arab can be made to believe that he must reconcile himself to the existing situation. The Arab States, which have been the victims of imperialist aggression, want only one thing - the restoration of what was taken from them by force -and they are right.\n34.\tThe Soviet Union remains convinced that the Middle East problem can be solved. The basis for a solution exists in the form of the well-known Security Council resolutions, which as was confirmed once again by the recent discussion of the Middle East question in the United Nations are supported by an overwhelming majority of Stales Members of our Organization. The aggressor is becoming increasingly defiant in his refusal to agree to a settlement.\n35.\tEvery effort must be made to see that Israel and the countries and circles that support its present policy understand at long last the need for a more sober approach and that they truly *et out on the path leading to a solution of the problem.\n36.\tAs far as the Soviet Union is concerned, its position is clear, the situation in the Middle East must be resolved un the basis of the complete I repeat, complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories and of respect for the independence and inalienable rights of the States and peoples of the area, including the Arab people of Palestine. Our main, decisive interest in the Middle Fast is to promote the achievement of a just and lasting peace. The Soviet Union wishes to state tins once again from tins rostrum in the most categorical terms.\n37.\tIn order to obtain a proper perspective in a situation characterized by the extreme complexity of the interplay of various factors, one must appraise events in all their fullness and constant flux. That is particularly true at the present stage of the situation, which is dynamic and full of contrasts.\n38.\tIf one views unsolved problems without reference to the positive results that have already been achieved, it is easy to take an extreme position and deny the very possibility of resolving acute, controversial issues. In our opinion, however, there is no place for this approach to international phenomena, including the activities of the United Nations.\n39.\tEqually unproductive is the other extreme that of presenting the situation in rosy hues and failing to see that what remains to be done is far more than what has already been accomplished.\n40.\tBoth extremes are bad. All States, all Governments and all political figures must, if they are conscious of their responsibility, regard it as their first duty in (he international arena to work actively for peace.\n41.\tA whole series of problems are clamouring for solution. It cannot be said that the United Nations is not dealing with them. It may well be asked, however, how many of them are really being solved, and the answer is not a comforting one. It must be acknowledged that some problems become harder rather than easier to solve as time goes by, but they may become even more difficult if they are put off further.\n42.\tThe problem of problems is that of the continuing arms race. The development of techniques of mass destruction and the stockpiling of weapons have long since gone beyond the point where using them becomes an absurdity, for, as V. I. Lenin foresaw half a century ago, this process is \\\"undermining the very conditions for the existence of human society\\\". It must be obvious to all how ruinous it is to go on replenishing the arsenals. Yet. only in recent years has it become possible to take the first I repeat, the first step towards limiting the arms race.\n43.\tIt would be wrong to underestimate the importance of the measures that have already been taken. These measures serve to impede to some extent the unrestrained proliferation of armaments, particularly the most destructive types.\n44.\tTen years have passed since the signing of the Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, which was the first in a series of agreements. The fact that some countries have not acceded to the Treaty does not nullify the indisputable fact that it is beneficial to the peoples of the world.\n45.\tThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has gained wide recognition, and it has also been extremely helpful in curbing the unclear arms race.\n46.\tSuccess has been achieved in preventing of the emplacement of nuclear weapons in several important natural environments, namely the sea-bed and the ocean floor and outer space. Bacteriological weapons which are among the most deadly, have been banned and eliminated.\n47.\t Just recently, an important frontier was crossed when, as a result of agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the United States, mutual limitations were imposed on strategic arms and principles were formulated for negotiations on further such limitations. In conjunction with the historic conclusion of the Agreement between the Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War, these accords contribute significantly to an improvement in the international atmosphere.\n\n48.\tHowever, further efforts are needed, and they cannot, of course, be confined to two nuclear Powers, even though those two may be militarily the mightiest in the world. We could, in particular, find it gratifying if other States were willing to adhere to the principles jointly laid down by the Soviet Union and the United States for renunciation of the use of force and decisive action to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war; that would be of exceptional importance in ensuring lasting peace throughout the world.\n\n120.\tHuge sums continue to be spent for military purposes, and military planning goes on.\n121.\tSince the United Nations first began to function, the Soviet Union has consistently sought to turn events in the direction of disarmament. We have always urged that it is of the utmost importance to ban nuclear weapons and ensure that nuclear energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. I might recall that back in 1946, the first year of our Organization's existence, the Soviet Union placed on the negotiating table a draft international convention to prohibit the production and employment of weapons based on the use of atomic energy for the purpose of mass destruction; it did so in the belief that the aspirations and the conscience of nations called for such a convention.\n122.\tHow much discussion there has been since that time, and how many resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council, the General Assembly and various committees and commissions! If this were not such a serious matter, one could speak sarcastically about the mountains of paper that have been used up in the process. The essential point, however, is that there has been little change in the situation.\n123.\tIt would not occur to anyone to deny that the solution of the problems of disarmament involves great difficulties. And yet the international questions which have been successfully resolved up to now also appeared forbidding at the outset. Consequently, references to objective difficulties do not reveal the main point. The crux of the matter lies in political considerations. And responsibility for political considerations rests primarily with the people who are invested with power, those who stand at the helm of government.\n124.\tThere is hardly any point in digging about in the past, in analysing all the proposals which have been made or in dwelling on the positions of individual States. All that is quite well known. The walls of the United Nations have heard many speeches on the subject of disarmament.\n125.\tToday, however, we all have more experience in settling international problems than we had yesterday. And it suggests to us that even in the field of disarmament real progress can be achieved in some areas. All that is needed is to follow in practice a truth which in theory is certainly recognized by all: not to proclaim \\\"all or nothing\\\", but to single out one after another those problems on which agreement can be reached even at the present stage, and then solve them. Experience has shown that this approach can prove its worth even in such matters as vital to the security of the State as that ultimate weapon, the nuclear missile. Is that not demonstrated by the Soviet-American agreements dealing with that matter?\n126.\tNeither can there be any doubt about another matter. Those agreements would not have been possible if they had put either side at a disadvantage, if the principle of equal security had not been scrupulously observed.\n127.\tBut if, on such a basis, two countries have been able to achieve a limitation of arms, then why cannot, say, five Powers act similarly, provided, of course, that there will be no threat to the security of any of them? And if that can be done, what is there to prevent such a method from being applied to a wider range of countries? The greater the number of States that participate in a practical solution of the disarmament problem, the more tangible will be the benefit for the security of all peoples.\n128.\tFurthermore, we believe that the successes achieved on the path towards detente already make it possible for considerable additional resources to be made available to assist the developing countries.\n129.\tIn view of all these considerations, the Soviet Union wishes to propose that the question of the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries should be included in the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations as an important and urgent item.\n130.\tIf our proposal meets with general agreement, and if the General Assembly adopts an appropriate resolution, a beneficial and useful step can be taken.\n131.\tThe States which are permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations are known to have the largest military budgets. This is taken into account in our proposal.\n132.\tIn our view it would be appropriate to take as the starting-point for the proposed reduction the level of military budgets for the current year, 1973. That proportion of the funds made available by such a reduction which would be used to benefit the developing countries could, for example, amount to 10 per cent.\n133.\tNeedless to say, such a step would require \\\"the participation of all the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil without exception. It would also be desirable for other economically and militarily powerful States to reduce their military budgets.\n134.\tWe suggest that the funds made available for economic assistance to the developing countries should, first of all, be granted to those countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America which have experienced great difficulties this year because of grave natural disasters such as drought and floods.\n135.\tThe distribution of these funds should be carried out on an equitable basis. The amounts to be granted to individual countries, and the time-limits within which they are to be provided, could be determined by an international committee appointed on an ad hoc basis from among representatives of the developing countries, the States which are permanent members of the Security Council and other countries which reduce their military budgets.\n136.\tIt is obvious that the reductions in military expenditure would also benefit the States carrying out such reductions. They would be able to channel considerable funds towards the non-military needs of their own people and an improved standard of living.\n137.\tThe United Nations has laid the groundwork for fruitful activities on behalf of peace in a number of important fields.\n138.\tSpecifically, at last year's session, the General Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of the settlement of two major problems: the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVIII], and the question of a World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII].\n139.\tBut has this clearly expressed will of the peoples of the world, this opinion of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations been taken into account by all States? Unfortunately, that cannot be said to be true. It is a known fact that the Governments of some States have taken a position which prevents those decisions from being put into effect.\n140.\tThe Soviet Union believes that the earliest possible implementation of the solemn declaration of the General Assembly, speaking on behalf of the members of the United Nations, concerning their renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, would be an effective means of ensuring that one of the principles of the United Nations Charter was laid down as a law of international life. To that end, a forceful decision in the matter must be taken by the Security Council.\n43. For its part, the Soviet Union is ready to negotiate and to formalize reciprocal undertakings with all -and I stress, all \u2014 the nuclear powers on the non-use of force, including, at the same time, prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.\n44. The time has come to undertake practical preparations for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. Arrangements must finally be made so that the Special Committee provided for in the General Assembly resolution relating to preparations for that Conference can carry out the functions entrusted to it. There is no need to prove how desirable it is for all the nuclear Powers to take part in the Committee's work.\n145.\tThere are some who contend that the World Disarmament Conference could not be productive because of the large number of participants. But who ever said that complex problems must necessarily be settled by two or three States, or that a large-scale international conference will not reach agreement?\n146.\tWe harbour no illusions that the World Disarmament Conference will do away with all problems at one stroke. Let it go on for several months, or even several years. How can there be any objection to that if the Conference makes a contribution to the practical solution of urgent disarmament problems?\n147.\tIt is also argued that the Conference might hamper the efforts at solutions involving a smaller number of States. We feel that such fears are unfounded. Multilateral efforts can only help bilateral ones, and vice versa.\n148.\tAlthough detente and the development of peaceful co-operation are measured, not in decades, but merely in years, into this short period of time there have been compressed events which are significantly changing the face of the world.\n149.\tMemories are still fresh of a time when relations between the Soviet Union and the major capitalist countries were marked by tension and, in the case of some of them, by outright hostility. The fact that those times are now behind us is not welcomed by all. But all who are concerned for peace welcome the fact that those relations are now on a new track.\n150.\tThe Soviet Union and France have been dealing with each other in a consistent and serious manner for a number of years. Both countries have acquired useful experience and are using the favourable trends of detente to develop both their bilateral ties and political co-operation in international matters, and especially European matters. The Soviet Union values that important achievement.\n151.\tThe radical changes achieved by the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in their relations demonstrate that the two States are guided not by considerations of expediency, but by the long-term interests of their peoples and the interests of peace in Europe. A spirit of realism has also prevailed in the approach of the Federal Republic of Germany to questions which had long divided it and the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic. Many obstacles to the establishment of normal relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the other socialist countries of Europe have been removed, although in the Federal Republic of Germany itself, from all indications, such a policy is not to everyone's liking. The influence of forces clinging to old, outworn policies can still be felt there even today.\n152. A few days ago the General Assembly congratulated the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, two independent sovereign States, on their countries' admission to membership in the United Nations. This is one of the most important indications of the changes which are taking place in the world. We warmly welcome the presence in this hall of the delegation of the fraternal German Democratic Republic, and we are also gratified to see here the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n153.\tIt is not difficult to gauge the significance of the historic fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations, pursuant to Security Council recommendations, enthusiastically adopted the decision to admit these two States to membership in the United Nations. That fact shows merely that such a decision was long overdue. It is in keeping not only with the interests of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, but also the interests of all States throughout the world.\n154.\tIn a mere 18 months or two years an enormous distance has been covered in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. As a result of Soviet-American talks at the highest level \u2014 during the visit of President R. Nixon to Moscow in May of last year and the visit of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, to the United States this year \u2014 a firm basis has been laid for the development of relations between the two countries in a way which is fully in keeping with the principle of peaceful coexistence and which opens up vast possibilities. A number of agreements in various fields have been concluded. All these agreements have been made public; they speak for themselves. And they have not remained mere pieces of paper; much work has been done to give them concrete expression.\n155.\tIt is of fundamental importance that the improvement in Soviet-American relations is being achieved on the basis of mutual recognition of the opposition between the two States' social systems and ideologies, and on the understanding that the rapprochement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America is directed against no one and threatens no one's interests.\n156.\tThe Soviet Union is convinced that if both sides unswervingly carry out all the obligations they have assumed, including the strict observance of a cardinal principle in international relations, that of non-interference in each other's internal affairs \u2014 a principle on which our whole approach is based-then Soviet-American relations will be a permanent favourable factor promoting international peace-a point which is of historic significance.\n157.\tRelations between the Soviet Union and Japan are not at a standstill. The Soviet Union intends to continue to work to ensure that these relations become relations of genuine good-neighbourliness and co-operation. That is quite feasible if both countries constantly bear in mind the fundamental long-term interests of peace and security in the Far East.\n158.\tThe Soviet Union is ready to expand its relations of mutually advantageous co-operation with all countries of\nEurope and the other continents which so desire, whether in the search for solutions to current international political problems, wide-ranging economic agreements, joint efforts to use the benefits of scientific and technological progress or the exchange of spiritual values.\n159.\tOn the first day of the present session of the General Assembly the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began. This is a great and unprecedented endeavour. For the first time all European States, together with the United States and Canada have sat down at the same table in order jointly to determine measures that would help to assure the peoples of Europe a peaceful future for as long as can be foreseen.\n160.\tThe Soviet Union views the prospects for the work of the Conference with considerable optimism. Its participants have already to a certain extent found a common language; there are, at least, no differences between them in agreeing that the Conference faces tasks of great importance which will require business-like and constructive consideration. If such an approach prevails to the end, the participants in the Conference will be able to place their contribution to the strengthening of general peace in the scales of history with a sense of satisfaction. That will benefit not only States directly concerned with European affairs, but all peoples of the world.\n161.\tThere is a possibility of achieving a good and, in terms of its potential consequences, even a historic success as a result of the Conference. All that is necessary for this is for all participants to display a responsible and serious approach to the problems before them. Nobody should yield to the temptation to teach others how to manage their internal affairs. It must be admitted that some would like to try to impose their own internal practices on others. No, internal practices, internal laws, represent the line before the threshold of every State at which all others must stop.\n162.\tWere we to embark on a course of imposing our own practices on other countries, whether in the field of economic life or ideology, it is probable that those who are trying to persuade us to adopt the laws .morals and customs of others would disagree. And that is understandable and justified. If States and their representatives to the United Nations tried to act in that way, none of us here would advance one step in important matters and people would, not without justification, draw an analogy between the activity of the United Nations and the Biblical legend of the Tower of Babel, where those involved ceased to understand one another and failed to complete what they had intended to build.\n163.\tMeanwhile, some in the West are not averse to launching noisy propaganda campaigns and even to resorting to the methods of blackmail in order to cover up their own attempts to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Matters have gone so far that they are attempting to arrogate to themselves the right to dictate right and left by whom and how the question of emigration from this or that country should be handled, how many emigrants there should be and when and just where they should go. In doing so, they do not hesitate to praise to the skies those who represent no one but who, whether deliberately or inadvertently, are merely an unwitting weapon in the hands of the forces opposed to the relaxation of tension in the world.\n164.\tThe Soviet Union decisively rejects such an approach and condemns it. We will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs.\n165.\tThe question that inevitably comes to mind is this: do the organizers of these campaigns seriously think that only the Soviet Union, only the socialist countries are interested in international detente and in the development of trade, scientific and technical and other forms of co-operation and that others are merely doing them a great favour by agreeing to hold talks on these matters?\n166.\tAnyone who is interested in the slightest degree in seeing an improvement in the international situation is well aware that this is not the case, that this is a reciprocal process governed by the mutual interests of the parties concerned and, above all, by the interests of the people.\n167.\tThe main thing now is not to let the basic, truly important problems facing States be overshadowed by a poisonous atmosphere deliberately cheated over trumped-up questions.\n168.\tThe Soviet Union considers it desirable to supplement political detente in Europe by military detente. This cause may be served by yet another major undertaking by a number of States: the talks opening on 20 October 1973 on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe.\n169.\tAs a result of the positive changes in the international situation, it is also becoming possible to view the situation in Asia in a new light.\n170.\tIn Asian affairs, as in international affairs in general, the policy of the Soviet Union is a policy directed towards peace, security and co-operation. The Soviet Union extends its hand to any State which shares these goals. A shining example of this is the uninterrupted development of relations between the USSR and India, a great, peace-loving Asian Power. It is further demonstrated by the history of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and many other Asian countries. Our fundamental belief is that there are no problems in relations between the Soviet Union and the States of Asia which could not be solved at the negotiating table.\n171.\tThe Soviet Union is the initiator of the concept of collective security in Asia. This idea is constantly gaining strength; scepticism is being dispelled and the unfounded suspicions are disappearing.\n172.\tIn a recent speech in Alma Ata, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, L. I. Brezhnev, said that we support collective security in Asia because \\\"we are seeking to eliminate war, armed conflicts and imperialist aggression on the continent of Asia; we want the conditions for unhampered development and national revival to be guaranteed every country and people; we want a spirit of trust and\nmutual understanding to prevail in relations between the countries of Asia\\\".\n173.\tThe Soviet Union is in favour of equitable participation in the system of collective security by all Asian countries, without any exception. Any intention of directing collective security in Asia against any State is totally alien to us, despite allegations to the contrary.\n174.\tThe positive changes which have recently become apparent on the Asian continent also include the emergence of new, constructive factors in the situation on the Korean peninsula and this is, first and foremost, to the credit of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That being so, it would be all the more inadmissible for new, artificial obstacles to the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea to be added to the old forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.\n175.\tThere is, of course, no need to recall in detail in this Assembly the consistent support which the Soviet Union has given and continues to give to the developing States of Asia, Africa and Latin America. On more than one occasion the United Nations has been the arena for fierce political battles with colonialism of every kind, and the Soviet Union has always resolutely defended oppressed peoples and given all possible support to their struggle for national liberation.\n176.\tWe are well aware that this is a difficult and grim struggle, and some very recent events remind us yet again that it may take tragic turns.\n177.\tIn Chile, as we know, the lawful Government has been overthrown. The elected President, Salvador Allende, his country's most outstanding patriot, has been killed. The forces of reaction have struck a blow at the Chilean people's desire for true independence and freedom.\n178.\tThere was serious provocation of another Latin American State, Cuba, whose embassy and one of whose ships were fired upon. Surely the heads of the military junta realize that such acts can only be described as international brigandage and acts of aggression?\n179.\tAn anti-Soviet campaign has been stirred up in the country; there are instances of arbitrary and violent action against Soviet institutions and citizens who were sent to give friendly assistance to the Chilean people at the request of the lawful Government of the country.\n180.\tWhat can one say about this? There can be no doubt that history will bring to account those who attempt to prevent the peoples from breathing the air of genuine independence or to drown in blood their right to national freedom.\n181.\tFor its part, the Soviet Government could not remain indifferent to the intolerable situation that was developing and took the decision to break off diplomatic relations with Chile, or, more precisely, with the regime of the military junta.\n182.\tThere is no doubt that the just cause of the Chilean people will triumph in the end, despite the current tragedy.\n183.\tStates which have embarked on the course of political independence have always found and will continue to find in the Soviet Union a friend ready to aid them in consolidating their economic self-sufficiency, to share its knowledge and experience and to assist them in their moments of difficulty. Expansion of co-operation with developing countries is an integral part of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.\n184.\tIt is our conviction that the relaxation of international tension is conducive to a situation where young States can, in peace, devote all their efforts and resources to economic and social progress, to raising the living standards of their people, and to shaping their own future without fear of outside interference.\n185.\tThe healthier the over-all world atmosphere becomes, the more anachronistic are the remaining vestiges of colonialism and the reserves of apartheid and racial discrimination, the stronger is the condemnation they merit and the more vigorous must be the struggle to bring about their complete elimination. It is the clear duty of the United Nations to contribute to the speediest possible elimination of these shameful survivals of colonialism wherever they still exist, be it in Angola or Mozambique, Bissau or Southern Rhodesia, South or South-West Africa.\n186.\tIt is our aim that the voice of the fighters should be clearly heard here, within the walls of the United Nations, that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)] should be fully implemented and that the racists and colonialists should be finally deprived of the opportunity to receive support from outside, in particular from certain Member countries of the United Nations, something which is still a feature of current international life.\n187.\tThose who struggle against colonialism and racism for their national liberation and for their inalienable human rights and dignity enjoy the unwavering support of the Soviet Union. Let there be no doubt that the Soviet Union will continue to do its utmost to ensure that this struggle ends in a decisive victory.\n188.\tIn the struggle for peace, the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are one with the developing States and we value this highly. With some of these countries we have well established relations; with others, relations are only now beginning to develop. But apart from this, the platform of the struggle for further detente offers ever-greater opportunities for co-operation. We believe that the fullest possible advantage should be taken of them.\n189.\tThroughout its history, the United Nations has operated in varying political weather, and so far the fine days have been far fewer than the bad ones. What has enabled it not merely to survive but also to do many useful things? The fact that it was founded for the purpose of maintaining international peace. And this task remains permanently relevant. From another point of view, the United Nations Charter contains adequate provisions for the fulfilment of the Organization's lofty mission. The\nUnited Nations has demonstrated its strength in those cases where the purposes and principles of its Charter have been strictly observed, and its weakness when departures from the Charter have been permitted. What matters is that this world Organization should remain in the mainstream of international politics, contributing to the solution of crucial problems.\n190.\tThis does not in any way imply that the Soviet Union is inclined to neglect even one aspect of the diversified activities of the United Nations, whether of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature. It actively assists in putting into practice everything of value-1 repeat, everything of value \u2014 that the collective wisdom and experience of States can produce.\n191.\tIndeed, a few days ago, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ratified two important international legal instruments pertaining to respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and the protection of human dignity and the interests of society as a whole. These documents were carefully and thoroughly elaborated in United Nations bodies and were subsequently approved by the General Assembly. I am referring to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ibid.]. These two Covenants do not merely contain wishes or recommendations of a declaratory nature, but provide for quite specific obligations on the part of States parties to them. We appeal to countries which have not yet signed or ratified these Covenants to follow our example and to take steps to ensure that they come into force as soon as possible.\n192.\tThe peoples of the world expect from the United Nations measures which will contribute to a further improvement in the international situation. With favourable changes taking place in the world, opportunities are increasing for the United Nations to make its own, major contribution to the consolidation of detente and to making it stable and irreversible.\n193.\tFor its part, the Soviet Union is sparing no effort for the triumph of the cause of peace on earth. This is the essence of its peace-loving policy and its peace programme, launched by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Every State, every statesman can be confident that he will continue to find in the Soviet Union a faithful partner at all times and in all cases where action is taken to prevent the danger of war and contribute to peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs this is the first opportunity which the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has to speak in the general debate of the General Assembly, it is appropriate that at this time I should indicate to other delegations the general principles upon which the foreign relations of the Bahamas shall be conducted in this Assembly and in its associations with other States. The necessity to state these principles briefly will limit what I have to say for the most part to some broad generalizations, but I shall also make some modest suggestions for action by this Assembly in areas which are of particular significance to the Bahamas.\n3.\tA desirable starting point for me is the Preamble to the Independence Constitution of the Bahamas, which came into force on 10 July past and which reads as follows:\n\\\"WHEREAS Four hundred and eighty-one years ago the rediscovery of this Family of Islands, Rocks and Cays heralded the rebirth of the New World,\n\\\"AND WHEREAS the People of this Family of Islands recognize that the preservation of their Freedom will be guaranteed by a national commitment to Self-discipline, Industry, Loyalty, Unity and an abiding respect for Christian values and the Rule of Law;\n\\\"NOWKNOW YE THEREFORE:\n\\\"We the Inheritors of and Successors to this Family of Islands, recognizing the Supremacy of God and believing\nin the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual,\n\\\"DO HEREBY PROCLAIM IN SOLEMN PRAISE the Establishment of a Free and Democratic Sovereign Nation founded on Spiritual Values and in which no Man, Woman or Child shall ever be Slave or Bondsman to anyone or their Labour exploited or their Lives frustrated by deprivation,\n\\\"AND DO HEREBY PROVIDE by these Articles for the indivisible Unity and Creation under God of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.\\\"\nThereafter in the constitutional document are articles which, subject to those which provide for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, make the Constitution the supreme law of the Bahamas. We thereby consciously subjected our national sovereignty to adherence to the concept of the rule of law together with the proposition that:\n\\\".. . the idea of the rule of law must embrace the doctrine that there is a national responsibility to create and maintain the social and economic condition which will give meaning and substance to the idea of equality under law\\\".\n4.\tThroughout the years of colonial administrations, the energies and attention of the Bahamian people, in particular for my generation, were directed to the ultimate goals of majority rule, political and economic self-determination and sovereign independence. One of the by-products of this necessary preoccupation with internal and anti-colonialist politics was that public attention was directed inwardly to internal problems. Matters of external relations were, therefore, relegated to an unimportant position or thought to be irrelevant to what at the time were the most immediate matters of internal politics.\n5.\tAt the same time, however, there were external forces at work which were compressing the whole world into closer affinity and interdependence. A companion in growth and progress to our evolutionary advance to sovereign independence has been the remarkable change which has taken place during the past decade in communication and transportation facilities. Hence it is possible for words spoken here to be heard, and the speaker here to be seen, instantaneously anywhere in the world. It is also now possible to fly today from our capital city of Nassau to New York in 2 hours and 45 minutes, to Frankfurt in 9 hours or to Sydney in 25 hours.\n6.\tTherefore, ever since 1964 when the first comprehensive written Constitution came into effect in the\nBahamas and ultimate independence was assured, we have begun to look outward upon a world which was being shrunk by technology and which was being brought closer to us and to which we began to look with eager expectation. Indeed, this is evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of the Bahamas came into existence four years before independence and the 1969 Constitution which we had gave a wide measure of responsibility in foreign affairs to the Bahamas Government. Thereafter, the Bahamas began consciously to turn its attention outward and to recognize that there was a place for it in the world which its necessity to prosper and survive demanded be filled.\n7.\tIt was therefore inevitable and a matter of course that the Bahamas, after independence, directed its attention to membership in the United Nations. It is not for the love of platitudes or a craving for fine words that in the Bahamas we take seriously the words of the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations which reads in part:\n\\\"WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. .. and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\n\\\"AND FOR THESE ENDS to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security ...\\\".\n8.\tThe Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a new Member of this Organization. We have, none the less, observed the attempts which have been made by this body towards the realization of its purposes and principles as expressed in the Charter, to which all of us Members subscribe. The Charter imposes upon the members of this Assembly the enormous task of providing for the world conditions conducive to the betterment of the welfare of all mankind. This was the spirit in which the Charter founders drafted its constitution. This, similarly, must be the current resolve of its Member nations.\n9.\tWe in the Bahamas have not been unmindful of the fact' that in its 28 years the United Nations has experienced both failures and successes, and notwithstanding the view which is apparently held by some and is born of frustration, I do not believe, as I have read expressed in a leading national journal of a Member State recently, that \\\"... the sad, even bitter truth is that the United Nations is no longer in the mainstream of world politics\\\".\n10.\tIt may very well be that the enormous capacity of all kinds which exists within the States legitimately categorized as super-Powers has dwarfed the necessities of the other Members of the United Nations, but it is presumptuous to assume that the course of the super-Powers from time to time constitutes the mainstream of world politics. However, this would be the case if all the members of the Assembly passively allowed this to be so. Be that as it may, the aspirations of our people are no less real or immediate than those of the big nations and the demands made upon its leaders no less compelling.\n11.\tMy Government has a responsibility to the Bahamas to make its proper contribution to the collective efforts to the United Nations to create an harmoniously ordered world society; to create an internationally recognized rule of law which will guarantee the territorial integrity of States; to sustain a level of economic growth which will provide a continuingly increasing standard of living, education and social services for its people; and to assist in creating a system of human values and of morality which will create a climate of existence for mankind to enable it to enjoy and fulfil itself in peace.\n12.\tBut endless debate and tired cliches do not at all provide the machinery that will assist in finding solutions to some of the problems that now face us. These solutions ought not to depend on the interrelations between the sources of physical power and the location of authority, but rather upon the centralization of power and authority here as is envisaged by the Charter. Otherwise the pursuit of international peace and security will remain the province of a privileged few, and the credibility gap between the rhetoric of world international order and the realities inherent in the pursuit of the national interest of the few will become even wider.\n13.\tThe urgent work of the United Nations, made more urgent by the total interdependence of States in the world, has significance and meaning for us in the Bahamas as it does for every other Member State. World problems and their effect have no national boundaries. The unresolved Middle East problems may seem remote and irrelevant to the Bahamas, but they are not. The Bahamas has no natural source of economically exploitable energy, and the frustrating lack of a peaceful settlement in the Middle .East which propels rising prices of oil in the world has its effect on the cost of fuel, the cost of electricity, the cost of living in the Bahamas and ultimately the standard of living of its people. So we say there must be solutions found there.\n14.\tThe Bahamas is an archipelagic State, so located in the North Atlantic that heavily trafficked commercial shipping lanes pass through the archipelago. In the south-eastern Bahamas, the Crooked Island and Mira Por Vos passages exist for shipping to and from ports in the Caribbean and Central America, and to and from the United States of America and Canadian ports; in the north-west Bahamas, the Northeast and Northwest Providence channels are the shipping lanes through which pass practically all the commercial traffic between the Gulf of Mexico and Europe. The Bahamas has little known mineral resources, but has developed a successful resort industry and is in the process of diversifying the economy as rapidly as possible. We are aware, nevertheless, of the dangers to our ecology and resort-island facilities to which we are subjected by the large numbers of ships of all kinds which traffic through our waters. My Government is therefore conscious of the importance to the Bahamas of early international agreement on matters of territorial jurisdiction within the boundaries of our archipelago, on matters of territorial jurisdiction around the boundaries of our-archipelago, the limits of economic exploitation within and around the boundaries of our archipelago, pollution of our archipelago, rights of passage through our archipelago, and conservation and other related matters, all of which will affect the continued use of the sea lanes through the archipelago. All matters pertaining to international agreement on the law of the sea are therefore extremely relevant to the Bahamas.\n15.\tWe welcome the attempts which so far have been made to secure for archipelagic States a just and equitable regime pertaining to the sea and sea-bed around and within them, as this concept constitutes not only a means of protection of the economic resources and safeguards against pollution, but also acts to ensure the psychological, political and social unification of the whole group of islands.\n16.\tThe Bahamas is a major importer of food. Everything in the world, therefore, which is relevant to the supply of food and its cost is relevant to the Bahamas. Any action taken by this body which is calculated to increase food production, provide adequate conservation methods and improve the techniques of production will receive the active support of our delegation.\n17.\tThe world of yesterday was. divided and measured by colour, by race, by religious beliefs and by ideological persuasion. The world today is additionally divided by the developed and the under-developed, the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. The Bahamas is legitimately categorized as a small nation and as such requires a very unique combination of ingredients to create a successful nation State out of scattered islands: but small nations can be made into viable economic entities with the help of the technological expertise available in the world which can provide all the answers to successful development. The successful development of all under-developed countries can therefore be achieved provided that the developed countries are prepared to commit themselves to the task in co-operation with one another, not competitively, and without expectation of reward in any ideological conflict. The Bahamas would be a willing participant in the promotion of any United Nations economic development programme calculated to redress the balance between the developed and the under-developed undertaken in a spirit of universal co-operation.\n18.\tI have made reference to these few matters, by way of example only, to illustrate my proposition of the total interdependence of all nations in the world upon others, a fact which appears, sometimes, to be overlooked in the international contests of the national self-interests of big and powerful States, which interests, I believe, history will one day judge to have been some very narrow self-interests indeed. Practised as it has been by the big nations, it is little wonder that this contest of self-interest appears to have caused some lack of spirit and frustration here.\n19.\tIn this connexion, I have to say that, notwithstanding the fears which have been expressed with regard to the present dialogue between the super-Powers and the detente said to exist between them, I do not share those fears. Implicit in the normalization of relations between the great Powers is their desire that there be no necessity for the world to be divided into contesting blocs of nations. We must, so far as we are able, accept that implication in this detente and believe that they mean what they say, and believe that they know how the people of the world will interpret their actions. Taken as it appears to be, is it not right that we may conclude that the super-Powers have agreed that the world has changed, that competitions between ideologies can lead only to armed conflict, that different economic systems can survive together harmoniously and that the world can now look forward to a new order of international order and justice led by them in this place?\n20.\tOver the 28 years of the life of this Organization we have witnessed the development of two super-Powers, the Republic of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In very recent times, we have seen wondrous signs of dramatic changes in East-West relationships evidenced, first, by the arrival, acceptance and seating here of the People's Republic of China and secondly, less than two weeks ago, by the admission to membership here of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the next decade or two we may come to see a United States of Europe comprising what is now the enlarged European Economic Community and in that time a United States of Europe and a People's Republic of China may themselves realize their full potential to become super-Powers.\n21.\tIn that event, and particularly if the detente fails to fulfil our hopes and dreams, it may become necessary to think again whether in the interests of international peace and understanding the Headquarters of our Organization should be located within the territorial jurisdiction of a super-Power, or whether it might more properly be located in a small but beautiful Member State which has no pretensions to power but which has many attributes for the congenial settlement of international disputes.\n22.\tOur delegation will be authorized to offer, at any time the question may arise, one of the 700 islands of the Bahamas as an ideal compromise location for any future Headquarters of the United Nations or any one or more of its agencies.\n23.\tI belong to a young country which is full of young people, not unlike young people of every other State represented here; young people who have become impatient with inconsistencies, indifferent to the claims of competing ideologies and to the cynicism of the old. It appears to many of the young of the world that the promise of 28 years ago has been too long frustrated by narrow prejudices and calculated self-interest and a failure to adhere to the clear intentions of the United Nations Charter.\n24.\tPrior to independence, there was a small minority in the Bahamas which sought to dismember one island from the nation; but majority rule and self-determination prevailed in the end and the movement failed. So we can view with compassion now two Germanys, two Koreas and two Viet-Nams. However, ideological conflicts imposed upon a people can never divide it for ever, no more than the mind of man can ever be separated from its will to exercise its sovereign identity and freedom.\n25.\tDo representatives believe that the world's youth are unaware of the fact that the United Nations has been unable to suppress the use of unlawful force; that narrow disputes go unsettled because super-Powers have been unable to agree; that interference with constitutionally elected Governments is overlooked; or that racism, in its most virulent form, is permitted to persist in southern Africa? Neither history nor succeeding generations will look with compassion upon a people that appeared to act without the guidance of morality or the rule of law.\n26.\tThe hope of the generation to which I belong, and that of those younger than I, is for the preservation of a world order subject to the machinery of the United Nations, not by the so-called real-politik of super-Powers which are able to juggle the sovereignty of smaller nations. I am, however, not so Utopian as to believe that it is totally within our competence and not within the competence of the great Powers to make this hope a reality.\n27.\tIf the United Nations, this world parliament, is to have immediate meaning and significance, if the conflicting claims of morality and power are to be reconciled, that can be accomplished only by the collective and concerted effort of the great Powers, each one of which, like the rest of us, has given solemn accord to the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n28.\tWe have the means to give new hope to mankind, to create a stable international order dominated by total and absolute political and economic self-determination and human and moral values which make human beings paramount, not things or abstractions.\n29.\tIn all such ways as are available to us, the Bahamas delegation will be committed to making the hope of the young and the world a reality in our lifetime. To that end, we shall actively support action by this body that will: first, create machinery to enable the United Nations to resolve all existing territorial boundary matters which now remain unresolved and thereafter to guarantee the inviolability of those fixed physical boundaries, making it an offence against international law to acquire or dismember a State by force; second, create a permanent peace-keeping force to enable this body to enforce the guarantees of territorial integrity which will be afforded to every State; third, actively promote the further development of the developing and under-developed world by a massive development programme sponsored by the active participation of the two super-Powers in particular, acting not in ideological competition but in universal concert, so that no State in the world need be made subject or bondsman to any ideology and every State may enjoy real self-determination, free to pursue its own best internal policies; no nation need thereafter be subject to the hegemony of any other State, and the world may be freed from the confining limitations and conflicting pressures implicit in competing economic systems; fourth, remove the last remnants of colonialism from the world, in particular from southern Africa, and all forms of foreign domination of the small by the big; fifth, build upon the detente between the great Powers to create the climate for positive and active co-operation by them in proving to the world that peace is merely the means by which national boundaries may be transcended and a world order created with their collective co-operative leadership, by which their unlimited technological skills may be applied in the equitable distribution of the wealth of the earth and the seas; sixth, accomplish the international renunciation of ideological conflict, competition between economic systems, religious bigotry and racism in all its subtle forms.\n30.\tThe delegation of the Bahamas is committed to serve those ends. Some, perhaps, are Utopian, but all are capable of attainment provided that we all have the collective will.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff272.\tMr. President, allow me, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country, who is unable to be present, to convey to you, over and above the traditional congratulations, the satisfaction of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea on the occasion of your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of our General Assembly. These congratulations are extended also to each of the members of the General Committee, who have made themselves worthy of the confidence of our august Assembly.\n273.\tI should like also to discharge a pleasant duty, namely, to pay a deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, and to tell him how greatly we appreciated the tact, courtesy and competence with which he conducted the work of the twenty-seventh session, of the General Assembly.\n274.\tYour election to the presidency of this twenty-eighth session appears to us like a definite guarantee of the lucid conduct of our work towards the adoption of decisions in favour of the liberation of peoples, towards justice and equality among all peoples, that are the necessary conditions for peace and security.\n275.\tYou are a Latin American. It is, therefore, obvious that your love of the rights of peoples cannot be questioned. Child of the third world, you are inevitably sensitive, for more than one reason, to the many ills afflicting countries that are victims of the manoeuvres of the rich States. Thanks to the enormous experience you have acquired in the course of your diplomatic career, you are perfectly aware of the problems which paralyse our Organization, thus making peace and security precarious.\n\n276.\tThe readiness of States to subscribe to the principles of mutual understanding is an important element if we are to ensure international security and durable peace on our planet. The task that devolves on us is therefore that of uniting our efforts so as to work for the advent of a world in which the negative forces of hatred and domination will yield to those of entente and fraternity among peoples.\n277.\tThe fortunate changes that have taken place in the concept of relations between States indicate that we have reached a turning point, a concrete turning point, represented by a series of treaties and agreements one of whose most tangible results is the recent decision of the General Assembly to receive into our Organization the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend a welcome to these friendly States which, we are convinced, will make an important and valuable contribution to the cause of peace.\n278.\tThe problem of international peace and security, the defence of national sovereignties, decolonialization and the struggle against imperialism continue to be the focus of both bilateral and multilateral meetings. The dialogue between the great Powers appears to forecast the triumph of freedom, justice and equality among peoples, the essential basis for peace on our earth. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held recently in Algiers, has shown without the slightest doubt the resolute will affirmed by 2,000 million underprivileged men to upset the scale of accepted values and to give our universe greater social balance and its people greater hope and certainty.\n279.\tUnfortunately, international peace and security have but a partial meaning for some members of our universal community. In fact, the peace of which they speak is rather that of the hateful order that they impose on other peoples, and security to them is the security of the illegitimate privileges they enjoy at the expense of other nations.\n280.\tIs it possible for a single moment to bring an era of total peace and security throughout the world without first eradicating the causes of tension that beset Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America? It is no longer a secret to anyone that the number one enemy of the order that our Organization has undertaken to create is still imperialism and all its present manifestations, such as colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism, etc.\n281.\tAs everyone is aware, the Republic of Guinea, my country, has suffered and still suffers from the effects of imperialism which, since 28 September 1958, has hounded us for the simple reason that we have chosen the path of full responsibility. Imperialism does everything to jeopardize the sovereignty of our country. To achieve its regrettable objectives, it has allied itself with Portuguese colonial fascism, the most abject colonialism. And we understand that the fascist Government of Caetano, despite his ringing defeat on 22 December 1970 by the brave and proud people of Guinea and his condemnation by the Security Council, does not cease to indulge in acts of provocation against the peaceful Guinean population.\n282.\tPortuguese military aircraft constantly violate our air space. Every time the Portuguese troops suffer severe setbacks at the hands of freedom fighters in Guinea-Bissau, they bomb our frontier villages on the fallacious pretext of reprisals or the right of hot pursuit. Mercenaries of all kinds, paid killers trained and released by Portugal, infiltrate regularly across our frontiers for purposes of aggression.\n\n283.\tIn its implacable determination to destroy the revolutionary regime that the proud people of Guinea has chosen freely for itself, Portugal and its allies intensify the training of mercenaries in the occupied Territories of the new independent State of Guinea-Bissau and in some of the neighbouring Slates, thus preparing a new armed aggression against our people. But, regardless of the means used by international imperialism, the people of Guinea, more than ever determined and united behind its great President, Ahmed Sekou Toure, will triumph, as it did .on 22 November 1970, over the forces of domination and will continue to defend its gains and to give unreserved support to the liberation movements in order to speed up the emancipation of the African fatherland and thus to contribute to ensuring the reign of international peace and security.\n284.\tI should like, moreover, to emphasize that \u2014 like all the independent States of Africa and, generally speaking, all the countries in the world \u2014 the people of Guinea aspire profoundly to peace so that they can effectively devote themselves to the exalting task of building up their country. It is for this reason that they demand of international imperialism and its allies and, in particular, some of the neighbouring States of the Republic of Guinea that they recognize this sacred and inalienable right to peace and tranquillity \u2014 indispensable factors of peaceful coexistence.\n285.\tMy delegation wishes to emphasize the ludicrousness of the claim of the Lisbon authorities that the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique are provinces and a prolongation of Portugal. In those African Territories, there still waves the flag of that country which is not linked to Africa either by geography or by culture, or less still by a common history.\n286.\tThroughout his intervention during the present session of the General Assembly the \\\"worthy representative\\\", \\\"the accredited spokesman of Portugal\\\", Mr. Patricio, was so bold, with the audacity of which he alone is capable, as to uphold theories of assimilation, such as \\\"the legitimacy of Portugal as an African nation\\\" [2138th meeting, para. 146) and many other absurdities as well.\n287.\tNo living person can accept that grotesque assertion, and, if Bissau is called Conakry 2, Lisbon, built up thanks to the wealth of Bissau, will soon be called Conakry.\n288.\tIn his confusion, Mr. Patricio attacks the socialist countries, the Scandinavian countries, OAU and how many\nmore? We must agree that the world shrinks dangerously under the paltry views of Portugal.\n289.\tIllustrating the full dimension of the imperialist- colonialist-fascist hysteria of Portugal, Mario Soares writes:\n\\\"... In fact, the only specific feature of Portuguese colonialism in comparison with other European colonialisms derives essentially from the financial and mental poverty of the settlers and the economic underdevelopment of the metropolitan country, which itself is a colony of the great Powers.\\\" \n290.\tIn fact, the decisive element of Portugal, its chemical property, is extra-Lusitanian. One need not be an expert in political affairs to realize that that unfortunate country, because of the mediocrity of its economic and military potential, stubbornly clings to its policy only because it knows it enjoys the complicity of NATO, whose member countries flout and disdain the resolutions adopted in favour of the African peoples.\n291.\tConvinced that the cause it pursues is irreparably doomed, the Government of criminal Caetano pursues a policy of systematic destruction, of Fascist genocide, against the peaceful civilian populations of Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verde Islands, Angola and Mozambique. Is there any need to recall in this connexion the savage massacre of over 400 Africans in the village of Wiriyamu in the Mozambican province of Tete, which aroused profound indignation and the condemnation of world public opinion.\n292.\tDefeated everywhere in the field by the revolutionary forces, the regime in Lisbon resorts at present to the physical liquidation of the authentic representatives of the African peoples. As if to qualify itself in that hateful undertaking and believing it can put an end definitely to the heroic resistance of the nationalists in Guinea-Bissau, Portuguese imperialism, on 20 January 1973, in Conakry, had our comrade Amilcar Cabral, the great freedom fighter and founder and Secretary-General of PAIGC,  cowardly\n,, assassinated by mercenaries who had infiltrated into the area.\n293.\tThe courageous people of Guinea-Bissau gave to that insolent challenge the resounding and obvious reply by proclaiming victoriously on 24 September 1973 the People's Democratic Republic of Guinea-Bissau. Our delegation applauds that historic decision enthusiastically and rejoices at the fact that our Government was the first to recognize the young independent and sovereign State. The independence of Guinea-Bissau is the triumph of reason over brute force, the victory of freedom over colonialism, the prelude to a process that will infallibly lead to the liquidation of colonialism in Africa.\n294.\tIn the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau, the people, guided by PAIGC under the enlightened leadership of its founder and No. 1 militant, Amilcar Cabral, has, in the course of 17 years of political and armed struggle, constructed a new life and now possesses a constantly evolving administrative organization, social and cultural services, a\njudicial system, a steadily developing economy and national armed forces.\n295.\tThe visit of a United Nations Special Mission to the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau from 2 to 8 April 1972 served to confirm to the international community what has been attested to by dozens of impartial, honest observers from every continent: the self-determination of our people and the de facto existence of an efficiently functioning State structure.\n296.\tIn flagrant violation of modern international law, the Portuguese colonialists are still encroaching upon some portions of our national territory. The United Nations has repeatedly recognized the illegality of the Portuguese presence, the inalienable right of our people to freedom and sovereignty, and the legitimacy of its struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\n297.\tOn the basis of the historic resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council have reaffirmed the inalienable right of our people to self- determination and independence, particularly in General Assembly resolution 2918 (XXVII) of 14 November 1972 and Security Council resolution 322 (1972) of 22 November 1972. Furthermore, on the proposal of the Special Committee on decolonization, the Fourth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly at its twenty-seventh session recognized PAIGC, the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, as the only and authentic representative of the people of that Territory.\n298.\tThe People's National Assembly, which is the result of PAIGC's successes in the fight against Portuguese colonialism, was constituted on the basis of the principle that power derives from the people and should serve the people. The Assembly is composed of representatives elected by universal and direct suffrage by secret ballot, being the expression of the sovereign will of the people of Guinea-Bissau.\n299.\tAt its meeting of 24 September 1973 in the Boe region, the People's National Assembly, expressing the sovereign will of the people, solemnly proclaimed the State of Guinea-Bissau. In that proclamation, the People's National Assembly declared, inter alia:\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau is a sovereign, republican, democratic, anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist State whose primary objectives are the complete liberation of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and the forging of a union between those two territories for the purpose of building a strong African homeland dedicated to progress. The arrangements for this union will be determined, after these two territories are liberated, in accordance with the will of the people.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes the sacred duty of taking action to expedite, by every means, the expulsion of the forces of aggression of Portuguese colonialism from that part of the territory of Guinea- Bissau which they still occupy and to intensify the struggle in the Cape Verde Islands, which form an\nintegral and inalienable part of the national territory of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau regards the strengthening of the links of solidarity and soldierly brotherhood between our people and all peoples of the Portuguese colonies as one of the fundamental principles of its foreign policy; it stands in solidarity with the peoples struggling for their freedom and independence in Africa, Asia and Latin America and with all Arab peoples fighting against zionism.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau is an integral part of Africa and strives for the unity of the African peoples, respecting the freedom of those peoples, their dignity and their right to political, economic, social and cultural progress.\n\\\"As regards international relations, the State of Guinea-Bissau wishes to maintain and develop ties of friendship, co-operation and solidarity with its neighbours \u2014 the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Senegal \u2014 with all independent African States and with all States throughout the world which recognize its sovereignty and support the national liberation struggle of our people. These relations shall be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs and mutual advantage.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes responsibility for promoting the economic advancement of the country, thereby creating the material basis for the development of culture, science and technology, with a view to the continuing improvement of the social and economic living standards of our population and with the ultimate aim of achieving a life of peace, well-being and progress for all our country's children.\n\\\"Having as a foundation our heroic People's National Liberation Army, the State of Guinea-Bissau will provide our national armed forces with all necessary means to accomplish the task of bringing about the complete liberation of our country, and defending the achievements of our people and the integrity of our national territory.\n\\\"From the historic moment of the proclamation of the State of Guinea-Bissau, authorities and organs of the Portuguese colonial State which exercise any political, military or administrative authority in our territory are illegal, and their acts are null and void. Consequently, from that moment on, the Portuguese State has no right to assume any obligations or commitments in relation to our country. All treaties, conventions, agreements, alliances and concessions involving our country which were entered into in the past by the Portuguese colonialists will be submitted to the People's National Assembly, the supreme embodiment of State power, which will proceed to review them in accordance with the interests of our peoples.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau affirms the principle that it is fighting against Portuguese colonialism and not against the Portuguese people, with which our people wishes to maintain a friendly and co-operative relationship.\n\\\"The State of Guinea-Bissau adheres to the principles of non-alignment. It supports the settlement of international disputes by negotiation and, to that effect and in accordance with the resolutions of the highest international organs, it declares its willingness to negotiate a solution which will put an end to the aggression of the Portuguese colonial Government that is illegally occupying part of our national territory and committing acts of genocide against our populations.\\\"\n300.\tWe are happy to see the great sympathy with which most of the delegations attending this twenty-eighth session have welcomed the proclamation of independence by Guinea-Bissau, and we address a pressing appeal to all Governments to recognize the new State and to grant it effective and unreserved support, thus enabling it shortly to occupy its rightful place in the international community and in the specialized agencies of the United Nations.\n301.\tDespite the strong reaction of independent Africa, supported by its friends, against the appropriation by certain imperialist Powers of the enormous natural resources of the Territories under Portuguese domination, the Cabora Bassa and Cunene projects continue to receive Western capital which the criminal protagonists describe fallaciously as beneficial investments.\n302.\tMy delegation believes that we must draw other conclusions from the recognition of the liberation movements by our Organization as the true representatives of their territories, conclusions that must be more in keeping with the will and aspirations of the peoples concerned, who are fighting so courageously for their freedom, independence and the sovereignty of their countries. In this context the presence of Portugal in these Territories is an unbearable aggression, a criminal aggression that must be punished as such. For this reason my delegation requests the inclusion of a new item on the agenda, to be entitled \\\"Criminal aggression by Portugal against the sovereign State of Guinea-Bissau and the illegal occupation of certain parts of its national territory\\\".\n303.\tFor us, independence means the exercise of national sovereignty by the people. It is also, and above all, a protest against injustices and all the causes of injustice and insecurity that daily endanger peace and human lives. It is the inauguration of a world of peace and happiness that our people cry out for with all their strength.\n304.\tIn southern Africa the illegal regime of Ian Smith is joining in a common cause with the racists of Pretoria and Portugal to exacerbate to the point of paroxism, racial hatred and methods of repression. Threats, brutalities, arbitrary imprisonments, murder in cold blood have become the lot of the freedom fighters in that part of the world. In the face of this tragedy, which is reminiscent of the age of primitive hordes, my delegation continues to maintain that so long as Great Britain, the administering Power, does not satisfy the just claims of the people of Zimbabwe, who ask for the convening of a constitutional conference based on the principle \\\"one man, one vote\\\", that country remains fully responsible.\n305.\tI should like on behalf of my delegation at this point to pay a solemn tribute to the heroism of the militant people of the sister Republic of Zambia in the face of the numerous provocations of the imperialist oligarchies that are interlinked in southern Africa. The colonialist and racist regimes of southern Africa, powerless to stem the flow of the struggle for liberation, are now compelled to resort to other means. It is within that context that we must place the aggression and economic blackmail of the rebel Ian Smith against Zambia, which so victoriously took up the challenge.\n306.\tIndependent Africa, through its continental organization, OAU, has sufficiently highlighted and stigmatized the strengthening of the aggressiveness of the colonialists and racists by reason of the assistance they receive from their allies in the Western camp. Despite the determined sanctions of the international community, the economy of the partisans of segregation prospers still further and the armaments of the oppressors become more and more modern.\n307.\tThe Government of South Africa, despite the general condemnation of conscious and responsible mankind, continues to maintain our brothers under the heinous system of apartheid. The policy of the creation of \\\"Bantustans\\\" and the various forms of segregation remain the daily practice in South Africa. For Vorster and his clique the black man \u2014  unfortunately, we must say this \u2014 is no different from an animal, since according to that backward and insolent philosophy all those belonging to that race have no soul and no conscience and deserve none of the rights required for the happiness and dignity of our fellow men.\n308.\tThe almost unanimous position taken by the members of the General Assembly against the right to speak of the delegation of the white minority of South Africa was an eloquent manifestation of the condemnation of Vorster's policy of apartheid. In our view, that manifestation is but one stage in the struggle embarked upon by Africa, whose\nobjective is the occupation of the seat of South Africa by the authentic representatives of that part of the world.\n309.\tOn 4 February 1972, at its memorable meetings in Addis Ababa, the Security Council adopted its resolution 309 (1972), relating to Namibia. The events that have taken place since then have in no way changed the reactionary position of South Africa in Namibia. With obdurate cynicism they have opposed the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to find an equitable and peaceful solution. After the failure of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, after the unanimous rejection by the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, and in the light of the results of the recent referendum held in that Territory, my delegation believes that the United Nations should envisage the possibility of taking other concrete steps in order that the people of Namibia may as soon as possible accede to independence and national sovereignty.\n310.\tAlthough the explosive situation obtaining in southern Africa is of the highest concern to us, we cannot pass over in silence the existence of other equally important\n. colonialist bastions in the continent: so-called French\nSomaliland, the Comoro islands, so-called Spanish Sahara, the Seychelles islands, and so forth.\n311.\tThe period of colonial domination is finished forever. All peoples without distinction must unconditionally enjoy their freedom.\n312.\tMy delegation feels that, if our Organization is to live up to the commitments proclaimed and accepted since San Francisco, it must use all the means at its disposal to defeat the forces that oppose the realization of its noble ideals.\n313.\tI should like now to turn to another problem which remains one of the constant preoccupations of our Organization \u2014 the Zionist aggression in the Middle East.\n314.\tBy creating out of nowhere the State of Israel, the United Nations has fanned the flames of a vast fire which it can no longer contain and which has acquired disquieting proportions.\n315.\tIsrael arbitrarily occupies by mere virtue of military power the territory of the brave Palestinian people, and this situation has lasted for 25 years. For 25 years, the Palestinian people chased from their fatherland have lived the errant life imposed on them by the Zionists.\n316.\tDespite repeated condemnation from the forces of peace throughout the world and the many resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, Israel has since June 1967 been occupying the territory of the Arab republics of Egypt and Syria.\n317.\tSupported by a most powerful ally, it arrogantly defied the whole of the international community. To the peace efforts of Africa and the Arab States it has always responded with contempt and arrogance.\n318.\tInevitably, that state of affairs led to the events of 6 October. Thus, with rarely equalled violence, there broke out the vast conflict latent since June 1967.\n319.\tOnce again the Middle East is at war. On 9 October, with indignation and consternation, the world learned of the bombing of Damascus, which led to the deaths of many civilian victims, among them diplomats and United Nations officials.\n320. The Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria must recover their usurped territory. Peace in the Middle East must be achieved at that price.\n321.\tOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of Guinea, I wish to reiterate to the peoples and Governments of the Arab States, and in particular to Egypt and Syria, the complete solidarity and unreserved support of the people and Government of my country for their just struggle against the Israeli invader.\n322.\tInternational imperialism has created other hotbeds of tension which it continues to maintain despite international disapproval.\n323.\tThe peace efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the reunification of its country still encounter numerous obstacles and a climate of continued tension maintained by the presence in South Korea of foreign troops.\n324.\tThus it is essential to hold as soon as possible a conference which would bring together representatives of all the population of the two Koreas to discuss problems concerning the future of the Korean fatherland. That is why my delegation opposes the premature admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations, which would sanction the definitive division of that country.\n325.\tBy withdrawing its armed forces and by ensuring scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of those States, the United Nations must help Korea recover its national unity.\n326.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held from 5 to 9 September in Algiers, symbolized the resistance of oppressed peoples and was extremely well attended. The success of its work opened a new era in the history of the third world.\n327.\tBut, although we carefully follow those positive changes in the international situation, especially in the relations between the great Powers, the struggle of all the peaceful forces for the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and co-operation still meets with the active resistance of those that are in favour of war. Some of the great Powers, in order to create zones of influence for themselves, trample underfoot the elementary rights of peoples. The case of the Indo-Chinese peninsula is a typical example of this.\n328.\tMy delegation expresses its sincere concern at the recrudescence of military action in that region and invites the international community to use its good offices so that a just peace may be established in that part of South-East Asia.\n329.\tThe Republic of Guinea, which from the very first hours recognized the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by His Majesty Prince Norodom Sihanouk, sincerely hopes that the United Nations will understand the legitimate aspirations of the Khmer people to manage their own affairs.\n330.\tIn Algiers the large majority of non-aligned countries gave their firm support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in its struggle for true independence.\n331.\tThe universality of the United Nations, which is one of the essential prerequisites for the achievement of the purposes and objectives of the San Francisco Charter, demands that all peoples make their contribution to the solution of the problems affecting mankind. Yet we note with regret the absence of the representatives of Viet-Nam, Korea, Palestine, the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and of all the liberation movements which we recognized in 1972 as being the only legitimate representatives of their territories. The presence here of certain men who represent only themselves, of usurpers of power, of oppressors of peoples, is an affront and causes us indignation.\n332.\tAmong the Powers that arrogate to themselves the right unilaterally to discuss serious questions affecting mankind, we find precisely those that are responsible for the problems besetting world security. This is a paradox! It is inconceivable because it is contrary to logic that one should be both the judge and the accused.\n333.\tIf our Organization wishes to fulfil its historic and sacred mission, namely, to save present and succeeding- generations from the scourge of war, if our Organization wishes to establish international peace and security that are real and complete, it must eliminate the causes of war and tension, and eradicate from international relations the spirit of political domination and economic injustice. To do so we must break with Byzantine discussions and resolutely search for appropriate ways and means to ensure respect for the spirit of our Charter.\n334.\tWe must proclaim as crimes against humanity any acts that run counter to the advent of a just and durable peace and we must all take a stand against acts that are contrary to morality, peace and security in the world. The struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid, zionism and all forms of aggression fall within this context and must be collectively supported by the United Nations because these phenomena are contrary to the principles upheld by our Organization. The internationalization of that struggle would enable our Organization to mobilize all its material, financial and military resources on behalf of the liberation forces. Thus we would show the peoples of the world that the United Nations strives to achieve the realization of their most fundamental and sacred aspirations.\n335.\tWe cannot, of course, achieve such results unless we revise the San Francisco Charter and adapt it to the new needs of our peoples. It goes without saying that the revision of the United Nations Charter and the strengthening of the structures of our international Organization demand greater democracy and equality among the Members, and that will be possible only if an end is put to the privileges given exclusively to some Powers. We must abolish the status of permanent member of the Security Council; we must abrogate the right of veto.\n336.\tThe main weakness of our Organization is due to the fact that only five of its Members, through the right of veto, hold in their hands the key to the solution of world problems.\n337.\tThis state of affairs is no longer in keeping with the realities of our century and constitutes a flagrant violation of the principle of democracy and a grave violation of the dignity of the large majority of the countries represented in this Assembly.\n338.\tOf all the international problems that polarize world public opinion, disarmament is unquestionably both the oldest and the most topical, because it is the one that has achieved the least possible progress. One speaks of it more as hobby than through real conviction. It goes without saying that there is still a game of hide and seek. The medium-sized and small States, when they bring up the question of disarmament, still have in mind the fact that infallibly they will come up against the resistance of the great Powers and thus will not succeed. As for the great Powers themselves, they have always subscribed to resolutions by which they have not felt themselves bound.\n339.\tThis year will mark the convening of the first session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose second session the General Assembly has scheduled to take place in 1974 [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)]. We attach to that Conference the importance that it deserves. We hope that in its deliberations it will duly take into account the demands of the developing world and its security needs. The need to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of my country, which is one of the main targets of imperialism, has led us to extend the limits of our territorial waters to 200 nautical miles. The importance that we attach to the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea is explained by our constant desire for the speedy codification of certain rules and conditions whose adaptation to present realities is indispensable.\n340.\tThe Conference can and should be held as planned. However, by reason of the explosive situation at present prevailing in Chile, it would be desirable for the Conference to be held elsewhere. In that connexion, my delegation suggests that we reconsider paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 3029 A (XXVII), according to which it was decided to hold the second session of that Conference in Santiago.\n341.\tThe people of Guinea has followed with deep emotion the painful events which last month brought sorrow to the friendly Republic of Chile. Our delegation expresses its deep sympathy to the valiant people of Chile, which has remained faithful to the revolutionary ideals of President Salvador Allende.\n342.\tIn the world today, the contradictions that we find in Africa in its relations with the outside world result from the fact that the African economy is still exploited or dependent on outside countries. It is beset by increasing disparities between the prices of our primary commodities and those of the goods sold to us from outside Africa. The terms of trade bring new concern each day to our peoples, whose creative efforts are annihilated by a system that always tends to aggravate the living conditions of the producers in our continent. Therefore we must take a decision as early as possible to lay the foundation of an economic policy that reflects our determination to achieve the decolonization of our continent and ensure effective solidarity for our peoples in this area.\n343.\tIt was because of a desire to defend these interests that the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and G6vernment of the OAU in Addis Ababa adopted the African declaration on economic co-operation, development and independence.\n344.\tThe sincere co-operation that we wish to obtain from the developed countries must, come even more from the United Nations, in which we place our confidence. In fact we note that often the loans it grants through its bodies increase our debts rather than help us. Often over half the sum allocated to projects in our countries is used for endless studies and for the travel expenses of experts. Finally, when the projects have no more funds, they are merely abandoned.\n345.\tI should not wish to end this intervention without saying a few words about the drought that has recently afflicted six States in the Sudano-Sahelian region and which has ravaged in an unprecedented way the population and livestock of that region. My delegation will not dwell on the details of that situation, which has been sufficiently explained by many delegations that have spoken before me and which was the subject of an eloquent statement by General Lamizana, President of the sister Republic of the Upper Volta, under special mandate from the meeting at Ouagadougou of the six countries concerned. [2145th meeting].\n346.\tI shall confine myself to expressing my sincere thanks on behalf of my Government to all those who have responded to the appeal of our brothers in distress. I should like to emphasize, however, that, while the immediate needs of these countries have been met to some extent with the assistance received, much remains to be done to eliminate the sequels of this disaster and to restore normal life to that agro-pastoral region.\n347.\tIt is for this reason that we call for the collaboration of the international Organization in order that it may take concrete measures to reconstruct the economy of the States of the Sudano-Sahelian area so that they can face up to these calamities and others of the same kind in the future."

        "file_text": "\ufeff86.\tMr. President, I am happy to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We rejoice in the honour thus bestowed on you personally and on your country, Ecuador. We are fully confident that you will guide the affairs of this Assembly with impartiality, and we assure you of our full co-operation.\n87.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General presents a penetrating analysis of the situation, objectives and potentialities of the United Nations. We would be well advised to study closely his important observations and to consider carefully the entire range of problems raised by the Secretary-General.\n88.\tOver the years we have become accustomed to hearing much criticism of the work of the United Nations. Our Organization and the tangible results we achieve are often looked upon with impatience and disappointment. To mention but a few of the shortcomings pointed out to us: our results fall short of expectations; we speak too much and act too little; the provisions of the Charter are inadequate; our activities should be expanded or reduced, or new organs should be created.\n89.\tThis impatience is understandable; it reflects the uneasiness or even insecurity, but also the hopes, prevalent in a time marked by new departures.\n90.\tThe United Nations was founded 28 years ago. The world Organization was the fruit of the aspirations and resolve of a horrified mankind to create, by reason and humanity, a world of peaceful and ordered coexistence of States and nations. The purposes and principles of the Charter have proved to be of durable value. The international machinery which has since evolved will continue to be an indispensable framework and an essential precondition for genuine international solidarity. However, it is not enough to support the United Nations in words. And it is not beneficial to misuse the vast potentialities of the Organization for campaigns in pursuit of narrow and nationalistic aims. If we were to take stock of the situation, we should learn that the constant and considerate application of the United Nations machinery is the best way in which to enrich our heritage.\n91.\tAt the same time, we must remain responsive to constructive criticism and steadily prove able to adapt our Organization to the ever changing challenges. Since the Charter was signed, many years ago, the world has changed more than in any other period of the same length. The relatively static social pattern has been replaced almost everywhere by mobility and new departures, often in the, face of considerable opposition from the established society. A new generation has grown up which questions our very objectives \u2014 a generation to which the machinery we have provided is a matter of course; a generation which measures our performance principally in the light of the capability of the United Nations to offer the individual equitable conditions, freedom, security and dignity; a generation which insists upon our Organization being able to add to international relations a human dimension consonant with the ideals which all human civilizations have evolved.\n92.\tWe are facing a dual challenge: to safeguard and further develop a harmonious co-operation within the family of nations, while linking to our aspirations and our decisions the human dimension which alone can enhance the quality of life of the individual.\n93.\tIf we attempted to evaluate the present situation we could perhaps say that it is characterized by a growing recognition of the need for well-balanced efforts-at the global, regional and bilateral levels-to tackle fundamental problems which in reality affect us all and whose solution is a key to safeguarding and humanizing our existence. We must also realize that at the same time the situation is characterized by the lack of resolve with which we transform our recognition into practical action.\n94.\tIn the political field, positive features which previously were just traceable have become much more distinct. The favourable development in relations between the major Powers is continuing. And in my part of the world, in Europe, further efforts towards detente have led to the gratifying result that we were able a few days ago to welcome the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic as Members of the United Nations. The importance of the process which paved the way to the admission of the two German States cannot be overrated. The mainspring has been the initiatives taken and persistently pursued by the great statesman who has just addressed this Assembly, Chancellor Willy Brandt, and by the Federal Government.\n95.\tIn Europe, a noteworthy event since our last General Assembly session has been the enlargement of the European Community by three new countries: Ireland, the United Kingdom and my own country. The developments manifested in this enlargement are of vital concern to the individual human being in a part of the world which twice in one generation has been embroiled in devastating wars. This dynamic evolution results from a recognition of our identity and oar responsibility towards ourselves and towards the world at large. In accentuating community coherence, the very foundation of which is our democratic institutions, we do not forget our relations with and responsibilities towards the outside world. We welcome this, as it has consistently been the policy of Denmark to promote and develop open-mindedness in our relations with the entire world.\n96.\tParticularly in relation to the United States, the European Community is engaged in a dialogue in which we have great hopes. I am confident that a positive outcome will prove of benefit to the world community at large. We welcome the fact that this dialogue was given added impetus at the meeting in Copenhagen on 10 and 11 September of the Foreign Ministers in the family of the nine members of the Community.\n97.\tAfter thorough and successfully completed preparations, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has entered its second phase. On the basis of recent trends towards detente the primary aim of the Conference must now be to create the conditions for a new forward thrust in the process of detente and co-operation. If we succeed, we shall have attained a result that again will be of importance not only to the countries directly involved. All the way through it remains important to aim not only at peaceful and correct relations among States, but to further the quality of life of the individual, which is the basis on which all efforts should be measured and judged. It is important that we arrive at a point where the implications of detente are translated into palpable reality for the peoples of the European countries in the form of concrete and well defined measures.\n98.\tAs I said a while ago, there seems to be a growing recognition of the need for common solutions to major problems facing us, but that recognition is not always translated into action. In the field of disarmament, the world Organization has made strenuous efforts for a long time without achieving much progress. Over a number of years we have witnessed certain advances through the adoption of some limited disarmament and arms-control measures. But realistically we must admit that deplorable stagnation-has occurred. We are still waiting for the progress that could reduce the risks inherent in continued armament and the resultant senseless waste of resources. To put it in more specific terms, I think the time is now ripe for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a treaty prohibiting the development, production and stockpiling of all kinds of chemical weapons and providing for the destruction of existing stocks of such weapons.\n99.\tIn the Middle East, energetic efforts have been made, not least by this Organization, its Secretary-General and his personal representative. And yet the situation remains deadlocked, and we are regularly witnessing tragic events. World opinion on this question is marked by growing and understandable impatience, which is also felt in my country. I call upon all parties to make a whole-hearted effort to find a solution in conformity with the guidelines which the Security Council established in its now almost six-year-old-I repeat, six-year-old-resolution 242(1967). My Government will welcome initiatives suitable to break the present deadlock and lead to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n100.\tOnce again we must note that in southern Africa there has been no progress in the cause of reason and humanity. On the contrary, we receive reports of acts of violence, encroachments and bloodshed in that distressed area. I appeal to those responsible to wake up to the reality of the situation before the sands run out. My Government is ready to take an active part in efforts under the provisions of the Charter to find a peaceful solution securing for the African peoples the right of self-determination. The Secretary-General has made commendable efforts. We hope he will be enabled to continue his endeavours.\n101.\tIn the South Asian subcontinent, responsible statesmen are striving to overcome the controversies of the recent past, and expectations have been raised that a solution satisfactory to all may soon be worked out. I hope that the three Governments may succeed in this endeavour of reconciliation and so be allowed to turn their full attention to the future.\n102.\tThe situation in Indo-China as a whole, although still marked by human suffering and instability, has improved over the last few months. But much restraint will be required of the parties to exploit the opportunities that have been opened for a final and peaceful solution to the protracted and bitter conflicts.\n103.\tThe difficult bilateral talks aimed at normalizing relations between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been continued. Decisive for our Organization? is the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula in order that the conciliation of the two Korean States may take place in the best possible climate and in order that they may be enabled to play their proper role in the world community.\n104.\tThe twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be commemorated during this session. For a quarter-century the Declaration has represented a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations in their efforts to ensure respect for the dignity of man.\n105.\tIn spite of the progress made in this field we must deplore the fact that fundamental rights as set forth in the Declaration are still being disregarded and that freedom of thought and freedom of speech are far from always respected in the Member countries.\n106.\tWe are alarmed by the many reports of torture or other cruel or degrading treatment of human beings, and thus we understand and respect the many endeavours aimed at condemnation and elimination of the use of torture.\n107.\tDisregard for the individual becomes particularly acute in armed conflicts, where in modern times the civilian population is exposed to severe risks. It is therefore imperative that as many States as possible participate in the work which the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have started in order to develop the rules of humanitarian international law in armed conflicts. We must endeavour to attain universal adherence to those new rules.\n108.\tThe Danish Government is gravely concerned about the frequent acts of international terrorism victimizing innocent persons. Concerted international efforts are required to break the vicious circle of terror and counter- terror. All nations must recognize their responsibilities by taking concrete steps in this direction.\n109.\tDenmark attaches great importance to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. What is at stake is not only the law of the sea in the classical sense but the ability of our Organization to find suitable solutions for the distribution of the wealth of the seas and the sea-bed.\n110.\tCoastal States should be accorded more extensive rights to the living resources of the sea. In particular, there is a need to give such rights to coastal States among the developing countries and to States or regions whose populations are heavily dependent on fisheries for their livelihood and without alternative employment possibilities. The legitimate interests of other nations and of the international community as a whole must be taken into consideration.\n111.\tThe work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields is this year marked by the first review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n112.\tAlthough statistics may yet be incomplete, it is evident that the balance-sheet of the first two years of the\nSecond United Nations Development Decade does not give grounds for complacency. On the whole, the expectations of progress in the developing countries were not met. Nevertheless there are signs that may augur well for the future.\n113.\tThe multilateral trade negotiations which have now been initiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on' Tariffs and Trade should, together with an early agreement on a durable and equitable reform of the international monetary system, help create optimum conditions for world trade and, in turn, for economic growth, to the benefit of developing as well as developed countries.\n114.\tHowever, economic growth is regarded no longer as an end in itself but rather as a means to improve the quality of life of the individual. It is therefore gratifying to note that within a wide range of areas this conception is gradually being translated into action on a global scale. In endeavours to ensure the quality of life of our own and future generations the questions of environment and population also loom large. We welcome the efforts now under way to follow up the consensus of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, and we are looking forward to seeing the World Population Conference next year lay the foundation of realistic and far-sighted population policies.\n115.\tThe United Nations has a unique role to play in promoting international co-operation for economic and social progress in the less fortunate countries of the world. The growing sense of solidarity should inspire us-the better-off countries-steadily to improve our contribution to this global development effort. My country for one is resolved to follow such a course.\n116.\tI have tried to draw attention to a number of factors, problems and trends of prime importance. We must promote co-operation and detente. We must realize the need for genuine disarmament. Goodwill must be shown to settle the Middle East conflict. In southern Africa the law of justice and humanity must be obeyed. The promising progress towards an over-all solution to the conflict in the South Asian subcontinent must be continued. A satisfactory solution must be found to the Korean question. The existing possibilities of a final and peaceful solution to the conflict in Indo-China must be exploited. Economic co-operation must be expanded, not least for the benefit of the less fortunate nations. Human rights must be respected in the widest sense.\n117.\tThe topics I have touched upon demonstrate the scope of our Organization's activities. They demonstrate also the challenges confronting the world community. I am convinced, however, that we who are responsible for the continued existence and success of the United Nations will be able, by persistence and dedication, to take a step forward on the path of detente and conciliation, peace and co-operation, towards the ultimate goal: an international society committed to the dignity and worth of the individual."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\t I wish to congratulate the President whole-heartedly on his election to preside over the General Assembly. The confidence shown by all States Members of the United Nations is a credit to him, to his country and the whole of Latin America. His lengthy experience in international affairs and in the United Nations has ?'ell prepared him for this great task, and I express the sincerest wishes that his tenure will be crowned with success and personal satisfaction.\n2.\tOur congratulations go also to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, the retiring President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, who conducted our debates last year with such vigour, faith, competence and dash.\n3.\tTo Mr. Waldheim, our Secretary-General, we express our gratitude and our admiration for his untiring activities, for his understanding of world problems, for his availability at all times to Member countries and in particular the poor countries, and for his broad-mindedness and his outstanding qualities as a politician, a diplomat and a negotiator. He does not spare himself, and we thank him for his untiring efforts, his faith, his patience and the judicious use he makes of his many talents. We thank Austria for giving us this expert, this champion of detente at a time when the world is so much in need of one.\n4.\tFinally, may I be permitted to hail the presence in our midst of three new Member States: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the\nGerman Democratic Republic. The advent of these countries enables our Organization to take a major step towards universality. We sincerely rejoice and express our gratitude to all those who have contributed to this progress, towards peace, independence and the universality of our Organization.\n5.\tIf one were to look at things from the general point of view, one could well say, without fear of error, that the world is going through an historic phase of the utmost importance, about which men rejoice everywhere; on earth. The outer signs of the new turn that international affairs have taken are crystal clear: there was the arrival two years ago in our Organization of the People's Republic of China; there were the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland; there were the direct meetings between the Heads of State of the great Powers and the conclusion of the first co-operation agreements among them; there was the reconciliation between Japan and China; there was the armistice in Viet-Nam, then the International Conference on Viet-Nam and the peace agreements of Paris; and this year there is the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the arrival in the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas; there is the proclamation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau that we hail joyfully and which my country, the Central African Republic, has recognized de jure. May all our wishes for success accompany it in its first steps. Other promising signs appear on the horizon; Japan is proposing a conference on peace and security in Asia; attempts are still being made to bring peace throughout Indo-China; in the Indian subcontinent we witness with pleasure the reconciliation of two great nations, India and Pakistan, two pillars of our Organization; and a concrete dialogue has been opened in Korea.\n6.\tAll of this is good and worthy of praise and applause, and we must do everything in our power to consolidate and intensify this ray of hope, this springtime in international relations. The cold war, which sowed haired, divided peoples and brought about an unbridled arms race will soon be, we hope, no more than a bad memory. Mankind, entering its global era, endowed with a universal Organization marked by accommodation rather than the desire for domination of the great Powers, appears at last to have embarked upon the path of common sense and reason. The peoples of the world are not mistaken. They therefore applaud these developments, in the north and the south, in the east and the west, in the rich countries as well as in the poor countries, over and above ideologies and systems, over and above races and colours.\n7.\tOur twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, like the two preceding sessions, forms part of this great \n\nhistorical trend that has been called detente. It reflects that movement; it acts in favour of detente and carries its fruits far beyond it, towards a more noble and even more necessary objective: namely, entente and co-operation among all peoples.\n8.\tWhat can we actually do in the course of this session of the General Assembly to show ourselves worthy of our peoples and to promote the building of peace, justice and progress that is so impatiently expected of us? May I be permitted, despite the very modest place that my country, the Central African Republic, holds in the concert of nations, to make a few suggestions.\n9.\tFirst of all, our first duty in the present circumstances is to settle rapidly and definitively the conflicts and sources of friction that still poison international relations and which, by reason of their duration or by a sudden recrudescence' risk delaying progress towards detente and even destroying it. It is important that the question of the Middle East, a potential hotbed of serious explosions, with far-reaching ramifications, be settled once and for all.\n10.\tIt is important that peace return to the whole of Indo-China. It is important that the problem of Cyprus be erased from our books. It is important that the question of Korea, too, be settled once and for all. Efforts are under way in regard to all these problems and it is to be hoped that they will soon be successful in order that those regions can be purified in the atmosphere .of the great movement of detente that we are witnessing.\n11.\tWe must deplore the fact that in that movement which is the result essentially of the initiatives of the great Powers one burning question, a question which affects a whole continent and which overflows into international relations, has not been given its rightful priority. I am speaking of the problems of colonialism and racism in southern Africa. It is imperative that the vast move for detente embrace Africa also and that a concerted effort be undertaken with the assistance of the entire international community, and particularly that of the great Powers, in order to settle the situation in that vast region \u2014 a situation that is so dangerous for world peace and security.\n12.\tWe live in an era in which priorities may vary from region to region and country to country. For the rich countries detente has become a matter of priority. For Africa \u2014  for Africa, I say \u2014 independence and racial equality, objectives already attained elsewhere in the world, constitute that priority. It is therefore for the international community to help us in achieving our legitimate aims which are in keeping with international morality. There cannot be two yardsticks in international ethics. The rich world in the United Nations continues to appeal to Africa for co-operation in the fields of environment, population, terrorism, the law of the sea and so on. But what does the rest of the world do to help Africa achieve its objectives, its priorities? Hence, the questions of southern Africa must be included as a priority item on the agenda of international detente. To continue along the present course is not only morally unworthy of the international community but also dangerous, because violence will only increase and, in our time, violence knows no frontiers. At the present time we are witnessing a vast European effort to settle problems under the auspices of the\nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Tanaka, for his part, has launched the idea of a conference on peace in Asia. Perhaps the time has come to think about a similar effort, at a conference on independence and peace in Africa, which would endeavour, with the assistance in particular of the great Powers, to achieve independence, racial equality and peace \u2014 all fundamental objectives of the Charter \u2014 in our torn continent.\n13.\tIn this connexion, I should like to quote the very pertinent words spoken by our Secretary-General last year at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] held at Rabat, Morocco, from 12 to 15 June 1972, that should dictate our approach and behaviour with respect to this crucial problem of contemporary history. He said:\n\\\"How great would be our joy and how relieved we would be if I were able to declare today that the whole of Africa was free and independent. The march of progress and independence has encountered many obstacles which today unduly delay, at the cost of much suffering, an ineluctable historical evolution. Sooner or later that process will be achieved by peaceful means or by force. There is no nation in our world which is so interdependent that it can resist forever the profound changes whose legitimacy the international community recognizes.\\\"\n14.\t\\\"\tSecondly, problems accumulate so quickly and human sufferings are still so great in so many countries of the world that we must, as rapidly as possible, go beyond the stage of detente, which is no more than a period of transition, and embark deliberately on a period of active human solidarity and international co-operation. The application of the United Nations Charter has frequently been delayed and hindered over these past 25 years by the cold war. The cold war having disappeared from view, we must return to the spirit of San Francisco and give an unprecedented impetus to our Organization which has, in the meantime, become fully representative of the whole world and of all human aspirations. The provisions of the Charter, be they political or economic, must be revived in the spirit of the detente and the co-operation that have become such an imperative need.\n15.\tWe feel that, in particular, meetings between heads of State must be increased, not only bilaterally but also within this Organization, which offers a universal framework at a time When so many universal problems and difficulties stand in the way of the happiness of mankind. It is here, from this rostrum, that the views of the various nations must be given by their authorized leaders. It is here, in these halls and corridors, that practical plans of fraternity and human co-operation must be conceived and adopted. It is here, at the clearing-house of the problems and aspirations of the whole world that we must build the peaceful, unarmed, just and prosperous world community, united in its cultural and human diversity.\n\n16.\tThere remains so much-to be done. Poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy that are still rampant in the world\nshould make us ashamed, especially when we think of the enormous resources wasted on dangerous and useless weapons. Here, too, we must draw all the logical consequences of detente. Might it not be a good thing for the Economic and Social Council to include an item on its agenda entitled \\\"Detente and economic development\\\" and review new actions that might derive from that detente for developing countries? To a large degree, assistance to poor countries in these past years stemmed from the cold war and the competition between the great Powers. What will happen to that aid? Could we not conceive of the possibility that competition would give way to co-operation and that joint aid programmes between the great Powers would be offered to the poor countries? The alliance of the scientific, technical and economic might of the rich countries could work miracles for the poor countries if they so wished. We sincerely hope that there will be a great alliance against poverty, an alliance in which all the advanced countries would participate regardless of their political or social system. Would it not be natural, moreover, with this trend of detente to envisage at least a doubling of multilateral resources and, in particular, those of the United Nations Development Programme? We sincerely believe that the Second Committee of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should attempt to relaunch aid on a vaster scale both bilaterally and internationally in the light of that detente. In so doing, special attention should be paid to the poorer developing countries, and above all to the landlocked countries. A first effort has been made in that direction by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] in Santiago, Chile, and by the United Nations Development Programme, but we hope that a less strict definition will be adopted for that category of countries and that greater resources will be envisaged for them.\n17.\tYes, there is still so much to be done on our earth that an entirely new spirit, an unprecedented solidarity and cooperation, much greater generosity and understanding and much greater foresight must inspire us in the future,\n18.\tWe have barely scratched the surface of knowledge concerning our planet. Research on the potential of our seas and oceans, which cover three quarters of our globe, has intensified recently; and we must applaud the agreement on oceanographic research concluded this summer in Washington between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. \n19.\tOnly 30 per cent of our lands are inhabited and exploited. It took a terrible drought in the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region and a further encroachment of the Sahara to open our eyes and to show us how meagre were the resources devoted to a better knowledge of our deserts, to the struggle against their extension and, better still, to their conquest and exploitation.\n20.\tWould it not be a good thing, at a time when so much is said of over-population and the population explosion, to consider a little further the possibilities of occupation and production that our earth offers us? Would it not be wise for the international community at this stage, after the warning given by the Sahara, to launch a vast programme of cooperation between countries which have deserts in order better to know those areas and to find the means of limiting their expansion and perhaps of conquering them for the welfare of man? That again is a practical suggestion that my country wishes to put forward, having in mind our brothers in the Sudano-Sahelian region.\n21.\tOur knowledge of the tropical and equatorial regions is not much more brilliant. The scientific and technological efforts of mankind have concentrated mainly on the natural conditions and the resources of the Nordic and rich countries. The exploration of the great biological potential of the tropical and equatorial regions has barely been sketched. One realizes to what extent efforts in these fields could be profitable when we think of the successes of the experimental stations of the Ford Foundation in Mexico and the Philippines which are at the root of the \\\"green revolution\\\" in wheat and rice. Now that the cold war is dying and an era ^f friendship is being initiated between the great scientific and ' industrial Powers, has not the time come to think of a new scientific and technical strategy, a true impetus to be given to our knowledge of the resources of our planet, and especially of 'he African continent, for the greater benefit of man?\n22.\tPeace, justice and progress in the world are to a large extent the fruit of peace, of justice and of progress in our respective countries. Hence, it is a good thing that each year countries should come to this rostrum to tell the world what they have done to contribute to the peace and well-being of their peoples. So far as the Central African Republic is concerned, we believe that we have honestly fulfilled our obligations and duties.\n23.\tNot only have we lived in peace with our neighbours, but the head of our State, His Excellency General Jean-Bedel Bokassa, a pilgrim of peace, continues to do everything in his power to contribute to the maintenance of international peace.\n24.\tOur Government, moreover, thanks to the policy in force since January 1966, the \\\"Bokassa Operation\\\", has established an original strategy for development and has worked for the well-being of its citizens.\n25.\tWe have co-operated with our African brothers in the political, economic, cultural, technical and scientific fields within the framework of the Organization of African Unity [OAU\\.\n26.\tWe have co-operated with all the countries in the world in political, economic and social organs of the United Nations as well as in all large international conferences and in the specialized agencies.\n27.\tMay we be forgiven for not always having the necessary highly skilled personnel to participate successfully in all these endeavours. The poor countries also have a paucity of diplomatic and technical personnel and the effort demanded by the complexity of international affairs, very often in highly scientific and technical fields, often exceeds the means of a country such as my own. But we try to do our best to add our block to the common building.\n28.\tThe world has fortunately survived, without a new world war, one of its most dangerous periods, the most awesomely armed, and the most all-encompassing that has ever existed. We are on the threshold of a new era, without precedent in history, full of challenge and promise, but weighed down by problems, complexities, impatience and claims. We, men of all nations, without distinction as to colour, creed or culture, have a noble role to play, that of tackling together almost super-human tasks, for the well- being of the humble, the suffering, the disinherited, in their quest for peace, justice and progress for the whole of mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tThe membership of the German Democratic Republic in the United Nations, acquired only a few days ago, provides an opportunity for its Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline for the first time before this world forum the policy of the socialist German State and its position on important current tasks and problems of the United Nations.\n2.\tIn the view of the German Democratic Republic its admission to the United Nations is an historic event, for it implies that the post-war period in Europe has come to an end. I ask representatives to remember that the first documents in which the Powers of the anti-Hitler coalition called for the establishment of an Organization of the United Nations were, at the same time, documents of the fight against Fascist German imperialism. Exactly three decades ago, in October 1943, the Allied Powers adopted the Moscow Declaration on General Security, in which they pledged their determination to enforce the unconditional surrender of Hitler fascism. At the same time, they recognized:\n\n\\\"... the necessity of establishing... a general international organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to membership by all such States, large or small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.\\\"\n3.\tIn the three decades from October 1943 to October 1974, profound changes have taken place on the international scene. To bring them about the necessary conditions had to be created in Europe, and chiefly in the territory of the former German Reich. To this end the Potsdam Agreement, concluded after the end of the Hitler war, made provision for the extirpation of German militarism and nazism, the democratization of social life, the punishment of war and Nazi criminals, and the curbing of the power of monopolies. These measures were designed to guarantee that no war could ever again start from German soil.\n4.\tThe German Democratic Republic was established in October 1949 on these sound foundations. Enterprises of war and Nazi criminals had been converted into people's property through a referendum; a democratic agrarian reform had given land to the peasants; Nazi and militarist elements were removed from all public posts; war and Nazi criminals were strictly punished; and the school and education system was remodelled along democratic lines. The evil spirit of racial hatred and chauvinism was thoroughly uprooted.\n5.\tIn the face of massive war destruction of production facilities and all sorts of buildings, most essential human rights such as the fundamental social rights of the working people, the right to work and to employment, the right to education and to recreation, the rights of women and of youth, were implemented in the most adverse material circumstances.\n6.\tIt was on that anti-Fascist, democratic basis that the German Democratic Republic subsequently developed into a socialist State. Its people have chosen for ever the socialist system of society and have thus exercised their right of self-determination guaranteed in the Charter of the United Nations. The German Democratic Republic owes its rise to their efforts and to its firm and indestructible alliance with the Soviet Union and the other socialist States.\n7.\tUpon his election as our country's first President, the late Wilhelm Pieck, a proven fighter against fascism and war, formally declared before the supreme representative body of the German Democratic Republic on 11 October 1949:\n\\\"We are well aware of the great responsibility which the German people have to accept because they aided and abetted Hitler's barbarous war, and we are also aware of our obligation for reparation towards the countries afflicted by the Hitler war. We will fulfil in good faith the obligations placed upon us under the Potsdam Agreement, whereby we seek to regain the world's confidence and join the comity of peace-loving democratic nations.\\\"\n8.\tAs the State Secretary to the first President of the German Democratic Republic, I am particularly pleased and highly privileged to declare to the General Assembly of the United Nations that the German Democratic Republic has fulfilled that pledge with honour. In compliance with the Potsdam Agreement, it has fulfilled conscientiously its obligation for reparation towards the Soviet Union and the \n\nPolish People's Republic. With regard to the Polish, Czech and Slovak peoples, who were so often the first victims of aggression by greater Germany, the German Democratic Republic took decisive steps for a genuine reconciliation. As early as 1950, in the Treaty of Goerlitz, it recognized without reservation the frontier with the Polish People's Republic on the Oder and Neisse rivers. At the same time, in the first Treaty it concluded with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, it condemned the diktat of Munich with all its consequences, and it pledged to refrain from making any territorial claims or pressing for frontier revision with regard to those two States.\n9.\tActing in that way more than two decades ago, the German Democratic Republic made contributors to European security which remain effective examples in the light of recent European developments.\n10.\tSince its inception, the German Democratic Republic has practised active solidarity with the Asian, African and Latin American peoples defending themselves against imperialist aggression or resisting colonialist repression. Never has it paid only verbal tribute to the struggle against colonialism and racism, but has always considered it its sacred duty to support that struggle by action.\n11.\tIn the German Democratic Republic there are no political or economic groups whose drive for profit and exports would bar a policy aimed at implementing the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations. Nor are there any motivations for the German Democratic Republic to uphold the aims of those States which are still pursuing colonialist or neo-colonialist policies.\n12.\tEven when it was net a Member of the United Nations, the German Democratic Republic consistently implemented all resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations condemning colonialism and neocolonialism and on the boycotting of racism regimes.\n13.\tTo ensure durable peace and security, to support the , peoples fighting for their freedom and independence, to be\nwilling to establish relations of peaceful coexistence with States of different political and social systems: those are the aims and principles of the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic, which it has pursued and observed ever since its foundation.\n14.\tThe admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations has occurred at a time of international detente, to which the German Democratic Republic, has made essential contributions. At present, European peoples and States are making efforts to ensure that their continent, which was twice in this century the source and scene of world wars, will become at long last a centre of detente and peace in the world.\n15.\tA representative of the socialist peace policy cannot ignore in this context that German imperialism and militarism, pursuing programmes of conquest as it did, was the main aggressor in both World Wars of this century. With their policies of non-recognition of frontiers, of armament\nand of revanche, its protagonists were implicated in the failure and break-down of the League of Nations as a peace organization.\n16.\tHaving drawn these lessons from history, the German Democratic Republic pursues a foreign policy of peace and international understanding which is in full harmony with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Its membership in the United Nations now offers the German Democratic Republic new opportunities for effectively developing this policy of peaceful coexistence and international peace in the interests of its own people.\n17.\tThe current international situation offers good opportunities to settle international issues, however complicated, by negotiation based on the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social and political systems. The Charter of the United Nations and its strict observance are a solid basis for that.\n18.\tVery convincing evidence to this effect is, in the view of the German Democratic Republic, the significant Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America.  The Agreement does not endanger, but increases, the security of every country. It does not impair, but promotes, the process of detente and peaceful coexistence between States, and therefore fully meets the interest of all peoples in peace.\n19.\tThe admission of the German Democratic Republic and of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations was preceded by the signing of international treaties in which the inviolability of frontiers and of the territorial status quo in Europe is recognized. The treaties were concluded by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany. They fix in binding terms of international law the frontiers and territories of the States as they have emerged as a result of the Second World War and of post-war developments.\n20.\tThe international relations of States can only serve detente and peaceful co-operation if they rest on the generally binding principles of the United Nations Charter. This applies without restriction also to relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Therefore the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  commits both States to be guided by the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations, in particular by the principle of the sovereign equality of all States. It is equally important that the inviolability, now and in the future, of the frontier between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the obligation of both States to respect fully each other's territorial integrity have been affirmed by international law. The Treaty has no time limit. It contains nothing that could call in question the finality of the provisions agreed upon or could give them a provisional character, such as the character of a so-called modus vivendi \n\n  \n \n21.\tConsequently, the Treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany corresponds to the irreversible historical realities that have emerged on German soil from the Second World War and from post-war development. The German Reich, founded in 1871 in blood and iron, launched two world wars which claimed over 70 million human lives. That imperialist German Reich perished in ashes, blood and ruins in 1945 and its generals signed the unconditional surrender demanded in the Moscow Declaration of the Allied Powers.\n22.\tFor a quarter of a century two sovereign German States, independent of each other and having diametrically opposed social systems, have been in existence. The German Democratic Republic is a State of peace, democracy and socialism which has absolutely nothing in common with the imperialist nature of the German Reich. It has broken for ever with the fateful German militarist past. In the German Democratic Republic there is developing a socialist German nation, closely associated with the peoples of the socialist community. From the antagonistic character of the social and political orders, it follows conclusively that between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany a unification will never be possible. But what is possible, and necessary, are good-neighbourly relations of peaceful coexistence between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. Such durable relations of peaceful coexistence between the two German States will have a beneficial effect not only in Europe but also in world-wide international relations and organizations.\n23.\tThere is no doubt that the relaxation of tension in Europe has especially been promoted by the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin concluded between the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and France. To this Agreement the German Democratic Republic has made its constructive contribution. Any assessment of this contribution will have to take into account that West Berlin is situated about 200 kilometres from the frontier with the Federal Republic of Germany and amid the territory of the German Democratic Republic. All questions of civilian transit traffic to and from West Berlin could therefore be settled only in consultation and agreement with the German Democratic Republic. In each phase of the often complicated negotiation of the West Berlin Agreement the German Democratic Republic displayed an attitude that was first and foremost determined by its interest in a progressing European detente. By submitting proposals and draft treaties and negotiating in a spirit of goodwill, the German Democratic Republic later very much facilitated the conclusion of the Transit Agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and of arrangements with the Senate of West Berlin.\n24.\tThe German Democratic Republic is equally broad- minded in implementing the treaties and agreements. To give members just one example, permit me to bring to your notice that over 14 million citizens of Western countries, including the Federal Republic of Germany and of the Western sectors of Berlin, have visited the German Democratic Republic between 1 January 1972 and 25 September 1973. Nineteen and one half million persons passed in transit to and from West Berlin through the German Democratic Republic's territory in that period. Three and a quarter million citizens of the German Democratic Republic visited Western countries, including the Federal Republic and West Berlin in the same period. And iii the same period again, 21.5 million citizens of the German Democratic Republic travelled to socialist countries, while 18.5 million nationals of these socialist countries visited the German Democratic Republic. All in all, the total of journeys across the frontiers of the German Democratic Republic in those 21 months is 76.7 million. I ask members to consider when judging these figures in the millions that the German Democratic Republic itself has only 17 million inhabitants. All these figures in my view are impressive and tell their own tale; they spare my commenting on all sorts of unserious assertions.\n25.\tOn the same day on which the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly was opened, the second phase of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe started. It is not too much to say that Europe stands on the threshold of a new era \u2014 an era of peaceful coexistence and peaceful co-operation, which is important for the improvement of the international climate, too. In addition to two world wars, many colonial wars originated in Europe. It is therefore in the interest of all States of our globe that, in the wake of constructive policies, peace and co-operation should at last emanate from the European continent. The peoples and States of all continents will undoubtedly benefit when the Conference decides that the indispensable basic principles for security and co-operation should be binding on all participating countries.\n26.\tDetente in Europe will improve chances to contain hotbeds of tension in other parts of the world. It will prove once more that political settlements of long-standing disputes are possible and useful. It will check or hinder those forces that are seeking to fuel tensions for aggressive and annexationist aims. Ensured security and co-operation in Europe will \u2014 not least among the results \u2014 be of use to the Asian, African and Latin American countries in the solution of the economic, scientific and technological problems they are facing.\n27.\tPrecisely for this reason the achievements of the last few years in the direction of detente, security and co-operation must not be relinquished, but firmly consolidated as a basis and model for new gains of peace and understanding among the peoples.\n28.\tThe German Democratic Republic views the United Nations as the most important international organ for guaranteeing security and maintaining world peace. The people and Government of the German Democratic Republic whole-heartedly subscribe to the aim set out in the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", and they will employ all the powers and abilities at their command so that this aim will be achieved. To work for this noble\nand lofty purpose, what is required is the strict observance, rather than the revision, of the Charter.\n29.\tThe evolution of the international situation since the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security was adopted by the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2734 (XXV]  has confirmed the programmatic substance and topicality of that basic document. Significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of the principles of the United Nations in international life. Yet much remains to be done.\n30.\tThe German Democratic Republic supports the resolution on the non-use of force in international relations and on the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty- seventh session [resolution 2936 (XXVII)} at the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It considers that the Security Council should, pursuant to that resolution, take a decision binding on all States Members of the United Nations. That would be a highly effective step towards ensuring international security, particularly since an obligation to renounce the use of force would be accompanied by a ban on the most threatening form of force, the use of nuclear weapons. In a large number of international instruments and agreements of the recent past, the importance of the renunciation of force has been reaffirmed and underlined. Hence, a decision of the Security Council on the prohibition of the use of force and nuclear weapons for all time would positively meet the requirements of international development.\n31.\tTo be durable, political detente needs to be complemented by corresponding agreements on disarmament measures. The arms race is not only a persisting threat to peace, but an immense material burden on the peoples. While huge sums are spent on manufacturing weapons to kill people, many countries have a shortage of social institutions and educational facilities, and millions of human beings suffer want. That is why we welcome the proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations should deal with the reduction by 10 per cent of the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191]. All States which have major economic and military potentials should follow such an exemplary approach with corresponding cuts in their military budgets. In our view, the proposal of the Soviet Union constitutes a genuine chance to translate the declarations on disarmament into practical disarmament measures directly benefiting the peoples and developing countries. To contain the arms race is therefore an urgent, humanitarian task and an imperative of humanity.\n32.\tWe fully share the position of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations that the time is ripe for a world disarmament conference. Such a conference could thoroughly discuss international problems and negotiate agreements which promote the basic and primary goal \u2014 general and complete disarmament-and provide for effective partial measures of arms limitation. A world disarmament conference would be commensurate with the paramount importance of the problem and make possible a universal and equal participation of all States. Questions of disarmament concern the interests and obligations of all States irrespective of their size or level of economic or other development.\n33.\tThe United Nations has successfully carried out a number of important conferences in the fields of international law and environmental protection. So we think that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the eventual course of the world disarmament conference. The conference will surely have difficult and complex problems to consider; but important agreements such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [see resolution 2826 (XXVI)] have been reached although their subject matters were complicated. These examples allow us to expect a successful course for the disarmament conference if all participating Governments heed the wish of their peoples for peace and security.\n34.\tThe elimination of sources of conflict is an indispensable condition for the recovery of the international situation. Paragraph 5 of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security stipulates that the territory of a State must not be occupied illegally by use of force. Contrary to this stipulation and in violation of resolution 242 (1967) adopted by the Security Council, Israel still holds Arab territory under occupation and is thus responsible for the fact that this dangerous source of war still exists.\n35.\tThe withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories and respect for the independence and legitimate rights of the States and peoples of the area, including the Arab people of Palestine \u2014 only a political arrangement including these conditions will lead to the settlement of the Middle East conflict in conformity with the Security Council resolution.\n36.\tThe German Democratic Republic, together with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other States of the socialist community, is convinced that it is necessary and possible to extend the zone of detente to cover the whole world. For this reason we sincerely support the aspirations of the peoples of Asia for a system of collective security in the region, and we note with satisfaction that circumstances for achieving this aim have essentially improved of late.\n37.\tThe war in Indo-China for many years darkened the international situation and permanently threatened to engulf mankind in a world-wide conflict. Despite much resistance, the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam, signed at Paris on 27 January 1973, has now been achieved. Those who were putting up resistance to the Agreement on Viet-Nam until the last minute are also those who continue to violate it and to launch military actions. In our view, it is now of the utmost importance to ensure strict observance of the Agreement on restoring peace in Viet-Nam.\n38.\tAs it did in the hard days of fighting, the German Democratic Republic continues to side in firm solidarity with the Viet-Namese people now that the tasks of reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam have to be tackled.\n39.\tThe German Democratic Republic stands consistently for the recognition of the right of the peoples of Indochina to determine their destinies themselves and to restore a just peace to Indo-China as a whole.\n40.\tThe German Democratic Republic supports the just demand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Reconstruction of Korea be dissolved immediately. The United Nations flag should no longer be used by foreign troops stationed in South Korea. The so-called United Nations Command should be abolished. All foreign troops-should be withdrawn from South Korea.\n41.\tAn event important for the normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent and for the establishment of relations of peaceful coexistence between the States in Asia is, in the opinion of the German Democratic Republic, the recent agreement between India and Pakistan. In this context I wish to record the hope that the overdue admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the United Nations can now take place.\n42.\tThe Government of the German Democratic Republic is highly interested in international co-operation in the fields of economics, science and technology and in other areas. It believes, however, that a secure peace is the most vital prerequisite to solving the problems the peoples are facing in building their social and cultural life. Here we think, in particular, of the economic and social problems of the developing countries.\n43.\tDifferent circumstances prevailing in the various regions must, of course, not be left out of account in endeavours to assist in the extension of the process of detente to all continents. In Africa, detente cannot mean tolerating Portuguese colonial rule or accepting the policy of apartheid in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia \u2014 quite the contrary. To eliminate colonialism and racism is an indispensable element of detente on the African continent. Detente will be furthered as it becomes possible to enforce the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems in international life. Observance of the generally accepted rules of international law in relations between socialist and capitalist States will make it m6re difficult for forces pursuing colonialist, racist or social oppression to keep foreign peoples under their yoke.\n44.\tIn keeping with decisions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, the German Democratic Republic has for many years practised active solidarity with the African peoples fighting for their liberation. News about massacres by Portuguese mercenaries in Mozambique underlines more than ever the urgent need to overcome all forms of colonial suppression. Both in the United Nations and through other solidarity activities in support of international solidarity, the German Democratic Republic will advocate the right to self-determination of all African peoples.\n45.\tThe fact that the boycott measures decided on by the United Nations are not being complied with by some States cannot be passed over in silence. Not only is their trade with South Africa not decreasing, it is even growing. Their investments, and thus their participation, in the exploitation of the racially suppressed indigenous populations have grown enormously. Multinational monopolies are expanding their influence in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. For the sake of their profits they assist the racist regimes in repressing the indigenous populations. This practice of monopoly capitalism grossly conflicts with the demand of the African peoples to have their own natural resources and mineral riches under their own control. This demand is fully justified and should be supported in every respect by decisions and measures of the United Nations.\n46.\tIt is consistent with our views with regard to the implementation of the right of peoples to self- determination and the world-wide enforcement of human rights as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations of December 1948 that the German Democratic Republic firmly sides with the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America and supports their struggle for political and economic independence.\n47.\tIn Chile, a constitutional government, elected by the people, was ousted by a military coup d'etat. President Salvador Allende, held in high esteem all over the world, was assassinated. Bloody violence and terror have been unleashed to destroy the social progress achieved. We are convinced, however, that the Chilean people will repulse these attacks on their vital rights and finally succeed in their struggle for the right to choose their own way of development. We feel that humaneness and self- determination call for all-round support and assistance for the people of Chile in their courageous resistance. In breach of international law, acts of reprisal and violence were committed against citizens and premises of the German Democratic Republic; therefore, the Government of the German Democratic Republic was compelled to suspend diplomatic relations with Chile.\n48.\tThe German Democratic Republic has followed with the greatest attention and sympathy the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Algiers. It supports the decisions taken at that Conference with regard to the settlement of conflicts caused by imperialist aggression. It takes the same stand on the decisions of the Conference concerning the consolidation of national independence, the unrestricted control of peoples over their natural resources, the economic interests of developing countries, and respect for the sovereign equality of all States. The German Democratic Republic associates itself with the struggle of non-aligned countries against all forms of colonialist or neo-colonialist exploitation and suppression.\n49.\tUpon being admitted to the United Nations, the German Democratic Republic formally undertook at all times to respect and observe the Charter of the United Nations, whose unchanged validity it accepts without reservation.\n50.\tAssuming this obligation, we feel called upon to make a contribution, in keeping with our possibilities and capabilities, to the fulfilment of those great tasks which the United Nations is facing. The German Democratic Republic has always thought that the exercise of State sovereignty in our times must include readiness to engage in peaceful international co-operation. Along these lines it will assist in the implementation of the lofty humanist concepts and principles of international law enshrined in the Charter. The representatives of the German Democratic Republic are ready and determined constructively to co-operate with all representatives for the noble cause of peace, international understanding and co-operation."

His election to that high office is an eloquent tribute not only to his own person but also to his great country, Ecuador. I am confident that with his diplomatic skill and the vast experience he has acquired during his long and distinguished association with the United Nations he is indeed most eminently qualified for his high office and that he will lead us to a fruitful conclusion of our deliberations. For my part, I pledge my delegation's utmost co-operation and fullest support in the execution of his task.\n35.\tI take this opportunity also to say how grateful we are to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, who as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly so skilfully and in such a statesmanlike manner guided the Assembly to a successful conclusion. It is most auspicious that we should have begun our work at this Assembly by making yet further progress towards the universality of the United Nations by admitting three more States to membership. In that connexion I should like, in the name of my delegation and on behalf of the Malaysian Government, to extend our sincere congratulations and warmest welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the occasion of their admission to membership in this Organization.\n36.\tThe admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is highly significant, for it marks another important development in the process of decolonization. But, while it is an occasion for rejoicing, it also reminds us of the unfinished task before us \u2014 that of helping other colonial territories still under foreign domination to attain their freedom and independence.\n37.\tWe congratulate the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their successful efforts to reach an historic accord between themselves which, among other things, has led to the admission of the two countries to membership in the United Nations. This understanding between the two German States, and the agreement reached on Berlin, which was for many years one of the most intractable problems in East-West relations, are further important milestones in the gradual progress towards international harmony and concord.\tc\n38.\tA recurrent theme in this session's general debate is the subject of detente. Malaysia welcomes the initiatives of the past year towards the relaxation of tension among the major Powers, among them the dialogue at the highest level between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the establishment of regular contacts between the United States and China and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Those are major initiatives which must be regarded as important developments towards an era of peaceful coexistence and positive cooperation among nations, which is more rational in concept and more beneficial to mankind than the discredited old order of mistrust, suspicion and confrontation of the cold war.\n39.\tAs a country pursuing the policy of non-alignment, Malaysia has all the more reason to welcome that development, since in a sense it represents significant progress in one of the major efforts of the non-aligned movement itself. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers last month, was most timely and had a particular significance in this context of detente. On the one hand it dramatized the relevance of the efforts of the non-aligned movement in the past in preventing big-Power confrontation and in breaking down the barriers of the cold war. On the other hand it focused attention on the future role of the non-aligned movement in ensuring that the end of big-Power confrontation does not become the beginning of big-Power hegemony, and that the third world will retain the right and the capability of playing its part in shaping the destiny of mankind.\n40.\tIn welcoming this positive development we must be mindful that detente does not automatically guarantee the peace that we all seek. The renewed armed hostilities and Israeli aggression in the Middle East must serve as a stern reminder of the slender thread by which world peace hangs in the balance. At a time when the world is beginning to feel comforted by the thaw in the cold war it must serve as a warning that, unless the forces of detente are harnessed for the just solution of such urgent problems as the Middle East situation, the world will just slip into the abyss of international anarchy. That is indeed the challenge of detente. Whether it will prove to be beneficial to mankind or whether it will be detrimental to the cause of peace, or for that matter whether the advantages of this new beginning will be wastefully frittered away, must depend largely on how the international community responds to it.\n41.\tIn the final analysis, the real success of detente will be measured in terms of its contribution to achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In that context detente cannot be meaningful if it does not lead to a greater willingness and effort on the part of the major Powers in particular and of all nations in general to strengthen the efficacy of the United Nations so as to enable this Organization to play a more effective role in grappling with some of the more intractable problems of our time, the solution of which requires the full support of the entire community of nations. Detente will have no relevance if it fails to accelerate the process of decolonization, whose slow progress at the moment is caused by the stubborn refusal of the remaining colonial Powers to recognize the right of peoples to self-determination. Detente will fall short of our expectations if it fails to generate a greater will among all parties concerned to attain the goal of general and complete disarmament to which the United Nations is committed and which the peoples of the world demand as a legitimate right for survival. And, finally, detente will turn out to be an utter disappointment, an illusion, if it does not bring about a greater dedication among the developed countries to the task of discharging their obligations and redressing the economic imbalance and disparity between the developed and developing world and a political will to do so. For detente to have any meaning at all it must be more than a process of accommodation among the major Powers; it must truly serve as the vehicle for the attainment of permanent and universal peace in the world, for the just exploitation of the world's resources and for the equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity for all mankind.\n42.\tIt is in that perspective that Malaysia views with great concern the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East resulting from a renewed act of aggression by Israel. This latest act of Israeli aggression is manifestly a continuation of Israel's policy of annexation and consolidation of its occupation of Arab lands illegally occupied by force. We are concerned at the latest reports that, in its policy of aggression, Israel has resorted to bombing populated centres, such as Port Said and Damascus, causing many civilian casualties. Israel's continued persistence in carrying out that policy is not only a grave threat to international peace and security but also a serious impediment to the progress of detente and, because of that, it is all the more to be condemned.\n43.\tSince its aggression of 1967, Israel has pursued a policy of systematic defiance of the United Nations Charter, of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and of world public opinion. Consistent with this policy, Israel has persistently aborted several peace initiatives aimed at securing the implementation of Security Council resolutions for the just and durable settlement of the Middle East problems. As a result Israel today is still in occupation of Arab lands acquired by force, and coupled with this continuing act of aggression. Israel is systematically carrying out its plans for the perpetuation of its occupation of Arab lands. Malaysia's sympathies are with the Arab peoples in their efforts to regain their lost territories.\n44.\tIsrael stands condemned not only for its aggression against Arab countries but equally for its refusal to honour and implement General Assembly resolutions on the question of Palestine. After more than 25 years the Palestinians are today still denied their inalienable right to self-determination, and continue to live in enforced exile with increasing misery and mounting desperation.\n45.\tThe renewed armed hostilities in the Middle East further emphasize the urgent need for the solution of the problem. It is more urgent than ever, more urgent than perhaps we care to admit, for this Organization to secure justice and peace for the Middle East on the basis of complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and of respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. This is a renewed challenge for the United Nations, and more particularly for the major Powers with special responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security, for which, in view of their new commitment and vita! stake in the further relaxation of international tension, this is also a challenge of detente.\n46.\tI turn now to other developments in the international scene, some of which are positive in character. Of particular interest to us in Asia is the agreement reached recently between Pakistan and India and Bangladesh. We welcome this whole-heartedly. We hope it will bring to a quick end the misery and sufferings of thousands of those separated from their loved ones. The agreement is an important step towards final reconciliation among the countries on the South Asian subcontinent, with all of which my country enjoys the best of relations. My delegation earnestly hopes that the initiatives already begun will continue and lead towards the final attainment of a just and lasting peace. It is also our sincere hope that Bangladesh will be admitted to membership in the United Nations at the earliest possible opportunity.\n47.\tWe welcome also the constructive efforts by both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to work towards a peaceful solution of their problem and thereby contribute to the relaxation of tension in that area. The dialogue between the two countries is an important break-through in the impasse which has for so long kept the two Koreas in confrontation with each other. We recognize the enormity of the problem between them, but at least the efforts towards reconciliation have begun. As a country enjoying friendly diplomatic relations with both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, Malaysia hopes that these efforts will eventually bring about not only peace but national reunification of the two divided countries.\n48.\tIn our constant striving for international peace and security, the most historic and significant achievement since this General Assembly last met took place in the region of South-East Asia. That was the signing of the\npeace agreements on Viet-Nam. These agreements have been welcomed and endorsed by the international community since they provide a realistic and fair basis for the peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam problem. It is clearly the duty of the international community to help in the implementation of these agreements and to ensure that nothing is done to jeopardize the chances of an early settlement of the problem and therefore delay the restoration of peace and stability in South-East Asia. The people of Viet-Nam should be allowed to decide their own future without further interference by outside Powers. It is indeed tragic in human terms for the people of Viet-Nam that even when the country is formally at peace they should continue to endure the agony and ravages of war. This should serve to emphasize the urgency of the strict implementation of the Paris agreements and scrupulous adherence to all their provisions by all parties concerned. After more than two decades of war and devastation, nothing should now be done to undermine and destroy the solid foundation on which peace should be built in South-East Asia.\n49.\tWe welcome also the signing of the Vientiane Agreement  as another positive contribution towards peace-building in Indo-China in particular, and in a broader sense in the region of South-East Asia. The strict application of the Agreement is therefore important and essential if peace and stability are to be restored and national harmony established in accordance with the aspirations and wishes of the people of Laos.\n50.\tWith regard to Cambodia, it is deeply regretted that no agreement has as yet been attained to stop the armed conflict. We hope that the parties in the conflict will achieve a peaceful settlement of their problem. And in this connexion we believe that the people of that country should be allowed to determine their own future without interference from outside, and that the parties concerned should be allowed to take their own initiatives and work for the reconciliation and settlement of the problem in accordance with their own wishes. Nothing, therefore, should be done that would prejudge the wishes of the Khmer people as this would constitute interference in their affairs. The best contribution we can make towards peace in Cambodia is to show complete and scrupulous respect for the right of the Khmer people to unfettered freedom, without outside interference of any form, to reconcile their differences and achieve a peaceful settlement and national reconciliation.\n51.\tI would now like to address myself to another area which is of serious concern to the international community. I refer in particular to apartheid in South Africa and colonial oppression in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, and other remaining colonial Territories. The peoples of these countries are experiencing the most serious forms of exploitation and oppression, and the failure of the world community to redress their situation has led them to resort to the only legitimate action left that promises some hope of recovering their fundamental human rights and dignity \u2014 that of armed struggle. The recent declaration of independence by Guinea-Bissau is an important development m the struggle of the African peoples against Portuguese colonialism in that continent. The fact remains, however, that the colonialist and racist regimes in Africa arc now even more entrenched in their position, convinced that some of their powerful friends and trading partners, some of which are permanent members of the Security Council, will obstruct any effective action by the United Nations. The persistent repression carried out by these regimes constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a grave threat to international peace and security.\n52.\tOne of the most serious and urgent problems confronting mankind is that of general and complete disarmament. No true and lasting peace is possible while the question of disarmament hangs in the balance. In view of the awesome consequences to mankind of a nuclear holocaust. it is imperative that all nations subscribe to constructive efforts towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. Merely to give verbal acquiescence to disarmament is not enough. It is the hope of my delegation that the spirit of detente will generate a political will among the major Powers seriously to apply themselves to the question of disarmament, for it is they, the major Powers, which, with the awesome arsenals Of destruction in their possession, have the final responsibility for saving mankind from self-annihilation.\n53.\tWe recognize that there has been significant progress in this important field of disarmament where a number of agreements have been signed since 1963 for partial disarmament measures.\n54.\tBut while these significant gains are being made it is with grave concern that my delegation views the recent nuclear tests in complete disregard of world opinion. Both from the point of view of the dangers they pose to the environment and of their effects on the spiralling arms race all forms of nuclear testing must be halted. This is one of the crucial problems which the General Assembly must tackle with the utmost urgency and seriousness. Mankind has a right to demand the cessation of all nuclear testing in all environments. A treaty on such a comprehensive test ban is long overdue.\n55.\tHaving recognized that the question of disarmament is crucial to the attainment of true and durable peace, my delegation would like once again reiterate its support for the convening of a world disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations and pledge its readiness to play a role in that conference.\n56.\tAnother way by which we, the smaller nations, may contribute to disarmament is by creating conditions favourable to the relaxation of tension. In this belief, we welcome and support efforts for the creation of zones of peace. Malaysia, as a signatory to the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 197L3 which seeks to establish South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, welcomed and is working for the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. It is of great interest to us that an area bordering upon our region should be meeting the challenge of detente by seeking to make itself free of big-Power hegemony and interference. In the same spirit, we salute the Treaty of Tlatclolco,  which establishes Latin America as a nuclear-free zone. Malaysia equally welcomes all moves for the creation of other zones of peace and would pledge its support, sympathy and encouragement to those who seek to establish such zones.\n57.\tAs regards the proposal for making South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, Malaysia lakes a realistic approach. The proposal seeks to withdraw the region of South-East Asia from being an arena for major-Power contest for spheres of influence. But we do not see the zone as a tight-knit inward-looking entity that would seek to deprive outside Powers of all their interests in the region. Rather, we envisage a situation where there will be no inhibition upon the pursuit of legitimate interests by all foreign Powers, restricting only the pursuit of illegitimate interests. The proposal additionally seeks to enhance co-operation among States in the region and to develop a sense of regionalism so that all who belong to the region need not feel themselves in a hostile environment. Towards that end Malaysia has established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and, together with our partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEANJ, we are committed to the expansion of this Association to include all States in the region.\n58.\tA committee of senior officials of the signatory nations of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration has been at work to draw up the blueprint for the establishment of the zone. It is the view of Malaysia that satisfactory progress is being made, and upon completion of the blueprint a significant step will have been taken towards the point in time when States in the region begin the process of phasing in the South-East Asian zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, It is our hope that the sense of brotherhood and kinship that we expect to evolve from our partnership in the proposed zone will result in a solidarity that will prevent our differences from assuming proportions which in the past have resulted in their exploitation by those outside the region, to our terrible cost.\n59.\tMalaysia is encouraged by the understanding and support already given to this proposal, particularly by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in August in Ottawa and the fourth non-aligned summit Conference in September in Algiers. The declared will of the major Powers to work towards true and permanent peace, and their profession of the spirit of detente are grounds for further encouragement for the realization of this regional initiative.\n60.\tBefore I move to the problems confronting us on the international economic scene, I would like to address myself briefly to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Malaysia has profound interest in the Conference and hopes that it will achieve positive results in establishing an equitable basis upon which the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction could be shared among the nations of the world. It is also our hope that the Conference will achieve agreements on a wide range of issues, such as the question of sovereignty over territorial seas, to which Malaysia as a littoral State attaches the utmost importance. Malaysia takes an active interest in the subjects and issues that have been seriously considered by the sea-bed Committee  and will work positively towards the establishment of a law of the sea that would be more fair and realistic, and one that would take into account the legitimate interests and rights of all States, particularly those in the developing world.\n61.\tIn the economic and social fields, the problems confronting the developing countries continue to cry out for attention. Most of the developing countries are beset with problems of mass poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, hunger, disease, maldistribution of income, low levels of productivity, an inadequate net flow of external resources and an increasing debt burden. These are not new problems. Yet, despite our best intentions and despite the efforts of the international community, the problems continue to confront us with growing complexity and increasing urgency. The fact is that time is not on our side. The third world cannot afford the luxury of waiting at the pleasure of the developed countries before we can hope to receive a sympathetic hearing or a helping hand from the richer and more industrialized countries, most of which laid the foundations of their present-day prosperity through the exploitation of the human and natural resources of the developing countries. If detente in practical terms means the finding of a modus vivendi among the richer and more powerful countries on the issues of peace and security without at the same time making a perceptible and measurable movement towards finding a solution to the problems of economic and social development facing the developing countries, then detente for the developing countries will fall short of our expectations.\n62.\tIn 1970, in an atmosphere filled with promise and hope, we adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Yet, with only two years gone by, the signs are very ominous, and the preliminary assessment is not at all encouraging. The Committee on Development Planning, a committee of experts, has concluded in its report  that the Strategy remains very much more a wish than a policy, and it goes on to say that the cause of development has lost momentum. No doubt we will be discussing the question of review and appraisal of the Second United Nations Development Decade in greater detail later. Suffice it for me to say here that the objective of the discussions should not be to make recriminations or to apportion blame but to infuse the Strategy with new life and lift it from the doldrums by identifying the shortfalls and reasons for them and by bringing it up to date with the inclusion of fresh ideas and innovations that have come to the forefront since the Strategy was adopted. A concerted effort has to be made to ensure that the provisions of the Strategy are implemented. Developed countries should not seize upon the reservations and objections they entered when the Strategy was adopted as an excuse to evade their responsibilities. What is needed is the political will among all of us, more particularly by the developed countries, to make a true success of the Strategy.\n63.\tOne area where there is a need for the political will to manifest itself is on the question of official development assistance under the Strategy. Not only has such development assistance from the developed countries fallen short of the prescribed target, but the rate has in fact shown some decline. This is indeed a matter of grave concern, and one which undoubtedly will be given great attention in our later deliberations.\n64.\tIn a period which stands out singularly for its lack of initiatives in the field of trade, the multinational trade negotiations now taking place represent a welcome initiative on the part of the developed countries. However, following the experience gained from the previous rounds of negotiations, developing countries cannot but express guarded optimism at the outcome of the current negotiations. What is of paramount importance to the developing countries is that their interests are not lost sight of and that they would indeed gain tangible and lasting benefits from trade liberalization measures which will be discussed at the negotiations. This is not asking for much, for such measures would have mutually beneficial results, both for the developed and for the developing countries. More trade would mean that the developing countries would be able to increase not only the tempo of their development efforts through the expansion of their export earnings, but also their purchases from developed countries, thus eventually contributing to a viable system of world trade and payments.\n65.\tThe progress made towards that end will be consolidated if we can, at the same time, bring about reforms in the present unstable monetary system as soon as possible, resulting in a stable and durable monetary order that will take into account the special interests of the developing countries and the need for them to participate fully in the decision-making process.\n66.\tSince I have said much about developed countries and what is expected of them, it may justifiably be asked what sort of role developing countries themselves should play. The answer to this is clearly stated in the Strategy: the developing countries themselves bear the primary responsibility for their own economic and social development. The Strategy also establishes the well-being of the individual as the ultimate objective of development.\n67.\tMalaysia is mindful of that, and all our national efforts are geared towards that objective. As our Prime Minister has said, \\\"No plan is good enough until it has reached the people and has received their acquiescence.\\\" Hence there is active participation of the people at all levels in the development process. We in Malaysia have learned through painful experience that pursuit of the growth of the gross national product alone is not enough and that socio-cultural factors have also to be taken into account. That is especially so in Malaysia's case, where inequalities in the distribution of income coincide with racial divisions.\n68.\tHence the main objectives of the second Malaysia plan 1971-1975 are to eradicate poverty among all, to bring about a more equitable distribution of income, to ensure balanced development between the urban and rural areas, to create more employment opportunities for the growing labour force, to eradicate racial distinction in economic functions and to restructure society as a whole. In addition to that, the Malaysian Government has also oriented its educational programmes towards meeting the increasing demands for technical and managerial skills and is pursuing an active policy on family planning. Thus our development plan aims not only at the economic betterment of the country but at achieving it in a way that will improve the quality of life of all our people and promote the unity of the nation.\n69.\tIn order to meet the challenge of economic development it is imperative that the developing countries improve their bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis the developed countries. The developing countries are individually prone to the vagaries of international economic and financial relations, and find themselves at the mercy of market forces dominated by the developed countries. Developing countries are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of mutual assistance, cooperation and self-reliance among themselves. It is only by standing together, by trading more with one another, by establishing institutional frameworks within which such trade can be conducted and by exchanging experiences which are relevant to the aspirations of their peoples that they can reduce the impact of adverse developments on their economies and development efforts.\n70.\tThat point was underscored by the recent summit meeting of non-aligned countries. The meeting called for the convening of a conference of developing countries on commodities which would give them the opportunity to work for a fair deal in world trade. That will go a long way in improving the bargaining position of the third world. The success achieved by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] in that respect is a very good example of what can be achieved through action based on solidarity and co-operation. If developing countries take those steps we shall then have achieved something we can be truly proud of.\n71.\tIn conclusion I wish to say that my delegation looks to the future not only with great expectations but also with the realization that those expectations can reach fruition only if we respond with dynamism to changing situations. Rarely has mankind faced such a challenge and opportunity as we now; see before us. It is vital that the nations of the world have the strength and the wisdom to rise to the occasion and meet this challenge and opportunity with a positive and dynamic response. For only then can we bring ourselves nearer to the attainment\nof universal peace and a better quality of life for all."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tMr. President, greeting you on behalf of the country that I have the honour to represent is not only the fulfilment of a routine, but it is a resumption of a personal dialogue and an official exchange that we started in Mexico, when you were Secretary-General of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America [OPANAL], a post in which you, as usual, performed brilliantly. I therefore am fully aware of your ability and your capacity, which have justifiably placed you in the post of President of the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that you will fulfil your duties as President with the good judgement and calmness that you have always shown in your long career in different international bodies. I congratulate you most sincerely.\n2.\tThe breath of death sweeps America and the world as a whole. A cold spectre lowers over our continent. A champion of democracy who tried to achieve the redemption of the needy of his country has died.\n3.\tA few days ago you yourself, Mr. President, in your inaugural statement mentioned your deeply felt conviction that the constitutional President of Chile was \\\"... a man who loved his people and defended his ideals with his blood and his life.\\\" [2117th meeting, para. 40.]\n4.\tWe fully share that assessment. It is for that reason that we wish to pay a tribute to the memory of Salvador Allende, who died in the defence of freedom and social justice. This enlightened Head of State waged war without quarter to achieve the desires of his country. Perhaps for the first time, a real effort was made to achieve profound structural changes in the life of a nation heading towards socialism, while remaining within the democratic, legal and peaceful way of life. The entire world followed that new experiment with great interest, and a number of nations, with deeply-rooted hope. Today that hope has perished \u2014 even though the fervour and the love for the hero that fell will continue \u2014  exactly as five years ago that noble effort of giving socialism a human visage died also.\n5.\tMy country believes that violence is not the answer, nor is the destruction of freedom. The President of Mexico himself put it: \\\"Any action adopted against a free people diminishes the total freedom of all, and thus inevitably affects us all.\\\"\n6.\tIt would appear that at this tragic moment Chile has lost its best sons: Pablo Neruda is dead. When my country learned of the horrors in the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago we invited the great poet of Isla Negra to reside in Mexico and restore his precarious health. The invitation was accepted, but, unfortunately, it could not be complied with.\n7.\tWe have always scrupulously respected that noble institution of Latin America, the right of asylum, quite irrespective of the ideology or political leanings of the one , persecuted. Thus the Mexican Embassy in Santiago opened its doors to all who felt themselves seriously threatened, and\na good number of them are today on Mexican soil. We hope that the requirements of the existing inter-American agreements on this question will be strictly complied with, for we are convinced that the eyes of all the peoples of the world are now focused on Chile and are carefully watching the evolution of the situation, .\n8.\tAs far as the foreigners there are concerned, many of them refugees from other Latin American countries \u2014  , whose number has been assessed at approximately 14,000 \u2014  we are encouraged by the information made public by the Secretary-General of the United Nations regarding his own efforts and those of other high international officials and regarding official safeguards offered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile.\n9.\tHowever, the situation prevailing is still extremely grave. We are particularly concerned about the fate of the political prisoners for whose lives and freedom \u2014 within the framework of human rights \u2014 the General Assembly should continue to be alert and vigilant.\n10.\tThe situation prevailing in southern Africa continues to be intolerable. There the most elementary human rights are ignored because of the colour of a person's skin, and the practice of racial discrimination has been raised to the level of State policy. But, like peace, freedom is indivisible. While there are peoples subjected to colonialism or racial discrimination, men of good will cannot remain calm or satisfied. Our Organization must continue to struggle in order completely and definitely to eliminate colonialism in all its forms and manifestations, whether direct or indirect, whether political or economic. The Mexican delegation is ready to contribute to the study of measures that should be adopted to achieve that end,\n11.\tI should like to congratulate the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their admission to membership in our Organization. Thus our Organization is coming even closer to the effective fulfilment of the principle of universality. We trust that soon we shall be able to welcome equally those States that are not yet Members of the United Nations.\n12.\tThe International Law Commission has just celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence. Its work has contributed greatly to the codification and progressive development of international law. A not unimportant portion of contemporary international law has now been incorporated in a number of treaties, thanks to its constant activity. I am very happy to extend our congratulations to that body on its praiseworthy efforts.\n13.\tThere are many items on the agenda of the present session of the Assembly that call for our particular attention. However, it would be impossible for us at the moment to examine them all. We shall have an opportunity to present our views on the majority of them when they come up for consideration in the relevant main Committees or in the plenary meetings of the Assembly. Therefore, I shall limit myself at this time to making known the views of Mexico on four of those items which, because of their ramifications and important implications, are of greater significance and, we believe, cannot be over-stressed: the law of the sea, disarmament, the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the charter of economic rights and duties of States.\n14.\tThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, which has been preparing the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has just concluded its work in Geneva without having achieved significant agreement on substantive questions, such as the demarcation of the territorial sea, the nature and characteristics of the zone of national jurisdiction \u2014 which we have baptized the \\\"patrimonial sea\\\" \u2014 certain aspects of the delimitation of the\ncontinental shelf, and the regime to be applied to what has been called \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\".\n15.\tDoubtless that situation arose owing to the fact that all the efforts made were not sufficient to achieve agreements that are indispensable. We wonder, in these circumstances, whether we are in a position to start a conference on the date set by the General Assembly, or whether we might not be better advised to make a last effort that would allow us to go to that meeting with an adequate basis to work on.\n16.\tIn order to do so, we believe that the best procedure might well be the following: to inaugurate the Conference here, as provided, in the month of November; to hold an organizational and procedural session for a period of two weeks; to convene a preliminary meeting in which all States invited to the Conference would take part. The preliminary meeting could be held in March or April, either in New York or in Geneva; negotiations would concentrate on those problems that constitute the nub of the future law of the sea, leaving for July and August the task of elaborating the corresponding instruments.\n17.\tWe are convinced that, during the three years of preparatory work, although agreements have not been arrived at, nevertheless the essential basis of what might become the common concepts of a great number of countries has been laid. I refer to the new concept of the \\\"patrimonial sea\\\", as we, the countries which signed the Declaration of Santo Domingo,1 have called it, or the \\\"exclusive economic zone1', as the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have preferred to call it.\n18.\tThis concept includes two inseparable elements: a territorial sea with a maximum width of 12 nautical miles, over which the coastal State exercises full sovereignty, and a zone adjacent to the territorial sea and extending for a distance of 200 nautical miles.\n19.\tIn that oceanic zone the coastal State does not exercise sovereignty as it does over the territorial sea, since it must scrupulously respect the rights of all States, either coastal or land-locked, to the freedom of navigation and over flight and to the laying of submarine cables or pipelines. However, in that zone the sovereign rights of the coastal States would be recognized with respect to renewable and non-renewable resources that may be found in the water column, on the sea-bed and in the subsoil thereof, together with rights relating to the regulation of scientific research and the prevention of the contamination of the marine environment.\n20.\tAs was evident during the negotiations that have taken place, we believe sincerely that this new definition can satisfy the great majority of States.\n21.\tFortunately, this time we are not facing a position whereby the developing world is placed in confrontation with the highly industrialized countries. We have noted with satisfaction that the concept of an exclusive economic zone, or patrimonial sea, has been accepted and defended by members of both groups.\n22.\tWe are now approaching the middle of the decade which the General Assembly agreed in 1969 to proclaim as the Disarmament Decade [resolution 2602E(XXIV)]. At the same time, and with good reason, the Assembly emphasized the beneficial influence that this Decade could have on the strengthening of international security and on the encouragement of economic development.\n23.\tWe therefore find it inexplicable that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should once again come to this high body of the United Nations, just as it did last year, with empty hands.\n24.\tWe share the view expressed by many of its members, among them Mexico, and reflected in the 1973 report [A/9141-DC/236], namely, that the primary responsibility falls on the two States that have been jointly serving as Chairmen of the Committee, and that there is no reason whatsoever that can justify the stagnation in the Committee's work or the present lack of effective negotiations.\n25.\tIt is now up to the Assembly to pass judgement and adopt decisions in order to remedy this disturbing situation concerning disarmament. As an illustration, it is sufficient to recall that nuclear arsenals exist that represent such a capacity of \\\"over-kill\\\" that they are more than sufficient to blot out, not once but many times over, every sign of life on this planet; that the amount annually squandered in military spending amounts to more than $220,000 million, in other words, a sum 30 times greater than the amount the developed countries are induced, with a great effort, to earmark annually in the form of official assistance for development; and that we are confronted with an unbridled arms race aimed at increasing the already terrifying destructive potential of nuclear weapons and designed to produce, among non-nuclear weapons, refinements of cruelty and indiscriminate extermination that must be inconceivable to any sound mind.\n26.\tAmong the decisions that the General Assembly should adopt, there should be one, we believe, unequivocally reaffirming that general and complete disarmament under effective international control \u2014 that same question which, first in 1959 [resolution 1378 (XIV)}, and for a second time 10 years later [resolution 2602 E (XXIV)], the General Assembly itself described as the most important question facing the world today \u2014 continues to be, and must continue to be, the final goal of all the efforts of the international community in this sphere of action. Thus, too, it should be made perfectly clear that one of the primary stages to be achieved in order to reach that goal must be the destruction of the enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons already accumulated, and a strict prohibition on any future resumption of their production.\n27.\tAmong those same decisions, we believe that there should be one involving also the approval of a number of resolutions calling for a total cessation of nuclear weapons tests and the elimination of all chemical weapons. These are two matters which, as the United Nations has so often repeated, warrant the highest priority.\n28.\tThe frustrating sterility of the negotiations in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament led Mexico, last February, at the beginning of the 1973 session of that body, to suggest an immediate examination of other subjects, first and foremost among them the reduction of military budgets. It is therefore natural that we should have been gratified at the formal request submitted by the Minister for Foreign Relations of the Soviet Union, Andrei Gromyko, that there be included in the agenda of the present Assembly session an item, the consideration of which might lead to an agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council making possible equitable reductions in their respective military budgets, together with the employment of the resources thus saved for assistance to developing countries [A/9191].\n29.\tWith regard to the machinery available to the United Nations for disarmament, the experience of the last two years has made apparent the urgent and unavoidable need to strengthen the only deliberative body \u2014 the General Assembly \u2014 which in practice has been functioning, and to reorganize thoroughly or to replace the negotiating body, namely the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament.\n30.\tWe are convinced that it is indispensable for us, at this session, to establish a body whose task will be to bring about the timely convening of a world disarmament conference at which all States will be able to set forth adequately their views on the problem of disarmament that so vitally affects the interests of all peoples. We venture to hope also that such a body, regardless of the name it may be given, should have a membership and terms of reference that will guarantee the co-operation of all the nuclear Powers, so that a repetition of the sad experience of the so-called Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference maybe avoided.\n31.\tWith regard to the negotiating body, we believe it would be advisable for the General Assembly, using whatever procedures it may deem appropriate, to explore without delay the question of what reforms in composition and in procedure should be recommended, so that the negotiating body on disarmament may be rendered more effective and, in particular, be able to count on the participation of all the nuclear Powers.\n32.\tQuite contrary to what has been occurring in the rest of the world, in Latin America the regime of total absence of nuclear weapons set forth in the Treaty of Tlatelolco2 \u2014 for which the Government of Mexico has the honour of serving as depositary Government \u2014 has continued to progress and gain strength.\n33.\tAs a result of the discussions held by the President of Mexico with the Heads of State of the French Republic and the People's Republic of China in the course of the visit he made to both those countries in the spring of this year, the French Government decided to sign Additional Protocol II of the Treaty on 18 July last, and the Chinese Government did so on 21 August.\n34.\tThose significant acts, which will doubtless be complemented in the near future by the corresponding ratifications, have strengthened the efficiency of the Treaty. In fact, it will be recalled that the nuclear Powers Parties to the Protocol committed themselves both to the obligation of\nfully respecting the statute of denuclearization in respect to warlike purposes as defined in the provisions of the Treaty and pledged themselves not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the contracting parties to the Treaty.\n35.\tSince it is well known that the United Kingdom and the United States had already in the past acceded to the Protocol, the steps now taken by France and China mean that only one of the five nuclear Powers is still withholding its co-operation regarding the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone, the only densely populated zone thus far established as nuclear-free.\n36.\tI take advantage of this opportunity to appeal to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to reconsider its attitude and to accept the obligations deriving from Additional Protocol II of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\n37.\tIt might almost seem redundant  \u2014  since they are so obvious  \u2014  for us to stress the grave crises that afflict our world today, but we cannot complacently watch world inflation, the imbalance of the terms of trade, the food crisis, the absence of regulations governing the transfer of technology, the interventionist and unbridled attitude of a great number of transnational corporations, the lack of an adequate demographic programme, the lack of a balanced and generalized utilization of the resources of the sea and of a rational preservation of the environment. All those deplorable conditions are just so many serious problems which the United Nations must consider, and regulate \u2014  and do so immediately.\n38.\tTo refer merely to what I might term the \\\"food crisis\\\", damaging meteorological phenomena, plagues, diseases, human carelessness and the irrational utilization of natural resources all depict a panorama of despair. In 1972 wheat production was limited to 300 million tons, that is to say, 6 per cent less than the 1971 world harvest. For the present year the supply of rice has been termed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] as barely enough, in marked contrast to the abundant surpluses during the last three years. With regard to secondary cereals \u2014 corn, sorghum, millet, barley, oats and rye \u2014 it has been calculated that in 1972 their production amounted to 555 million tons, that is to say, 20 million tons less than in 1971. Generally speaking, the reduction of food supplies has increased the demand and, therefore, caused a general rise in the cost of the majority of food products, They have also suffered very adversely from speculation and financial crises which have also aggravated the situation.\n39.\tIn the last few years the Mexican Government has stressed its foreign trade, seeking to promote and diversify our international economic relations. It was for this reason that we went to the Tokyo Ministerial Meeting to start new trade negotiations of a multilateral nature within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GAIT].\n40.\tIn the course of the GATT negotiations the fundamental concepts of non-reciprocity, non-discrimination and preferential treatment in trade relations of the developed countries with the developing countries were encouraged and advanced, so that the developing nations can enjoy fair and increased participation in world trade.\n41.\tMexico was also present at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund [IMF], held from 24 to 28 September in Nairobi, Kenya. The Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. Jose L6pez Portillo, was selected as the spokesman for Latin America, and through him Mexico reiterated its traditional position concerning international monetary reform. He emphasized the fact that Latin Americans do not consider a reform complete unless it simultaneously and interrelatedly includes the transfer of real resources to the developing countries, at adequate rates and on adequate terms. One sentence by the Mexican Secretary of Finance summed up the philosophy that should underlie economic relations among nations. He said: \\\"The powerful countries belong to humanity and not humanity to the powerful countries.\\\"\n42.\tAware of the problems and the crises afflicting our generation and threatening to continue with greater recurrence in the times through which our descendants will live, the President of Mexico, Mr. Luis Echeverria, sensing the feelings of all and consonant with the active foreign policy that his Government is pursuing, proposed to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] at its third session, held in Santiago, Chile, in April 1972, that there be prepared and approved a charter of economic rights and duties of States.3 The proposal was approved and transmitted to the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and the Assembly decided [resolution 3037 (XXVII)] that a group on 40 nations, to be designated by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, Mr. Manuel Perez Guerrero, would devote itself to the noble task of drafting the charter. That group of 40 has earned our congratulations for its hard work. It has concluded its task and its report is now before the present session and is to be considered in the Second Committee.''\n43.\tOne extremely important point in the course of elaborating that charter is the fact that it was the subject of a special section of the Economic Declaration approved at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers, at the beginning of September of this year. Section XIII reads:\n\\\"The non-aligned nations deem it necessary that the United Nations General Assembly should give priority at its twenty-eighth session, to the elaboration of the Charter of economic rights and duties of States.\n\\\"This document should give expression to the economic aspirations of countries struggling to achieve over-all development as well as those of the international community as a whole.\\\" \n44.\tThe manifest support given by the Heads of State and Government of so many varied and important countries present at that Conference of non-aligned countries comforts us greatly. We are also grateful for the express reference which was most constructively and positively made by the recently designated Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Henry Kissinger, when he spoke of the charter\nof economic rights and duties of States. We should like also to express our appreciation to all the other representatives who have offered or may in the future offer their support for this initiative.\n45.\tThe hour to act has struck. Millions of people are concerned and worried or living in misery and want. The line of \\\"the hungry encircles the world. Technological progress is still the monopoly of a few. Many transnational corporations are continuing to disturb the situation. World inflation cruelly oppresses the developing nations and foodstuffs are lacking while populations are growing dangerously. The resources of the sea are being utilized indiscriminately by the great naval Powers. The environment is deteriorating, endangering human life. Are we to be imperturbable, indifferent and insensitive as we watch this increasingly terrifying situation? Are we going to allow succeeding generations \u2014 if they succeed in existing \u2014 to call us irresponsible?\n46.\tThe proposal of the Mexican President does not, and should not, belong exclusively to my country. It is a common cause. It is a generous and worthy undertaking of all mankind. Let us not allow routine or bureaucracy to delay, vitiate or damage that noble effort. Let us speed our procedures, come to agreements quickly \u2014 in a word, let us approve this indispensable document as soon as we can.\n47.\tThis great international pledge must contain, among other fundamental concepts, that of the right of States freely to dispose of their natural resources, to regulate and govern foreign investment, to participate in the international decision-making process in the solution of world economic and monetary problems and to share in the benefits resulting there from, and to participate in fair and balanced world trade,\n48.\tWe must also govern the obligation of States not to discriminate on the basis of political, economic or social systems, to introduce structural changes in the world economy in order to achieve an international division of labour that is just and rational, to facilitate the widest possible access to the benefits deriving from the progress and achievements in science and technology and to give technical and financial assistance in favourable conditions, and also the duty of all States to safeguard the common heritage of mankind and protect and improve the human environment.\n49.\tIf the Charter of the United Nations is primarily a political alliance for maintaining international peace and security, let the charter of economic rights and duties of States be an economic alliance that will unite us in progress and welfare. Once and for all, let us put an end to economic discrimination. Let there no longer be apartheid in the distribution of benefits. Let not poverty be a constant stimulus for revolution and war, Let us do away with what divides us. Let us exalt what unites us.\n50.\tGreece left us an ethical heritage; Rome a legal one. The mediaeval era left us religion. The Renaissance left us aesthetics \u2014 and so on. Each generation has distinguished itself by leaving a fruitful heritage to its heirs. Our generation, that of the twentieth century, although it has been outstanding because of its prodigious technological progress, has also suffered two great world conflagrations and the threat of a third which, if it were to occur, would inevitably be the last. Are we incapable of leaving a more advantageous, more generous heritage to our succeeding generations?\n51.\tLet us here and now prove that we have gone through this world, not leaving marks of violence and aggression, but giving birth to and creating a more just and more prosperous society."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tThe twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is presided over by a prominent representative of Ecuadorian diplomacy. Your rich experience, Mr. President, in the various organs of the United Nations will contribute greatly to the success of this session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Austrian delegation I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election. I would add to these our best wishes for the exercise of your high office.\n2.\tThe general debate so far has provided an accurate reflection of the political situation of the world. That is a good thing. It shows that the United Nations is close to real life  \u2014  in other words, that it constitutes a reality in the political process. That fact alone enhances its effectiveness \u2014 an effectiveness which is of service to all States and, in particular, to small and medium-sized countries.\n3.\tThe word \\\"detente \\\" has been heard in each of the statements made in the debate so far. There are good reasons for that. The process of detente throughout the world has indeed moved forward since last year. In the past year no new centre of international conflict has emerged. That is of itself a considerable achievement, since it shows that local or continent-wide detente is not only of significance for those directly involved, but also improves the climate of world politics as a whole, and that in turn promotes the settlement of conflicts of interest, even serious ones, between States that were not originally participating in the process of detente.\n4.\tHowever, it is not only detente that has been reflected in the course of the general debate so far. For those who have followed this debate, it has been impossible to overlook the continuing tensions of ideology, power politics and nationalism which still exist on various continents. The causes of conflict in the world are still numerous. Even without these causes of conflict constantly before our eyes, we could deduce their existence from the fact that advances in the field of disarmament and even in the limitation of the arms race have been extremely modest until now.\n5.\tThis is frightening for a world whose natural resources are beginning to be recognized as limited and whose inhabitants strive, as we all know, for quality of life rather than quality of weapons. Terrifying as this escalation of armaments may be, it is understandable in view of the fact that even today, and even among Members of the United Nations, it is not the removal of the causes of conflict or mutual faith in the peaceful settlement of disputes which guarantees peaceful coexistence, but the balance of military potential or \u2014 to take a term from the vocabulary of atomic- age philosophy \u2014 the concept of mutual assured destruction.\n6.\tComing at a time when we are not only talking about detente, but when, in wide parts of the world, strong elements of detente manifest themselves, these meetings in New York could and should afford us new opportunities to reflect on what we can contribute to the creation of a better world.\n7.\tThe present process of detente began by initiatives on the bilateral level. Without wishing to be exhaustive, I refer here, in a global context, to the rapprochement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union and to the establishment of a new relationship between the United States and China. On the European scale, this process of detente has been marked by the treaties the Federal Republic of Germany has concluded with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland, the treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Bilateral initiatives were a prerequisite for these developments. We owe our gratitude to all the statesmen who undertook them and contributed to their success. Our task now, it seems to me, is to multilateralize these bilateral efforts \u2014 in other words, to render them of service to all other States on a broad international level.\n8.\tThis multilateralization of detente is necessary, as it reduces the incidence of crises in bilateral relations, which, as experience shows, are normally prone to it. It creates a \nkind of network which strengthens bilateral detente, and also means that States which were not parties to the original initiatives can profit from this lessening of tension.\n9.\tOn the global level, the United Nations offers the best means for multilateralizing detente. On the European level, we have the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, from which, judging by experience gained so far, the participating States can expect a certain additional degree of security and, above all, an additional degree of co-operation.\n10.\tThe admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations is a clearly visible sign of the present developments in Europe \u2014 and not only in Europe. My Government has never left any doubt that it sincerely wanted the admission of these two States to the United Nations. Their membership is not only an expression of normalization in Europe, but also a further step towards universality and greater effectiveness of the United Nations itself. May I therefore take this opportunity to extend once more a warm welcome to the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and also to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, as Members of this world Organization.\n11.\tSmaller States \u2014 and they in particular \u2014 have to make their contribution to the multilateralization of detente. This duty can be discharged not only by constructive cooperation in international organizations, but also by the development of bilateral relations with other States, especially those which are our neighbours. Every day we all are faced with new problems in our respective regions. Differences of interest may and do arise. It depends upon us, on our approach to them, to find suitable and acceptable compromises in line with the new climate which is starting to prevail in international relations. If we wish to avoid outside interference, we have to settle our affairs by our own efforts. Conflicts of interest between States must be settled at the negotiating table. We are always ready to sit down to discuss problems which have arisen and to try to find solutions to them. Even if such negotiations should take a long time, we are convinced that patience and good faith will be rewarded by success.\n12.\tAn example of this is the treatment of the question of South Tyrol, which was the subject matter of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI). Three years ago, I was able to inform the General Assembly that Austria and Italy had agreed on a proposal for a solution which made provision for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol and a relevant time-table agreed to by both States. \n13.\tI am happy to be able to state that the implementation of the proposal for a settlement of this question has made further progress since the last session of the General Assembly, and that the major part of the measures have been implemented through appropriate legislative and administrative instruments. A certain part of those measures is, however, still open. May I express the hope that the developments now in progress will continue to advance in a satisfactory way, which, in turn, will lead to an even better relationship between the two neighbouring countries.\n14.\tAs far as Europe is concerned, the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Helsinki at the Foreign Minister level, established 10 principles which should prove of basic significance to mutual relations among States. I will not repeat them here. They are in full accord with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which this General Assembly adopted on 24 October 1970 [resolution 2625 (XXV)\\ These principles confer rights and impose obligations. Where they confer rights, these rights must be exercised within a framework corresponding to the present state of affairs in the world. Where they impose obligations, these obligations must be discharged in good faith. Only in this way can we take those small steps which are necessary in order to make the process of detente irreversible.\n15.\tDetente is not an end in itself. From detente we must go on to co-operation in the widest possible sense. But we can do so only if we are supported by public opinion, if we are able to convince our citizens that detente and cooperation are of direct benefit to them. Their support of such policies will in turn influence the process of detente, give it new impetus and open up new vistas of international co-operation.\n16.\tAs is well known, the citizens of Austria have, with the citizens of our neighbours, many personal ties which have their roots in history. We do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, just as we would resist any attempt to interfere in our own internal affairs. But I refuse to believe that an appeal to remove administrative obstacles to the reunion of families, to the visiting of old and sick relatives and to the very personal decision man makes in choosing a partner for life constitutes interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\n17.\tIn recent days, the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Federal Government have come into the spotlight of international interest, and there have been misunderstandings about Austria's basic philosophy in certain respects. I therefore feel the Assembly is entitled to expect a clarification from me in this respect.\n18.\tFirst, with regard to the aspect of terrorism, it is the Austrian Government which has for several years \u2014 in the International Civil Aviation Organization, in the General Assembly, and, at the regional level, in the Council for Europe \u2014 very strongly advocated multilateral action against terrorism. Effective and practical measures to combat international terrorism can be devised only at the international level, if they are really to be successful. All members are aware that to date the international community has not been able to agree on such international measures.\n19.\tAs long as no such international co-operation exists in the field of terrorism, each State will be compelled to face alone this new form of warfare directed against those not parties to a conflict. Accordingly, reactions to an act of terror will not and cannot be the same in all countries. Guided by its humanitarian principles, my Government regards the saving of human life as the overriding objective which transcends all others. That and that alone is the reason why my Government did everything to create the pre-conditions which made it possible for the four hostages taken in the terrorist act of 28 September to be freed.\n20.\tI do not wish now to dwell in detail on the way in which the Foreign Minister of Israel commented from this rostrum Wednesday [2139th meeting] on the act of terrorism perpetrated in Austria on 28 September 1973, and on the Austrian reactions to it. My Government is convinced that terrorists are not given encouragement by the fact that a Government is not prepared to sacrifice human lives. Past experience provides ample proof that even the supreme sacrifice has not been a deterrent; nor will it be so in the future. The main responsibility for the persistence of terrorism lies with those who have contributed to the blocking of efforts to establish effective international co-operation against terrorism. A world-wide disease can be fought successfully only with world-wide remedies.\n21.\tThose who really care for the fate of people desiring to travel through Austria on their way to their new homes should not make Schoenau Castle their battle cry or an ideology. Nobody can profit from a campaign against Austria, especially not the people for whom it appears to be organized. Such a campaign will never serve any purpose. My Government will not yield to any pressure, wherever it may come from, and expects that all States will, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, refrain from interfering in Austria's internal affairs. It would seem advisable not to lose one's sense of proportion and to endeavour to find the way to objective judgements and appraisals.\n22.\tMy Government leaves the door wide open for any future talks on humanitarian questions, and thus I come to the second aspect of this matter: the humanitarian position Austria has taken in the past, is taking at present and will take in the future.\n23.\tSince regaining full independence, the Austrian Government and the Austrian people have received several hundred thousand refugees. Those who wished to continue their journey were able to do so; those who wished to remain in Austria have become citizens, integrated into the Austrian people. They thus have become not a source of unrest but an element contributing to peace in Europe. Furthermore, the Austrian Government and the Austrian people have, since I960 alone, greatly facilitated, and indeed made possible, the transit through Austria of about 165,000 persons seeking to make their future home in Israel.\n24.\tAustria would have acted, and did act, in the same way also towards all other people irrespective of their nationality, their colour, their race, their religion and their political convictions. This, too, remains valid for the future.\n25.\tI do not say this because the Austrian Government or the Austrian people expect special recognition for it, but because it seems to me that a reference to past practice is the most appropriate means to dispel misunderstandings and misinterpretations about Austria's humanitarian attitude now and in the future. The Austrian Prime Minister, Bruno Kreisky, made this abundantly clear when, on 29 September 1973, he said:\n\\\"Austria is committed to the principles of democracy and humanitarianism, and I wish to emphasize that nothing will change in our basic attitude, our laws or our humanitarian practice because of what has happened or what may yet happen. In the interest of maintaining peace within Austria, certain minor changes will be made, but there will be no fundamental changes in our humanitarian approach. Austria remains a country which extends asylum to everyone who feels persecuted, and offers everyone who wishes to reach another country via Austria the opportunity to do so.\\\"\nThat is Austria's position. My Government is also ready to co-operate with international organizations, in particular the United Nations, if they are in a position to accept part of the responsibility which in the past Austria has carried alone.\n26.\tPermit me finally to return briefly to the problems facing the United Nations. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, to whom we pay tribute for his devoted work on behalf of our world Organization, asked in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the question:\n\\\"Do the majority of Member States really want an organization which is more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies? Do they really want an organization which can play a useful and active role in focusing international efforts on the solution of the most difficult and controversial problems and which in doing so will in certain situations develop an impetus of its own?\\\" \n27.\tMy Government's answer to that question is a very short and simple one, based both on Austria's own interests and on the principle of international solidarity. The answer is, Yes, we want such a world Organization, and we are prepared to work together with other nations for it."

        "file_text": "\ufeff237.\tIt is with particular pleasure that my delegation associates itself with the speakers who have extended congratulations to Ambassador Benites on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This election marks the crowning point of an outstanding career that has been devoted to the service of world peace and understanding among peoples. The high office of the presidency to which he was so deservedly elected is made more significant this session because of the unique opportunity offered and the challenge involved to derive the most for mankind from the new trend of negotiation, peaceful coexistence and contact, which hopefully appeared on the world scene during the past two sessions of the General Assembly. My delegation is certain that under his wise guidance and leadership our work will be effectively accomplished in a spirit of co-operation that will contribute significantly towards peace and harmony in the world.\n238.\tI should like also to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation which preceding speakers have addressed to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, for the able and statesmanlike manner in which he guided the deliberations of this body during the preceding session.\n239.\tAs the President has so rightly observed, the outstanding feature of this Assembly session is that it marks the beginning of genuine universality. I take great pleasure in extending a warm welcome to the three new Member States of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, the proposals for whose admission Cyprus sponsored as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. We hope and trust that the constructive participation of the two German States in the work of the United Nations and the beneficial influence of the Charter principles will prove conducive to the closer co-operation and unity of the great German nation. Our traditional stand has always been and continues to be for the unity and integrity of all nations and peoples. World experience during the years after the Second World War has amply demonstrated that partition is an ever-bleeding wound in the body of any country.\n240.\tThe twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly has convened in an atmosphere of confidence and hope. Not since 1946, when this Assembly held its first session, have there been so many good auguries for peace in the world, and such revival of hope for the emergence of an era of conciliation and relaxation of tensions.\n241.\tIn the past year the course of international relations continued to be influenced by the spirit of the Charter, and, further to peaceful coexistence, great efforts were exerted to promote international co-operation among States with different social and political systems.\n242.\tThe process of detente, which had commenced among the big Powers, was followed this year by the personal meetings between leading Heads of State. Such meetings are of fundamental importance and are beneficial to the cause of peace, in view of the great responsibilities which their countries bear for the maintenance of international peace and security. When relations among these Powers develop on the basis of mutual accommodation and cooperation, they exert favourable influence on the international situation as a whole. The cessation of hostilities in Viet-Nam and the resulting truce agreement is, we believe, a case in point, and one which the world community has welcomed as a triumph of statesmanship, and as a-good point of departure for achieving durable peace in that part of the world. At the same time, I wish to express the hope and conviction that accommodation among the big Powers will not result in a situation in which the legitimate interests of small countries would be ignored.\n243.\tThe constructive results of the recent session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki in July, the second phase of which has now commenced in Geneva, of the Commonwealth Heads of State Conference in Ottawa in August, and of the Fourth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Algiers in September, all of this year, in which my country participated and made its modest contribution, have helped to bring about a substantial, easing of tensions in international relations, signalling the beginning of an era of positive developments which undoubtedly will facilitate the search for peace in the world.\n244.\tCyprus shares the fervent hopes of all mankind at this juncture, when there are signs that goodwill is replacing antagonism and mistrust. We would like to restate our belief that, as a natural sequence, the new spirit of bilateral and group co-operation should be channelled into the United Nations so that the much needed unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council in matters affecting peace and security may be finally achieved. The Charter of the United Nations presupposes, and indeed bases itself upon, a reasonable degree of accord and unity between the big Powers. This accord has many times in the past been lacking, in a manner hampering and even frustrating the task of the United Nations to fulfil its pre-eminent purpose, giving thus rise to grave apprehensions concerning the Organization's effectiveness in the maintenance of peace and security. In the light of the near universality of the United Nations, this new trend will not only render the United Nations more effective, but will also assure the permanence of relaxation of international tensions; moreover, it will ease the concern of many Members about the paralysing effects which the abuse of the veto frequently produces on the United Nations organ bearing the greatest weight of political responsibility. At the same time, the United Nations will become what mankind intended it to be: an effective instrument for securing peace, and not merely a spectator of hopeful signs of easing of tensions brought about by bilateral initiatives and agreements.\n245.\tA stronger Organization need not raise apprehensions in any quarter, for it is through this world body that small States can ensure their security and respect for their independence and territorial integrity, as well as promote their economic and social progress. It is also in this Organization that the true and long-term interests of the big Powers lie.\n246.\tThe Government of Cyprus considers the United Nations as the pillar of its foreign policy, and will continue to support unreservedly its strengthening, and work together with all peace-loving nations to enhance the sphere of its activities and the degree of its effectiveness so as to make it the supreme instrument for peace, justice and progress for all mankind. We realize that these are high goals, especially in the light of the fact that the successes so far achieved by the United Nations fall short of the vision of its founding fathers and of the hopes the vast majority of peoples everywhere continue to place in it.\n247.\tYet it must be pointed out that during the last 28 years the achievements of the United Nations in various fields, and particularly in the socio-economic field and decolonization, have been substantial. It is this quiet, long-term work of the Organization that merits the greatest praise, particularly from the small States, which perhaps derive the greatest benefit from long-term development programmes.\n248.\tThe increasing degree of economic, legal, scientific and humanitarian co-operation of nations taking place under the aegis of the United Nations is proof of the fulfilment of the many purposes of the Charter at the basic level of human endeavour. Although such co-operation rarely elicits sensational recognition such as is bestowed upon purely political issues, nevertheless the importance of these developments must be recognized.\n249.\tAlthough the same cannot be said of the Organization's efforts in handling the major problems which still confront the world community, the role it has played in peace-keeping is surely constructive and it can, if we wish it, become truly the custodian of world peace and security. In this connexion, one basic fact we should bear in mind is that the armed conflicts of the past 28 years have not led to a world war. That does not mean that the armed conflicts of these later years are inconsiderable and that the lives lost and resources wasted should be ignored. However, given the technology of modern warfare we must be thankful that we have not had to face extinction through a nuclear holocaust. The United Nations has played an essential, role in this regard, and if we are willing to strengthen and consolidate its machinery it can yet become the catalyst of differences which arise among nations, the protector of human rights and the promoter of the economic and social well- being of peoples throughout the world, which was the vision of those who created it.\n250.\tIn sum, if we have the courage and determination to back this Organization with unselfish support in all its efforts towards the full realization of the aims and principles of the Charter, it can become a dynamic instrument of Governments for collective security, peace and progress.\n251.\tThe Secretary-General has significantly posed two vital questions to us all: \\\"What kind of world organization do we need? And what kind of world organization are Governments prepared in reality to accept?\\\" [See A/9100/ Add J, p. 8.] The greater effectiveness of the United Nations and the enhancement of its image must ultimately depend on the answers we give to those questions. To my mind, the universality of our Organization, the common need for collective security, peace, justice and equality and the necessity for concerted action to face vital world problems in an effective manner point to the answers to the questions the Secretary-General has posed. The need to develop a new concept of allegiance to the United Nations as an authority representing the world community is obvious and pressing if peace and justice are to prevail in the world.\n252.\tThe continued existence of colonialism is not compatible with international peace, much less with freedom and justice. It is a fact that much progress has been made towards decolonization since the adoption of the epoch- making General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, which gave a new impetus to the application of the concept of self-determination to colonial peoples.\n253.\tHowever, the decolonization process has encountered several setbacks because of the outmoded policies of two Member States of this Organization \u2014 Portugal and South Africa. The recent commendable efforts exerted by the Secretary-General with regard to the granting of self- determination to Namibia have not produced progress. Full implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) thus remains a major challenge to the United Nations.\n254.\tIn that respect my delegation is anxious to see progress sharply accelerated. The world has confirmed the undeniable truth that, once a people has expressed a desire to assume the duties and responsibilities of independence, denial of freedom thereafter compels recourse to force, which immediately develops into an active threat to the maintenance of peace and security.\n255.\tCyprus having itself emerged from colonial rule, it has all along fully supported the struggle for the granting of independence to colonial countries and the ending of the abhorrent practices of apartheid in Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. We stand in full solidarity with all peoples still deprived of their inalienable rights to freedom. independence and human dignity and have consistently fully implemented the concerted efforts and sanctions of the international community as stated in the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n256.\tWe attach great importance to the upholding and safeguarding of human rights and to the protection of the individual from all forms of discrimination. We cannot therefore but deplore the denial of human rights prevailing\n* in Southern Rhodesia, Namibia, South Africa and the so- called Portuguese Territories. It is our earnest hope that the colonial Powers will seize upon this new climate of cooperation and negotiation and \u2014 on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the launching of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination \u2014 heed public opinion. In so doing they will no doubt contribute to world peace and to their own true national interests and will at the same time observe with deeds this landmark in the quest for human rights.\n257.\tIn the same way as colonialism is not compatible with peace, economic deprivation is not conducive to world order, peace and justice. The recent reports with regard to the question of economic development indicate that the\nstandard of living of millions of people is pitifully low, that conditions of under nourishment and illiteracy are still conspicuously prevalent and that the gap between developed and developing countries has further widened. The First United Nations Development Decade, launched in 1961 by a hopeful world for the creation of conditions of economic stability and well-being ensuring a minimum standard of living for the peoples of the developing countries, fell short of its goals, and a review and appraisal undertaken this year of the Second United Nations Development Decade of the 1970s indicates that the growth rates of the developing countries burdened by debts, scarcity of aid and drought, are well below the average 6 per cent target rate set for the Second Decade and below the average achieved in 1960.\n258.\tThose disappointing reports, coming at a critical time when the economic world is beset by uncertainty of monetary and trade interchanges, present a challenge of the highest magnitude to the efforts of the international community to bring about an equitable distribution of wealth and to secure economic, monetary and social order. We welcome the negotiations now under way regarding the structure and future shape of the international monetary system and on world-wide trading arrangements, which undoubtedly will have a very important bearing upon the future of development in general and of the developing countries in particular. In addition, we agree that the concept of collective economic security should be further advanced. Co-operative international action in the economic field is vital to mankind \u2014 as, indeed, is international action in securing peace \u2014 and whatever difficulties may be encountered the United Nations remains the instrument best suited for universal economic co-operation and for the solution of outstanding international problems.\n259.\tThe growing realization of the international community that many problems facing the world cannot be finally dealt with within national boundaries makes the concept of collective economic security especially timely.\n260.\tThe recent monetary crisis and the drought which plagued many countries, including my own, underline the common problems and interdependence of big and small nations, rich and poor alike, and point to the necessity for collective action through the United Nations system for their solution.\n261.\tThe effective approach to the problem of the human environment and the consensus reached by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held last year in Stockholm, coupled with the efforts now under way to translate such consensus into concrete action, demonstrate the international community's willingness and ability to act when the will to act exists.\n262.\tThe United Nations determination to tackle world problems was demonstrated again on another question of vital international concern, the sea and the sea-bed, a subject marked by diverse national interests but of immense potential benefits to mankind. Marine resources will be needed urgently by a world whose population is expected to double within 30 years.\n263.\tThe law of the sea in its various aspects and, more specifically, the equitable distribution of the wealth of the sea and the sea-bed, are a field of vital concern to the United Nations and one to which my Government attaches particular importance. The traditional rules of the law of the sea have to be examined afresh in the light of recent revolutionary technological changes and political developments, and have to be adjusted so as to conform to present-day realities. At the same time, particular care should be taken so as to preserve principles firmly based on law and on equity that have stood the test of time and have for centuries served mankind well.\n264.\tOne of those principles is that there should be no artificial distinction at the expense of islands between continental and insular land masses in so far as the delimitation of maritime spaces is concerned. Also, the principle of the median line should continue to be the residual rule to be applied, failing an agreement to the contrary, in matters of delimitation between States which are opposite or adjacent to each other.\n265.\tIn general, the over-all approach should be one of balancing in a fair and equitable manner the legitimate rights and expectations of States with those of the international community as a whole. It is our fervent hope, and for our part we will use our best endeavours to see that, despite the obvious complexities, the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will be successful, and that thus the United Nations will have responded positively to the challenge it faces in this field of vital national and international concern.\n266.\tThe outstanding issues of peace and security, colonialism and the problem of economic under-development hamper the creation of the necessary international atmosphere for disarmament and frustrate efforts for the strengthening of peace.\n267.\tAny improvement in international relations, and any progress in solving outstanding international issues, would have a favourable bearing on the solution of the disarmament problem, and vice versa, because of the inherent interdependence of these problems. There is no need to try to find out where to start, as it is obvious that the greatest efforts should be exerted in both directions for the solution of this grave problem.\n268.\tIn addition to the perils which the continuing arms race presents to world peace, it deprives mankind of vast human and natural resources urgently needed for more constructive purposes. The interrelation between economic growth and disarmament is clear and direct. In this respect, we welcome as constructive the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union for reduction of the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council and the utilization of part of what is thus saved for development assistance [A/9191], Such a proposal, once given more specific content and if generally accepted, would constitute an important step in the right direction. At the same time, we wish to commend those countries which already are making available substantial sums in development aid.\n269.\tThe agreement worked out between the United States and the Soviet Union at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Helsinki has given rise to optimistic expectations among the peoples of the world. With the spirit of co-operation now prevalent, it is hoped that a determined effort will be made to stop the arms race, which has already reached unmanageable dimensions.\n270.\tThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction is an example showing that real progress can be made, and it is to be hoped that the international community will soon move towards an effective prohibition of chemical warfare. In a humane world society which is devoting such consistent efforts in the United Nations to helping mankind in combating disease and protecting the environment, the development of enormous quantities of paralysing chemicals for the purpose of using them against people of other nations is a tragic contradiction.\n271.\tThe question of nuclear testing is another area in which urgent progress is needed. In addition to the Treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in the atmosphere, concluded 10 years ago,  the time has now come, especially because of the favourable climate resulting from the detente, for a general agreement to stop all nuclear testing.\n272.\tDisarmament will, it may be hoped, open the way towards the creation and development of a permanent world peace force, a force accountable to the United Nations which gradually can become stronger than any national power or coalition of powers, a force whose one and only task will be to preserve world peace against infringement by any nation, great or small. The creation of a permanent peace-keeping force underlines the great importance of defining aggression so that objective criteria and guide-lines may be used by the Security Council for identifying aggression. We welcome the further progress achieved by the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression, meeting in Geneva last May, in defining aggression, and express our confidence that a consensus will be reached during its next session. The strengthening of the peace-keeping and peace-making functions of the United Nations is an essential requirement and an inducement for disarmament, for the latter cannot be realistically promoted without parallel efforts towards the creation of a world body whose purpose is to ensure international peace and security.\n273.\tAnother item offering the possibility of fruitful results at the present session is the draft convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons. The speedy adoption of this convention, coupled with its acceptance by the largest possible number of States will, we trust, mark yet another step forward by the international community in the already respectable series of measures taken in the legal field towards the observance of international legal order.\n274.\tWe also hope that constructive steps will be taken during this session towards measures to prevent international terrorism and, at the same time, towards understanding and alleviating the causes which bring it about.\n275.\tThe crisis that still persists in the Middle East, indirectly affecting all States in the area, is a source of deep concern to us. Along with so many others, we have supported the efforts of the United Nations to secure peace in that part of the world. Those efforts must continue and they must be intensified. The need for them grows greater as the issues become more clouded by suspicion, distrust and fear. We believe that, if success is yet to attend those efforts, a greater willingness must be shown by the parties directly involved for the solution of their problem on the basis of the Charter and the relevant United Nations resolutions, and specifically Security Council resolution 242 (1967), of 22 November 1967. That resolution contains in a balanced manner all the elements necessary for a just settlement and takes into consideration the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned, including those of the Palestinians. A basic principle in this regard is that the acquisition of territories by force must not and cannot be condoned or recognized.\n276.\tIt is not my intention to dwell at any considerable length on the question of Cyprus, a subject which has been before the United Nations for several years. It has been debated at length both before the Security Council \u2014 which is still seized of it \u2014 and in the General Assembly, which in 1965 adopted resolution 2077 (XX), reaffirming the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus. I would, however, naturally consider it appropriate to inform the Assembly of how 'he situation is at present.\n277.\tThe local talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, which were resumed last year in an expanded form, as suggested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, with the participation of the Secretary-General's Special Representative and in the presence of constitutional experts from Greece and Turkey, have continued in an effort to reach a peaceful and agreed solution of the constitutional problem confronting Cyprus. To some extent, progress has been achieved and certain points of disagreement have been bridged.\n278.\tBut there is still a serious gap and divergence of views on cardinal points, one of which is the demand of the Turkish Cypriot community for unrestricted local autonomy.\n279.\tWhile this is not at the present juncture the appropriate forum to enter into the details, I would simply say that in fact we have offered to the Turkish Cypriot community, which forms no more than 18 per cent of the population, far greater degree of local autonomy than has been given by any other State to any section of its population in similar or analogous situations. What the Government cannot do is to go beyond the safety zone necessary for the preservation of the independent and sovereign Republic of Cyprus. It is impossible, therefore, to subscribe to provisions in the Constitution of such abnormal divisiveness and patent unworkability as would inevitably disrupt the State, with all the dire consequences of strife and conflict and with the disaster of partition looming on the horizon.\n280.\tOur stand is for solidarity and co-operation between the two communities in goodwill and mutual respect in a sovereign, independent and unitary State. In this way Cyprus can become a link of unity and not an arena of conflict in the region and in the world. This is our position, which is consistent with the principles of the Charter and the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and in keeping with the world trends of today. \n\n281.\tI wish once again to express our deepest appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General and his collaborators in New York and Cyprus for their untiring efforts in the cause of peace in Cyprus, as well as to the Commander and the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus. We are also grateful to those countries which through their contributions in men and money make possible the continuation of the Force. We sincerely hope that it will not be too long before circumstances will permit the Force to be no longer necessary, thus relieving all concerned of this burden which they have been bearing so nobly.\n282.\tIt is becoming increasingly realized that a greater sense of unity and co-operation between all nations and peoples of the world, cutting across ideological or other boundaries, is now a demanding necessity in order to meet the global problems which threaten humanity as a whole in its fragile environment on this planet, for the dangers to all nations are common and so is the concern, calling for common action through an enlivened and activated United Nations.\n283.\tCyprus, with its very modest means, has always supported any world-unifying effort. In this spirit we salute with hope the present Assembly as the Assembly of transition from cold war antagonism to world cooperation in a dawning new era of positive human endeavour and achievement."

        "file_text": "\ufeff86.\tTen years ago, on 2 October 1963, I addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time from this same\nrostrum.5 At that time I had the twofold historic mission of declaring to the world that the Congolese revolution was the expression of the unanimous will of the whole people determined to live free, alone the master of its destiny, and to set forth the views of my Government on the major international problems which divided us and most of which, unfortunately, continue to divide the Members of our Organization.\n87: Today, returning here, I am happy and proud to say that the Congolese revolution has survived ail the gloomy prophecies. It has indeed just witnessed a rousing celebration of its tenth anniversary. It has overcome the many obstacles which imperialism and internal reaction have placed in its path, and it is doing very well. Its leader, Commandant Marien Ngouabi, is exercising determined and clear-sighted leadership, equalled only by the fierce will of the Congolese people to live free, in peace with everyone.\n88.\tToday I am happy to note that the gross injustice which had long been inflicted upon the People's Republic of China has been redressed and that the great Chinese people is now in a position to place its great wisdom and rich experience at the service of the world and peace, in frank and sincere co-operation, which is a gratification to. us all.\n89.\tToday I welcome with true satisfaction the simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to our Organization. This historic event belies the false theses which had prevailed until last year. I warmly welcome the representatives of those two countries and those of the Bahamas who have just taken their places in this Assembly.\n90.\tToday I note with great pleasure that the Laotian people, who have so long been in the nightmare of war and division, are finally making progress towards a normal existence even though the forces of evil are still striving vainly, to overturn the verdict of history.\n91.\tToday I should like to welcome once again the brilliant victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam which has been reflected in the signing of the cease-fire agreement at the beginning of this year in Paris.6 It is now for the United Nations to require that this Agreement, which has been constantly breached by the Saigon administration, always encouraged by United States imperialism, should be strictly respected. The Vietnamese people is entitled, like all the other peoples of the world, to a free existence, a normal life and institutions of its own choosing.\n92.\tUnfortunately, hardly did the flames of war in VietNam die down than United States imperialism lit another fire in Cambodia. But there again, under the enlightened leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the valiant Khmer people are every day giving proof that traitors to the motherland will only have meted out to them, when the time comes, the punishment they deserve. The representatives here in this Assembly know very well that the United National Front of Kampuchea controls nine-tenths of Cambodian territory.\n93.\tThey also know that the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which has just been held in Algiers, took an historic step when it demanded that the rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, should be restored in the United Nations and in the other international organizations and that that Government should be recognized as the legitimate government representing the people of Cambodia. The People's Republic of the Congo entirely approves this action, and the United Nations should see to it that it is actually brought about, because this alone will make it possible to restore peace in that part of Asia.\n94.\tStill in Asia, the situation in Korea is slow in developing. We certainly do not want the fragments of this mosaic to prevent us from identifying the problem in its totality. Without any doubt the status of observer, after a laborious and arduous quest, has just been granted to North Korea; but the duty of the Organization is to help this country, which has suffered so cruelly from foreign interventions in its political life, to bring about its reunification by peaceful means, free from any external influence.\n95.\tToday something that is even more tragic \u2014 Israel also is stubbornly rejecting the verdict of history. This stubbornness led in 1967 to the situation of which we are well aware, which itself has just given rise to serious developments in the Middle East less than a week ago. We do not want to address ourselves to a country which has systematically refused to comply with the unanimous will of the international community. We would rather say to those who support the Zionist and expansionist State of Israel that it is certainly high time for them to revise their calculations, because tomorrow it will no doubt be Israel itself that will reproach them for having imprisoned it in illusions which today are more than outmoded. We would also like to ask the fraternal Arab countries if it is not time to forget the things which may divide them and to combine their efforts against an enemy which is humiliating the whole Arab nation and which defies us all.\nCt;\n96.\tMany countries of the third world have already realized the danger represented by the expansionist and arrogant policy of Israel and are ending their relations with the Zionist State, thus heeding the appeal of our Arab brothers who consider, quite rightly, that this is the least they could do. We would like to hope that the neighbouring countries in the combat zone will understand that the time has come for them, too, to meet all their responsibilities and to provide Egypt and Syria, which have been the victims of aggression, with the concrete assistance which they need so much at the present time.\n97.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo, for its part faithful to the fundamental principles of its policy, has broken off all relations with Israel, without any pressure whatsoever from any source and without any kind of calculation. We are side by side with the valiant people of Palestine who are waging their struggle, and we fully support the fraternal countries of Egypt and Syria that are fighting so bravely for the restoration of their territorial integrity, because, for us, one of the most intolerable and inadmissible principles of our time will remain the acquisition of territory by force, which is after all nothing but a modern form of colonization. And the question of colonization brings us quite naturally to Africa.\n98.\tColonization is, of course, an historical phenomenon, which is in no way justified and which nothing could ever justify. Consequently, it is a phenomenon which is reprehensible at any time and at all times. But colonization is also a fact of history. It is because we are faced with a fact of history that you will understand that in this particular area President Marien Ngouabi will of course be attaching much more importance to what is happening than to what has happened.\n99.\tWhat is happening is that the former colonial Powers, in their anxiety to preserve their unjustly acquired advantages, are perpetuating in the most subtle ways their domination over the new independent States.\n100.\tWhat also is happening is that the great Powers, influenced by their selfish narrow interests, want to make satellites of the small countries.\n101.\tWhat we are faced with in each case is neo-colonialism, which is as inhumane, reprehensible and worthy of contempt as colonialism.\n102.\tWhat is happening also is that in spite of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which will soon be 13 years old, colonies in Africa still survive \u2014 the list of them has often been enumerated here and this makes it unnecessary for us to repeat it. The country which is persisting in perpetuating this phenomenon is sufficiently well known to you to make it unnecessary for us to name it here.\n103.\tWe of the People's Republic of the Congo are not racists and we hope that we will never have to respond to abominable acts of racism with other acts of racism, equally detestable. But we are also aware that patience has its limits, and that is why it is urgent for the international community to call upon this small country, and particularly those who would support, it, to rally to the side of history before seriously jeopardizing the chances of mankind of living in perfect harmony without distinction of race or religion.\n104.\tThe methods pursued by the last of the colonizers in Africa are well known to us all. The panoply of them has just been added to by individual attempts on individual persons, as for example, the cowardly assassinations of illustrious sons of Africa, such as Edwardo Mondlane and Amilcar Cabral. These assassinations have only served to strengthen the scorn and the hatred of the whole of Africa and have also strengthened the determination of freedom fighters in their struggle.\n105.\tThe Assembly knows the daily tragedy afflicting the people of the territories under colonial domination.. There are numerous documents relating to them which are available to each of our delegations. The massacres in Mozambique have been described in the smallest detail by Mr. Marcelino dos Santos and the Reverend Hastings. The forced systematic exploitation of the riches of Angola is well known to us all. I have quite deliberately brought these two aspects together to show with what cruelty and what cynicism colonialism is striving to destroy, in the countries which it dominates, the two essential elements in the life of a nation: man and nature.\n106.\tHence, my Government feels that the best thought- out and the most sincere speeches will do nothing to change the situation. It is acts which are necessary. The opportunity is unique. It has just been offered to us by Guinea-Bissau. The country of Amilcar Cabral has just won a victory over the oppressor, a striking victory which we must not only welcome, but which we must do everything we can to strengthen. If the United Nations really wishes decolonization in accordance with its own Charter, Guinea-Bissau should be immediately admitted to membership and should take its place here without debate, because I do not think there is any Member country which has received any mandate from the people of Guinea-Bissau to represent them here. Such a decision, while it would be strictly in keeping with the principles of the Charter and would fall squarely within the framework of the objectives of the Organization, would be a great incentive to the fighters of Angola and Mozambique, and a serious warning to the racists of Rhodesia and South Africa.\n107.\tWith regard to the situation in Rhodesia and Namibia, with regard to the policy of apartheid in South Africa, nothing remains to be said, and it is possibly only the way of saying it which has changed. It is for this reason that, here too, my Government considers that the United Nations should take concrete action and Request the Western Powers to choose between their selfish interests and those of the whole international community.\n108.\tMay I be permitted, from this rostrum, to assure once again the peoples of Palestine. Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique and all those waging an armed struggle, of the total and unconditional support of the Congolese people. We support them because the causes for which they are fighting are just and because there is no peace without justice, even if there is detente.\n109.\tWe are in fact going through a very exalting stage where the acceleration of history makes it possible for us to note, every day, appreciable changes in the world panorama. A decade of ideological confrontations dominated by the snows of the cold war is now being succeeded, we are told with tranquil assurance, by a so-called phase of political realism and international detente. My country, like many other third-world countries, can only welcome the advent of this new era, this golden age which we are promised; because we need peace to build in our own countries a society of prosperity and dignity and to deal more effectively with the thorny problems of the well-being of our working masses. But in truth, can there really be peace without freedom? My delegation would like to invite everyone, without futile emotion or passion, without demagogy, but in all objectivity, to reflect on this concept of detente which, if it is historically justified, must nevertheless be given a more real content, if we want to increase its credibility among the disinherited of the earth even a little. The twenty-eighth session has been placed by many speakers within a general framework of detente. Detente appears to be the watchword which is to inspire all of our delegations throughout our work. I am among those who find it repugnant to use this rostrum for sterile polemics. But, as I have stressed earlier, good sense should be based on the inspiration of actual facts which occur every day in order to shed the proper light on this notion of detente to which the peace-loving peoples of the world so legitimately aspire. This concept of detente, which has been widely canvassed and which, if we are to believe the acclamations accompanying its birth, has no enemy, is liable to remain a useless instrument of analysis if it is reduced to the role of being the privilege of a minority of the all-powerful and becomes deflected from its supreme objective, which is to strengthen the common wish of people to organize the live forces of our planet to serve understanding, friendship, justice, peace and the progress of humanity without any discrimination. In any case, imposed from the summit of the pyramid without taking the least account of other elements which nevertheless constitute the key to the explanation of the international situation, detente runs the serious risk of having a brief and tragic career because in our world today it is no longer possible to pretend to ignore in the international arena the long-exploited and scorned third world.\n110.\tI am aware that my purpose may seem to be at variance with a certain uniformity which has been maintained by our culpable passivity, but we all know the evil consequences that may develop from a vacuum ascribable to a lack of perspicacity and the indecision of peaceful peoples. It is therefore more necessary than ever now for all nations to give their support to the policy of detente whose outlines and content should be clearly defined here so as to avoid reducing the United Nations to the humiliating role of a distant and scorned witness. We will gain nothing from closing our eyes to the brutal realities which constitute, unfortunately \u2014 and will for a long time to come \u2014 the backdrop of our world. For us, true political realism is that which has as its purpose fighting imperialism and its acolytes and which consists of unequivocally supporting the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government for the benefit of all countries, and in particular for the countries which are still groaning under the yoke of colonialism and racism; political realism that would be worthy of proper attention is that which would include in its programme in golden letters the right of peoples to dispose of their own resources, to decide on their own destiny, the inalienable right of peoples to have the regime of their choice and to determine in all freedom what their alliances will be.\n111.\tThe concept of detente makes it very natural for us to think of peace, and of war too. And as representatives know, in our day war is waged with ever-more murderous weapons, ever-more sophisticated weapons, which the under-equipped countries do not possess \u2014 fortunately, or unfortunately perhaps \u2014 and which they will probably never need if the great Powers were a little more sincere and had more good faith in their intentions. What we want is that people should be clearer when they speak of disarmament. In our view, the countries which have for so long been oppressed and exploited and are once again today exposed to all kinds of interference and aggression have the right to defend themselves.\n112.\tIf a franker dialogue could take place on the subject of detente and disarmament, perhaps we would then be able to take a big step towards the indispensable democratization of international relations. Indeed, it is becoming ever more intolerable that important problems, which may affect the very life of our Organization and the future of mankind, should continue to be the subject, or a kind of preserve, of the club of the all-powerful.\n113.\tThe Organization's Charter should be revised and adapted to new conditions, because we believe most sincerely that the right of veto, for example, has become an anachronism and should disappear.\n114.\tIt is also urgent to have redefinition of relations among States to put an end to external intervention, which is ever-more open and arrogant, in the internal affairs of young nations. Every country has the right to be free, to conceive and to execute its own policy.\n115.\tAs was proclaimed by the Algiers Conference, the sovereignty of States over their natural resources should become an inalienable principle for everyone. This problem leads us to consider the situation \u2014 which we would have preferred not to mention \u2014 which was created in Chile by the reactionary coup d'etat of 11 September 1973. We condemn most vigorously \u2014 and representatives no doubt have sensed this throughout our statement \u2014 any intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. And we would have said nothing about the events in Chile if \u2014 as was so well understood by the fourth non-aligned Conference in Algiers \u2014 what was under preparation in Santiago and which led to the cowardly assassination of President Salvador Allende was not considered by the third world as a vast plot against us all. President Allende, who was constitutionally elected, scrupulously respected the institutions and democratic practices to which his people were so profoundly attached. His crime, his only crime, was to have tried to restore to the Chileans that which the multinational companies had taken from them.\n116.\tToday, while abominable genocide is being organized in Chile, while duly accredited diplomats to that country have seen their immunity grossly violated, and while the democracy so dear to the Chilean people is becoming every day more and more a shadow of its former self, the world of the United Nations is leaning back and reclining in its\n'-intellectual comfort. Here, again, the last word belongs to history.\n117.\tIt is quite deliberate that in our statement we shall not go into any details about economic problems. That would have made it necessary for you to listen to yet one more speech that would serve no purpose, particularly because it is now clearly established that in order to become equipped the developing countries must, above all, rely on themselves. I will simply say that the policy of charity must give way to freely agreed co-operation, which should be to the mutual benefit of the contracting parties. We \u2014 the small countries, in particular \u2014 should in the problems of development, work for the strengthening of the United Nations, especially of its specialized agencies, whose efforts, despite their limited resources, have just so felicitously added themselves to our own action.\n118.\tThose were the thoughts which Commandant Marien Ngouabi, President of the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party, President of the People's Republic of the Congo, asked me to submit to this august Assembly over which you, Sir, are presiding today.\n119.\tWe hope that the delegations here will benefit from your eminent qualities as a jurist and a humanist, your valuable and long experience in the service of the international community, so as to ensure that the work of this twenty-eighth session will be the great success that the whole world expects it to be.\n120.\tWe are convinced that, like your predecessor Minister Trepczynski \u2014 to whom we pay a cordial tribute here \u2014  and like our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose devotion to the cause of peace is beyond all praise, you will spare no effort to encourage the States Members of this Organization, which have wandered into paths to which they have been led by their selfish, sordid and outmoded interests, to reconcile themselves with history, a history which no reasonable nation has the right to oppose eternally."

        "file_text": "\ufeff44.\tDuring last year's general debate in this Assembly, a vast majority of Member States, including the Polish People's Republic, expressed their satisfaction with the improvement in the international situation, hoping for further and ever more tangible progress in the policy of peace and detente.\n45.\tYet another year has gone by. In the history of world progress it will go down as an important one. The world has speeded up its advance towards peace. The principles of peaceful coexistence of States having different systems are becoming an ever more universal basis for international relations.\n46.\t\\\"For many years,\\\" said the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Edward Gierek, \\\"the Socialist States, including Poland, have beer< struggling for the victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence in inter-State relations. This idea is now becoming victorious.\\\"\n47.\tA development like this is consonant with the will of the peoples we represent, and with their aspirations to live in peace and security and to enjoy freedom and independence; it is consonant with their desires to enjoy an ever better material and cultural life-which entails progressive social transformations.\n48.\tPositive changes in international relations and better prospects for the maintenance of world peace are a contribution of merit made by those States Members <?f the United Nations which, in their foreign policies, have for long consistently and with unfailing dedication advanced \\\"and worked for the consolidation of peace and international security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization. The Soviet Union, Poland and other States of the socialist community, belong among them.\n49.\tThe principle objective of the foreign policy of the socialist States, as was again pointed out by the decisions of the meeting of the leaders of the States of the socialist community in the Crimea on 30 and 31 July 1973, has been to ensure a just and lasting peace.\n50.\tThe Polish People's Republic is contributing to the policy of peace and detente, to the elimination of seedbeds of tension and to the promotion of relations of equality among all States, whatever their systems and standards of economic development. Our constant objective is to increase the contribution to this lofty cause. Thus motivated, we are participating in the work of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n51.\tThe Polish delegation wishes to express its satisfaction that the desire to maintain peace is becoming the guiding idea of the foreign policies of a growing number of Member States. Thus the United Nations may become an ever more effective instrument for the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security.\n52.\tAmong important developments of the past 12 months the ending of war in Viet-Nam comes to the fore. This has been a great success of peace. The conclusion of the Paris agreements represented a milestone in the elimination of international conflicts and opened up possibilities for a political settlement of all the problems of Indo-China. From this rostrum Poland wishes the Viet-Namese people all success in their speedy recovery from the war-inflicted wounds. The Paris agreements should be fully implemented. As a member of the International Commission of Control\nand Supervision, Poland, within the scope of its possibilities, will continue contributing to the attainment of this goal.\n53.\tI wish to express satisfaction with the progress in the normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent. The New Delhi agreement of 28 August last between India and Pakistan is an important step towards full normalization, peace and good-neighbourly co-operation between the States of the subcontinent. This is indeed a matter of satisfaction to us, as Poland is linked by friendly relations with India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Polish delegation hopes that the membership of the United Nations will be soon enlarged by the admission of Bangladesh.\n54.\tThe year that has passed has brought also a series of constructive initiatives with a view to consolidating detente and unreservedly accepting the principles of peaceful coexistence. These initiatives include multilateral efforts, such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and negotiations on arms and troop reduction in Central Europe, as well as momentous changes in bilateral relations between many Member States of the United Nations.\n55.\tIn our opinion, this new and justly hope-inspiring development is primarily expressed in the fact that the States of the European continent, regardless of their systems, size or geographic location, are making a collective effort to create the foundations of a lasting system of security and co-operation. This effort will find its practical reflection in the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose second phase is now being held at Geneva.\n56.\tThat effort is being made on the basis of the recognition of the fact that security in Europe can only rest on the inviolability of the political and territorial post-war realities. This has been evidenced in the bilateral treaties signed by the Soviet Union, Poland and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic .of Germany, in the normalization of relations by most countries with the two German States, and in the admission of those two States to the United Nations.\n57.\tOn numerous occasions in the past the Polish delegation has had the opportunity to comment from this rostrum on matters pertaining to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and to present specific proposals, including the conclusion of an all-European treaty on collective security. The main task of the Conference we visualize as consisting of the creation of a system of collective security in Europe, the future overcoming of the division of Europe into two groupings opposed politically and militarily to each other, and the mapping out jointly of the course of a further peaceful development of the European continent. Peace means something more than merely a state short of war or even a situation in which war has been eliminated. We conceive of peace as an open, dynamic and steadily advancing process: a process into which a constructive programme has to be injected, one with positive ideas and values to be implemented by a joint effort. We feel that all the conditions are there for the Conference to make that goal materialize. Poland favours expansion of all-round co-operation with\nStates having different socio-political systems. The equitable development of such co-operation depends on nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States, observance of the principle of mutual respect for the rights and customs of individual nations, and respect for their cultural and historically formed national identity.\n58.\tBy virtue of its geographic location, Poland concentrates on Europe; but we do not see that continent as detached from the rest of the world. We believe that the most substantial contribution to the peaceful and progressive development of the world Europe can make will consist of the establishment of a system of collective security, of turning Europe into a continent which would pose no threat to any other region and which, through co-operation with the other parts of the world, would contribute to the growth of the well-being of the peoples of all continents and to a life in peace, freedom and dignity all over the world. In that way Europe would cease to be a hotbed of tensions and conflicts, involving other nations of the world, as has frequently occurred in the past. Europe would thus become a centre of stabilization of world peace and a model of relations between States with different socio-political systems, in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n59.\tIt is our firm belief that the decisions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will be of historic importance for Europe, for the security of other continents and for world peace.\n60.\tThe essential progress in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is of special significance. This is reflected in agreements signed during the visit of President Nixon to the Soviet Union in May 1972 and in the course of the visit paid to the United States this year by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Their relations were established on the principle of peaceful coexistence, which is an important step forward along the road towards strengthening world peace and creating realistic possibilities for building relations among States on the very same foundations.\n61.\tThe agreements in question imply the intention of both Powers to have the political detente accompanied also by a military detente. It is with appreciation and hope that Poland views the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States and the prospects for a peaceful development of relations between the two great Powers; for we think that they resulted in the strengthening of world peace and security.\n62.\tWhile developing and reinforcing relations with its allies, Poland is expanding its contacts on principles of peaceful coexistence with other countries. President Nixon's visit to Warsaw in the spring of last year resulted in an accelerated expansion of relations between Poland and the United States. Likewise, we have developed our relations with a number of West European States. Fresh content and new forms were added to our relationships with France as a result of the visit paid last year to Paris by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Edward Gierek. We have entered a new phase of relations with the Federal Republic of\nGermany. We are developing friendly relations with Italy, Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria and other States. The time has come, too, to start talks on our mutual relations with the Vatican.\n63.\tWe are also strengthening our ties with States in other parts of the world. Such ties are especially animated with India and also, notably in the economic field, with Japan.\n64.\tWe lend our support to the efforts of the non-aligned States which, at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers, adopted a number of resolutions [see A/9330 and Corr.] testifying to their determination to pursue a policy of peace and of struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism. The Algiers Conference pointed out the urgent need for eliminating the remnants of colonialism and for fighting all forms of neo-colonialism. We for our part, express our solidarity with the struggle waged by the national liberation movements in Africa.\n65.\tAgainst the background of positive developments and the emerging trends of detente and co-operation based on equal rights, the persisting hotbeds of tension and manifestations of the policy from a position of strength, vestiges of colonialism and other harmful phenomena in the international situation stand out in glaring contrast. The situation in the Middle East is fraught with the danger of the eruption of a military conflict. The present situation there should lead us into no complacent mood. Israel persists in ignoring the decisions of the Security Council and pursues a policy of aggression and terror towards its Arab neighbours. Poland's unswerving position is that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) should be promptly implemented. Occupied Arab territories ought to be restored to their rightful owners without delay. That is the basic condition for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. All peoples of the region, including the Palestinian people, should be guaranteed the right to an independent existence and a peaceful life.\n66.\tDevelopments in Chile have shocked the world and Polish public opinion. The overthrow by force of the legal Government of the country, the assassination of the constitutional President, Dr. Salvador Allende, who only last year was a guest of this Assembly, acts of violence against and harassment of diplomatic missions and citizens of various States, as well as of foreign ships, depriving the Chilean people of its natural resources and surrendering them to international monopolies, mass terror in the country-all this cannot but have far-reaching international implications, endangering the atmosphere of peace and detente in the world. The people of Poland condemn with indignation the acts of violence and terror raging in Chile.\n67.\tNov/ that the policy of detente has scored many successes, there is a need for even greater efforts than ever before to reinforce these positive trends and to make them irreversible. The scope of encouraging changes has to be broadened so as to ensure that open conflicts and unsettled problems may not again bring a relapse into the cold war, or give rise to dangerous tensions. This will take vigilance vis-\u00e0-vis any forces which for their selfish ends might wish to obstruct the positive changes in the international situation, sow distrust or complicate the processes of international confidence-building.\n68.\tIn the present historical moment in the world situation the activity of these forces is a harmful and dangerous anachronism. Also more apparent than ever before is the bankruptcy of any attempts at solving international conflicts by war and by methods of the policy from a position of strength.\n69.\tThe United Nations, which now, owing to the admission of new Members, comprises almost all States of our globe, has an important role to play in the consolidation of the positive changes in the international situation. In my statements from this rostrum [2118th meeting], I have already had the occasion to present the views of the Government of Poland as to the great significance for the United Nations and for the situation at large of the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany into our Organization. We feel that the United Nations not only should provide a forum for political debates of a universal nature, but should also become a venue for practical construction of a system of collective security through, inter alia, universalization of the positive experience gained by various regions of the world.\n70.\tWe are entitled to expect that the United Nations will lend its active support to all efforts which are made on the bilateral as well as the multilateral plane, both on a regional and on a global scale, and are aimed at the normalization of international relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, the renunciation once and for all of the use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the expansion of non-discriminatory co-operation in all fields. This is what will determine the prestige of the United Nations among the international community and the Organization's place in the history of mankind.\n71.\tThe United Nations efforts to consolidate detente and to make it an irreversible process have to entail specific measures in the field of military detente and disarmament. First of all we have to do away for ever with the danger of a nuclear war. That is, in fact, the basic task of this Organization.\n72.\tWe feel that in order to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war it is of special necessity and high priority that all States ratify the Treaty on the partial banning of nuclear-weapon tests  and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)], and, subsequently, that further steps should be taken towards the complete elimination of nuclear arms.\n73.\tTwo days ago [2126th meeting], the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Andrei Gromyko, presented in this hall an extremely important proposal on reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. The practical implementation of that proposal\nwould not only produce immense material advantages but would also have an impact upon the improvement of the atmosphere of trust in international relations; we are also aware of the new vistas that would open up for further disarmament measures. The Polish People's Republic welcomes this important initiative and lends it its full support.\n74.\tPoland is consistently guided by the desire for general and complete disarmament. Hence, we favour the speediest possible convocation of the World Disarmament Conference. We trust that in the course of the present session, on the basis of the record of work heretofore of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, established under resolution 2930 (XXVII), we shall take further decisions concerning the preparation of the Conference. The Conference could become a turning point in the efforts aimed at freeing mankind from the tremendous burden of armaments, strengthening world peace and promoting the successful socio-economic development of the nations of the world.\n75.\tThe consolidation of the processes of detente and the building of world peace are inconceivable without broad economic co-operation among the States of the world.\n76.\tThe quest for stimuli to economic co-operation between all States is all the more important to the United Nations inasmuch as there is a feed-back relationship between the development of the political situation and that of the situation obtaining in international economic relations. For political co-operation provides a propitious climate for promoting economic collaboration, which in turn becomes a solid basis for and a factor of intensified development of political intercourse. Moreover, advanced economic collaboration can in many instances lead to the establishment of co-operation on the political plane, and vice versa.\n77.\tI dare say that the historic record of accomplishment of our generation will to a large extent depend on the conditions which we shall be able to create .for the development of economic co-operation on a global scale. They include very broadly conceived questions of economic collaboration on a scale much wider than has so far been the case in the work of our Organization.\n78.\tThe conditions which we should create for the expansion of economic collaboration ought to take account ' of the legitimate interests of all States. They should be oriented towards the fullest possible utilization of the opportunities offered by the international division of labour; they should ensure a scale of production and exchanges to each State, so as to make goods accessible to all. First and foremost they should ensure proper participation in the international division of labour to those States which in the early stages of the formation of the division of labour were not able to secure an appropriate place for themselves and their share in it\n79.\tIt therefore becomes urgent to work out a new machinery which will intensify the expansion of multilateral economic co-operation and take account of the interests of all States and regions of the world. The principal mechanisms governing international economic\nrelations were formed immediately following the Second World War at a time when political co-operation between individual States and regions was on a rather small scale. Besides, only a small number of States had a share in the setting up of those mechanisms.\n80.\tWith international detente and growing political collaboration, with a more advanced development of productive forces and a considerable growth in the number of States participating in world economic co-operation, the earlier mechanisms governing international economic relations fail to meet the present day requirements.\n81.\tIn many areas the situation is disquieting. Broad segments of international opinion call for proper action regarding, in particular, the following questions: the aggravation of the crisis of the capitalist monetary system, which adversely affects the entire international trade exchanges; the unequal and often discriminatory attitude of certain States and groupings of the West vis-\u00e0-vis trade exchanges with the socialist countries; the absence of mechanisms to stimulate the expansion of collaboration in science and technology, as well as industrial co-operation; and the absence of effective mechanisms which would assist the developing countries in taking their place in the international division of labour.\n82.\tThe United Nations should play an essential part in providing solutions to those problems. We offer our support to the efforts being made in this direction, inter alia, within the framework of the United Nations Development Programme, the functioning of which we highly value.\n83.\tPoland attaches great importance to the expansion of economic co-operation with all countries of the world. The economic decisions we have been taking in recent years are so designed as to fit our economy into the international division of labour on a wider scale. It is our desire to make full use of the opportunities arising from participation in all-round international economic co-operation.\n84.\tThe economic record of Poland over recent years substantiates the practicability of our plans. Last year alone, Poland's gross national income increased by 10 per cent, industrial production rose by almost 11 per cent, and foreign trade turnover grew by over 19 per cent. The figures I have' just quoted eloquently testify to the importance my country attaches to the expansion of economic collaboration with other countries, which is best illustrated by the measurable index of the rate of growth of our trade exchanges.\n85.\tAll nations of the world want to live in peace. All nations of the world want to live in freedom. All nations want to live better, more prosperous, more cultured lives. The United Nations can play a very important part in the attainment of these noble objectives. That, however, calls for the co-operation and dedication of all Member States. The delegation of Poland will spare no effort to that end."

        "file_text": "\ufeff147.\tOn behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and the delegation of Sri Lanka, I extend to Ambassador Benites our cordial congratulations on his election as President of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. His acknowledged eminence as an international jurist, his vast experience in United Nations affairs and the conspicuous diplomatic skill which he has displayed, as well as his personal qualities of patience, courtesy and tact, assure us of wise guidance and leadership during this session.\n148.\tThe United Nations owes its sincerest thanks to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyfiski, the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, for his adroit handling of the work of that session and especially of some particularly controversial problems. His capacity for negotiation spared the Assembly discussions that might have been acrimonious and futile.\n149.\tOn the eve of this session the world heard the shocking news of the violent change of government in a country with which we have always maintained the most friendly understanding, a country which had co-operated with us closely on important problems both of a political and economic nature, and had taken its rightful place in the community of non-aligned nations. The Government which was overthrown had sought through a socialist policy to ensure for the people of that country a greater measure of social and economic equality and justice than they had enjoyed before.\n150.\tThe Government and people of Sri Lanka heard with profound grief and distress the poignant and tragic news of the death of President Salvador Allende, who gave his life in an attempt as a politician to fulfil what his friend and compatriot, the late Pablo Neruda, described as the poet's duty to take his place alongside the people in their struggle to transform society, which has been betrayed into chaos by its rulers, into an orderly existence based on political, economic and social democracy.\n151.\tThe experience of Chile shows that the deadliest enemies of social and economic reform and of the egalitarian society are the forces of reaction within a country, that privileged and pampered elite, which would not shrink from enlisting the support of external forces which command unlimited financial resources and exercise a decisive influence in key areas of the economy. This power and influence embolden them to conceive and even conduct operations designed to subordinate the democratic will of the people to their blinding obsession with profits and the politics of financial and economic dominion. The people of Chile have our deepest sympathy.\n152.\tA new chapter in the history of the United Nations has been opened by the admission to its membership of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We accord them a warm welcome to this Organization. They come here pledged to support the cause of peace and to redeem the past. We can no longer demand of them any further expiation of the crimes their leaders committed. In relations between nations, as between individuals, there is a time to remember and a time to forget.\n,153. We take special pleasure in welcoming the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on their admission to membership in the United Nations. We extend to them our best wishes and assure them of our close and constant co-operation.\n154. The past year has seen dramatic improvements in the United States relations with the Soviet Union and China, as well as clear signs of increasingly close and friendly co-operation between Japan on the one hand and the Soviet Union and China on the other. These developments are a favourable portent for the future. We\nhope that they will gain increased momentum. Above all, we hope that at least the ideology they share in common will help compose the differences that now unfortunately exist between China and the Soviet Union.\n155.\tThe cessation of hostilities in Viet-Nam has removed one of the principal impediments to final reconciliation \u2014 the presence of foreign forces in that unhappy country, torn by internecine conflict and tormented and devastated by continuous warfare over a period of more than 30 years. But the end of war does not necessarily herald the dawn of peace. It is now left to the various factions in that country to refrain altogether from hostile acts against each other and to take the fullest advantage of the cessation of hostilities by entering into negotiations for the restoration of peace and harmony and for the initiation of the process of reconstruction. A commendable example has been set by Laos. We sincerely hope that a similar process will be started in Cambodia, uninfluenced by the interference, overt or otherwise, of outside parties.\n156.\tThe presence of both North and South Korea in our midst as observers should give a further impetus to the realization of the objective which should benefit them both \u2014 the ultimate unification of that country.\n157.\tIt is in the same spirit that we welcome the Indo- Pakistan Agreement of 28 August 1973 regarding the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian internees in India and the repatriation of all Bengalis in Pakistan and all Pakistanis in Bangladesh, specified in the Agreement. Ties of culture and history bind us firmly to the peoples of those countries. The future of South Asia depends very greatly on the maintenance of friendly relations and co-operation between them, and we in Sri Lanka stand ready, as always, to enter into active partnership with them in all efforts to ensure stability in the region and to bring peace and prosperity to all our peoples. We believe that, given a display of fraternity and magnanimity on all sides, all existing obstacles to the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations should soon be removed.\n158.\tThe enlargement of the European Economic Community through the accession of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland creates new opportunities for some but acute problems for others, among\n. them my own country. The increase in the strength and cohesion of the European Economic Community, while creating ideal conditions for rapid economic progress and ever-increasing prosperity for the members of the Community itself, could be so exploited as to produce beneficial consequences for the rest of the world by increasing rather than limiting trade opportunities to, and providing better markets for, the products of the developing world as a whole. The loss of those preferences which the members of the Commonwealth enjoyed in the past and the attenuation of the most-favoured nation principle, both of which result from Britain's accession to the Common Market, create special problems for the developing members of the Commonwealth, among them Sri Lanka, whose principal trading partner has been and continues to be Britain.\n159.\tWe sincerely hope that the negotiations that have already been set in train for the establishment of a special relationship between the Community and the associable territories will bring substantial relief and advantages to those territories. Those advantages are expected to take the form of trade and financial aid schemes, as well as compensatory financing and the creation of special institutions. We welcome this policy, but must appeal for its progressive application to others not yet eligible for such special treatment, particularly Asian Commonwealth countries like Sri Lanka, which will suffer deprivation as well as denial. We will lose the benefits hitherto enjoyed under the Commonwealth preference scheme and face the problem of unequal competition in European markets. The enlargement of the European Economic Community should not be allowed to arrest or reverse the trend towards greater liberalization of international trade and the elimination of all discriminatory trade practices.\n160.\tThe President of Upper Volta reminded us today of the calamity of the Sudano-Sahelian drought and famine and the heavy toll they have taken. The time has come for us to marshal all the resources of modern technology to avert such catastrophes in the future. We therefore welcome the initiative taken by the United States delegation in proposing the convening of a world food conference [2124th meeting]. If we cannot agree on reducing our stocks of guns, let us at least try to increase our stocks of food grains.\n161.\tInterest in the concept of collective economic security has been revived on the initiative of the Government of Brazil, and that Government deserves to be congratulated on that initiative. We also applaud the initiative of the President of Mexico in regard to the adoption of a charter of economic rights and duties. The essence of those two concepts has already been distilled in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We would welcome any new and concrete proposals for giving expression to the concept of collective economic security, but we should like to emphasize that there is no need for any new institutions for that purpose. We already have the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, which treat the problems on an interregional or global scale, while on the other hand we have the regional economic commissions which are equipped with both the means and the authority to promote regional cooperation.\n162.\tThe results achieved during the First United Nations Development Decade were disappointing and dismal. The Strategy for the second Decade contains certain priorities, incorporated in paragraphs (24), (25) and (26), which constitute the essence of collective economic security, namely, the priority aim of \\\"... securing stable, remunerative and equitable prices\\\" for the raw materials produced by developing countries; the principle that \\\"No new tariff and non-tariff barriers will be raised nor will the existing ones be increased by developed countries against imports of primary products of particular interest to developing countries;\\\" and that priority should be given by developed countries . .to reducing or eliminating duties and other barriers to imports of primary products, including those in processed or semi-processed form, of export interest to developing countries...\\\".\n163.\tThese results were to be achieved by 31 December 1972. That there is little to review and less to appraise, except failure, is abundantly clear from the report on the second session of the Committee on Review and Appraisal.\n164.\tMost of the problems that exist between nations might, in our belief, perhaps be considerably mitigated, if not solved, through greater economic co-operation and the improvement of economic relations between countries.\n165.\tMore attention and encouragement need to be given to those organs of the United Nations family that are concerned with economic co-operation and questions of international trade and development, in particular UNIDO, which was established with the definite purpose of dealing with the problems that afflicted the developing countries and of establishing a more solid association and partnership between the developing and the developed sections of the world to their mutual benefit and advantage. If there is any tendency to set up UNCTAD as a rival to the Economic and Social Council, it should be resolutely discouraged. There are clear and hopeful signs of the Council's regaining its vitality and assuming the constitutional role assigned to it under the Charter. The Secretary-General has in his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization drawn pointed attention to this question and has noted with satisfaction the reassertion of the constitutional authority of the Economic and Social Council [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 7]. One of that Council's most important functions is the coordination and reconciliation of the activities of the independent specialized agencies and other organs \u2014  steadily growing in number \u2014 through which the economic and social policies of the United Nations are carried into effect. There has to be decentralization but not at the expense of integration; there should be effective co-ordination to avoid duplication and dissipation of effort, waste of staff and inefficient use of funds.\n166.\tThe criticism is often heard that the developing countries are too importunate or too peremptory in their demands for aid. The modest targets set for the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries do not, in our opinion, justify such a harsh criticism. Aid is like the quality of mercy: it blesseth him that gives and him that takes. If it is inspired by altruism, it is also sustained by self-interest. It is an investment that will some day yield a dividend in which the donor will himself share, as it will give the recipient nations readier access to the products of the donor nations. This is sufficient justification for the developing countries' proposal, in regard to the reform of the international monetary system, that there should be a definite link established between special drawing rights and development aid. The proposal that in the next issue of special drawing rights the developing nations should have a greater share is only the other side of the same coin. The creation of this next issue should no longer be deferred.\n167.\tThe question of a world disarmament conference will once again be discussed. The major Powers have an opportunity of providing an earnest of their good faith and thus creating a favourable climate for such a conference if they pledge themselves to a total and unqualified renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons; a comprehensive test ban treaty, to be concluded without any further excuses or delay; the total cessation of the manufacture of all nuclear weapons; and the dismantling of all nuclear arsenals. Those Powers which enjoy an overwhelming superiority in nuclear capacity and whose nuclear armouries pose the greatest threat of nuclear war ending in a nuclear holocaust must first set an example by giving the lead in committing themselves to these four points. If we condemn atmospheric testing, we must not content ourselves with merely making mild remonstrances against the conduct of underground testing. We must condemn all forms of testing and demand the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty, accompanied by the other and related measures which we have already proposed.\n168.\tThe Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has once again failed to keep its promise of producing a draft agreement on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and the destruction of stockpiles of such weapons. The excuse given by those who wish to retain these weapons is palpably flimsy.\n169.\tIn striking contrast to the fervour with which the major Powers appeal for the support of the rest of the membership for any disarmament proposal they produce is the attitude of disdain and superciliousness with which they themselves have treated a proposal that adopts a positive approach to the problem, one that seeks to prevent the spread of the arms race into at least one region of the world, one that seeks, as its ultimate aim, the removal of all military bases from that area and one that by this means seeks to create a climate of peace where the accumulation or the use of arms would not be necessary. I refer to the Indian Ocean peace zone proposal on which the General Assembly adopted a Declaration at its twenty-sixth session [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. This Declaration, may I remind the Assembly, failed to secure. the support of the major Powers with one notable exception \u2014 China. The First Committee will shortly receive and consider the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean [A/9029] established by General Assembly resolution 2992 (XXVII). I do not feel called upon, therefore, to comment on the report at this stage.\n170.\tThe United Nations does not appear to be anywhere near a solution of the Middle East problem. On the other hand it seems to be coming \u2014 if it has not already come \u2014 perilously close to the eye of the storm. Institutions and individuals that ardently support respect for human rights and express their indignation over the denial to a certain group of the right to leave their country do not show any concern over the fact that the assertion of that right results in the flagrant denial and destruction of the human rights of another group. I refer to the policy adopted by the State of Israel of establishing along the perimeter of the occupied territories a pattern of settlements in which for the most part Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union are settled.\n171.\tWhy do the champions of human rights fail to voice their objections to the expropriation of the lands of the Palestinian Arabs and to their use for the establishment of Jewish settlements on the pretext of security? This pretext cannot be reconciled with the declarations of Israeli leaders that the State of Israel commands overwhelming military superiority over the combined forces of the Arab world. This is no idle boast. More disturbing, however, are the statements of Israeli leaders that they are acting in accordance with the doctrine of the power of right or the right of power, the most naked and unabashed assertion of the principle that might is right, which is totally at variance with the fundamental principles of the Organization to which they belong and to which they have pledged their support.\n172.\tWe wish to see a settlement in the Middle East  \u2014 one that will guarantee conditions of peace and security not merely to the people of Israel but to all the peoples of the Arab world that are their neighbours. We wish to see a partnership established between them that can be of lasting benefit to both groups. But we must hold the scales evenly and create conditions in which negotiations, direct or indirect, can start. To invoke Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is meaningless if the violation of the human rights of the population of the occupied territories continues to pass unchallenged and unchecked. The present policy of Israel can only be described as one of territorial aggrandizement based on the territorial claims of Israel and in transgression of the very instrument that created the State of Israel within clearly demarcated boundaries. The State of Israel has a right to welcome Jews from all over the world \u2014 no one questions that right \u2014 but it must not be left free to encroach on the territory, and extinguish the rights, of the Palestinian Arabs.\n173.\tAs long as the occupation in its present form continues and is consolidated by the practices and policies systematically pursued by the Government of Israel, the conditions required for negotiation will never be created. The hope of peace will remain as remote and evanescent as ever and the danger of the outbreak of hostilities will haunt us, undiminished by considerations sacred or secular. The fighting that flared up on 6 October was a grim warning.\n174.\tThe Charter is a document that has a sanctity of its own, even if it lacks Messianic inspiration, and any violation of the Charter is a greater blasphemy and sacrilege than a decision to assert one's rights while one antagonist is absorbed in a spiritual exercise of supreme significance to him \u2014 even if that were actually the case. All faiths must be held in reverence, but it is no less a blasphemy and sacrilege to plead that the most sacred hour in one's calendar must be invoked to secure one's immunity from the consequences of one's own wrongdoing.\n175.\tThe latest news is that civilian targets in densely populated areas in the heart of Damascus are being subjected to intensive and ruthless bombing by the Israeli Air Force, the excuse being that they are close to military headquarters. There are even reports, still to be confirmed, that fatal casualties have occurred among the families of foreign diplomats. Against this background of savagery, the Israeli Foreign Minister's impassioned and propagandistic reference at the 2139th meeting to atonement sounds utterly hollow and hypocritical.\n176.\tThe inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force is a principle that must be accepted and honoured without qualification or equivocation. It is a principle that is not open to modification or attenuation. Any attempt at manipulating it through prevarication to suit a particular nation's policies and designs will deceive nobody. It is, as it were, the coping stone of the archway of peace through which all posterity must be free to pass in safety, in honour and in dignity. Tamper with it, and the whole structure will collapse in ruins.\n177.\tIt is in that spirit that the efforts to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must be renewed.\n178.\tThe members of the international community will soon face their severest test in co-operation and compromise for the establishment of a stable and viable law of the sea when the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is convened. We shall be called upon to review existing international law and transform it, especially that part of it that derives its authority from custom, to suit the moral values, ethical standards and political principles of the twentieth century. These are entirely different from the values, standards and principles of the generation of Grotius and Selden. Any law or custom governing the conduct of nations in their relations with one another must be based on principles of equity and international social justice. If a genuine and durable reform of the law of nations, whether it be in regard to the law of the sea or other aspects of international law, is to be achieved, there has to be a willingness on the part of the powerful and affluent to accommodate the interests and aspirations of the less privileged nations of the world. A law which will ensure order as well as justice must be free from extravagance and must take into special consideration the interests of the land-locked countries, if they are to be treated as equal partners with an equal right to the common heritage of mankind.\n179.\tThe United Nations has made little progress with the problems of Africa. The savage and ruthless suppression of liberation movements in Portuguese colonial Territories by the Government of Portugal, the odious and obnoxious racist policies of the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia and of the South African Government continue unabated. Civilized opinion throughout the world remains outraged but helpless. The only effective weapon, short of armed intervention \u2014  which is beyond contemplation \u2014 is sanctions if they are scrupulously enforced. It is too often pleaded that a Member State's duties and responsibilities under the Charter must be governed by realities. In the language of diplomacy, reality is only an imaginary obstacle to the fulfilment of a binding obligation. This plea or pretext is most often advanced in regard to the enforcement of mandatory sanctions against racist regimes. More than anything else, this attitude undermines the Charter and impairs its effectiveness, while at the same time dealing a mortal blow to the prestige of the principal organs of the United Nations \u2014 the General Assembly and the Security Council. The lofty sentiments often heard in this Assembly lose their meaning when they are belied by actions and policies which reject or ignore Charter obligations.\n180.\tIn the general debate scant attention is paid to one of the principal organs of the United Nations \u2014 the Secretariat. The United Nations is the hub of the international civil service and should serve as a model to all the other members of the United Nations family in regard to the maintenance of efficiency, morale and that essential ingredient of all forms of service, loyalty to the employer \u2014 in this instance the international community. Without loss of national identity there could be subordination of it in the larger interest of the world community. Morale can be sustained only if the permanent members of the international civil service are assured of fair treatment in the matter of promotion and remuneration. Recruitment policies must similarly be designed to secure the best talent available subject only to the requirement stated in Article 101, paragraph 3 of the Charter.\n181.\tEvery Member has a right to ensure that the principle of equitable geographical distribution without sacrifice of merit and efficiency is strictly observed, but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that there are occasions when undue pressure is exercised by delegations in regard to appointments and promotions. Where such pressures are successful and affect the legitimate career prospects of permanent members of the Organization, some degree of demoralization must result. The Members should extend their co-operation to the Secretary-General in ensuring that the highest standards are maintained in regard to recruitment and\n. promotion, free from any suspicion of political influence, and that recruits to the international civil service have an assured prospect of steady advancement unaffected by extraneous factors, provided they maintain the requisite standards of integrity, efficiency and loyalty.\n182.\tAnother aspect of the problem which deserves attention is the remuneration of members of the Secretariat. The currency fluctuations of recent times have caused hardship to many, especially those in the lower grades. An arrangement should be made whereby the adjustments in allowances can be effected with the least possible delay where currency fluctuations have an adverse effect on the emoluments of the staff. Such an arrangement could conform in large measure to the policy and practice of the host country in regard to the members of its own civil service. Relief often comes too late, and in the meantime avoidable hardship is inflicted on the staff.\n183.\tIn section XI of the excellent introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has drawn attention to the additional burden imposed on the Organization's finances through the exchange fluctuations that have occurred in recent times, particularly the decline in the value of the United States dollar. It would appear that the nervous breakdown of the United States dollar \u2014 and I deliberately describe it as a nervous breakdown, as the decline in the value of the dollar has nothing to do with economic factors such as the productive capacity of the United States economy and its competitiveness \u2014 has resulted in an increase of as much as 25 per cent or more in the cost in dollars of purchasing the currencies required to meet the United Nations regular budget obligations in Geneva, Vienna and elsewhere.\n184.\tIt would not be unfair to suggest that that extra cost should be borne by those countries whose currencies have strengthened against the United States dollar. Some of those countries have acquired that position of strength and superiority largely owing to the generosity of the United States. If the extra financial costs imposed on the Organization as a result of this development in the world's money markets has to be met at the expense of humanitarian programmes undertaken or contemplated by the Organization, the prosperous economies should not begrudge the United Nations this special measure of relief. While on this theme, we should like to congratulate the Government of Japan on its special grant of $10 million and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on its special grant of $ 1 million to meet part of the deficit under which the Organization is now staggering. Those are examples worthy of emulation by others.\n185.\tThe need for a revision of the Charter has been referred to by many speakers. In our opinion, the Charter remains the best instrument for international cooperation to secure peace, harmony and progress and the establishment of a stable world order that human ingenuity could have devised to suit the fickleness and frailty of human nature and the unavoidable partisanship that is dictated by expediency and overrides principle. There are some aspects in regard to which the Charter requires revision to bring it into line with contemporary realities. Changes of a fundamental character, especially those affecting the relationships that existed between the members of the victorious alliance of the Second World War 28 years ago. have taken place and must be considered in any revision. Two continents do not enjoy the privilege of permanent representation and the power that goes with it in the Security Council. Political considerations today count for much less than economic factors. But in any attempt at reform we must reckon with the fact that once conferred special privileges are difficult to withdraw. The most urgent reform of all is reform of ourselves."

        "file_text": "\ufeff70.\tMr. President, fellow travellers on Spaceship Earth: it is with pleasure that the Philippine delegation offers its warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your many years of distinguished participation in the affairs of the United Nations is the best guarantee that you will guide this Assembly successfully. We are certain that under your able leadership our deliberations will proceed expeditiously and productively and that we will maintain the high standard of achievement of your eminent predecessors, the latest of whom was the distinguished Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, Mr. Stanislaw Trepzynski.\n71.\tA time of change, such as the present, should be a time of opportunity. When human affairs become fluid,\nwhat has been impossible becomes possible. What could never be attempted can be accomplished. On the other hand, when old moorings are swept away and old approaches and patterns no longer work, a sense of disorientation and anxiety can overcome us. The question is how we meet change. If we utilize change, direct change, steer change into constructive channels, we can transform situations that have been intractable and we can build anew in better, more adequate ways. If we resist change, if we mourn the old ways, if we are unprepared and have no designs for a better future, then the tides of change will be blocked and futility and frustration will be the result.\n72.\tThat we are at such a \\\"fork in history\\\" is plain to all of us. Every field of human affairs is characterized by rapid and irreversible change. The wise guiding of change is our\nmajor responsibility as we near the three-quarter mark of this century.\n73.\tEven forms of government yield to change and adapt to the overriding needs and aspirations of peoples, aspirations whose fulfilment cannot be any longer delayed. Where there is no change, or where efforts are made to set the clock back, disaster is the result. Thus, in the Philippines, as in many other countries, change has become necessary and inevitable in response to the nation's imperative need for a better life.\n74.\tAt a time when many old, historically stable, democratic Governments are finding the traditional processes of democracy tarnished-I repeat, tarnished \u2014 and their stability uncertain, even more the Governments of newer and poorer nations are discerning, as the Philippines has discerned, that decisive and innovative changes are called for.\n75.\tA year ago, President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines established what was aptly described as a New Society. In essence it was a realistic response to a compelling need for revolutionary change. The old political framework, transplanted from the West, had proved inadequate to satisfy the aspirations of our people for economic and social justice. Structural reforms were needed; indeed, the entire society had to be restructured. The paramount aim was full participation of the people in the responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of national development.\n76.\tPresident Marcos said on the occasion of the first anniversary of the New Society two weeks ago:\n\\\"Basically, what we have done was to lay the foundations of national civility that have been torn up by decades of bitter political strife and social anarchy. We have redressed the most urgent popular grievances. We have established a pattern of social, political and economic stability. From this new level of stability we must now launch our nation towards new heights of development.\\\"\nThe results are indeed noteworthy. Due to enhanced international acceptance, arising from greatly improved domestic stability, peace and order, foreign investments in the Philippines increased by 138 per cent-I repeat, 138 per cent. The growth of domestic business has kept pace.\n77.\tEven more significant is the change brought about by land reform, the historic cause of social unrest. In recognition of its importance, the first act of President Marcos under the New Society was to declare the entire country a land reform area. In just one year more than 100,000 land transfers have been accomplished, together with essential supporting measures such as the establishment of cooperatives and credit financing, and the development of farm infrastructure facilities. This exceeds the total number of transfers in the quarter century since the Philippines regained its independence.\n78.\tThe six-year land reform programme envisions the transfer of more than 1.5 million hectares of farm land to nearly 1 million tenant farmers.\n79.\tAnother significant change for the better is the increase of foreign exchange reserves. Starting at a very low point, our foreign exchange reserves rose by over 5,000 per cent-I repeat, 5,000 per cent \u2014 under the New Society. In 1972, the surplus was near rock bottom at $10 million. During the first eight months of 1973 it went up to $531 million, and in September it rose to $759 million as against $10 million a year ago. There has also been a notable improvement in the balance-of-payments position, which' in the past year showed a surplus of $425 million as against only $6 million the previous year.\n80.\tTax revenues have increased by more than 65 per cent, reflecting the effectiveness of tax reforms and, more important, enhanced popular support for the New Society. Tourists are coming in ever-greater numbers, and a 30 per cent increase is projected for the coming year.\n81.\tThe economic gains under the New Society are matched by advances in the social sectors. Every aspect of national development has received a fresh impetus. The New Society has acted as a catalyst, releasing the creative energies of our people. Dynamic self-help is being maximized.\n82.\tIn this great undertaking of transforming a society that had been stunted and malformed by centuries of foreign domination, we have received invaluable assistance from friendly countries and various agencies of the United Nations family. Almost by definition, poor, developing countries, particularly former colonies like the Philippines, cannot attain self-sustaining growth by self-help alone. There are critical gaps in technology, modern equipment and capital funds that can only be filled with external aid.\n83.\tWe are particularly grateful to the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], now the largest United Nations operational agency for development, for envisaging an increased indicative planning figure allocation in support of our four-year country development programme. The programme is being reviewed in the light of the New Society's development priorities. We intend to maintain close co-operation with UNDP in this exercise.\n84.\tOn the social side, the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF] continues to give us urgently needed aid, particularly in the vital fields of child health, applied nutrition, and education for under-privileged youth. Important and deeply appreciated technical assistance is being provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other specialized agencies.\n85.\tBut the greatest share of credit and responsibility belongs to our own people, who are now energetically working in unison under the inspired leadership of our President. \\\"The most important gain [of the New Society],\\\" said President Marcos, \\\"is the transformation of our people. It is here that our Democratic Revolution [finds] its greatest virtue.\\\"\n86.\tWe are responding constructively to the challenge of change. Politically and economically we are striving, with growing success, to put our own house in order. But in our interdependent world there can be no security in isolation.\n87.\tOur foreign policy therefore has also undergone significant change under the New Society. Among these is a new and sustained effort to open the windows towards the socialist and/or communist countries. Last year, the Philippines established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and Romania. And in the last two weeks, diplomatic ties were forged between the Philippines and the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic, respectively. Active negotiations are in progress to normalize relations with other socialist countries.\n88.\tIt is also natural that we should be deeply concerned about the situation in our own neighbourhood, in the Asian region to which we belong.\n89.\tWith the ending of the war in Viet-Nam, a new situation confronts us in Asia. One super-Power, the United States, is withdrawing its forces from the Asian mainland and generally reducing its military presence in the area. Another super-Power, the Soviet Union, is increasing its political and military presence in the region. Then we have China, historically and actually the most important Asian country. And modern Japan represents an unprecedented, perhaps unique, factor in the sense that it is a great economic power which thus far has renounced the traditional attendant trappings of military power.\n90.\tThe crucial question for us in Asia is this, What shape or form will this momentous convergence of events and forces assume? Will the change be constructive? Or will a new struggle for domination turn Asia once again into a battleground of competing great Power ambitions?\n91.\tIn Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971, the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] -Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand \u2014 have adopted the ASEAN Declaration of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality.  This Declaration expresses their desire to see peace and stability prevail in Southeast Asia and indeed in the whole Asian region, through the observance of the principle of non-intervention in their domestic affairs. It' is supplemented by President Marcos's proposal for an Asian forum in which Asian problems could be considered in a spirit of amicable co-operation and Asian disputes settled by peaceful means.\n92.\tStill a cause for serious concern is the continued fighting in Cambodia. Foreign interference is fanning the fires of conflict between the two contending national leaderships in the Khmer Republic. But however plausible the reasons may be, intervention in the internal affairs of a State is inadmissible. We believe therefore that the basic prescription for peace in Cambodia will be to allow the Cambodians to decide their own destiny without active and material assistance from outside. It is up to the Khmer people themselves to determine unmolested the leadership and Government of their choice. If it was possible in Laos to achieve a peace settlement among the contending parties, it is reasonable to expect that a similar accord could be reached in Cambodia. The adjudication of differences within nations and among peoples of the same race, of the\nsame culture and tradition, if left alone, should be easier to accomplish. Another aspect of the Khmer conflict is the claim put forward that the government in exile had remote control of that territory when it took flight. The United Nations should reject this claim as it is incredible and also fraught with dangerous implications for every Member State.\n93.\tThe ASEAN countries were heartened by the Shanghai communiqu\u00e9 of 27 February 1972, in which China and the United States agreed that no single Power should exercise hegemony in Asia. They are encouraged by the professed desire of Japan to play a constructive role in the peaceful development of the Asian region and they hope that the Soviet Union, in developing its policies and its presence in Asia, will take fully into account the Asian peoples' aspiration to peaceful progress.\n94.\tWhile Asia claims our primary interest, we are no less concerned with the state of the world as a whole. In this larger context, change is also the order of the day. And so it must be with our own world Organization. The United Nations cannot afford to stand still. It must move resolutely toward the future in a sustained effort to bring into being a peaceful and equitable world motivated by justice and humanity. Building the future can be, and should be, a joyful process of co-operative construction. But if change is resisted, if nations are grudging in participating in the communal task, if they refuse to see the handwriting on the wall, then humanity will shed many more bitter and wholly unnecessary tears.\n95.\tOur skills are not so lacking, our understanding is not so meagre, that Spaceship Earth cannot be managed, cannot be piloted successfully toward a better future. No, the ingenuity and imagination of men, the knowledge and wisdom we already have in hand are not so deficient that we can find an excuse in ignorance or a refuge in lack of vision, or in a failure to meet the urgent requirements of our times. The blame, if blame there is to be, must lie in the spirit of separatism and of insularity and in efforts to maintain the status quo rather than in exploring together and planning together for that future toward which we are inevitably travelling and in which we snail find that our common identity is the only workable, the only practical and the only functional reality.\n96.\tThere can be no secession from the world. No nation can return to former, less complicated, less interdependent\n< days. Instead, the implications of our new interdependence have to be spelled out and must, for survival's sake, be implemented without delay.\n97.\tIn many ways our world Organization has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, innovation and originality.\nIn the passage of time, it has generated \\\"global departments\\\" for many of humanity's most urgent needs: among others, in the fields of health, food, education, economic assistance, atomic energy and, even more recently, in environment, population and soon, we hope, a regime for the sea-bed and ocean space. It can be said without exaggeration that these \\\"departments of planetary management\\\" are fundamentally sound, if inadequately supported. Considering the restrictions on their activities imposed by limited resources, they have to their credit many significant achievements.\n98.\tClearly, however, the United Nations is not yet receiving the support or the recognition of its centrality in the affairs of all its Members which is required for successful, joint, co-operative approaches to man's most pressing problems \u2014 problems which cannot be met and mastered except at the global level. The near-universality of the Organization, and the new steps achieved at the beginning of this session, suggest a growing realization of the essential and fundamental role the Organization will be required to play in the future.\n99.\tI should like, at this time, in my turn to offer my congratulations and the warm welcome of my country to the three new Members of our Organization: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We look forward to the important contribution which we are sure they will make to the work of the United Nations. The roster is now nearly complete, and we look forward to the membership of the remaining divided countries at the earliest possible time.\n100.\tWe have already heard in this general debate several references to the encumbrances of an Organization which has not changed as rapidly as it should, which continues to be handicapped in its work by improvisation, ad hoc inventions and last-minute efforts to head off major disasters, a tactic which is foredoomed to failure. It is perfectly true that improving the structure and functioning of our Organization will not mean that it will automatically be used more effectively by its Members. At the same time, however, every improvement we make will remove one more excuse for the non-use of the United Nations.\n101.\tImprovements in our pre-atomic-age Charter have been long, almost disastrously, delayed. The structure of the Security Council no longer accords with reality. It should be enlarged and made more truly representative. The human rights functions of the Organization seriously need rationalization and centralization. There is no standing machinery for conciliation in political disputes. The peacekeeping machinery is still ad hoc in character. We have heard earlier that it may now be possible to move ahead, finally, in the institutionalization of the peace-keeping function which is vital and indispensable to world peace. Our earnest hope is that renewed efforts will bear fruit in the near future.\n102.\tIt is plainly embarrassing to old and new Members alike that the odious phrase \\\"enemy States\\\" remains in our Charter. We must consider it a disgrace that we were unable to remove this anachronism before the admission of new Members this year.\n103.\tIt is high time indeed for deliberations on the ways to adapt our Organization more effectively to the increasingly heavy demands that will be, and because of the inevitability of future history must be, placed on the United Nations. Our distinguished and able Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, has raised for all of us the fundamental question in very clear terms in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"Do the majority of Member States really want an Organization which is more than a conference machinery\nand a forum for the pursuit of national policies? Do they really want an Organization which can play a useful and active role in focusing international efforts on the solution of the most difficult and controversial problems .. .? \\\" [A/9001/Add.1, p. 8]\nThose are the questions posed to us by the Secretary- General.\n104.\tIn my view, the answer to these questions is at the present time neither yes nor no. The Members are ambivalent about the United Nations. They begin to see the absolute and inescapable necessity for the Organization to perform functions global in scope that no States nor group of States can perform by themselves. At the same time, implied in implementing vital tasks for the world community is a major change, if one might say so, in gravity, a shift in focus from go-it-alone national attitudes and mechanisms to machinery for global co-operation, consensus and the common pursuit of collective solutions.\n105.\tBut we cannot expect to enjoy the fruits of collective action on common problems without prior commitment to a community approach. International peace and security, collective economic security, disarmament and universal human rights will always elude us unless the prerequisite commitments to common processes are firmly and finally made.\n106.\tIt is with those considerations in mind that the Government of the Philippines has resolutely stood for the improvement of our Organization. I wish to make it absolutely clear that we have taken this approach for no ulterior motives. We have none. We have not undertaken it from ambition for a special place in the Organization. We have none. We have not undertaken it as the agent for any super-Power or for any nation other than ourselves. Our concern is simply to help bring our Organization up to the highest peak of efficiency and effectiveness achievable at this critical time. We are well aware, like the majority of Members, that this is not the case today. As, during the coming year, we prepare for a sober consideration of the views and suggestions of Members for the improvement of the world Organization, we anticipate that all Members will be giving this important endeavour the serious reflection it deserves and requires. We look forward to co-operating again with like-minded colleagues from many countries as we recommence the work we began on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization.\n107.\tThis, too, is an anniversary year \u2014 the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the noblest, most far-reaching texts of man, and a testimonial to the essential soundness of mankind's vision and aspiration. The acceptance of a guide of planetary norms for the treatment of human beings is wholly without precedent. Its adoption marked a new \\\"coming of age\\\" of the human race. For the first time, man, the noblest of species, was called upon to respond and to respect the integrity of all of its own kind.\n108.\tThe intervening years have seen stumbling progress, halting progress, but real and substantial progress nevertheless. Yet the right to self-determination, the only basic human right enshrined in both of the International Covenants on human rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)], continues to be defiantly denied to remaining colonies, particularly in Africa. And above all evils, the evil of apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination still divides us, still pits man against man, still inflicts wounds on the body of mankind.\n109.\tWe are embarking on a new effort to eradicate this most ancient evil. We all have our responsibilities in this regard. But some Members in a position to effect change have a particular and unique responsibility and, if I might say so, the opportunity to ring down the curtain on this aspect of man's inhumanity to man. Does the exercise of this opportunity cost something in terms of short-term strained relations or immediate benefit? Then we must ask, What is that cost, compared to the freeing of whole enclaves of humanity into their proper estate, and to the gratitude which will be universally felt?\n110.\tWe welcome the growing spirit of detente-as long as it bears fruits to be shared by all the world. It should, for instance, extend to the Middle East and inspire a new and determined effort to resolve that crisis on the basis of Security Council resolution 242(1967). And detente should be merely the prelude to renewed and intensified efforts within the larger framework of our Organization to find concord and to tackle the blights of our planet with resources released from strife. A detente that stops short will be a source of disappointment, and can even become a source of global danger. For detente is only the beginning of opportunity-opportunity to approach the neglected agenda of man's most urgent needs. The United Nations has recently been the birthplace of important new concepts of\n. the greatest .potential importance for peace and justice. In connexion with the Third United' Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the concept of the common heritage of mankind was born. In connexion with the material disparities which are inflicting untold suffering on the \\\"southern world\\\", the concept of \\\"collective economic security\\\" is now under consideration and elaboration, together with the Mexican proposal for a charter of economic rights and\n, duties of States, which may ultimately become one of the means for the emancipation of man from want and hunger. Only when that comes to pass will the full dimensions of human creative energies become manifest.\n111.\tIn any case, we must begin immediately to plan together and to plan carefully for the equitable access of all peoples to the finite resources and benefits of our small,, beautiful and irreplaceable planet. To protect short-term gains against the requirements of long-term global planning is to prepare the world for strife and the human race for suicide. While we have time, there is, as we have often been reminded, no time to spare. If we cannot plan for our collective future in the United Nations, then where shall we confront the task? Progress thus far has given only mild reason for hope and, in some areas, it has been plainly disappointing. For instance, which of the resolutions adopted at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have been honoured and implemented? Which? To what extent are the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade to be achieved? The record so far has not been encouraging, and it sharply challenges complacency. History will judge harshly those that have the power, and thus the opportunity and responsibility to act, and yet have so far neglected to do so.\n112.\tThe importance of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is well understood by us all. In particular, the Conference will provide for archipelagic countries like my own the possibility of a much more adequate recognition of our special problems, which have been ignored in the past. The Philippines, in common with other archipelagic States, has a profound interest in this question, and we intend to take an active part in its detailed consideration by the appropriate Committee of the Assembly.\n113.\tAll States stand to benefit from the rationalization of the law of the sea. And, as cannot be said too often, the placing of the bulk of the resources of the sea under the auspices of a new United Nations regime will guarantee new economic benefits, equitably shared, and the preservation and protection of the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\". To achieve that goal will require a high degree of restraint and a sense of community born of a truly enlightened self-interest. To fail to exercise this attitude at the forthcoming Conference would be to forfeit one of the major opportunities now open to the family of nations. The measure of joint planning and consensus for mutual benefit at the Conference will be the measure of maturity in the world community.\n114.\tNot only will the Conference on the Law of the Sea be held next year, but, as we are also aware, the World Population Conference will convene during a year dedicated to a re-evaluation of the carrying capacity of the planet and of the responsibilities of each nation with regard to population questions, a field in which the United Nations Fund for Population Activities has been rendering exceptionally efficient and commendable service. Each of these major issues which has come before this Organization \u2014 as, last year, the vital question of preserving and enchancing the human environment was before us-serves to demonstrate the overriding need for effective world approaches and for effective world institutions to implement them. Thus, each passing year underlines the importance of our work and can serve to renew our determination to succeed in our endeavours.\n115.\tIn the light of those considerations, it is to be regretted that this year has not seen more substantial progress in halting and reversing the arms race, which, like a cancerous growth on the body of humanity, parasitically drains off so much of the world's material and scientific wealth not only into non-productive but into monstrously threatening channels. It is a matter of particular regret to the nations of the Pacific basin that the appeals of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with regard to the end of all nuclear testing have gone unheeded. While we welcome whatever forward motion has been registered in the existing forums, the results are disappointingly meagre and slow, leaving humanity still in jeopardy and with an uncertain future. The acceleration of progress towards a ban on all nuclear tests should be the overriding consideration \u2014 not whether one or another forum at any particular time should be given eminence.\n116.\tWe fully realize that no single meeting or series of meetings, no single forum or series of forums will provide\ninstant general disarmament. Yet we believe that each avenue which offers some promise of greater understanding and progress should be most seriously considered. We would point out that progress made during the coming year will assist greatly in ensuring a productive review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].\n117.\tGeneral and complete disarmament, in the long run, depends, as it always has, upon the simultaneous creation of a viable and just world order able to assume and discharge the responsibilities of peace-making and peacekeeping and the safeguarding of equity and justice that no nation or group of nations can ever again provide for themselves. It is thus urgent that we begin \\\"thinking in parallel\\\" \u2014 in designing provision for the parallel augmentation of our international institutions for global peace and security at the same time that we redouble our efforts to curtail and finally to end the nuclear arms race. Nor must the conventional arms races in areas of tension \u2014 which until now have been all too often overlooked-be neglected. Not only do they take on ruinous economic dimensions and threaten military disaster for the States concerned, but they can also serve as the fuses for general conflict. We would hope that the United Nations may be encouraged to assume a part of the task once performed by the League of Nations in the publication of available data on arms budgets and arms transfers. Such publication would be wholly without prejudice to the parties concerned, but would provide the world community with instructive information and perhaps\n. guide-lines as a basis for action in dealing with this extremely important problem.\n118.\tIn a related field, my Government takes a profound interest in the forthcoming conference on human rights in armed conflict,  called at the suggestion of the International Committee of the Red Cross. We particularly applaud the efforts of those whose far-sighted and humanitarian endeavours are directed to limitations and restrictions on particularly indiscriminate or cruel weapons, and we remain hopeful of progress in this area.\n119.\tEach year of the following decade, like the years of the past decade, is sure to be described as \\\"unprecedented\\\"; and each time the statement is made it will be absolutely correct. Our annual meeting provides the opportunity for a trip to the mountain-top to broaden our perspective, renew our vision and chart a course of constructive change for the period ahead. At times, all that is required is course correction; at other times, major shifts in orientation and commitment are inescapable. No less than the best we have to offer will suffice to see us through the fateful changes of the period immediately ahead.\n120.\tIts major characteristics will relate to the implementation of interdependence in new institutions and in adaptation of the best of the old; they will relate to the central fact of irreversible human convergence and to the need for securing the richness of human diversity as the accompaniment of human unity. It has been well said that we have no alternative but to enact our age-old ideals-for purely technical reasons. The planet cannot be steered save\nfrom the cockpit of Spaceship Earth on which, for better or for worse, we are all fellow travellers. The requirements of its passengers cannot be analysed or quantified adequately except from the central clearing-house. What our individual nations can perform adequately for their peoples can, should and will remain with them; what they cannot, must be pooled for accommodation and the hammering out of collective decisions. The road of conscious comity leads to a peaceful and harmonious future; the alternate road of separatism and self-defeating selfishness leads to disaster.\n121.\tOur United Nations gains daily in importance in the discharge of our common task. May it gain daily also in the commitment of its Members."

        "file_text": "\ufeff121.\tMr. President, since a tradition appears to have been established that Algeria should be the last to speak in the general debate, I avail myself of this opportunity and privilege to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to you from this rostrum by all the speakers who have preceded me and with whom I am particularly happy to associate my delegation. We rejoice in the fact that at last, following the rule of accession to the presidency of the General Assembly, small countries like ours accede to an equality of rights among the members of the international community, an equality that has still to be extended to more fundamental areas of our activity.\n122.\tWe are convinced that the compliments addressed to you, Mr. President, are highly deserved because of the qualities you have shown in the course of your long career in this Organization, which are a guarantee that under your wise guidance the current session of the General Assembly will score a success in the history of our Organization.\n123.\tYour election to the presidency is also a tribute paid to the Latin American continent and its increasingly remarkable role in world affairs and, more especially, in the united efforts deployed by the countries of the third world to solve their problems and assume their responsibilities at the international level.\n124.\tIt is also for me a pleasant duty to convey to Mr. Trepczynski our gratitude for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the twenty-seventh session and to assure him of our friendship and deep esteem.\n125.\tAs we come to the end of our general debate it would appear, as usual, that while some assess optimistically the evolution of the international situation, others express their apprehension as regards the future of our peoples. They have all referred to the present trend towards detente among the great Powers, a detente which appears to ring down the curtain on the cold war and mark the beginning of a new era characterized both by the substitution of cooperation for confrontation among the great Powers and by the emergence of new centres of decision on the international scene. No one would dream of denying the importance of such a phenomenon which is likely to change fundamentally the international environment. But its exact significance and the implications it entails are not assessed in the same terms by all the members of the international community. If we truly find ourselves at a turning-point in our history, then it is more than ever necessary that we understand our mutual intentions, our preoccupations and our aspirations. The change that has begun in international relations may lead to the strengthening of peace and security if henceforward we devote ourselves to the task of defining our long-term objectives and orienting our efforts towards the solution of the real problems threatening mankind.\n126.\tThe present situation did not arise spontaneously and if the period of the cold war has come to an end it is certainly not by reason of a sudden manifestation of wisdom among the great Powers in the world. Throughout this period the balance of the power of destruction prevented the unleashing of a confrontation between the superpowers. The impossibility of each of them achieving absolute supremacy over the other finally showed the futility of competition in the field of armaments and encouraged them to accept each other mutually as the first Powers of the world in the exercise of international responsibilities. The establishment of that new situation should naturally go hand in hand with the solution of the problems of the cold war, particularly in Europe and in Asia, and take account of the evolution that has led to the emergence of new Powers that are naturally associated in the management of international affairs.\n127.\tThus, the threat of a general conflagration and of the unleashing of an atomic war that for so long weighed over mankind has been averted and the trend towards detente is encouraged by an increased sharing in international responsibilities by the more active participation of the People's Republic of China in the management of world affairs and by the efforts of the countries of Europe to achieve their own rapprochement and to establish co-operative links among themselves. It is on such elements that some base their optimistic vision of the future, a future in which relations of understanding must replace relations of force and where an unbridled and ruinous race in the field of armaments will be replaced by peaceful competition for technical and scientific progress and the organization of a better life for all peoples.\n128.\tThis euphoric appreciation is somewhat Utopian and unfortunately is not confirmed by the realities of our daily life.\n129.\tThe burning events of these past few days show how fragile are the bases of hasty optimism in the assessment of the evolution of the international situation. The resumption of the war in the Middle East, following a new Israeli aggression against. Egypt and Syria, has come to remind us that peace in the world does not rest on peaceful coexistence among the great Powers alone. The persistence of Israel in its refusal to apply the resolutions of the Security Council and to abide by international law, the permanence of the injustice that struck the Palestinian people, are undoubtedly the more immediate causes of the tension that persists in that area of the world and which keeps alive the constant threat against international security. But it would be erroneous to stop at this cursory analysis and to refuse to include the problem of the Middle East in a broader context which would bring in the designs, ambitions and greed aroused both by the strategic advantages and the economic potential of the region. The energy crisis which threatens the industrialized countries has put the Middle East crisis in a new light and perfectly explains the role that appears to be given to Israel and the unfailing support which it receives from the United States of America and certain Western countries.\n130.\tA month ago a very grave crisis broke out in Chile, overthrowing the Government of President Allende. The coup deforce of the military junta intervened on the morrow of the Algiers Conference of non-aligned countries and constituted an open challenge to all the countries of the third world, assuming thus its true significance. In their declaration the Heads of State meeting in Algiers said:\n\\\"The Conference hails the Government and people of Chile, who in their struggle to consolidate their independence and build a new society are facing the combined aggression of reaction and imperialism. It expresses its solidarity with Chile in its efforts to achieve the economic and social transformations already started, to avoid the civil war and preserve its national unity.\\\" [See A/9330 and Corr.l, para. 56.]\n131.\tThe coup d'etat which cost the life of President Allende is the result of that combined aggression of reaction and imperialism and shows once again that the trend towards detente emerging in the relations between the great Powers has not yet made itself manifest in the countries of the third world.\n132.\tThe Chilean people at present are undergoing a tragic trial which calls into question not only their own freedoms and threatens the results so painfully acquired by their social and economic revolution, but constitutes also a danger to the freedom and independence of all our peoples. In its present difficult moments we want to assure that country that it has our entire solidarity and the active sympathy of all those who, throughout the world, remain attached to the ideals for which President Allende died. May we avail ourselves of this opportunity to pay a resounding tribute to President Salvador Allende, who, at the sacrifice of his life, has' given the greatest example of fidelity to his principles, devotion to his people and courage in the defence of the sovereignty of his country. Allende will not have died in vain. The movement that he had the merit to start, the social and economic transformations he undertook, the new awareness he aroused among the Chilean people, cannot be overthrown with the use of violence. The Chilean revolution will continue and the Chilean people \u2014  which will find no better guide than the memory of Allende, who showed them the only path that leads to freedom and dignity \u2014 will have the last word.\n133.\tThose events would be enough in themselves to justify our scepticism as regards the effects for the countries of the third world of the new climate that characterizes the relations between the great Powers. The removal to a distance of the spectre of a general holocaust does not suffice to eliminate the crises that are developing in the third world-or- the threats that hang over the present and future of our peoples.\n134.\tThe Conference of non-aligned countries recently held in Algiers considered the present international situation in depth and assessed its positive aspects, its shortcomings and its future implications. In its final Declaration, the Conference emphasized that:\n.. the present strengthening of detente between East and West and the progress towards the settlement in Europe of problems inherited from the Second World War represent important achievements by the forces of peace in the world. The fears created by the nuclear threat as well as the determination of peoples increasingly tend to give primacy to dialogue rather than confrontation.\\\" [Ibid., para. 10.]\n135. That development of the international situation was for too long demanded by the non-aligned countries for it not to be hailed by them as a first step towards the establishment among all peoples in the world of relations based on understanding and co-operation, free of any mental reservations on the utilization of force or the advantages of might to attack the sovereignty of others. But they cannot press complaisance so far as to ignore the threats that still weigh over their own security. The Declaration of Algiers states in fact, that:\n\\\"As long as colonial wars, apartheid, imperialist aggression, alien domination and foreign occupation and power politics, economic exploitation and plunder prevail, peace will prove limited in principle and scope. In a world where, besides a minority of rich countries there exists a majority of poor countries, it would be dangerous to increase such division by restricting peace to the prosperous areas of the world while the rest of mankind remained condemned to insecurity and domination by the most powerful. Peace is indivisible: it could not be reduced to a mere shifting of confrontation from one area to another, nor should it condone the continued existence of tension in some areas while endeavouring to eliminate it elsewhere. Detente would remain precarious if it did not take into consideration the interests of other countries.\\\" [Ibid., para. 16.]\n136.\tThis assessment, which reflects the aspirations of the majority of peoples, must not be regarded as \\\"a thunderclap under clear skies\\\" or as the tedious repetition of claims that are never satisfied. At a time when the division of the world into East and West blocs appears to be coming to an end, we do not wish to see a new demarcation established between countries enjoying the benefits of peace and security and countries condemned to live at war or under the threat of war \u2014 a demarcation which, as if by chance, would embrace the contours of the dividing line between developed and* developing countries. Those who, like us, wish to stop a discrimination so prejudicial to the establishment of a harmonious international order, must not content themselves with stressing its dangers and deploring its trends, but must work to prevent its aggravation by devoting to our preoccupations the attention they deserve.\n137.\tWe have never ceased speaking of those preoccupations, both in this Assembly and in other forums, and whenever we have addressed public opinion or other Governments. The sympathy they have met with in general has not been followed up in practice, and the problems they raised were left unsolved. Perhaps they were covered by the broader concern of a possible confrontation between the great Powers. Now that that possibility has been rejected by the establishment of peaceful coexistence, between the super-rowers and by the elimination of the last vestiges of the cold war, can we hope that there will be sufficient goodwill to make it possible to undertake the search for a satisfactory settlement of the crises affecting the third world, and envisage the translation into deeds of the decisions of principle adopted for the solution of those problems? It is in fact on that change in mentality and attitude and on the capacity of the international community to respond to the appeal and expectations of the third world that we shall judge the authenticity of the detente whose reality in the world of today is already being asserted by some.\n\\\"While considerable progress has been made towards East-West detente, the fact that peoples are in direct confrontation with colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid, alien domination and foreign occupation, neo-colonialism, imperialism and Zionism, remains an indisputable reality of our age.\\\" [Ibid., para. 14.]\nThus spoke the Heads of State of the non-aligned countries, summing up in this manner their preoccupations.\n138.\tDespite the true progress accomplished in the field of decolonization, the African continent is still afflicted in its southern part by the perpetuation of Portuguese colonialism which, in its stubborn attempt to survive the attacks of the liberation movements and the efforts of international organizations, assumes the most ignoble and hateful forms, as revealed by the latest massacres in Mozambique. The support that Portugal has in this House and \u2014 even more condemnable still \u2014 in the pursuance of its policy of oppression, responds perhaps to considerations of regional solidarity, which in this case transforms friendship into complicity, a complicity that we denounce once again in the strongest terms.\n139.\tHowever, the will of peoples in the long run will be stronger than the stubbornness of the Portuguese leaders who seek to maintain their anachronistic domination over the African Territories. The declaration of independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is undeniably a victory in the struggle for liberation, and an encouragement for the patriots who continue to fight in the other Territories under colonial domination.\n140.\tFor our part, we hail the birth of a new independent State in Africa, which only naturally finds its rightful place in the great African family, and in assuring it of our solidarity we wish to express our wishes for its success in its struggle against Portuguese aggression and for the building up of a prosperous nation proud of its freedom. We also express the hope that the independent Republic of Guinea-Bissau will soon join the other members of the international community in this Organization.\n141.\tThe colonial situation that continues to exist in the part of the Sahara under Spanish domination could not be prolonged without serious risks for the balance of all that area, which encompasses Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. For many years appeals have been addressed to the Spanish Government to facilitate and organize a referendum so that the Saharan people may exercise its right to self-determination. The sincerity of the Spanish authorities in their declared desire of respecting the will of the Sahsirans cannot be judged from their assertions \u2014 more or less solemn \u2014 but from frank and open action which will enable the Saharan population to express its will freely and without delay.\n142.\tThe attitude of the international community as regards the apartheid practised by South Africa has again manifested itself unequivocally in this Assembly when the large majority of its members refused to hear the statement of the representative of Pretoria. Here too it is difficult for us to understand and accept the equivocal position of countries which, while condemning apartheid, continue to give their support to a regime such as this to which apartheid is an article of faith. The solidarity of race and the community of interests are not enough to explain that they condemn the crime while fraternizing with the criminals. Apartheid constitutes a denial of all human values and an infamous affront against the dignity of Africans. One cannot at the same time proclaim one's friendship for Africa and give the champions of apartheid a support that enables them to consolidate their regime.\n143.\tBut it is not only by its obstinacy in the practice of apartheid that South Africa challenges the whole of the international community. The perpetuation of its domination over Namibia and its refusal to submit to the decisions of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice are more than mere violations of international law; they represent an insolent defiance of the resolutions of our Organization and an arrogant contempt for international opinion. South Africa finds in Namibia not only favourable ground for the extension of its policy of apartheid, but also a source of enrichment through the exploitation of the resources of that Territory. The countries that are associated with these economic interests bear a good part of the responsibility for the intransigent attitude of South Africa, which is encouraged by their complicity. By entrusting to its Secretary-General the task of contacting the Government of Pretoria to inform himself of its intentions and to try to find a solution which would preserve the rights of the Namibian people, the United Nations has shown a spirit of conciliation which in no way served to shake the stubbornness of the South African leaders. We believe, like all African States, that the mission entrusted to the Secretary- General should not be renewed. The intentions of South Africa are now clearer than ever and leave no room for hope of a settlement in a spirit of mutual understanding.\n144.\tEncouraged and supported by South Africa and Portugal, the minority regime of Salisbury maintains in Rhodesia a .situation that represents both colonialism and apartheid in that other Territory of southern Africa. In this case, the direct responsibility of Great Britain is involved, especially after its refusal to respond to the appeal of the African countries to resort to every means, including force, to put an end to the rebellion of the white settlers. The refusal of the African population to accept the settlement negotiated between Ian Smith and Lord Home, clearly expressed in the Pearce report,  leaves no doubt as to the will of the Africans to have their rights restored to them through the exercise of their responsibilities in their country. It is for the international community to support their efforts, to give them the necessary help and to strengthen the economic measures with which they intend to break the resistance of the white minority in Rhodesia.\n145.\tThe African problems I have invoked do not only affect the rights of peoples to a life of dignity and independence; they represent in themselves a constant threat to peace and security in the whole of the African continent. The General Assembly and the Security Council are already seized of cases of aggression by Portugal, South Africa and I Rhodesia against African independent States. The maintenance of a colonial presence or of a regime of racial discrimination in a part of Africa constitutes a permanent danger felt by all the African countries which compromises all possibilities of extending to the African continent the detente we wish to ensure in international relations.\n146.\tWe turn now to the Asian continent, and we must first of all express our satisfaction at the progress achieved in the relations between the countries of the Indian subcontinent, while expressing the hope that those countries, all of which have our sympathy and friendship, will complete the settlement of the problems born of their conflict. The wounds resulting from a fratricidal war are often deep and difficult to heal, but patience and community of feeling and destiny in the long run triumph over hostility and hatred, and it is by looking towards the future that the adversaries of yesterday will find the path to confidence and reconciliation.\n147.\tWe all hailed the Paris agreements which put an end to the long and deadly war in Viet-Nam. More than any other, the people of Viet-Nam deserves at long last to live in peace in order to rebuild its devastated country out of its ruins. But the violations of the Paris agreements by the Saigon regime and the countries that support it are likely to destroy this peace that was bought so dearly. The Heads of State of the non-aligned countries, which give their full support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, condemn those violations and undertake to encourage every effort for the realization of a peaceful, independent, neutral and democratic Viet-Nam that would lead to its peaceful reunification.\n148.\tStill in the Indo-Chinese peninsula, the struggle of the people of Cambodia has shown the world the illegitimacy of the Government of Phnom-Penh installed by the United States of America following its aggression in 1970. The progress achieved by the patriots of Cambodia enable the Government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to present itself as the only authentic representative of Cambodia incarnating the national will of that people. The sovereign rights of that Government must be restored to it in the United Nations, where its seat is unlawfully occupied by the representatives of a regime which owes its survival only to foreign intervention, which merely underlines its usurping character.\n149.\tThe problem of Korea this year will be the subject of a debate in the General Assembly [item 41]. We are gratified at this decision, deferred for so long as a result of manoeuvres that we have denounced regularly in the past. The will of the people of Korea to seek to unify their homeland is obvious, and it is quite clear that everything must be done to encourage and facilitate that reunification through peaceful means. True, the discussions that began between the North and the South tend to lead to this end, but they cannot succeed unless they are free of all foreign interference. It is for that reason that first a decision must be taken to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, to suppress the United Nations Command in Korea and to evacuate all foreign troops. We could not envisage the admission to the United Nations of two separate Koreas, which would establish forever a division that we are precisely trying to eliminate. The admission of Korea to our Organization can be more than the last stage in efforts to reunify that country, which was divided almost 30 years ago.\n150.\tAt the beginning of my statement I mentioned the new developments in the Middle East situation. The war that has broken out again was ignited by a fire which had not been properly put out, which has been consuming that region for almost a quarter of a century. We must go back to the period of Israel's creation and to the conditions surrounding it to discover the very sources of the constant tension which characterizes the Middle East. The elements of the conflict, its prolongation and implications will become more complex and grave, but under the mass of problems that it creates, the roots of the evil remain the same: the Middle East crisis resides, above all, in the tragedy of the Palestinian people constrained by force of arms to leave their homeland to make way for a foreign population which bases the legitimacy of its installation in Palestine on the mere fact of belonging to the Jewish religion. It is because the perpetration of that monstrosity was accepted and encouraged or because people resigned themselves to the belief that the international community could not find a satisfactory solution to a conflict that today seriously threatens world peace. It is because this situation has been allowed to go on that on three occasions we have seen war break out in the region and lead to the territorial expansion of Israel and the illegal occupation of territories belonging to independent States in the area, while the problem was acquiring ever more disquieting dimensions. It is because of the international community's inability to compel Israel to evacuate the territories conquered following its aggression .that conflict has broken out again, once more engulfing the whole region.\n151.\tAgain we see the Middle East bathed in blood, for the fourth time since 1947. Indeed, Israel has accustomed us to its incursions into the neighbouring countries, to its surprise attacks that take no account either of its international obligations or of the sovereignty of countries that have, in no way provoked such acts of piracy. We shall not dwell on the long series of crimes committed by Israel in disregard of international legality, sowing death and terror, because it was assured of immunity by virtue of the element of surprise and its superiority in armaments, not to mention the impunity fostered by the protection of its allies, particularly through the United States veto in the Security Council. Today the struggle is harder, and Israel must face the resolute determination of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Thus it resorts to ignoble attacks against defenceless populated centres, against civilian populations and targets, following the strict logic of its philosophy which subordinates the principles of morality to the desire for doubtful publicity. Perhaps this time world public opinion will be better informed of the nature of the Zionist regime, to which has imprudently remain complacent at times in the past.\n152.\tBecause sanctions against it were not adopted in time, Israeli aggression in the Middle East follows the same course as the imperialist war in Indo-China. By its refusal to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally from the territories it occupied following its aggression against Egypt, Syria and Jordan, and by it systematic practice of a policy of annexation, expansion, terror and constant violation of human rights, Israel has aggravated the threat that it has never ceased to hold over international peace and security.\n153.\tNor can one doubt that in this perspective the resistance of the Palestinian people acquires its full significance, since it falls within the context of the general struggle of peoples for the exercise of their right to freedom, dignity and national existence.\n154.\tBarely a few months ago the Security Council was seized of this problem by the Arab Republic of Egypt, that recourse having been based on a decision taken at a meeting of Heads of State and Government of O AU. That decision emphasized the need and extreme urgency of finding new prospects for a peaceful solution following Israel's rejection of all such past attempts. But that action was thwarted by the improper use of the right of veto.\n155.\tMore recently still, and in a wider framework, the non-aligned countries have tackled the question of the Middle East as one of the primary themes of their common concerns. The decisions adopted to that end by the Fourth Conference in Algiers were, by reason of the resumption of hostilities in the Middle East, communicated immediately to the permanent members of the Security Council by President Boumediene. In his message he stated, inter alia:\n\\\"The events which are at present taking place in the Middle East and which are the logical consequence of Israeli aggression lead me to emphasize the exceptional character of their gravity. In my capacity as President in Office of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries, I am in duty bound to draw your attention to the decisions taken by this Conference concerning the situation in the Middle East. Those decisions are based in particular on a recognition of the fact that Israel's persistence in its defiant attitude towards the international community and the United Nations will lead non-aligned countries between them and, within the framework of the United I Nations, in conjunction with the Member States of that Organization, to take individual and collective political and economic measures against Israel, in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\n\\\"Similarly, recalling the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the need to restore the national rights of the Palestinian people, 'the Conference [calls upon] all States, and in particular the United States of America, to abstain from providing Israel with ... any political, economic or financial support which may enable it to continue its aggressive and expansionist policy'. It calls for 'immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied territories, and pledges itself to assist Egypt, Syria and Jordan in liberating their occupied territories, by every means'.\\\"\n156.\tThat solemn appeal, launched in the name of an assembly that is so representative in terms of both the number and the quality of its participants, an appeal which in the present circumstances rings out so loudly, must be heeded; it must inspire our Organization to take concrete and urgent measures consonant with justice if it is truly to assume its full responsibility for the safeguarding of international peace and security.\n157.\tThe new Israeli aggression against Egypt and Syria, probably conceived to test the military potential and the resistance of those brother nations, and certainly to destroy them by. way of prevention, has failed lamentably. Everything, however, seems to indicate that it was very carefully prepared, militarily and politically. Now that the freedom fighters have begun to have their say, it is to be hoped that it will not be necessary to use other arguments, which the Middle East in particular and the Arab nation in general have in good measure.\n158.\tLike all free peoples, the peoples of Egypt and Syria are only opposing the aggressor; they are trying to push out the foreign occupier, defend the integrity of their national territory and recover their inalienable rights. In so doing, they incarnate today the meaning of dignity and honour. Their trials are our trials; their suffering, our suffering. And since we share with them a common destiny, we shall, side by side with them, assume our responsibilities to the end.\n159.\tThey do not stand alone: the non-aligned countries, the socialist States and other healthy forces in the world will give them constant support and unfailing solidarity.\n160.\tBut perhaps there is little use in emphasizing the responsibility of Israel, which, because of its Zionist and expansionist character, cannot become a part of the Middle East. We must have the courage and clear-mindedness to assess the responsibility of the United Nations and that of certain great Powers, particularly the United States of America, which have always given their support to Israel, providing it with the means for carrying on its aggressive and imperialist policy and assuring it of protection even against the rules of international law. That responsibility was engaged from the very day Israel was created, and it must be invoked when dealing with the present situation of the Palestinian people or with the occupation by Israel of Arab territories. It is therefore incumbent on the United Nations to resolve a problem which the United Nations itself helped to create.\n161.\tThe solution to be found must, of course, entail the complete recovery by the Arab countries in that region of the territories occupied by Israel, and the arrangements necessary for their security against the expansionism and aggressiveness of the Zionist regime. But to establish a lasting peace in that sensitive region, any solution must go to the very root of the problem; it must restore the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine and assure them of the means for freeing themselves from the injustice that has afflicted them for so many years, an injustice the lasting scars of which will be borne not only by the present generation but also by generations to come.\n162.\tMr. President, in applauding your accession to the presidency of our Assembly, I underlined the outstanding part played by Latin America in the joint struggle of the third world. The ever greater participation of the countries of your continent in the non-aligned movement is the most striking and reassuring testimony to this fact.\n163.\tThe Conference of our Heads of State in Algiers assigned especial importance to your problems. In the final Declaration of our Conference appears the following:\n\\\"The Conference considers that the struggle for the liberation of Latin America is an important factor in the struggle of peoples against colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism and is a contribution towards achieving and strengthening peace and international security.\\\" [A/9330 and Corr.l, para. 55.]\nMoreover:\n\\\"It supports the struggle of the peoples of Latin America for the affirmation of their sovereignty, the restoration of their natural resources and implementation of the structural changes essential for their development, and condemns the imperialistic aggressions and pressures to which these countries are subjected.\\\" [Ibid., para. 54.]\n164.\tThe tragic events in Chile have come all too soon, unfortunately, to confirm the fears expressed in that declaration, and to prove to what degree, in Latin America and everywhere else in the third world, our peoples must remain vigilant and rely on their active solidarity to face the dangers threatening them.\n165.\tThe movement that is developing on the Latin American continent for the consolidation of independence and the recovery of national resources must necessarily confront the forces of imperialism, the operations of which are evident in military interventions and the activities of multinational companies. We give our total support to the peoples of Latin America in the courageous struggle they are waging, and particularly to the people of Peru, which has embarked upon an undertaking to reconquer its wealth and transform its economic and social structures; also to the people of Panama, which seeks legitimately to restore its sovereignty over the Canal Zone. The people of Cuba, for its part, knows how great is the sympathy and solidarity with which we have always followed and admired the revolutionary task it has accomplished. And once again we wish to denounce the unjust and unjustified blockade imposed upon Cuba by the United States of America, and the hostile measures directed against it by the new military authorities in Chile.\n166.\tSince I wish to lay before you here the concerns expressed by the non-aligned countries at the Algiers Conference, I must inform you of the profound disquiet aroused by the evolution of the economic and social situation in the developing countries. That evolution is characterized by an aggravation of the inequality already existing in the rate of economic growth as between the developed and the underdeveloped countries. The international economic order continues to function to the detriment of the poorer countries, and all attempts to reverse that disastrous trend have produced no satisfactory results. The principal difficulty resides in the selfishness of the most developed countries, which do not wish to give up their privileges and refuse to change a\n18\nsystem that promotes their prosperity to the disadvantage of the countries that provide their raw materials.\n167.\tWe all know how disappointing were the results of the First United Nations Development Decade. The Second Development Decade is already well under way and appears to be no more promising than the first. The imbalances that result from this disparity in the distribution of wealth may have the most tragic effects on the international balance as a whole, and the crises that have already occurred in the field of energy show the depth of the ills that characterize the present world economic situation.\n168.\tThe monetary crisis through which we are living strikes a hard blow at the developing countries, while at the same time the responsibility therefore rests exclusively on the industrialized countries, which should be the only ones to bear the consequences.\n169.\tProblems of food and the environment, together with those relating to the organization of world trade, muse occupy the attention of all and can be solved only within the framework of broader international co-operation. It was for this reason that the Algiers Conference suggested the urgent convening of a joint conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and UNCTAD,- at the ministerial level, and the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted exclusively to problems of development.\n170.\tIt is not necessary to point out that development problems can easily be tied in with the problem of disarmament, in so far as the resources released through disarmament could find no better use than to be placed at the service of development. We therefore welcome any suggestion along these lines stemming from a sincere effort to promote real, general and complete disarmament, and from a genuine will to reform the whole international economic system with a view to a more equitable distribution of wealth and income.\n171.\tThe non-aligned countries have always given proof of their profound attachment to the United Nations and the principles of the Charter. They remain convinced that the Organization can be an effective instrument for promoting international peace and security, for developing co-operation and for safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms. Its call to universality is further strengthened this year by the simultaneous admission of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany ' and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We are indeed happy to welcome these three new Members which will, without doubt, help to strengthen our Organization and guarantee for it an ever greater sphere of action.\n172.\tHowever, we take note of the pertinent observation of the Secretary-General when, in the introduction to his report, he stressed that\n\\\"The United Nations and its family of organizations were set up to deal with the problems of a world very different from the one we live in today.\\\" [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 1.]\nThe changes that have marked the life of mankind, together with those that have changed the political, military, economic and social conditions of the world, have upset the order of priority of our concerns and introduced a new balance into the international situation. The Organization cannot play its part and fulfil its mission unless it reflects a faithful image of international society. The most important change stems from the emergence of a large number of countries into international life. The Organization can no longer be moved merely by the impulses given by the great Powers alone, whether conflicting or combined. The voice of the small and medium-sized countries must also be one of the components of that system of forces.\n173.\tAll of us have adhered to the Charter, and that was the primary condition for our admission to the United Nations. But we must also say that we then had no choice but to accept the terms of a treaty prepared without our participation and on the basis of considerations that did not necessarily take our preoccupations into account. It will be understood that we find it natural that certain provisions of the Charter which no doubt were justified when it was drawn up no longer appear to suit the present international situation and should be reconsidered in the light of the transformations to which we have referred.\n174.\tThat is true in particular of the right of veto enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council. We can accept the idea that that privilege is in keeping with the particular responsibility exercised by the great Powers in international affairs, but when that privilege is used so that a great Power may evade the obligations imposed on it by international law, when it serves to divert international law from its true objectives, when it seeks to oppose the opinion of the remainder of the community, we believe it introduces an imbalance dangerous to international harmony. If its immediate abolition does not appear possible, we must at least spell out its usage by giving a restrictive definition of the cases in which it can be used.\n175.\tIt is paradoxical to note that the world appears to be further removed from unity now that the cold-war period has ended and there are appearing on the horizon serious indications of a detente in international relations. No doubt that is because the threat of a general war united all peoples in the same fear of annihilation and in efforts to prevent that catastrophe. As that threat disappears, the concerns of our peoples change and we see a new cleavage in international society.\n176.\tWe belong to the world that does not yet enjoy the benefits of that detente, the world whose security is precarious. the world still confronted by the difficult problems of under-development. Most of the countries that find themselves in that situation now belong to the movement of the non-aligned, which was born of the identity of their concerns and the community of their hopes. The solidarity that unites them does not seek to make of them a new bloc which would appear on the horizon when existing blocs are relaxing their unity and dissolving in ever wider cooperation.\n177.\tNon-alignment was born precisely at a time when those blocs confronted each other, and its purpose was to preserve the independence of the small countries while working to establish peaceful coexistence between different social and political systems. The progress achieved along that road is perhaps to some extent due to the unremitting action of the non-aligned countries in favour of peace and international understanding.\n178.\tThe transformation of the international order undoubtedly modifies the content of the notion of non- alignment, which, while being attached to the idea of the defence of national independence, now has as its objective the promotion of peaceful coexistence between the great and small Powers. That coexistence, founded on respect and on the equality of rights of States, is based first of all on the concept of non-interference in the affairs of other States and renunciation of external pressure. It must lead to the building of a more equitable world where force will not replace law, which will give all peoples equal access to the benefits of civilization.\n179.\tThat is what more than 80 non-aligned countries meeting in Algiers have solemnly sought to reaffirm. The principles on which they have founded their action and their international behaviour are above all an act of faith in the future of mankind which reflects the great hopes of all our peoples. The participation in that conference of more than 60 Heads of State and Government confers on its declarations outstanding authenticity which the international community cannot disregard. The construction of the world of today and determination of the world of tomorrow is of concern to us all, and nothing would be more dangerous than to refuse to pay attention to the appeal of the representatives of two thirds of mankind. It is an appeal for justice for all peoples, an appeal for fraternity among all men. Why should it not be heeded?\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff133.\tI am happy, Mr. President, to greet you cordially on behalf of my Government and to congratulate you on your election to preside over this new session of the General Assembly. For the people of Ecuador it is a matter of rejoicing and pride that a most worthy compatriot such as yourself has been raised to that high post in recognition of outstanding ability and qualifications and experience in the\nUnited Nations. All of that is a guarantee of the effectiveness with which the General Assembly will be directed.\n134.\tI wish also to greet and pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, the distinguished Polish diplomat, who with wisdom and skill fulfilled his noble duties,\n135.\tHaving read the news in the paper this morning, I wish to pay a posthumous tribute to a great man of this hemisphere and a great poet of the world, Pablo Neruda.\n136.\tMy first words are also words of welcome to the Organization to the three new States which have become Members this year \u2014 the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Bahamas. The admission of those peoples to the United Nations will strengthen its bodies and constitute a ratification of the principle of universality foreseen in the Charter, a principle that my country fully supports. The admission of the two German States will also be a great contribution to relieving tension in Europe, with salutary reactions in the entire world, and certainly there will be repercussions entirely favourable to the work being done by the United Nations to fulfil its purposes and principles.\n137.\tI have just spoken of strengthening the United Nations, and on behalf of my Government I must stress that although during the passage of the long years since its foundation the Organization has made undeniable contributions to the cause of peace, its role still is not everything that the peoples expect or hope. We are watching the opening up of a dark, upset and troubled world, where contradictory forces struggle to deprive men and communities of possibilities of progress and social justice which they quite justifiably seek and require.\n138.\tCan we deny that at present there are upheavals and tensions? The complexity of a world becoming more technical although less human, the damage to basic values of the human spirit in all spheres, the irrepressible clamour of the less favoured classes prove to us clearly that the United Nations must give greater pragmatic and concrete assistance in the solution of international problems, for the sake of peoples and of security in general. States must fully comply with the obligations imposed upon them as Members of the United Nations. One of the unchallengeable premises for strengthening peace is the observation of the Charter of the United Nations. But if certain resolutions are not complied with, if they are casuistically or subtly evaded, if they are ignored, then the moral weight of the United Nations is also but meagre and the statements we make here on behalf of our States are of no value.\n139.\tThe world Organization is duty bound to ensure that the resolutions and recommendations adopted by common agreement are implemented. My country is fully convinced that the efficacy of the United Nations must hinge upon the political will of its Members to carry out in good faith the fundamental obligations incumbent upon them in accordance with the Charter and their desire to co-operate in the solution of problems of general interest. If we wish to strengthen the Organization and avoid its prestige and authority being sapped, it is imperative that words be accompanied by deeds, so that resolutions will not -be reduced to mere declarations of principles, without concrete results.\n140.\tThere can be no doubt that on certain levels positive changes in international life have been achieved. These are intended to improve the political climate, and this has led to the creation of new and excellent possibilities for lessening international tensions. Now it is necessary that dialogue between the parties to a conflict should continue. The end of the war in Viet Nam, while it must please all of us, must serve as a lesson, one that will warn all of us of the dangers, the atrocious calamities that follow upon a state of violence and undeclared war, or what happens when in one way or another peoples are denied the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.\n141.\tSatisfieC as we are at the end of the conflict ir. Viet Nam, so, too, my Government and delegation are gratified at the way in which the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have carried out their dialogue and laid the groundwork for a worthy contribution to detente and European security, which must obviously have repercussions on the security cf the entire world.\n142.\tThe admission of the two Germanys to the world Organization, a fruit of that dialogue, is a clear example of the beneficial results to world peace generated by good will and the desire for justice and equity when applied by parties in the solution of their disputes. The results of the multilateral consultations to prepare the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which have also confirmed the relaxation of tension and confrontation in Europe, point now to practical collaboration and prove that when a matter is tackled with a desire for a solution, that has a favourable effect on all other matters which may be the seed of future difficulties and problems in world order and which can also catch the same spirit of understanding and the same desire for solution.\n143.\tWe would hope that all these events would serve as an example so that other problems besetting the world will also be successfully solved through negotiation within the framework of the spirit of good will and understanding, for the benefit of all peoples of the world, of peace and of international co-operation.\n144.\tAnd yet there are still conflicts in the world. The situation in Indochina, particularly in Cambodia, is continuing obscure and tumultuous and is reaching the levels of unbearable anguish and horror experienced in Viet Nam.\n145.\tThe situation in the Middle East, too, remains disturbed. My country, peace-loving by conviction and tradition, wants with all the force of its confidence in law to make a warm and urgent appeal to the parties in conflict. My Government feels that a sincere effort on the part of the governments concerned to carry out a dialogue without prior conditions, without prejudice and without imposition could do much for a final and just solution. Thus my delegation considers it equally necessary for all efforts to be made to find a solution to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. That resolution contains the basic tenets of international law as set forth in the Charter. A possible solution must in any case take into account all aspects of the problem of the Middle East and be based indisputably on the principles of equity and justice, without taking'into account hatred or prejudice of any sort. We believe that in any case the solution must be sought within the framework of the United Nations, and I must say it is equally necessary that the activities of the great Powers, that in one way or another support the different parties to the conflict in the Middle East, must be directed to finding solutions for the establishment of constructive peace and not stand in the way of possible formulas of agreement and understanding. The conflict in the Middle East, because of its explosive nature, obliges the United Nations to try unflaggingly to end it.\n146.\tIn the light of so important a problem as that of Korea, my delegation considers that the world Organization should enc urage any free pronouncement by the entire Korean people and allow the two Koreas to continue their contacts to find the most just and appropriate road to a solution to the problem.\n147.\tMy delegation draws attention to the tact that, despite the many resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council regarding racial or religious discrimination and colonialism, millions of human beings are still suffering the consequences of these illegal and inhuman systems.\n148.\tThese resolutions of the world Organization seem to be challenged almost openly by the countries that practice these forms that are so contrary to the purooses and principles of the United Nations. The practice of racial and religious discrimination is retrograde and turns back centuries of civilization and progress. As far as colonialism is concerned, it is the very denial of freedom itself and of the right of peoples to self-determination. It coerces them with political occupation, economic pressures or inadmissible armed threats.\n149.\tParadoxically enough, while man has shaken off the forces that tied him to earth and has launched himself into the conquest of the stars, there are still subjet peoples whose fate is in foreign hands which resort to violent coercion, and drown in blood their desire for just rebellion, the hunger for freedom that has written the most heroic pages of history.\n150.\tEcuador can do no less than urge that the agreements arrived at in the General Assembly and the Security Council be implemented. With regard to the legal situation of the territories under Portuguese administration, we continue to argue that this situation is covered by Article 73 of the Chapter of the United Nations.\n151.\tSince international economic co-operation is an obligation instituted in the Charter, we must with determination encourage any steps that will tend to create favourable machinery and conditions so that the industrially advanced countries will supply the developing nations with the necessary effective assistance so that the process of economic and social transformation will become reality. The resolutions r./ust be implemented for that progress to be achieved and for the dangerous gap that divides some counts s from others to be bridged. This calls for an intensifying of economic, technical, scientific and cultural co-operation and also requires that the programmes of financing be fed with 1 per cent of the gross national product. There must also be a liberalization of trade and the removal of all obstacles that have so far stood in the way of the rational opening up of international markets to raw materials, the main source of income for countries of the third world.\n152.\tThe Second United Nations Development Decade, for all these reasons, should be supported fully and given all the necessary assistance. Furthermore, it should be strengthened, as the needs have grown in so many poverty- stricken regions of the world. At this time ! should like to stress the fact that the Latin American countries, upon studying, at the fifteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America, the results of the first two years of this Decade, adopted the so-called Quito Assessment. The observations in that document are positive and realistic and in keeping with the needs of the region and thus were endorsed by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1817 (LV). Let us now avoid any weak or ambiguous measures. The present moments are difficult enough: there is still lack of food; there is still disease and poverty; the international monetary crisis still produces negative results, particularly in the developing nations; and all this on the very eve of the multilateral trade negotiations to be held within the framework of GATT and whose bases and conditions are not precisely those that are most in keeping with the desires of a great majority of the countries that are facing difficulties in their trade development and therefore have serious problems with their balance of payments \u2014 countries that, despite all their efforts, cannot implement their domestic development programmes.\n153.\tIn the light of these sombre prospects for the developing nations, we shall continue to press for a new study and analysis of the measures to solve the grave problem of maritime transport. Therefore we wholeheartedly support the spirit of the developing countries when proposing a code of conduct for maritime conferences in order to standardize freights and guarantee a just increase in the national merchant marines. We hope that the plenipotentiary conference\\\" that is to study that draft in November at Geneva will be as successful as the countries that have been working to this end desire.\n154.\tWe hope to achieve the development and welfare of our people, using the wealth of our national resources, whose exploitation must have, in the international field, sufficient guarantees and safeguards. Therefore we consider as a threat to the full exercise of the sovereignty of peoples any measure or action by any other State or transnational corporation that limits or hinders the free exercise of that basic right.\n155.\tIn the field of economic security, the action of the United Nations is \u2014 and should be \u2014 preponderant. The gap between the wealthy and the poor countries is widening instead of narrowing. Can we, then, speak of a future of peace in these circumstances for the peoples of the world? To consider it so would be Utopian and would be almost tragic naivete. There can be no doubt that this state of affairs is a reflection of injustices committed by the wealthy countries in their international trade policies. And voices have been raised in one of the organs of the United Nations to the effect that the concepts of political anc economic security ar: parallel and complement one another. My delegation believes that in the field to which I am referring the action of the United Nations has thus far not been very productive. This being the case, the possibility of the third world's emerging from underdevelopment is bleak indeed.\n156.\tThe world is confronting a profound technical and scientific revolution. Man's penetration of outer space and the depths of the ocean, the impressive progress of human knowledge and the rapid evolution of productive forces have wide repercussions on all spheres of the spiritual and material existence of man. All this offers countries fantastic ways of increasing their national wealth, of utilizing the natural resources they possess in order to support their economic and social progress and achieve development. But at fhe same time, this same revolution creates new and\ntremely complex problems having a bearing on the future of mankind. This creates new fields of co-operation, but at the same time it stresses the need to tackle the problems in ways and fashions that will be in keeping with the new needs of the modern world.\n157.\tTo achieve these goals, technology must be placed at the service of mankind; and for this it is imperative that appropriate machinery be set up to allow the developing\n\ncountries to enjoy full access to, and benefit from, technology and research. The developed countries with a high degree of technological know-how, with the experience and information they possess concerning outer space, ought to share those benefits with all developing nations, giving them access to such knowledge and know-how. But the technological capacity that allows them to increase their economic development must not be used, like other resources, to consolidate and increase their domination over other nations.\n158.\tIn resolution 2934 A and B (XXVII), the General Assembly appealed to the Powers that possess nuclear weapons to suspend all types of atomic tests, including underground tests, and to adhere without delay to the treaty prohibiting such weapons. But some States have not obeyed this resolution. The appeals of the world Organization have been spurned, and with surprise and sorrow we have seen that nuclear tests have continued, to the detriment of the authority of the United Nations and of efforts to strengthen peace. My delegation must state here that the latest nuclear tests carried out by France certainly have indicated a deterioration in the efforts that the Organization and all peoples have been making to prohibit nuclear weapons and the explosion of such bombs. We must lament the fact that it is France that has done this, but with the sincere and unfettered friendship that my country has always felt for the great French people, we cannot but be surprised at and condemn its contempt for world public opinion and its persistence in carrying out those tests, which further weaken the already fragile basis of security. My delegation will therefore continue to give its full support to the effort to achieve a complete prohibition of all nuclear weapons tests, chemical weapons, and all weapons of any kind that would constitute a cruel means of making war, which is repugnant to the conscience of all peoples.\n159.\tIn the field of disarmament an indispensable premise is confidence among States. It alone can create a climate conducive to the solution of a problem that is in itself complex, difficult and full of unknown quantities.\n160.\tTo resort to the use of force is to deny the power of reason. To channel nuclear, biological or chemical natural forces to the destruction of men is to allow the dominion of irrational energy over man.\n161.\tOn the international level in general, and specifically in the United Nations, there has been a proliferation of agreement! and recommendations to do away with the arms race. Yet mankind is still hoping for this, while still seeing the bombs and the cannons lowering over it. True disarmament cannot emerge merely from the co-ordination of wills on a piece of paper but must be the legal expression of genuine disarmament, which can only be found in the very soul of the peoples. True disarmament means to do away with the spirit of agression, to adopt a desire for peace and understanding and respect for the self-determination of peoples and for the unchallengeable dominion of law and justice.\n162.\tOn behalf of the Government and people of Ecuador, my delegation will continue to support fully all efforts tending towards general and complete disarmament under effective and secure international Control. In its resolution 2993 (XXVII) the General Assembly of the United Nations reaffirmed that:\n\\\"... any measure or pressure directed against any State while exercising its sovereign right freely to dispose of its natural resources constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination of peoples and nonintervention, as set forth in the Charter, which, if pursued, could constitute a threat to international peace and security\\\".\n163.\tTogether with other countries of Latin America, my country has been the victim of retaliatory measures because we defended this inherent right of peoples for our own development.\n164.\tIt is high time that we attached to international co-operation its real definition and scope. It cannot, as in the past, be placed at the service of unilateral interests and positions which vitiate the goals.\n165.\tEcuador must denounce to the General Assembly the persistence of the United States of America in turning international economic co-operation into a punitive element and a means of coercion against countries that, in the exercise of their legitimate rights, have captured and, in accordance with law, punished fishing fleets carrying out illicit activities in their jurisdictional waters. Not only does Ecuador reject the so-called application of sanctions, but at the same time we wish to stress that such conduct is unseemly and in no way helps to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations and friendly understandings. It also ignores the terms of article 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States, as well as Security Council resolution 330 (1973) of 21 March in which the Council, when reaffirming the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly, particularly resolution 2625 (XXV), proclaims that:\n\\\"... no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind,\\\"\nand requests States furthermore:\n\\\"... with a view to maintaining and strengthening peace and security in Latin America, to refrain from using or encouraging the use of any type of coercive measures against States of the region\\\".\n166.\tAt the present session the General Assembly will have to pronounce itself on matters of outstanding importance to the development of the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose decisions will determine the possibility of wide co-operation in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, if justice reigns and if. the sovereign equality of States is respected. But if, tragically, the sea remains as in the past a shameful means of political and economic domination, and if the exercise of force over reason and law succeeds, then the world will be confronted with a new period of disquiet and conflict incompatible with mutual obligations of creative interdependence and association under the San Francisco Charter.\n167.\tWe cannot forget the worthless results of previous conferences which tried to solve the great problems of the sea by ignoring the constitutional elements of balance between what the sovereign State requires in defence of its legitimate inalienable rights and what is required of it as an active and passive subject in a natural regime of interdependence. No decision that affects the fundamental interests of the developing countries or leads to the adoption of formulas of disguised colonialism or tutelage can be accepted by peoples who insist on respect for their freedom and their right to utilize all their natural resources. Among these resources of importance to the feeding and development of the coastal States are those that are in adjacent seas within reasonable limits dictated by geographic, geological, ecological, economic and social factors.\n168.\tParticularly important at present is that the formulas covering the use of the seas as well as the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the jurisdictional limit must be based on the principle that the regions reserved to the coastal State and coming under its exclusive sovereignty cannot be invaded.\n169.\tBut among the new conceptions of international law, some of which must necessarily be included in the reformulation of the law of the sea, sovereignty must be understood also as a factor for positive action in the policies of solidarity that, by bringing nations together in peace and justice, will make their exercise of sovereign rights the most effective means of mutual understanding and co-operation.\n170.\tIn keeping with those definitions, Ecuador has contended and continues to contend that it is for the coastal State itself to decide on the width of the sea over which it exercises sovereignty and the resources of which are therefore exclusively within its purview.\n171.\tTogether with other countries of our continent, Ecuador has set as the limit of its territorial seas 200 miles, measured from the corresponding base lines, the area over which we exercise sovereignty and, therefore, jurisdiction. We require that our laws be respected, even if that calls for police action when fishing vessels try to ignore the existence of a national law over that area.\n172.\tWith the same determination with which we uphold that proclamation, we state our unshakable resolution to participate positively in the development of a wide policy of co-operation by sovereign acts which will daily ensure that the seas are ties of unity and friendship among all peoples and will allow effective achievement of the efforts for conservation and reasonable exploitation of the ichthyolog- ical wealth of the seas, preservation of the marine environment and accelerated progress in scientific research, activities which Ecuador considers to be unavoidable duties of the coastal State.\n173.\tInternational co-operation in such important fields must be considered as an honest way of acting which satisfies the demands of particular interest to the coastal\nState and the community, and never as an instrument in the hands of the great fishing Powers for the undue exploitation of the ichthyological wealth to which they have no right. To contend that fishing should be divided up by species according to an apparently scientific criterion, in order to penetrate zones of foreign jurisdiction and take advantage of wealth that certainly is neither res nullius nor to be confused with the common heritage of mankind, bespeaks violation of the rights of States and is a shameful manifestation of the fact that there is still a tendency to ignore the legal equality of States and the identical value of the rights of the great and the small, the economically wealthy and the economically weak. The living resources of the coastal sea, whether it is termed territorial or patrimonial sea or economic zone, whether those resources belong to the coastal State because it exercises sovereignty over the marine area or because sovereign rights over such resources have been recognized, are subject to the legal provisions governing administration and exploitation, and therefore are under the control necessary to ensure their adequate utilization and conservation by the coastal State. It is the coastal State that can reserve unto itself or its nationals the full exploitation of all the resources of the marine zone over which it possesses sovereignty and exercises jurisdiction or can allow nationals of other States to comply with regulations and provisions arising from the sovereignty of the coastal State to carry out the exploitation.\n174.\tMy delegation, while frankly and energetically rejecting any type of coercion designed to affect in any way the sovereign will of a State, believes that international co-operation will find its true channel and will fulfil its duty by granting to the least economically and technically developed countries sufficient means to achieve full welfare for their peoples.\n175.\tMy country trusts the noble mission of the United Nations. We believe this mission can be accomplished only if all States, all peoples, meet their obligations and each, to the extent of its possibilities, sincerely and without ulterior motives contributes to the solution of the problems afflicting mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff124.\t I should like to direct my first words to you, Mr. President, in order to express the most sincere congratulations of the Portuguese delegation on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly. Your reputation as a distinguished jurist and a respected figure in Iberian-American culture, which we fraternally salute, make us certain that you will preside over this Assembly with impartiality and respect for the rules of law.\n125.\tTwenty-eight years ago, the San Francisco Charter was signed, dedicating the United Nations to its main task \u2014 the maintenance of peace and international security. This is understandable because peace and security constitute the prerequisites necessary for the attainment of the Organization's further objectives. In a world which had just seen the end of a long and cruel war, it was only normal that the desire for peace should assume a special significance and intensity.\n126.\tTo a certain extent we can see that this original aim of the Organization has been attained. Effectively speaking, in 28 years \u2014 seven more than those which separate the two great wars of this century \u2014 there has been no major global conflagration.\n127.\tNevertheless, it is necessary to recognize that conflicts have arisen regardless of the United Nations and that the mechanisms provided by the Charter for the maintenance of peace have either not been allowed to function or have not performed effectively.\n128.\tThe last few years have witnessed the appearance and development of a new element of major importance in the maintenance of peace. I refer to the call for a policy of detente, the positive results of which cannot be contested any more. This policy not only has the merit of reducing the danger of war, but also has permitted the establishment of certain forms of international co-operation, benefiting all, which would never have taken place in a climate of the cold war.\n129.\tWe have a notable example of this new attitude in the policy followed during recent years by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. The admission of the two German States to this Organization constitutes a stage, to a certain extent symbolic, of this new political climate. Thus, it is with satisfaction on our part that we view the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations Organization. We also commend the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n130.\tIf is also appropriate to make a special reference to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which we hope will result in the growth of a new climate of relations among the countries of Europe, and to which the Portuguese Government has given, and will continue to give, full co-operation.\n131.\tIn contrast to the climate of detente which characterizes some aspects of international relations, we witness with increasing frequency daily examples of the use of force for the resolution of conflicts or disputes. And, what is more striking, we see that some of those who proclaim the virtues of the policy of detente loudly and eloquently, attempt at the same time to find reasons and arguments which would justify the use of force whenever such a step would serve their own interests.\n132.\tHow can we claim that certain general principles which are declared to be fundamental in some areas are not valid for the entire world? How can we explain that the interpretation of these principles varies according to the latitude, the continent or the level of economic development of the areas in question?\n133.\tCertain Governments that, on the one hand, defend the inviolability of European borders, that claim the right to crush any form of subversion within their countries, and that condemn the terrorism which victimizes their citizens, on the other hand support subversive movements in Africa, finance terrorism and assert the right to violate the boundaries of southern Africa. Such an orientation leads to the conception of a world divided into two zones, subject to principles not only different from each other, but even antagonistic. In one zone \u2014 the economically developed area \u2014 the principles of non-intervention, respect for national sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence would be held valid.\n\n134.\tIn the other zone, that of the less-developed and poor nations, intervention in the internal affairs of other States would be allowed, subversion and terrorism legalized, and violence held not only justifiable, but worthy of praise and of outside support. That is to say, we would arrive at an international law of the rich and an international law of the poor, which, undoubtedly, is an extreme form of neocolonialism.\n135.\tApproximately a year ago, the United Nations established a committee to study methods of combating terrorism.  But certain parties promptly sought to use this opportunity in a political manner, m order to enable them to combat more effectively acts of subversion directed against themselves, while, at the same time, continuing to foster terrorism whenever advantage could be gained from it. Under these circumstances, the possibility of attaining the objectives initially proposed by the Committee was doomed from the outset. In fact the Committee was unable to achieve any progress at all.\n136.\tOne of the major exceptions which certain parties insist on attaching to the principle of the non-application of armed force concerns the so-called \\\"liberation movements\\\". Since these groups are formed through the process of self- selection, it becomes fairly easy for them to establish themselves as \\\"liberation movements\\\" once they are able to command the sympathy of the majorities that dominate international organizations. But apart from being easily achieved, their establishment is profitable also, a fact which helps to explain the rapid appearance of some of these movements. It may seem strange that a group presenting itself under a self-chosen label and counting on the support of certain sectors only can obtain privileges and advantages. But this is the truth.\n137.\tAn examination of certain conditions in the recent past can help us to understand how such a situation has arisen. The principle of self-determination came to acquire a very special meaning in the post-war period, a meaning that is reflected in the United Nations Charter itself. It became advantageous for one party in a conflict to be able to identify its cause with the defence of this principle. In the international community such a party would then be regarded as on the side of reason and justice. However, since we are dealing with a principle whose practical application is of great complexity, it is clear that such a principle could be used according to the will of the majorities, which would grant, or refuse, the status of \\\"liberation movements\\\" to dissident or subversive groups on the basis of their own self-interest.\n138.\tSimilarly, the nations which in number dominate the international assemblies use these groups in order to serve their own interests, and to try to secure for the liberation movements an extraordinary right to use force, including the practice of acts of terrorism and the receipt of external assistance.\n139.\tIn an international society of States \u2014 a reality on which the Charter of the United Nations is based \u2014 there is no possible justification for the bestowal on groups lacking an international juridical identity, of rights more ample than those granted to States.\n140.\tThe situation has become so absurd that the exceptions which some tried to introduce in this area, and which are supposedly justified by the principle of self-determination, do not even provide any guarantees for the defence of this principle. In fact the truth is just the opposite.\n141.\tLet us consider m example. A group of citizens of a given nation enters into conflict with the authorities and attempts to secure for itself the rule over all or part of the territory. It is obvious that without external interference, the degree of success of any such group of individuals would depend on the amount of support received from within the country. However, if the same group receives assistance from the outside, its degree of success will depend on the amount of assistance thus provided. And, if such support from outside is great enough, the domestic support may even become irrelevant; we would then have an operation entirely sustained and directed from abroad \u2014 obviously benefiting interests alien to those of the indigenous population \u2014 which would necessitate the collaboration of only a minimal part of the population to justify foreign interference.\n142.\tIn other words, to allow grants of external assistance to the liberation movements would be to pervert entirely the reasons given to justify the actions of such movements. While the principle involved may be that of self-determination, the truth is that what we are confronting is the pursuit of objectives and interests privy to certain Powers or group of Powers. Unfortunately, the example given is not merely theoretical. And many movements that emerge within the international community as paladins of the right to self- determination do not command any significant popular support. Their actions, either military, terrorist or pseudo- diplomatic, within or outside national borders, are the result of support received from abroad.\n143.\tIt is contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter to accept a norm whereby States can grant assistance to groups without international juridical identity, operating within other nations and resorting to violence to attain their objectives. It is even more abhorrent to attempt to justify such actions by involving the principle of self- determination. Actually, we are faced with a mere expedient by which certain Powers attempt to achieve their policies or to ensure their hegemony in areas where no other pretext can explain their presence.\n144.\tThe Portuguese Government accepts, and reaffirms emphatically, its support of the principle of self-determination. But it cannot allow this principle to be used as a means to legalize violations of such basic principles of international law as the non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.\n145.\tThe influence of the African States in the debates and resolutions of the General Assembly is held to be dominant. And in fact, it is. Their votes are decisive in the resolutions that are approved, not merely because of their numbers, but also because of the influence they have upon other countries, which keep them company in an alignment, whose roots, however, are unfortunately not to be found in a conviction of the justice of the causes defended, or in the merit or efficacy of the resolutions approved, but in barefaced opportunism and convenience. Votes which are cast with Africa, in order to please Africa, are votes against the real interests of Africa. It has been said here, with some truth, that, should this tendency continue, the United Nations would soon turn into a mere branch of the OAU. Such a situation would certainly be very degrading to the United Nations, which would thus find itself reduced merely to repeating and to echoing timidly resolutions and decisions adopted in other forums. But such a situation would, at least, be a boost to the prestige of the OAU. It would be a success and a triumph for Africa. The influence of the African States in the resolutions of this Organization would not have, in itself, anything that is pernicious or deserving of criticism. But does the voice of its representatives really express the true aspirations of Africa? Does their influence coincide with true African interests? That may be the case in some matters but it is certainly not true when one considers the campaign and the attacks against Portugal. The concentrated attacks against Portugal both in this Organisation and outside it are a pretext, a smoke-screen and an excuse: a good pretext for displaying a fictitious solidarity among Africans and towards Africans; a smokescreen for concealing from the eyes of the world the true problems and the real drama of Africa; and a convenient excuse for justifying omissions towards Africa and towards Africans.\n146.\tThe OAU, in a racist orientation that has no justification and with an utter lack of knowledge of our realities, today contests the legitimacy of Portugal as an African nation. The OAU considers Portugal an enemy of Africa, a threat to the security, independence and territorial integrity of African States, a challenge to the unity of the continent and an insult to the African man. We have followed with surprise, and even with indignation, this false and artificial campaign, so contrary to the real truth of the matter. The anti-Portuguese doctrines of the OAU deserve deeper reflection and an analysis of their fundamentals and significance. There is no real basis and no real motive for a conflict between Portugal and any other African State. .There is no clash of interests, no divergence of destinies that separates us from the rest of Africa. Why should we be the adversaries of any African country or of the entire continent?\n147.\tThe gravest accusation levelled against us, and one which is linked in a special way to the competence of this Organization, is that we constitute a threat to the independence and to the integrity of the African countries. It is even asserted that we are a threat to international peace and security. That is a strange, not to say an astounding, accusation, which time alone ought to have rendered baseless by now. For over 12 years that same accusation has repeatedly been made against us. But I ask you, Where are the African countries that have been invaded and conquered by Portugal? Where are the territories of African States annexed by Portugal? Which part of any African country has at any time been claimed by Portugal? Which frontiers in Africa do we seek to alter in our favour?\n148.\tWe may be repeating statements already made, but perhaps it would be pertinent at this time to affirm here again, and solemnly, that we have always been, and still are, prepared to give all the necessary juridical and political guarantees on this matter which are in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Are there African States which consider their security threatened by Portugal? Why do they not sign non-aggression pacts with us, or take part in bilateral or collective declarations renouncing the use of, or the threat to use, force, just as the European States are doing among themselves, amid the applause of the entire world? We too are prepared to take initiatives or to respond favourably to initiatives with regard to renouncing offensive and aggressive armaments in Africa. Africa does not have a more sincere, a more convinced, a more unwavering defender of the principles of paragraph 1 of Article 1 and paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter  \u2014  upon the principles of which rests the entire edifice of international peace and security \u2014 than Portugal. We are attacked from States bordering upon our territories. Those attacks are considered legitimate and Just. On the other hand, our defence is considered illegitimate and threatening. And yet such defensive action on our part is strictly contained within the frontiers of our territory and marked by a spirit of moderation and conciliation of which perhaps no other Member State of this Organization \u2014 I repeat, no other Member State \u2014 would be capable of giving proof.\n149.\tBut behind the escalation of violence and threats against Portugal, the spectre of a vaster and more generalized conflict is raised. One frequently hears expressions such as the \\\"Viet-Namization of southern Africa\\\", and attempts are made to feed the flames of \\\"a gigantic racial conflict\\\". \\\"Viet-Namization of southern Africa\\\"? \\\"A gigantic racial conflict\\\"? Perhaps that indeed might be the case if the Portuguese Government were to change its present defensive policy in Africa; if it were to withdraw the armed forces ensuring the protection of all the populations in the face of terrorist action; if it were to abandon to their fate the various ethnic communities of Angola and of Mozambique; if it were to permit these communities to segregate themselves along racist lines; if it were to let the territories of Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea cease to form the basis for the unification of the different ethnic groups inhabiting them; if it were to allow 'them to be fragmented at the pleasure of forces and influences which would immediately dispute them and convert them into the battlefield for the declared or potential ambitions of their neighbours and a theatre of operations where territorial claims and defence strategies would certainly clash. Those who persist in calling for the destruction of Portugal in Africa would do well to meditate a while on that perspective.\n150.\tAttempts are made to justify the intervention by African States and by the OAU in Portuguese Territories in the name of African solidarity. That solidarity, it is said, transcends frontiers and does not have to respect either traditional juridical principles, or rules of universal law, or the Charter of the United Nations. Thus, emotional appeals are made, calling for recourse to the use of force and violence, and aggression is given legitimacy. It is good that Africans should feel a spirit of solidarity among themselves and that they should treat one another as brothers. Brotherhood is a powerful weapon in the fight against injustice and against oppression. But it ought not to be blind or based upon fictions.\n151.\tThe African man has already discovered his true dimension and dignity, the consciousness of his rights and the force of his aspirations, the value of his culture and the significance of his history, his importance in the contemporary world and his fundamental role in the future. We salute with respect the struggle carried on by the leaders of the young African States, in their own countries and on the international stage, for the progress of the continent and the fight on many fronts to combat under-development and foreign domination. All the Portuguese of Africa are no less conscious of their position as Africans. The blacks among them and those that are of other races or of mixed blood do not feel any less closely related to the problems, the dramas, the conflicts, the aspirations and the future of Africa.\n152.\tBut if the leaders of the OAU fell a solidarity only with those of their brothers that are of the same race as themselves, they should think, for instance, of the many thousands of black-skinned Portuguese who fight in the ranks of the Portuguese armed forces. They call them mercenaries. But why, I ask you, should anti-Portuguese elements who are paid from abroad be called patriots and freedom-fighters, and money from the capitals of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia be considered so pure? It is ridiculous that those who have subjected themselves totally to the discipline and organization of parties, whose ideologies and doctrines are alien to the African continent, and who serve imperialisms foreign to Africa, are praised for their patriotism; whereas those that defend their African villages and accept the prospect of being able to build their future peacefully within their own country are called mercenaries and collaborators.\n153.\tBut who will believe that in any country mercenaries can be more numerous than patriots? Count, on one side, the terrorists of FRELIMO,  those that sow mines along the roads and in the African villages as well as those that obtain them in Moscow, in Prague, in Stockholm or in Oslo. Count, on the other side, only the Africans that fight against them, those integrated in the regular army units or in the rural militia in Mozambique. The same is true in Angola and Portuguese Guinea. Those Africans constitute the overwhelming majority as compared with the invaders sent in by the so-called liberation movements. An entire population made up of mercenaries \u2014 what an extravagant theory!\n154.\tThe millions of inhabitants in Portuguese Africa, whether farmers or factory workers, technicians or public servants, students or professors, are no less conscious of their quality as Africans than their brothers from the rest of Africa. And they do not think they are betraying that quality when they peacefully continue their activities and participate in increasing measure in the political, social and economic development that is taking place in their countries. But they will have reason on their side in thinking that it is the rest of Africa that betrays them whenever it provokes and incites violence that victimizes them, when it seeks by all means to render difficult or to impede the setting up of factories or the construction of dams on which depend their lives and their progress, and when it condemns all political reforms that bring them advantages \u2014 when in fact it strives to hamper the conditions that promote their true and authentic self-determination.\n155.\tI spoke here a year ago [2048th meeting] about the many reforms and development/which have occurred in Portuguese Africa. The armed attacks against Portugal have not prevented us from implementing them with speed and determination. In March of this year elections to the legislative assemblies of the States of Angola and Mozambique and of the remaining Portuguese overseas provinces in Africa took place. Foreign journalists who were present during these elections attested, some of them with surprise, to the, enormous, peaceful and eager participation of the' voters. How could oppressed populations behave in this fashion? The majority of the voters were not white. In Angola, for example, whites numbered no more than 20per cent of the entire electorate. The results of those elections sent a very large percentage of native-born candidates to the various legislative assemblies.\n156.\tAn important step was taken towards giving a larger and increasing autonomy to our African provinces, and also ensuring a progressively greater participation of the entire population in the political direction of their respective territories. Efforts will continue to be made in the future to increase the numbers of voters among the local populations. This will be a direct result of the stupendous increase in the school-going population at all levels of education. How will it then be possible to continue saying that Portuguese Africa is subject to the domination of a white minority?\n157.\tSimultaneously, the representation of the overseas provinces was increased in the National Assembly, or central Parliament, of the Portuguese State. We cannot foresee the future, but if the present trends should continue, and taking into account the make-up of our population as well as the progressive acceleration of the economic and cultural advancement of its African component, the Portuguese nation is heading towards a great Euro-African state, with the black majority in political dominance. Yet the concept of a white majority or a black majority has no meaning in our multiracial society, in which men and votes do not group themselves or are counted according to the colour of skin. Could the prospect of such a situation be repugnant to the OAU and to the United Nations, which make these concepts their banner and their objective?\n158.\tToday it is possible to compare the statutes of the States of Angola and Mozambique and those of the units of a federation. Even though the autonomous regions of the Portuguese State may not be juridically federated in some fields, such as economic planning, Angola and Mozambique enjoy an autonomy which surpasses to a great extent that which is generally attributed to a state belonging to a federation. Much is said of the great projects in execution, like those of Cabora Bassa and Cunene River development schemes, both of which have been condemned by the United Nations. These schemes are already great realities on the ground, which will have incalculable effects on the economic and social progress of vast regions and numerous populations, and will have beneficial repercussions beyond the frontiers, and also in countries having a black majority. But the economic progress in Portuguese Africa is not limited to them, for it is disseminated throughout the Territories and embraces all sectors, from agriculture, to industry, and the services. The economic relations among the Portuguese Territories are established on a basis of equality and of solidarity, and there is no element of exploitation and of predominance present in the plans or in the realities. Whoever will take the trouble to study the facts in depth will reach the conclusion that, in the over-all balance of the economic and financial flows, the positive balance belongs to the African part and the negative to the European. This is a fact that it is hard for some of our friends and advisers from northern Europe to understand. But how can we pretend that the racists of Scandinavia or members of the Dutch Parliament, saturated by centuries of colonialist mercantilism, would be able to grasp the spirit of a people that created Brazil and gave orientation to what is known as a Luso-tropical civilization?\n159.\tWhat more glaring example can I give of the solidarity between the different parts of my country than that of the assistance provided by metropolitan Portugal to Cape\nVerde? The drought, which today appears to be nearing its end in Cape Verde, was the longest in memory, lasting for over five years. In the meantime, thanks to the measures taken that drought has not resulted in graver consequences. No one has died of famine, the population has grown and there has been no stagnation in the development of the archipelago. The gross national product has grown at an average rate of 4 per cent per annum in the course of the last few years. The total of non-repayable financial aid furnished in the last three years is more than 30 million dollars and the aid for 1973 represents 25 per cent of the total value of the production originating in Cape Verde. In addition, technical and other forms of assistance were provided by metropolitan Portugal.\n160.\tThus, a country with a modest economic potential, to which the international community extends \\\"negative assistance\\\", has been able to find, thanks to the solidarity of its inhabitants, sufficient resources to avoid in one of its African territories the dramatic and catastrophic consequences which an identical natural phenomenon has provoked in various countries situated in the same geographical zone. And yet it is we who are called the colonialists.\n161.\tWe do not constitute a closed society in Africa. We do not raise political, juridical or social barriers among classes or among ethnic or religious groups. We do not set aside lands for the white and lands for the blacks. We do not distribute study courses, jobs and political positions, economic and social opportunities, on the basis of race or of colour. All the seeds of evolution and progress are to be found intermingled in our African societies. How, then, is one to justify the violence that leads nowhere and can only retard progress and make evolution difficult?\n162.\tViolence is lamented and condemned, its victims are pointed out. And in the campaign against Portugal no hesitation is shown in inverting responsibilities, in a scandalous fashion, with the instigators of the crimes showing themselves up in the role of accusers. And similarly no hesitation is shown in seeking recourse to the most astounding calumnies, to inventions and to the grossest falsifications of the truth. The Portuguese Government repudiates energetically accusations of massacres of civilian populations. As the Government of a civilized country and of a sovereign State, it considers it its exclusive responsibility, which it will not abdicate whatever may be the pressures to which it is submitted, to investigate and to punish the crimes and abuses perpetrated in its territory, whoever may have been the perpetrators. And how long is the list of the crimes and atrocities committed against the Portuguese civilian populations, especially the Africans, by the terrorists morally and financially supported by the Governments and institutions that seek to appear before world public opinion as defenders of peace and of human rights. And the only thing that is much greater than that list is long is the hypocrisy of those who level accusations against Portugal, based on suspect testimony of individuals politically compromised with anti-Portuguese movements, forgetting all the contradictions into which they let themselves fall and spurning the testimony of numerous journalists who have freely travelled around the area of the supposed massacres. And amid the artificial clamour thus raised, will those who make these accusations claim that the world will forget, among many others, the massacres which have occurred in recent times in places such as India, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Burundi, or the hundreds of thousands of dead, victims of tyranny in the Sudan, in Ethiopia, in Uganda or in Rwanda?\n163.\tCertainly there is a vast difference between an imagined number of some hundreds of dead whose death might have been, in any case, the lamentable consequence of terrorist activities, and the tens of thousands of victims resulting from the deliberate and systematic extermination of an entire ethnic group, such as is the case in Burundi, with the complacent and opportunistic silence of the same Governments and organizations which point an accusing finger at Portugal.\n164.\tAre there innocent victims and useless destruction in Portuguese Africa? Certainly there are. But who are those responsible? Not solely those who disturb the peace, committing aggressions of which the Portuguese populations are the victims and against which they have to defend themselves. Equally responsible are those who support these aggressors, at times under the fallacious pretext of providing humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance? Here is a fiction similar to that of the so-called liberated areas which are used as a pretext to justify such aid.\n165.\tWhere are the areas liberated by the terrorist movements, whose non-existence the organs of the United Nations continue to fear having to recognize, refusing as they do the persistent invitations addressed to them by the Portuguese Government with a view to clarifying the truth? Those areas can only be located where the headquarters and the bases of those movements are to be found, that is to say in the neighbouring territories. Are there, then, areas in the territories of the Republic of Guinea, or of Senegal, or of Congo-Brazzaville, or of Zaire, or of Zambia or of Tanzania, liberated from the control of the authorities of those countries? This is a problem which concerns the Governments of these States but whose resolution in no way alters the illegitimate character of the operations of those movements and of the assistance which they receive. But how is it possible to imagine that international organizations and responsible governments should base their conduct on fictions and fantasies? And shall we now have to add to the terminology of the fictions in vogue a new meaning of the expression \\\"illegal declaration of independence\\\"? How many imaginary declarations of independence are going to ensue in all the continents following the example of the terrorists installed in Conakry? The so-called PAIGC  has its headquarters in the Republic of Guinea/Conakry. It is there that its organization is established and its leaders and its cadres reside. If it exercises any control over populations or territories, these are all situated in the Republic of Guinea or in other countries that consider themselves sovereign and independent States. Must we suppose that a few days ago a secession in the Republic of Guinea took place and that the activities formerly carried out in combination by the Government of Sekou Toure and the PAIGC have now' been separated and apportioned? Here is a question which the Government in Conakry may have some interest in clarifying in relation to the States with which it maintains relations.\n166.\tThe situation is irrelevant to Portugal, and in no way affects the territory and the populations of the Portuguese province of Guinea, which is subject in all its extent to the sovereignty of the Government of Lisbon and which is under the effective control of the Portuguese authorities. For this reason, only the Portuguese Government will be able to continue assuming and exercising, in relation to that Territory and in relation to those populations, responsibilities at art international level. It is to be foreseen that the populations of Portuguese Guinea will unfortunately, continue to be attacked from foreign territory by terrorist organizations based there. But these attacks will have the same criminal nature and the same illicit character in international law whether they originate in a Guinea/Conakry No. 1 or in a Guinea/Conakry No. 2.\n167.\tAlthough no international juridical norm compels us to do this, and although we naturally cannot accept resolutions of the United Nations that are contrary to its own fundamental statute, however great the majority that has approved them, we have never hesitated to clarify before this Organization or before world public opinion, with honesty and realism, the true situation pertaining to Portuguese Africa, our problems and our difficulties, our possibilities and our successes. Is it that we have already achieved all our objectives of the political, economic, cultural and social promotion of all our people? No, certainly not.\n168.\tBut is the general position of Africa in the contemporary world in harmony with the aspirations and the possibilities of its sons? How many Africans exert influence on the direction of the interests of Africa and on the fundamental, political, economic and monetary decisions that are taken in international life and on which depends the lot of its peoples? How many participate effectively in political life within their countries? What is the share of Africa in total world income? How many Africans still die of hunger or from unsanitary conditions? How many doctors and professors has Africa? Where does the fight for the liberation of Africa and for the dignity of the African man really begin and end? Here are some subjects for reflection concerning the solidarity of the African brothers.\n169.\tAnd whether the OAU will or will not recognize this, Portugal has a natural solidarity with the rest of Africa. Some of our neighbours, who in difficult circumstances have not hesitated to seek our aid \u2014 which we have never refused nor made subject to political conditions \u2014 would have to agree with this. It is not among the lesser contradictions of this Organization that a mission set up by it had to count on the support and collaboration of Portugal for the solution of the problems of an African State, while at the same time, in the committees of the United Nations or in a conference promoted by it, resolutions were being approved which would have rendered that collaboration impossible. But was it not in this conference, called a conference of solidarity towards Africans, that once more all the projects in an extensive region of Africa that can contribute to a substantial increase in the production of food materials were condemned, at a time when millions of the continent's inhabitants were threatened with death from famine?\n170.\tWe are at a moment in history when, side by side with the legacies of over-population and under-development, the menacing prospect of a scarcity of cereals raises its head. As one of the world's most prestigious personalities solemnly affirmed here, \\\"morally, it makes no difference whether a man is killed in war or is condemned to starve to death by the indifference of others\\\" [2128th meeting, para. 48]. Would this, indeed, be the appropriate moment to assign priority in Africa to violence as compared to peaceful co-operation?\n171.\tOn various occasions and in many forms we have proposed conversations and negotiations with the African countries. We renewed these proposals about a year ago for talks with the OAU or with the African group in the United Nations, without prior conditions and with no limitations regarding agenda or subject matter. Although all our proposals have been rejected without any explanation, we still maintain them as valid\n172.\tIt is said that we seek to gain time. This is true. Every hour that is lost in Africa for the tasks of peace and progress creates tremendous responsibilities towards future generations. And why, one should ask, should it be feared so much that time may prove Portugal to be right?\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff90.\t Mr. President, on behalf of my Government I have the great pleasure of addressing to you my warm congratulations on the occasion of your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your election is certainly a tribute to your country, which on many occasions has been able to demonstrate its devotion to the ideas of the United Nations Charter. My delegation is convinced that thanks to your able guidance and to the wisdom we know to be one of your qualities the General Assembly will acquit itself of its many tasks efficiently and successfully.\n91.\t.May I also be permitted to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, for the able manner in which he presided over the twenty-seventh session.\n92.\tI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on the faith he has displayed in the discharge of his heavy duties in the service of peace.\n93.\tAnd I cannot fail to address a word of welcome to this Assembly of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, States which I am convinced will make a positive contribution to our work.\n94.\tAt the international level the year 1973 offers two features of great interest to all those who, like the Republic of Upper Volta, have faith in the United Nations. The first feature, which is certainly encouraging, falls under the heading of that detente achieved through bilateral contacts or multilateral meetings which, while they have not always resulted in tangible achievements, have none the less had the advantage of confirming the tendency which has been emerging since last year, namely, the achievement of detente through negotiation. The second feature of international life at the opening of this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is somewhat more disturbing. I refer to the persistence or emergence of local conflicts that at any moment could lead to wars on a world-wide scale, as has happened in the past. Our lofty mission in this Assembly is to act in such a way that detente will win out over confrontation, which is most often due to frustration, injustice, a desire for power by States, or disparities in economic and social development. To carry out this mission, it is necessary to turn interstate relations in the direction of the world order envisaged by the Charter. True, this course upon which the United Nations set out more than a quarter of a century ago is long and arduous, but we are convinced that, confronted with the dilemma of war or peace, this august Assembly could not evade its responsibility, which is to maintain international peace and security.\n95.\tI should like to state once again that my country is convinced more than ever that the United Nations Charter has defined and laid down fundamental purposes and principles which should regulate and strengthen good relations among all peoples. In particular we are in duty bound to work for and to place all the skill of mankind in the service of international peace and security, to respect the independence and sovereignty of States, large and small, to work for the elimination of all forms of oppression and colonial and racial domination, and to create in the developing countries conditions for harmonious economic and social development on a solid basis.\n96.\tThe sad realities of life today show us, however, how far we have departed from these noble objectives. Regions and developments which commanded our attention at our last session are still matters for concern.\n97.\tPast experience has shown us that our common aspirations for peace and progress would be more easily achieved if the international community were not every day involved in dealing with tensions and confrontations which have overwhelmed certain regions. How much effort and how much money have been wasted in sterile struggles, the only results of which have been to sow insecurity, poverty and desolation in regions which in reality only aspire to peace.\n98.\tBefore this Assembly it is my duty to repeat once again the fact that we should make every possible effort to put an end to the process of decolonization in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), for there is no doubt, whatsoever, that one of the great dangers which at present threaten international peace and security is to be found in the persistence, at a time when all progress requires the freedom and the flourishing of the individual, of systems and regimes founded on colonial and racial domination. The ineffectiveness displayed so far by the United Nations in dealing with the burning colonial problems leads my delegation to think we should turn to new methods of approach that are more realistic and effective so as to accelerate the process of decolonization. That is all the more necessary, inasmuch as the United Nations has recognized both the legitimacy of the armed struggle of the liberation movements and their representative nature. For the time being, we can but restate our indignation and concern at the situation that has been created and maintained in Africa by the colonialist and racist Powers. Portugal still continues to flout with impunity the legitimate wishes of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and to defy the United Nations. But the armed struggle unleashed in 1961 against Portuguese colonialism in Angola, and subsequently in Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, has entered upon a new phase, thanks to the great victories and the many sacrifices of the peoples of those regions. As a matter of fact, in the liberated areas, new structures have been set in place which are the incarnation of national sovereignty, making possible the work of reconstruction in all sectors of social life, education and production.\n99.\tHelpless to halt the progress of the national liberation struggle, Portugal does not hesitate to intensify its policy of terror by basely assassinating the leaders and political statesmen of the liberation movements. Thus it was that after Eduardo Mondlane it was Amilcar Cabral who, on 20 January 1973, fell under their blows; and we cannot forget the systematic slaughter of civilian populations in Mozambique, and witnesses have testified to the scope of those massacres. Amilcar Cabral, to whom we wish to pay a tribute from this rostrum, was a soldier aware of his role in the service of his country; a leader and a fighter in Guinea-Bissau, he made an important contribution to the liberation struggle of all of Africa, of which he was a worthy son. The most disturbing fact is that Portugal has succeeded in associating its Western allies of NATO in its colonial wars. As a matter of fact, it is difficult for us to draw a distinction between Portugal and those Powers that supply it with weapons in order to facilitate its colonial enterprises in Africa. Indeed, they are nothing less than accomplices. It goes without saying that this situation continues to constitute a serious threat to international peace and security; hence it is up to the United Nations, in these circumstances, to show that it is and remains a valuable tool of recourse for peoples that have fallen victim to injustice and oppression. This has proven to be all the more necessary, since in neighbouring regions the situation is deteriorating from day to day.\n100.\tIn Rhodesia, while the United Kingdom continues to shirk its obligations by proving itself unable or unwilling to take effective measures to put an end to the illegal Ian Smith regime, the binding sanctions imposed by the Security Council are being violated by Members of the United Nations, and in particular-what is even sadder  \u2014  by permanent States members of the Security Council. The United Nations should do everything in its power to enforce implementation of the sanctions it has adopted.\n101.\tWith respect to Namibia, there is no doubt whatsoever that the repressive measures and the pursuit of the so-called \\\"Bantustan\\\" policy by the racist authorities of\nSouth Africa constitute sources of serious concern. The United Nations here bears a special responsibility, to the extent that, legally speaking, that Territory should be administered by the United Nations pending its attainment of independence. The contacts between the racist South Africa regime and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have produced nothing worthwhile so far. It seems to us, therefore, inappropriate to continue those contacts, which, in the last analysis, do harm to the legitimate interests of the people of Namibia. On the other hand, my country will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia in the fulfilment of the task that has been entrusted to it by our Assembly.\n102.\tIn the field of decolonization we can be gratified at the co-operation existing between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The fruitful conduct of the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa, held at Oslo from 9 to 14 April 1973, is evidence of this. Upper Volta is ready to collaborate to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of that Conference-a Conference which has made an important contribution to the struggle for the liberation of Territories under colonial and racist domination in southern Africa.\n103.\tIn South Africa we are witnessing the violation of human rights as part of a policy of terror in the service of a system universally condemned: apartheid. This doctrine of the supremacy of one race over another is an absurdity in this century, and we shall never cease to combat it. This Assembly has declared that the apartheid system is a crime against humanity, which means, therefore, that any complacency  \u2014  not to mention complicity  \u2014  vis-\u00e0-vis South Africa is a challenge flung at the United Nations and the peoples of Africa. Still, throughout this year, one economic and trade mission after another from Western Powers has visited Pretoria and Johannesburg. The economic, financial and military assistance given to the racist minority Government of Pretoria by the NATO Powers enables it to continue and reinforce its apartheid policy. Once again, therefore, we invite those Powers to cut off all assistance to the racist South African regime and to combat it with all the means at their disposal. They can do so if they so desire.\n104.\tThe Middle East continues to be a serious source of apprehension for the international community. In spite of the numerous resolutions that have been adopted, the problem has not changed, and the situation of \\\"no peace, no war\\\" presages nothing good in a region where anything can happen from one moment to the next. The tensions and incidents on both sides of the frontiers between Israel and its neighbour States, the numerous complaints submitted to the Security Council throughout the year, followed by condemnations without any practical effect, are symptoms of the present impasse in the pursuit of an over-all solution to the Middle East problem.\n105.\tWe wish to reaffirm that it is unrealistic to question the political independence and territorial integrity of any State in that region. Similarly, the occupation or acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible and must be condemned. It must also be pointed out that consideration of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians is an indispensable element for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in that region. We must therefore achieve peace, and the successive failures of the numerous efforts undertaken since 1967 must impel us to persevere in the search for that peace, which is so desired by the international community. To this end, we feel that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) constitutes a solid basis for the settlement of the conflict. For the implementation of that resolution it is necessary that there emerge a common will on the part of the parties. But the present impasse, need I recall, unfortunately arises as a result of Israel's refusal to evacuate the Arab territories it has occupied by force, and this is a defiance hurled at our Organization by a State which owes its very existence to the United Nations.\n106.\tThe progressive colonization of those occupied territories as undertaken by Israel is a clear indication of the will of that country to annex, purely and simply, the territories in question. We believe that the international community should not permit that. In any event, as far as we are concerned, we condemn that policy.\n107.\tIn South-East Asia, the Viet-Namese drama has seen a happy change in course ever since January 1973 with the signature in Paris of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam. My Government can only be gratified at that Agreement, which had been awaited for more than 30 years and followed five years of difficult negotiations, indescribable sufferings and tremendous loss of human life in Viet-Nam.\n108.\tBut today, while the war seems to be at an end, the peace is still to be won. And it is therefore up to the whole of the international community, including the United Nations, which was kept away from the drama, to participate in this fight for the peace.\n109.\tWhat peace, we may ask, when in Cambodia everything is still to be done? That country, which was formerly a peaceful one under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who practised a policy of non-alignment, is today engulfed in a fate which was and still is that of Viet-Nam. Upper Volta-and I declare this from this rostrum loud and clear-supports the United National Front of Kampuchea, which effectively controls the major part of the territory of Cambodia. That is why my Government decided on 12 July last to recognize Prince Sihanouk's Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the only legitimate authority in Cambodia and to establish .diplomatic relations with it.\n110.\tUpper Volta has always been anxious to spare no effort in promoting the greatest possible understanding between all States which share its own ideas of frank and friendly co-operation and respect, for the sovereignty of all the parties concerned. It is within that framework that we find the decision of the Upper Volta Government to recognize the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government representing the Chinese people as a whole.\n111.\tAt the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, Upper Volta supported the proposal to adjourn the debate on the question of Korea, in the firm hope that the contacts which had been started between the two parties might come to tangible results.\n112.\tThe United Nations has a mission in Korea. That mission is to create by peaceful means a unified, independent and democratic Korea. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, whose mandate was to set up such conditions as would promote that peaceful and independent unification, has so far been unable to carry out the role assigned to it by the General Assembly. For that reason, and in pursuit of conditions that would lead to the unification of Korea, my delegation is of the opinion that it is necessary to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Moreover, all foreign troops would have to be immediately withdrawn from the Republic of Korea as an additional measure in order to diminish tensions and thus promote unification. In the opinion of the delegation of Upper Volta, it is for the two parties themselves to find a negotiated solution to all disputes existing between them and to decide by common agreement upon their ultimate admission to the United Nations.\n113.\tIn Europe, the way realities have developed has led the leaders of the countries of the region to die Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. We believe that the crystallization of those realities will constitute an element of detente in international relations, especially in Europe. Among those relations, we wish to single out the historic fact of the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. A tragic page in the history of post-war Europe has thus been turned, and we are happy at this.\n114.\tMy country, which maintains diplomatic relations\nwith the two countries, welcomes the conclusion of the\nfundamental Treaty between the two Germanys as a contribution beneficial to detente in Europe. We are happy at the possibility now given to those two great States to play their role in the United Nations in the service of peace, international co-operation and harmony between peoples. Tangible proof was given us this morning in the magnificent speech of Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany [2128th meeting].\n115.\tOn the front of economic and social development, it will soon be 1975-half way through the Second United Nations Development Decade. An assessment of the results achieved so far shows that the objectives defined in the International Development Strategy might well continue to remain so many mirages which only move further away instead of at least giving the illusion of being fixed even if inaccessible.\n116.\tIn reality, even if those goals are achieved, the mean annual per capita income in the developing countries will be only $265, whereas it will be of the order of $3,600 in the developed countries. It is also to be noted that those are averages and that in fact in the least developed developing countries the mean per capita annual income will be of the order of $150.\n117.\tIn spite of the modesty of the goals assigned to the Second Development Decade, there is still much to be desired in the way of achievement.\n7 Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, done at Berlin on 21 December 1972.\n118.\tthe most recent statistics show that the flow of financial resources, and specifically the real flow of public aid to development, fell in 1972 from 0.35 per cent to 0.34 per cent of the gross national product of member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In percentages of the gross national product of members of that Committee, the total flow of resources fell from 0.82 per cent in 1971 to 0.77 per cent in 1972. If account is taken of the increase in prices and shifts in parities, the real value of public assistance for development will have decreased by 15 per cent between 1961 and 1971.\n119.\tAll these elements merely serve to emphasize even more the need for the inclusion in any reform of the monetary systems of a link between special drawing rights and additional financing for development.\n120.\tAs regards the untying of aid, my delegation has taken good note of the assurance given by the countries concerned to the Committee on Invisibles and Financing Related to Trade of the Trade and Development Board that negotiations will soon be resumed with a view to a total untying of financial aid to development. Until such time as agreement is brought about, my delegation expresses the hope that certain countries will singly or in groups adopt unilateral measures designed to attenuate the harmful effects of tying aid to the purchase of goods and services in the donor countries. In our opinion, all donor countries can and should commit themselves to untying by 1975 the sums provided by public aid and by contributions to international financial institutions.\n121.\tIt is amply evident that the increase in the volume of financial contributions and the easing of the conditions and modalities for the provision of these contributions are of capital importance in view of the needs of the developing countries.\n122.\tAccordingly, all the developed countries should accept the target of 1 per cent and commit themselves to reaching it in 1975 at the latest. Similarly, in regard to public aid to development, as was stated by the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]\n\\\"... in order to raise the Rows of official development assistance from the current 0.35 per cent to the 0.7 per cent target, the developed countries would need to devote only about 1.5 per cent of the amount by which they themselves would grow richer during the decade.\\\"\n123.\tThe winding down of the development effort has taken the form of increasing difficulties within the multilateral financial institutions; thus the reconstitution of the resources of the International Development Association has not yet been brought about. The United Nations Development Programme has seen its global resources reach a level very much below the projections accepted by all its member States, in spite of the highly laudable efforts made by certain developed countries, especially the Scandinavian countries. As a consequence, the activities of certain organs and specialized agencies have been seriously compromised.\n124.\tThese negative trends must be halted and reversed if the international community intends to achieve the goals1 set for the Second Development Decade.\n125.\tThe developing countries have also had a serious reduction in their share of world trade. That share has fallen from 30 per cent in 1950 to 17 per cent in 1970. The various series of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT aimed at and had as a result only the solution of trade problems of industrialized countries, in defiance and to the detriment of the vital trading interests of the developing countries. My delegation is of the opinion that the whole of the international community should be mobilized in order to see to it that the Nixon Round does not content itself with seeking solutions to the trade problems of developed countries, as the Kennedy Round did. The negotiations should attempt in particular to provide a serious solution for the trade problems of developing countries and to give the developing countries net additional advantages, an increased share in world trade, a diversification of their exports and an expansion of the generalized system of preferences.\n126.\tAs regards commodities, though we may be gratified at the clear improvement that was felt late in 1972 and the first six months of 1973 in world markets in those commodities, we are bound to recognize that the surge in prices has benefited only the transnational corporations  \u2014   and, therefore, the developed countries-and not the producer countries. The rise occurred after several successive years of depressed rates and could have represented an important contribution to the economies of the exporting countries. My delegation hopes that in the light of those rates and of a more equitable level for producer countries, existing agreements will be reconsidered for the purpose of guaranteeing exporting countries fairer prices than those contained in the agreements.\n127.\tIn spite of the temporary rise in prices of certain commodities, the prices of other commodities-including tea, bananas, lemons and manganese  \u2014  have remained at their low levels.\n128.\tNegotiations in progress for the reform of the international monetary s-'stem and the Nixon Round under the auspices of GATT offer the international community an opportunity for decisive action concretely to promote the goals of the International Development Strategy.\n129.\tIn accordance with the provisions of UNCTAD resolution 84(111),  it is vital for problems of trade, financing, development and the monetary system to be resolved in a co-ordinated fashion with the full and entire participation of developed and developing countries in all phases of the discussions and decisions. As we indicated at the meetings of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board, my delegation is convinced that such co-ordination can be effectively guaranteed only at the intergovernmental level. We hope that consultations will take place on this matter in such a way that a solution acceptable to the developing countries can be formulated..\n130.\tAs regards the least developed among the developing countries, the results of the first three years of the Second Development Decade show that in practically all cases there has been little or no over-all growth, while in certain countries there has actually been a sharp decline in per capita income.\n131.\tMy delegation has taken due note of the pertinent recommendations made by the Development Assistance Committee with respect to the conditions for granting assistance to such countries. This is a highly modest effort which has still to be implemented by the great majority of the members of the Development Assistance Committee. It is to be hoped that the easing of conditions for providing capital will be accompanied by a substantial increase in the resources destined for those countries, both bilateral and multilateral. I am thinking of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Monetary Fund, regional development banks, the International Finance Corporation, and so on. In spite of all the debates in all international forums, and the unreserved support of all member countries, the international financial institutions are still far from responding to the expectations of the least developed countries. My delegation hopes that this is a temporary maladjustment which will be corrected in accordance with the unanimous wish of the whole of the international community, as expressed at all international meetings since the third session of UNCTAD.\n132.\tMy delegation is also awaiting with interest the implementation of the specific commitments undertaken by the socialist countries of Eastern Europe.\n133.\tThe world is at present going through a food crisis, which is aggravated by the feverish rise in prices for urgently needed commodities. It is necessary for the whole of the international community to seek a concerted solution to this problem, which is vital and urgent for two thirds of mankind. As the Director-General of the Food and Agricultural Organization [FAOJ emphasized in his speech before the fifty-fifth session of the Economic and Social Council, for 20 years the stocks of cereals have never been so low nor the prices so high. He said:\n\\\"The minimum anticipated needs for wheat in 1973-1974 cannot be covered through present production. There is also a shortage of rice, and cereals for animal feed may well be in short supply. ... In fact, are we to see in the next few months a world-wide shortage of cereals in the event of a bad harvest in one of the principal producing regions ...?\n\\\"It is no longer possible to tolerate that the world should be subjected to a system of international rationing through prices during periods of shortage  \u2014  in other words, to a system which would permit the richest or those who have come first to be served first and walk away with the biggest piece.\\\"1o\n10 For a summary of this statement, see Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, Fifty-fifth Session, 1861st meeting.\n134.\tIndeed, affluence has drawn food-stuffs to the countries which are able to pay-to the rich and developed countries of the north. The cereal crisis has not yet been sufficiently considered for an appropriate solution to be found. We are of the opinion that it would not be wise for the international community simply to leave it to the caprices of the monsoons, which may or may not come. It seems to us that the problem is far more serious and that is why Upper Volta supports the proposal of FAO to establish a cereal bank which would stock the surplus in times of over-production and make it available for consumption during lean periods.\n135.\tThat is the only international measure which would ensure an appropriate solution to the problem. The developed countries, which are major producers of cereals, have here an opportunity to manifest their interest in the solution of this problem, which is hanging like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the poor developing countries, which are helpless before this problem, the solution of which goes far beyond their respective national capacities.\n136.\tPending a concerted solution to the food crisis, any restrictive measures in regard to production and stockpiling should be postponed.\n137.\tIn this respect my delegation gives its full support to the proposal of the United States to convene in 1974 a conference which would discuss the ways and means to maintain food-stuff production at an appropriate level and to mobilize the efforts of all countries to deal with famine and malnutrition resulting from natural calamities \n138.\tIn Upper Volta and in the five other countries of the Sudano-Sahelian zone, drought has caused ravages among the 20 million inhabitants, their animals and their subsistence economies. Hundreds of persons have perished from thirst, hunger and diseases which have found easy prey among persons weakened by hunger. Millions of animals have perished, representing in practically all of these countries more than 80 per cent of' their livestock  \u2014   and trade in livestock constitutes their principal source of export income. Indeed all the peasants of the Sudano- Sahelian zone supplemented their raising of livestock by a little crop-growing for local consumption. In fact food imports were already sapping the modest currency resources of these six countries. The foreign currency income depended in part upon the value of products which were constantly decreasing in price on the world market, such as peanuts and cotton. It is in that context that we have to consider the causes, the effects and the ways to remedy the situation in these countries. I should like solemnly to thank here all those that have responded to the appeal of the populations affected by the drought, be they countries, governmental or non-governmental organizations or private individuals. This spontaneous and generous reaction on the part of international solidarity has saved thousands of human lives and has strengthened the faith of these populations in what man can do for himself and for his neighbours.\n139.\tHowever, the consequences of this drought remain with us. Even if the food production this year was better than that of the previous four years, it will not be sufficient to cover the needs of the consumers. Moreover, the countries affected by the drought have defined the medium-term and long-term measures for initiating the rehabilitation and the accelerated development of the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region through the reconstitution of production capital: the regeneration of soil and the reconstitution of the herds and of the productive forces of the working masses.\n140.\t1 shall not go into the specific details of the measures proposed by the Heads of State of the countries of the zone. Indeed, the Head of State of Upper Volta, President Sangoule Lamizana, designated by his peers, will have an opportunity of speaking here on 9 October for the purpose of presenting the measures agreed upon by the six countries.\n141.\tFor all the countries afflicted, this drought is a brutal blow in the sense of a deterioration of the ecological conditions of the soil as well as the living conditions of the populations. If the emergency measures have made it possible to solve urgent supply problems temporarily, at present the assistance of the international community must be sought in order to make it possible to bring about the implementation of measures through which these countries will build solid economies enabling them in the future to deal with and overcome calamities of this kind. The international community had already firmly committed itself to helping practically all these countries within the context of measures oriented towards the least developed countries. Only urgent and comprehensive implementation of all these measures, especially commercial and financial, will make it possible for these countries to approach, however modestly, the goals defined in the International Development Strategy. The international community can only turn to the developed countries and ask them to show the political will that is necessary to enable the populations concerned to reach a threshold of development placing them beyond the calamities that would otherwise be uncontrollable, even though they are foreseeable.\n142.\tThanks to the actions of certain peace-loving and freedom-loving countries, the United Nations has been able to prevent international disputes from deteriorating dangerously and sometimes has thus made it possible for conditions to be established for a final settlement.\n143.\tHowever, we have to work even harder in order to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to influence events so that a spirit of detente and peace may prevail throughout the world.\n144.\tMy delegation firmly hopes that the present session of the General Assembly will do everything in its power to give effect to measures which are genuinely applicable in regard to the maintenance of peace, co-operation, justice and the dignity of man."

        "file_text": "\ufeff Mr. President, your election to preside over this important Assembly gives immense pleasure to the delegation of Costa Rica. This is a just tribute to your country, the sister Republic of Ecuador, and a well-earned recognition of your personal attributes as a distinguished internationalist and an experienced fighter for peace, and justice among nations both in and out of the United Nations.\n2.\tMr. President, to echo the words of your inaugural statement [2117th meeting], the delegation of Costa Rica also wishes to express its sorrow at the recent deaths of two Heads of State: the constitutional President of Chile, Mr. Salvador Allende, and His Majesty King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden.\n3.\tMy country enjoys cordial diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, which it has done since its inception, and has had relations with the German Democratic Republic for the last year. We are happy now to offer a warm welcome to the representatives of those two recently admitted Members of our Organization. Their admission represents an important step towards making the United Nations truly universal. The fact that the necessary agreement was arrived a'/ between the two German States to permit their simultaneous admission is further proof of the relaxation of tension that kept the world divided into two antagonistic and apparently irreconcilable ideological blocs. The presence in this hall of the representatives of the two Germanys is a comforting symbol of the fact that the \\\"cold war\\\" has almost entirely given way to peaceful coexistence.\n4.\tThe progressive liquidation of colonialism allows us also to tender our welcome to a new American State: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We wish that young nation the greatest success and we also hope that it will very soon be admitted to our own regional organization, the Organization of American States [OAS], where all free and\n independent States of this hemisphere have the right to be represented.\n5.\tMy delegation voted enthusiastically in favour of resolution 2937 (XXVII). which expressed the desire of the General Assembly that the People's Republic of Bangladesh be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. We did so with the certainty that its Government would do everything possible to comply with Security Council resolution 307 (1971) on the just settlement of the problems flowing from the armed strife and on the repatriation of prisoners of war. We confidently hope that when the Security Council deals with the matter again, its members will unanimously recommend the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.\n6.\tCosta Rica encourages the aspirations of the Korean people to a prompt reunification of their ancient country, today divided into two States: the Republic of Korea, in the south, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in the north. We in Costa Rica, too, would like this reunification to be carried out through peaceful means, without foreign interference, and by the application of a formula which will permit the two Koreas \u2014 and all the Korean people \u2014 freely to decide what they prefer concerning the organization of a single State of Korea, and the form of government and the economic and social structure that will be best suited to the present historical reality and the just aspirations of that sorely beset nation.\n7.\tThe dialogue between the organizations of the Red Cross of the North and of the South of Korea, which started in 1971, fortunately culminated in July 1972 with a joint communiqu\u00e9 and with the formation of a North and South Korean Co-ordinating Committee. We trust that the dialogue between them will continue to be governed by a spirit of co-operation in order to overcome the obstacles that for 27 years have kept the Korean people divided.\n8.\tThis direct dialogue can advantageously replace the good offices of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. And in accordance with the hope that I expressed earlier that it will be the Koreans themselves who will solve their great problem, my Government is ready to vote for the dissolution of that Commission, as its own members have recommended.\n9.\tHowever, my delegation does not believe that the moment has now arrived also to dissolve the United Nations Command in Korea, created by Security Council resolution 84(1950) of 7 July 1950. Our view is based on the fact \nthat it was that joint Command-representing the United Nations as the only counterpart of the forces of North Korea and of the People's Republic of China-which signed the Armistice Agreement in 1953. For that reason we believe that the premature dissolution of the Command, before negotiation on agreements constituting a valid alternative to the Armistice Agreement, might endanger all the complicated arrangements that have kept the cease-fire in force for the last 20 years.\n10.\tThe Costa Rican delegation, of course, which desires to have the Koreans settle their own affairs themselves, would be ready to vote in favour of the dissolution of the United Nations Command when the representatives of the two Korean States officially notify the Security Council that they consider the Command no longer necessary.\n11.\tSince the question of Korea appears on the agenda of the Assembly this year [item 41], we trust that, in the debate that will be held on the matter, representatives of the two Korean States will participate, enjoying the same rights and the same obligations.\n12.\tCosta Rica has repeatedly stated its adherence to the principle of universality for our Organization. We believe that for the peace of the world and for a more effective functioning of the United Nations it is indispensable that all independent States with duly recognized Governments of their own be admitted to membership. It is for those reasons that my delegation is ready to support warmly the admission to the United Nations of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. My Government believes that full participation in our work by the two Korean States, far from being an obstacle, would make it easier to hold new dialogues to bring about the peaceful reunification of the great Korean nation.\n13.\tIn the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization, our efficient Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, reminds us that the original concept of the United Nations was that of \\\"an organization of which the primary function was to maintain, and if necessary impose, international peace and security...\\\" \n14.\tNow, although Mr. Waldheim recognizes that this concept has been expanded by the adoption of long- and medium-range targets, he contends that the first duty of the United Nations still is \\\"the day-to-day effort to maintain peace and security [ibid.] \u2014  and it could be no other, for without a truly peaceful atmosphere, other international activities cannot be adequately developed. It is for those reasons that it is appropriate that at each session of the General Assembly we think deeply about the meaning of peace and the ways of achieving it.\n15.\tIt has been repeatedly stated that peace is more than a mere absence of war. It is, rather, the fruit of justice. In modern days, in accordance with the thinking of His Holiness the Pope, peace has become the new name for development As a fruit of justice and the leaven of development, peace has its own channels, the main one being dialogue, communication among men. Genuine dialogue is impossible without honesty and sincerity. When it is achieved no problem bessetting human relations, however difficult it might appear, is insoluble, and thus we see the great value of the word, the spoken word, the sign of the greatness of the individual and the indispensable bridge for the legitimate progress of mankind.\n16.\tWar breaks out when words end, or, rather, when man decides to shatter his communications with other men. When we cease to hear words we begin to hear the rattling of machine-guns and the roar of cannon, and we see the realm of death take over and barbarism reign. In other words, barbarism begins when words die. Culture is words, culture is dialogue; barbarism is lack of communication.\n17.\tAnd herein lies the importance and fruitfulness of the United Nations at the world level, and of the OAS and other similar organizations at the regional level. Although they do not solve all international problems, their mere existence as forums for a dialogue among peoples is an extremely important element for peace. When there is the possibility of a dialogue, then there is hope for peace. Peace began to be seen in Viet-Nam when the North Americans and the North Viet-Namese declared themselves ready to talk. Peace has not yet been able to prevail in the Middle East because it has not been possible to establish a direct dialogue between Arabs and Israelis.\n18.\tIn Central America peace now appears promising since the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Honduras and El Salvador have begun a dialogue in Washington and in Mexico.\n19.\tAnd, as I said earlier, the talks initiated in Korea by the Red Cross organizations of the North and the South promise to be an effective instrument for the peaceful reunification of the peninsula.\n20.\tAs a United Nations Member in good standing, Costa Rica struggles everywhere to ensure the consolidation of peace, and that is why we have started a dialogue with all those countries which wish to speak with us, without considering their political ideology or their form of government. We are convinced that it is not necessary to possess a nuclear arsenal or to be a world economic power in order to possess a voice that can be heard, supporting and encouraging peace. Even small nations like my own, with clear-cut historic vision and a tradition against war, can and should raise the standard of peace.\n21.\tFor my Government peace will continue to be the ultimate objective of all our activities, both domestically and externally, and thus we daily feel more identified with the primary task of the United Nations.\n22.\tAll the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations are the bases and beacons of our foreign policy. It is for that reason that this year Costa Rica, with the unanimous support of the Latin American group of States, has decided to put forward its candidacy for one of the elective seats in the Security Council. We are thus trying to show my country's readiness to accept its part of the general responsibilities of the United Nations. Were we to be elected we would make the greatest effort in that post to interpret the feelings and aspirations to peace, justice and development that imbue the peoples of Latin America,\nwhose representatives would be choosing us to represent the entire region.\n23.\tIn the course of the general debate at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly, note was taken with satisfaction of the favourable way in which relations among the great Powers had evolved. We pointed out then that tensions between the East and the West were being reduced, tensions which for years had kept us plunged in the cold war and which at times seemed to be pushing the world towards nuclear holocaust.\n24.\tAt this new session we can again state that the detente between the East and the West has continued to grow in even more favourable conditions. The end of the war in Viet-Nam, the treaties on the normalization of relations among European States, the agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons, and the holding of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are just so many more encouraging symptoms of an improved atmosphere for world peace. Never have we been so close to putting into effect President Nixon's idea that the era of negotiation must replace the era of confrontation.\n25.\tBut the truth of the matter is that while tension between the East and West has been considerably reduced, the underlying tension between the North and the South is emerging and becoming more acute. While the great Powers seem to find a balance of coexistence in the administration of their own welfare, there is growing dissatisfaction on the\n- part of the under-developed nations with the exploitation of which, consciously or unconsciously, the industrialized, capitalistic or socialistic nations have made them the victims.\n26.\tAt the sessions of the United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] the paradox-albeit an understandable one \u2014 has become evident that there is an association among the governments in the north of the northern hemisphere, which have achieved a high degree of development, vis-\u00e0-vis the just claims of the nations in the south, which are beginning to be aware of the fact that their lack of union is a main cause of their backwardness.\n27.\tThe northern nations, regardless of their political ideology, represent conservatism in the struggle for world development. But this should be no surprise. The wealthy States always tend to be conservative. They have too much personal well-being to safeguard. On the other hand, the countries of the south-where, geographically, all the countries of the third world are located-tend to be revolutionary. Since they are poor and backward they feel compelled to liquidate the national and international structures that hinder their development. Confronted by the inequity of world trade and the lack of true, multinational economic co-operation, the winds of revolution blow increasingly stronger from the south to the north.\n28.\tIt is for those reasons that I repeat that this new process of the convergence of forces is rapidly changing the axis of international tensions. Until a short time ago, primarily for ideological and sometimes for dogmatic reasons, the axis ran from east to west. But because of the struggle against under-development, the axis of world tensions has switched and now goes from south to north.\n29.\tA short while ago I stated in Mexico that the greatest threat to peace was no longer nuclear weapons, which seem to have found in the balance of terror their own form of coexistence. The greatest threat to international peace and security \u2014 a threat which is far more explosive than even nuclear fusion itself \u2014 is the extreme poverty suffered by the great masses living in the southern hemisphere of the globe.\n30.\tThe despair of more than 2,000 million inhabitants living miserably in the under-developed nations composing the third world constitutes the greatest challenge to the new system of peaceful coexistence advocated by the great Powers.\n31.\tBut to maintain that peaceful coexistence \u2014 one we all desire \u2014 it. is imperative that we increase international co-operation for development, without ties, and establish a truly equitable foreign trade. Otherwise, the frustration of the peoples of the third world will become so acute that the tensions between the south and the north will grow, and very soon the world will find itself radically divided into two camps of a new \\\"cold war\\\" with much more fatal consequences than those suffered by mankind because of the already reduced tensions that existed in the previous \\\"cold war\\\" between east and west.\n32.\tWe are confronted now by a new session of the General Assembly and yet, unfortunately, no progress has been made in the establishment of peace in the Middle East. Despite the efforts made by our Organization, Security Council resolution 242(1967) still has not been implemented.\n33.\tWe must repeat to this Assembly our conviction that any solution sought to overcome the crisis of the Middle East must fit fully within the terms of reference of resolution 242(1967). That resolution combines in a balanced fashion three basic principles for peace in the Levant. Those are: (a) the principle of non-recognition of the acquisition of territory occupied by force; (b) the need to respect the sovereignty of all States of the region within recognized and secure boundaries; and (c) the just solution of the problem of the displaced Palestinians.\n34.\tWe believe that until a final solution is found, efforts should be redoubled to open the Suez Canal. The closing of the Canal has caused great economic losses not only to the countries concerned in the controversy of the Middle East, but also to the entire international community.\n35.\tThis year, as every year, we raise our voices in favour of general and complete disarmament under international control. By such an achievement not only would we safeguard mankind from the shadow of terror projected by war potential, but it would be possible for part of the $200 billion a year devoted to the purchase of weaponry to be devoted to international assistance, which \u2014 and this bears repetition \u2014 constitutes a duty and not philanthropy. It is a duty because, by such assistance, the industrialized nations, which are the ones that spend the most on weaponry, would be in a position to give back to the developing countries part of what they have extracted from them in order to help build their own development and power.\n36.\tWe regret the fact that despite the progressive detente to which we have referred with great encouragement, it has not progressed to the point of making disarmament possible. Costa Rica has supported and will continue to support the idea of holding a world disarmament conference. We do not lose hope at the misgivings that are expressed by some of the great Powers concerning the convening of such a conference. But realistically speaking, we do not expect it to be held without the necessary preparation. It is lamentable that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, appointed by the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, has not progressed in the task entrusted to it, particularly because of the refusal of four of the five nuclear Powers to participate in its deliberations, namely, the United States, China, France and the United Kingdom.\n37.\tAs a Latin American nation, Costa Rica is proud to be an active party to the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which has established in our region the only zone free of nuclear weapons. My delegation is gratified that in the course of the last year France and the People's Republic of China have joined the United States of America and the United Kingdom in signing Additional Protocol II: to the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We regret the fact that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has not as yet seen fit to do so.\n38.\tSince the end of the Second World War, more than 70 nations which had been under the colonial yoke have achieved their independence and are today Members of the United Nations. But that triumph of the principle of self-determination of peoples cannot fully satisfy us until the process of decolonization which was set in motion by the United Nations has been completed. My delegation will continue to give its whole-hearted support to the nations that struggle to achieve their complete independence.\n39.\tTrue to its tradition and being a determined partisan of the right of all peoples to choose their own future without outside pressure, Costa Rica repeats its support for the resolutions of the Security Council condemning all types of colonial policies. We also reaffirm our respect for the sanctions decreed against the illegal regime of Southern Rhodesia and also for the validity and purpose of the resolutions approved by this Assembly, which has repeatedly repudiated any form of racial discrimination and apartheid.\n40.\tI cannot pass over in silence the existence of the problem of Gibraltar, the last of the colonies on European soil. It is our duty to ask for the application to Gibraltar of the United Nations doctrine on decolonization in order to restore the territorial integrity of Spain. Thus, we hope that as promptly as possible the United Kingdom will declare itself ready to resume the negotiations with Spain called for in the resolutions of the General Assembly, in order to put and end to the colonial situation, a remnant of an anachronistic past, which continues to exist in Gibraltar.\n41.\tThis year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Surely this would be an appropriate moment to ponder the great principles contained in that valuable document as well as the way it has been either applied or set aside by some.\n42.\tHistory shows that ethical codes have always preceded ethical conduct, because societies need time to be educated and to assimilate more noble norms. And even after that, perfection is never achieved. Therefore, we should not be discouraged by the differences that we note in many nations, differences between the principles that were solemnly proclaimed a quarter of a century ago and the respect shown or not shown for those norms of conduct today.\n43.\tThe shadow of the totalitarian oppression unleashed by nazism and fascism led to the unanimous adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That document was intended to sum up the separation between freedom and slavery, peace and violence, justice and injustice, full development of the human personality and its mutilation.\n44.\tThe Declaration, in admirably precise language, defined the minimum framework of rights within which human dignity can develop. The minimum includes the right to equality, freedom, economic well being and to receive fraternal treatment from other members of the human family.\n45.\tArticle 1, paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations sets out as one of the main goals of the United Nations the following principle:\n\\\"To achieve international co-operation... in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\\".\n46.\tBut since the Charter itself does not specify which are those human rights and fundamental freedoms which it is a basic responsibility of the Organization to promote and respect, Costa Rica believes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights interprets the meaning of those terms, and thus it is incorporated in the Charter.\n47.\tAlthough the Declaration itself is not a binding series of rules for Members of the United Nations, as an interpretive document of the norms of the Charter that are binding it does share that binding character which calls for its observance.\n48.\tStates Members cannot claim ignorance of human rights and fundamental freedoms which they themselves promised to encourage when they adopted the Charter. When agreeing to the Declaration, they approved the list of rights and freedoms included among the terms of Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Charter that I have mentioned, and they therefore accepted the obligation of ensuring their recognition and universal and effective application through progressive national and international measures. It is in this way that Costa Rica interprets the situation and, at least as far as we are concerned, the ethical norms included in the Declaration of Human Rights are juridical mandates that cannot be shirked.\n49.\tIt is obvious that the dignity of man cannot be fully achieved merely by stating classic civil or political rights, or even by applying them. Human freedom is incomplete and may be spurned by others unless the individual enjoys a decent standard of living. We can also state that in the international field a country is not sufficiently respected, although it may be politically independent, unless, through its work and by its trade with other countries, it is able worthily to maintain the life of its citizens.\n50.\tFurthermore, it is also an obvious fact that to achieve a standard of living that is adequate for all members of society, a high degree of economic development is required. Thus we can echo the words of the late President Kennedy that development is another name for freedom. Human rights in their economic and social aspects can be achieved only if high production is combined with just distribution.\n51.\tPresident Figueres of Costa Rica has quite correctly stated:\n\\\"Before the industrial revolution it was inconceivable that there would be sufficient goods and services. Tacitly it was accepted by all except a few reformers that the work of the community could not produce more than was necessary for the welfare of a privileged minority. But today, for the first time in human history, some countries are producing enough for all their citizens. The poor nations, which still constitute the majority of mankind, wish to do the same. They, too, wish to develop.\n\\\"It is in the common interest of all peoples and for the harmony of the human family that these backward nations should be allowed to develop. Economic and social rights cannot be universally exercised until the co-ordinated work of mankind produces sufficient goods and services to meet the needs of all peoples.\\\"\n52.\tFor these economic and social rights to be fully implemented by States, they must possess the enormous financial and technical resources that only development can provide. That is why the under-developed nations cannot make human rights fully effective and why the developing nations must be assisted internationally so that, by accelerating their economic and social growth, they will be in a position to comply with the covenants that they have signed.\n53.\tCosta Rica regrets that the International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex J have not yet been ratified by a sufficient number of countries for them to enter into force. We take advantage of this opportunity respectfully to call on the States that have not yet ratified the Covenants to try to do so as soon as possible.\n54.\tEloquently to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Costa Rica \u2014 which sponsored the draft resolution proposing the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights2 -urges this Assembly and its Third Committee not to continue to postpone the study of this matter and to decide once and for all to give final approval to an important instrument for ensuring co-operation in bringing about respect for human rights.\n55.\tCosta Rica hopes that the United Nations will soon make a reality of the charter on economic rights and duties\n3.\nof States. This initiative, taken by President Echeverrfa of Mexico at the third session of UNCTAD, has the wholehearted support of my delegation because, as the distinguished proponent stated, a just order and a stable world are not possible until obligations and duties are established to protect economically weak States.\n56.\tSuch a charter must include the duty of the industrialized States to give more equitable treatment to the under-developed nations in their trade relations, because trade among the wealthy and the poor nations should be the best instrument for uniform world development. If economic and social rights were universally implemented, one hour of human work done in one country could be exchanged for one hour of human work done in another. This rule \u2014 which, we recognize, is a far-distant target- could nevertheless give many economically backward countries all the income necessary for development.\n57.\tBut against that thesis it will be argued that, in the majority of activities, the yield of one hour of work largely depends on the capital invested in the worker and also on the amount of technology utilized. For example, a good operator with an automatic shovel moves a hundred times Imore earth than a poor worker with a hand shovel; and, therefore, the same payment cannot be given to the skilled worker as to the unskilled labourer.\n58.\tHowever, in the advanced societies salary levels rise without taking the individual yield specifically into account. There are activities in which the man-hour yield has multiplied, such as in the steel industry. But there are other activities in which there has been no increase in man-hour productivity, as in the case of barbers, teachers, or musicians. But the salaries of all have grown more or less uniformly. Obviously, salaries and fees have been related to the increase in the productivity of the economy as a whole. The barber who shaves the mechanic is indirectly producing steel. This is in keeping with the aspirations of States to economic and social rights.\n59.\tIf mankind were integrated the same principle should apply internationally, and although it might appear to be a pipe-dream today, there is no moral reason why the Costa Rican peasant who produces coffee \u2014 on which the mechanic in Detroit breakfasts and then goes to build a truck to transport grain-should earn less \u2014 up to 20 times less \u2014 than his American colleague. The just role should be \\\"equal pay for equal effort\\\".\n60.\tPresident Figueres has pointed out repeatedly that the advanced societies hate even the least vestiges of slave labour, and the minimum wage laws prevent employers from buying cheap labour, even when foreign workers are in abundance. But they do not apply this idea to foreign trade. President Figueres has stated:\n\\\"The efforts of a vast number of workers receiving subsistence payment are purchased by the wealthy nations in the form of raw materials, and particularly\nagricultural materials. Free trade is allowed between private importers who negotiate from a position of strength in a wealthy economy and private exporters who reflect the weakness of a poor nation. Private exporters in a poor country do not feel responsible for the welfare of their people. Their main interest is to maintain the highest possible margin between what they pay national producers or workers and the price they obtain from the foreign importers. As far as they are concerned, exporting is good business at any level of price or salary; and thus, unintentionally, they delay economic development and social improvement\\\".\n61.\tAs long as international trade accentuates the impoverishment of the under-developed nations, it is indispensable that we continue to compensate for the imbalance by means of so-called foreign aid. Even if the terms of trade were to improve, it would still be necessary to give financial assistance to the developing countries to compensate them for the drain on their wealth during centuries of commercial exploitation.\n62.\tIn the First United Nations Development Decade this foreign aid was assessed at about 1 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized nations; but that target was not reached. Now it has been assessed at 0.70 per cent; and yet not even 0.35 per cent has been reached. It should be much higher if we truly wish to bridge the increasing gap between the poor and the wealthy countries.\n63.\tWhat chances are there of increasing foreign aid? That depends on the way in which world peace is strengthened. In point of fact, the national product of a developed country is used to pay three types of expenditure: those required to maintain the rate of development of domestic life; military expenses; and those amounts needed to encourage international development.\n64.\tIn order to increase the amount of any of those categories in any appreciable form, one or both of the others would have to be reduced. What has thus far been\nsacrificed is international development, because, politically, it is the least important. For obvious domestic reasons it is very difficult to reduce expenditures intended to maintain the growth of the standard of living; and for international reasons it has been considered a risk to reduce military expenditures.\n65.\tNevertheless, even though the expectation is not at all realistic, what will have to be reduced some day is, precisely, expenditure on warfare. Now that we -are enjoying the results of a great detente among the superpowers it should be less difficult to reduce military expenditure.\n66.\tAs President Figueres has pointed out,\n'The arithmetic of this affair is almost childish. If we could reduce by one-half the present expenditure on war, there would be a budget left over sufficient to maintain order and to continue the exploration of space, the atom, the sea-bed and the very heart of the earth.\n\\\"If we could cut expenditure on warfare by half, the most developed nations, without sacrificing their standard of living or their rate of growth, could devote the resources thus saved to development abroad. If all nations did likewise, as they should, perhaps in less than a half-century our planet could glory in the flowering of the Great Human Society.\\\"\n67.\tAlthough there remains a long road to travel, the greatness of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sheds its light along the road to progress in this last quarter of the century.\n68.\tThe enjoyment of human rights makes economic and social development an absolute necessity. Development forces us not only to correct the internal causes of poverty in nations, but also to review the entire gamut of economic relationships between the rich countries and the underdeveloped ones.\n69.\tSince it is difficult to change some of those relationships, it becomes necessary, as a substitute therefore, to offer some general compensation over a long period of time in the form of foreign aid. And as President Figueres of Costa Rica has said:\n\\\"Any great increase in foreign aid depends in large measure on the possibility of reducing expenditure for war. This is not at all surprising. Human rights and world peace dwell together in the hearts of men. Together they represent the great goal of the United Nations. Peace helps development. Development engenders peace. Each is a cause and each an effect. They reinforce each other. Their common destiny is the rule of human rights.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSince the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, some notable events have successively taken place on the international arena. First, there was the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam and Laos. Secondly, there were the talks held and the agreements concluded between the two super-Powers-the United States and the Soviet Union. Thirdly, there was the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In. the meantime, the third world has further awakened and grown in strength, and the African, Latin American and non-aligned countries held a series of important international conferences. What is the characteristic of the present world situation? Is the international situation really moving towards a general detente? This is a question in which people are interested. The delegation of the People's Republic of China would like to state its views on this question and a number of other questions with which the current session of the General Assembly is confronted.\n3.\tFirst, what is the characteristic of the present world situation?\nThe Chinese Government has long held that our world is now going through a process of great turbulence, great division and great realignment. The basic contradictions in the world are all sharpening, in particular the contradictions between imperialism and colonialism on the one hand and\nthe oppressed nations and peoples on the other and the contradictions among the imperialist countries, especially those between the two super-Powers. Although no new world war has broken out since the Second World War, local wars resulting from imperialist aggressions have never ceased. The great victory of the heroic Viet-Namese people's war of resistance against United States aggression and for national salvation has once again proved that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. A small nation can defeat a big one and a weak nation can defeat a strong one, so long as they dare to struggle, are good at struggle and persevere in struggle. It is not the people who fear imperialism; it is imperialism which fears the people. Revolution is the main trend in the world today. Now that the war in Viet-Nam has ended, can it be assumed that the world will henceforth be tranquil? Obviously not. When the Korean war was ended in 1953, some people thought that no more gunshots would be heard in the world. Not long afterwards, however, the Suez war broke out and then the Viet-Nam war started. And even today, the war in Indo-China has not stopped completely, for there is still fighting in Cambodia. Tension in the Middle East has not relaxed in the least. The colonialists and racists are carrying out armed suppression against the African people and the African people are developing armed resistance against them. The aggression against, subversion and control of and interference in countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America by the super-Powers are continuing without end. A recent case in point is the military coup d'etat in Chile. President Salvador Allende died a martyr at his post. We express profound condolences on his heroic death. At the same time, we hold one should not forget how harmful the absurd theory of so-called \\\"peaceful transition\\\" is to the anti-imperialism revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African and Latin American people, a theory which has been advocated by another super-Power. The dismemberment of a sovereign country by armed force and the legalization and perpetuation of that division have also become a tendency on the part of the big Powers in their attempt to dominate the world. In the economic field, the gap is widening between the rich and developed countries and the poor and developing countries, and even among the developed countries there exist many contradictions, and hence detente among them is far from being the case. The recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries, held at Algiers, strongly condemned racism, Zionism, colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism and strongly demanded a change in the present state of affairs in the world, demonstrating a further awakening of the Asian, African and Latin American peoples. In a word, we consider that the characteristic of the present situation is one of great disorder throughout the world and not tranquillity. And the main trend amidst this great disorder is that countries want independence, nations want liberation, and the people want revolution. \n\n5.\tSecond, why is there no tranquillity in the world today?\n6.\tWe have always held that all countries in the world, big or small, should be equal; that all countries, irrespective of their social systems, should establish normal State relations on the five principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence; and that international disputes should be settled peacefully on the basis of these principles without resorting to the use or threat of force. This should apply to relations between big Powers, to relations between a big Power and a small country, and all the more so to relations between a strong and a weak, or between a rich and a poor country. It was on these principles that China started to improve its relations with the United States and established diplomatic relations with Japan. In their joint communique issued in Shanghai on 27 February 1972, China and the United States further declared that they should not seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and were opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony. The same principle was reaffirmed in the Sino-Japanese statement of 30 September 1972 on the establishment of mutual diplomatic relations. In our view, the above-mentioned principles are the minimum criteria for the equality of all countries in international relations and indicate the correct way to achieve a relaxation of international tension.\n7.\tAs sovereign States, the United States and the Soviet Union are fully entitled to take the measures they deem appropriate to improve and develop their bilateral relations. However, we cannot but point out that the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War signed by them on 22 June 1973 goes far beyond the scope of bilateral relations. One may ask, Who has given them the right to enter into what they call \\\"urgent consultations\\\" in case of a dispute between either of the parties and other countries and even between any other two countries? The phrase about disputes which \\\"appear to involve the risk of nuclear conflict\\\" is open to any interpretation, and their so-called \\\"urgent consultations\\\" are bound to be followed by actions dictated by their own interests. Does not this mean that they may interfere at will in the relations among all countries on the strength of the huge numbers of nuclear weapons in their possession? China absolutely will not go begging for nuclear protection from any country, nor is she afraid of nuclear threat from any country. But we feel in duty bound to state our views on this matter since it concerns all the people of the world.\n8.\tThe signing of such an agreement by the Soviet Union and the United States is by no means accidental, but is derived from the so-called principle which they agreed upon in 1972 that the Soviet Union and the United States have \\\"security interests. . . based on the principle of equality\\\". What is meant by \\\"security interests.. . based on the principle of equality\\\"? To put it bluntly, it means rivalry for world hegemony \u2014 wherever one goes, the other will do the same. What they are doing now is simply to wrap up this content in the form of an agreement.\n9.\tIn fact, this Agreement is a mere scrap of paper. It contains no explicit undertaking on the non-use of nuclear weapons; still less does it envisage the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The United States Government was more frank when it stated that the Agreement is only a general statement of policy which does not involve any particular positive actions that either side has to take, and pointed out that agreements are not always maintained and there is nothing self-enforcing about this document.\n10.\tHowever, the Soviet leaders have made a great fanfare, lauding that Agreement to the skies, alleging that it ushered in \\\"a new era\\\" in international relations and opened up \\\"historical vistas for strengthening universal security as a whole,\\\" and that it was \\\"indeed of historic importance for all mankind\\\". They have their motives for so eulogizing the Agreement. One may recall Khrushchev's famous remarks: \\\"Even a tiny spark can cause a world conflagration\\\" and \\\"We\\\" \u2014 that is, the Soviet Union and the United States-\\\"are the strongest countries in the world, and if we unite for peace there can be no war. Then if any madman wanted war, we would but have to shake our fingers to warn him off.\\\" In this way, if the Soviet Union could be bound together with the United States, would not the whole world have to cringe to them? However, in our view, things may not necessarily turn out that way.\n11.\tIt is not so easy for the Soviet Union to bind itself to the United States. Shortly after the signing of the Agreement, the Soviet Union pressed forward with its underground nuclear tests and hastened the development of missiles with multiple warheads. The United States will not take this lying down. Why? Because the desperate struggle for nuclear superiority and world hegemony still goes on. The contention between the Soviet Union and the United States now extends all over the world. A vivid proof can be found in the recent subversion of a government in Asia and another in South America. Their scramble is becoming increasingly fierce. That is the reason why there is no tranquillity in the world today. So, what peaceful coexistence is there to speak of? There is. only a travesty of peaceful coexistence; the substance is coexistence in rivalry. But whether such coexistence can last is, of course, another question.\n12.\tThe Soviet leaders noisily proclaim that as a \\\"socialist\\\" State the Soviet Union is the \\\"natural and surest ally\\\" of the developing countries. In the past, some people in China also believed this, because they saw the Soviet Union as the homeland of the great Lenin and the Chinese revolution, a continuation of the October Revolution. Therefore, how could the Soviet Union, as a socialist State, fail to give the developing countries whole-hearted internationalist assistance? But since Khrushchev rose to power, we came to realize, thanks to the long and direct experience we had gained as a result of the Soviet Union's demand for the establishment of a joint fleet in the China Sea, its withdrawal of experts, its tearing up of contracts, border intrusions, subversions, and so on, that this was not the case, and that what the Soviet Union practised was not internationalism but great-Power chauvinism, national egoism and territorial expansionism. Therefore we will not blame those friends who have so far failed to see this for lack of experience. How can a socialist turn into an imperialist? There is in fact nothing strange about it if one goes a little into the history of the international Communist movement. Was not Karl Kautsky once a somewhat well-known Marxist? But he later betrayed Marxism and capitulated to imperialism. It was Lenin who passed the final historical verdict on Kautsky in his well-known pamphlet Trie Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky.  People can change; so can a State. It has changed, and what can one do about it?\n13.\tLenin pointed out on one occasion: \\\"We judge a person not by what he says or thinks of himself but by his actions.\\\" That applies to a State as well. What has the Soviet Government done to other countries in these years? This is clear to the broad masses of the people of Czechoslovakia, Egypt and Pakistan, to the peoples of Cambodia who are fighting dauntlessly, and to other peoples who have been subjected to its aggression, subversion, control, interference or bullying. The actions of the Soviet Government have amply shown that it is \\\"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\\\", as Lenin said.\n14.\tThe Soviet-United States Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War cannot hoodwink many people or intimidate the peoples of the world, but can only arouse indignation, misgivings and disillusionment. The tide is mounting against the hegemonism and power politics practised by the super-Powers.\n15.\tThird, who is really against detente?\n16.\tShortly after the war in Viet-Nam came to an end, the United States Government pronounced 1973 to be \\\"the year of Europe\\\". That was followed by the first stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \u2014 a conference advocated by the Soviet Government for many years. All this indicates that Europe is the focus of contention between the two super-Powers \u2014 the United States and the Soviet Union \u2014 and that the so-called European Security Conference is nothing but one of the forms of contention. Its proceedings showed, however, that it went far beyond the scope to which the two superpowers wished to confine it. At that Conference many countries stated pointedly that deeds and not empty promises are called for in the matter of security; that European security must be based on the safeguarding of national independence and sovereignty; that one must not become mentally disarmed and off guard simply because the European Security Conference has taken place; and that in order to guarantee European security, military blocs must be disbanded, foreign military bases dismantled, and foreign troops withdrawn, so that the relations between European countries may be established on the principles of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, complete equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.\n17.\tMoreover, some countries pointed out that the security of the Mediterranean and the security of Europe\n\nwere inseparable and that there could be no security for Europe when the Mediterranean is under the armed threat of, and contention by, the two super-Powers. All this is tantamount to a direct blow at those who seek by means of this Conference to consolidate the occupation of many European countries which resulted from the Second World War or the events thereafter, and to proceed further to disintegrate Western Europe and dominate the whole of Europe. The European Security Conference is still going on; but, judging from the proceedings of its first stage, it will further expose the ambitions of that super-Power which seeks to divide and disintegrate Western Europe.\n18.\tWhile stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and its world-wide contention with the United States for spheres of influence, the Soviet Union is clamouring for \\\"spreading the zone of relaxation to the whole world\\\". Accordingly, it has lately picked up once again the long-ignored trash known as the Asian Collective Security System. This is most amusing. It reminds us of the American by the name of John Foster Dulles, who, after the war in Indo-China was brought to an end by the first Geneva Conference in 1954,  hastily rigged up the so-called South-East Asia Treaty Organization, which was directed against China and whose members were mostly non-Southeast Asian countries. The Soviet Union is a European country and the chief of the alliance deriving from the Warsaw Treaty. Why should it be so eagerly concerned about the \\\"collective security\\\" of Asian countries? Has the ghost of John Foster Dulles gone to the Kremlin? Actually, would it not be less devious and more direct simply to extend the Warsaw Treaty to Asia?\n19.\tLately, the Soviet leaders have tried to pin an additional label on China, namely \\\"opponent of detente\\\". As the Chinese saying goes, this is putting Mr. Chang's hat on Mr. Li's head. Since you say you are so anxious to relax world tension, why do you not show your good faith by doing a thing or two \u2014 for instance, by withdrawing your armed forces from Czechoslovakia or the Mongolian People's Republic and by returning the four northern islands to Japan?\n20.\tWe hold that imperialism means war. There is a danger of war so long as imperialism exists. Today, when the various types of basic contradictions in the world are sharpening, the danger of a new world war still exists, and the people of all countries must be prepared, and must not let themselves be misled by a temporary and superficial facade of detente. Only thus can we better strive for a bright future for the world. In the final analysis, the destiny of mankind is decided by the people in their hundreds of millions who persevere in struggle and unity, and not by the one or two super-Powers.\n21.\tFourth, there is the Cambodian question.\n22.\tThe Chinese Government resolutely denounces the United States Government for continuing to support in various ways the puppet regime in Phnom Penh and wantonly to interfere in the affairs of Cambodia. The regime of the traitorous Lon Nol clique, which is now installed in Phnom Penh, was imposed on the Khmer people by the United States imperialists and their allies and has been illegal from its very inception. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of the head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, is the sole legal government of Cambodia. The People's Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia under its leadership have liberated over 90 per cent of Cambodia's territory, with over 80 per cent of the population. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia has been recognized by nearly 50 countries. The participants at the recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, which met in September at Algiers, have declared that the Royal Government of National Union under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk is the only legal government of Cambodia and earnestly requested all countries which love peace and justice to give it formal recognition [see A/9330, p. 12]. This is a voice of justice. The Chinese Government holds that the continued usurpation by the traitorous Lon Nol clique of the seat in the United Nations is a contempt for all countries that uphold justice, for the Fourth Conference and for the United Nations itself. The Chinese Government firmly maintains that the present session of the General Assembly should take a decision immediately to expel the representatives of the traitorous Lon Nol clique from the United Nations and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of the head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, its rightful seat in the United Nations.\n23.\tFifth, I turn now to the Korean question.\n24.\tThere are now before the General Assembly two draft resolutions on the Korean question \u2014 one sponsored by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and other countries [A/C.1/L.645], the other sponsored by Algeria, China and other countries [A/C.1IL.644 and Corr.l]. Regarding the former draft resolution, the Chinese Government considers that the position for retaining the United Nations Command and the United States forces in South Korea and for the entry of both North and South Korea into the United Nations is unreasonable and contrary to the joint communiqu\u00e9 of North and South Korea issued on 4 July 1972,  although it contains the positive element of dissolving the so-called \\\"United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea\\\".\n25.\tThe withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question are long overdue. According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953,  a high-level political conference for the settlement of the Korean question ought to have met within three months after the Armistice Agreement became effective. The conference was not held only because of the obstructions put up by the United States side at the time. Subsequently, the question was again discussed at the 1954 Korean Political Conference in Geneva. The then United States Secretary of State, Mr. John Foster Dulles, peremptorily rejected all reasonable proposals, thereby blocking once again a solution to the question of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. The United States was then absolutely unwilling to withdraw its forces from South Korea.\n26.\tWhat could be done about it? Well, if you would not withdraw, we would.\n27.\tIn 1958 the Chinese People's Volunteers unilaterally and unconditionally withdrew from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Consequently, there are no foreign forces on one side in Korea, while large numbers of foreign forces, mainly United States forces, are stationed on the other side. This most unreasonable state of affairs cannot but constitute an obstacle to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n28.\tIs South Korea so lacking in national self-respect that it must rely on the support of foreign forces? Obviously, such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated by the people in South Korea. Subsequently, thanks to the initiative of President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a joint communiqu\u00e9 of North and South Korea on the independent and peaceful reunification of the country was issued on 4 July 1972, leading to the start of a dialogue between the North and the South. This was a big step towards the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the problem of the reunification of Korea by the Koreans themselves. With the issuance of this communiqu\u00e9, the Korean Armistice Agreement, signed 19 years ago, to a great extent ceased to play the role it once had. The Koreans in the North and the South have themselves agreed upon refraining from committing armed provocations, big or small, and upon taking active measures for preventing incidents of unexpected military conflicts. Is this not the best guarantee for the maintenance of the armistice?\n29.\tIt is captious to say that the dissolution of the United Nations Command and the withdrawal of foreign forces would nullify the 1953 Armistice Agreement. It should be recalled that the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the one hand and the United Nations Command on the other. According to that kind of reasoning, would not the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers mean that the Korean Armistice Agreement had long been nullified? Since the Chinese People's Volunteers could withdraw from Korea, why cannot the foreign forces in South Korea under the signboard of the United Nations Command do the same?\n30.\tThe continued presence of the so-called United Nations Command and of foreign forces in South Korea is at variance with the principles agreed on by the two sides in Korea on 4 July 1972 that \\\"unification shall be achieved through independent Korean efforts without being subject to external imposition or interference\\\". In point of fact, it is the very presence of this outside force that has emboldened the South Korean authorities to reject a number of reasonable proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, thus causing the dialogue between the North and the South to bog down. The Kim Dae Jung incident which occurred not long ago\nhas shown how abjectly the South Korean authorities depend upon foreign forces. In order that conditions may be created to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, the United Nations Command should agree to disband, and all foreign forces stationed in South Korea should agree to withdraw.\n31.\tAs for the entry of both North and South Korea into the United Nations, this is plainly an attempt to legalize and perpetuate the division of Korea, which runs counter to the principle agreed upon between the North and the South that has a homogenous people, a great national unity shall be sought, above all as one nation, transcending differences in ideas, ideologies and systems\\\". In his five propositions put forward on 23 June of this year [see A/9027, para. 19], President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has pointed out that the North and the South should not enter the United Nations separately and that if they want to enter the United Nations before the reunification of the country is achieved, they should enter it as one State, at least, under the name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo after the Confederation is enforced. This proposition is entirely reasonable and merits the sympathy and support of all countries that uphold justice.\n32.\tSixth, there is the question of Bangladesh.\n33.\tAt the time of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly in 1971, the Soviet Union supported India in\n dismembering Pakistan by armed force. The General Assembly and then the Security Council adopted resolutions by overwhelming majorities calling for cease-fire, troop withdrawal and the repatriation of the prisoners of war by India and Pakistan f General Assembly resolution 2793 (XXVI) and Security Council resolution 307 (1971)]. At its twenty-seventh session, in 1972, the General Assembly further adopted two interdependent resolutions calling for the repatriation of Pakistan prisoners of war and expressing the desire for the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations [resolutions 2938 and 2937 (XXVII)].\n34.\tIt was not until 28 August of this year that an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and civilians was reached between India and Pakistan at New Delhi. This agreement has come much too late, but its ultimate conclusion is to be welcomed. The agreement reached is on paper, and there will have to be a process before it can be turned into reality. Complications may yet arise. The Chinese Government holds that the question of admitting Bangladesh to the United Nations can be considered once the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are implemented without qualification. But this can be done only after the thorough implementation of the United Nations resolutions, and definitely not before.\n35.\tSeventh, there is the Middle East question.\n36.\tAlthough the two super-Powers are both trumpeting about a general world trend towards detente, a tense stalemate of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" still prevails in the Middle East. When the Soviet Union dismembered Pakistan in 1971, no one said there was the risk of a nuclear war. Neither has anyone made a similar warning in connexion\nwith the current United States intervention in Cambodia. It is only in the Middle East that, at the mention of an attempt by Arab countries to repulse Israeli aggression and recover their lost territories, the air is filled with cries about a risk of nuclear war between the two super-Powers. Why is this so? Because the situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" created and maintained by the two super-Powers serves them best in their scramble for spheres of influence, oil resources and strategic positions in the Middle East. In. appearance the two super-Powers are each supporting one of the antagonistic sides, but in essence they are like two clay figurines which have been kneaded together and then remoulded, so that there is something of each in the other. Take the case of the aggressor Israel. Could Israel be so unbridled in its truculence if it received only supplies of American weapons but none of Soviet manpower? In our opinion, the so-called risk of a nuclear war has been deliberately fabricated to scare people. It is futile to count on the super-Powers to bring about a settlement of the Middle East question. Nor will the situation be changed by any resolution adopted by the United Nations. The only way out is to act independently and rely on one's own efforts. China has never had anything to do with the Israeli Zionists. China firmly supports the Palestinian and other Arab peoples in their just struggle against Israeli zionism. We believe that so long as they uphold unity and persevere in struggle, the Palestinian and other Arab peoples, with the support of the people of the whole world, will certainly surmount all the difficulties on their road of advance, recover their sacred territories and regain their national rights.\n37.\tEighth, there is the question of opposing colonialism.\n38.\tAn excellent situation prevails in Africa. In the past year, the African people have achieved a series of new victories in their struggle to win and safeguard their national independence and to oppose racism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism. Through their struggle they have come to realize more and more the necessity of armed struggle and mutual support. The Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], at its tenth ordinary session held last May in Addis Ababa, issued the resounding call to \\\"eliminate all forms of colonialism on the African continent\\\". The conference documents fully manifested the unity and co-operation of the African countries and their militancy against the common enemies, as well as the determination of the African people in the territories which have not yet become independent to expand their armed struggle for national liberation. With imperialist and superpower support and connivance, the racist regimes and colonialist authorities in Africa are resorting to more insidious and brutal means in their desperate struggle to buttress their tottering rule. They have long refused to implement the United Nations resolutions which reflect the just demands of the African people. What deserves special attention is that while the old-line colonialists are on the decline, neo-colonialists of different shades are trying to take their place by means of cunning and deceptive manoeuvres. The super-Powers are sowing dissension among the African countries so as to fish in troubled waters. The African people are still faced with the task of a protracted, complicated and tortuous struggle. Africa belongs to the great African people. The Chinese people stand firmly by the African people. We resolutely support the peoples of Mozambique, Angola, Azania, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau, Spanish Sahara and other regions in their just struggle for national liberation. We warmly hail and give recognition to the new-born Republic of Guinea- Bissau. We resolutely support the just struggles of all African countries against aggression, subversion and the sowing of discord by colonialism and neo-colonialism and in defence of State sovereignty and African unity. We are confident that the awakening African people will continue to win new victories in the course of their coming struggle.\n39.\tNinth, there is the question of opposing maritime hegemony.\n40.\tThe determined struggle for the recognition of maritime rights in a zone of 200 nautical miles initiated by Latin American countries has won increasing support among the numerous small and medium-sized countries. Both the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held earlier this year, expressly declared that a coastal State is entitled to establish an exclusive economic zone or a zone of national jurisdiction with the maximum limit of 200 nautical miles. And land-locked States are also entitled to share sea-bed and fishery resources. On this problem of maritime rights, the numerous small and medium-sized countries are waging a gigantic and vigorous struggle against the maritime hegemony of the super-Powers. With a view to seeking hegemony on the seas and oceans, the super-Powers are trying in vain to preserve the outdated law of the sea and are doing their utmost to restrict the territorial sea and scope of jurisdiction of all countries. They insist that the three-nautical-mile or 12-nautical-mile rule for the territorial sea is sacred and inviolable, arguing that the expansion of the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction will narrow down the open sea. This is a bluff. What sacredness and inviolability! The three-nautical-mile rule was a man- made stipulation, and so was the 12-nautical mile rule. Both rules reflect the reality of the time when the seas and oceans were controlled by colonialism and imperialism. What is there that is so sacred and inviolable? As to the assertion that the larger the territorial seas and the zones of jurisdiction, the smaller the open sea, the question must be asked, What is the open sea? The so-called \\\"open sea\\\" has, in fact, always been the \\\"private sea\\\" of a few strong naval Powers. The numerous small and medium-sized countries have now stood up; they constitute the majority and demand a change in the so-called law of the sea, which is advantageous only to the imperialists. What fault can-one find with this? In a proposal submitted by the Soviet Union and its allies to the United Nations Industrial Development Board on 2 June 1972, they said that \\\"the sovereignty over the natural resources is depending to a great extent upon the capability of utilizing these resources by the industry of the developing countries .. '.\\\". \n41.\tAt the 101st meeting of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction held in Geneva on 22 August 1973, a Soviet representative said that the developing countries could not increase their catch even if they had a 200-nautical-mile zone, because they lacked the technical know-how, fishing capacity, and so forth. These statements simply mean that the greater the might, the greater the right. This is the logic of imperialism, pure and simple. Why are the super-Powers so violently opposed to the position of the small and medium-sized countries for enlarging the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction? It is not difficult to see the underlying motive if only one takes a look at the contention between the United States and the Soviet Union for maritime hegemony in the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean and their rivalry in setting up bases and plundering the fishing and sea-bed resources there. When the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction are enlarged, their \\\"private sea\\\" over which they act the overlords will contract. How can the super-Powers not desperately oppose this? However, their opposition will eventually prove futile. So long as the numerous small and medium-sized countries are united by seeking common ground on major points, while reserving differences on minor ones, and persevere in tenacious and protracted efforts, their struggle against maritime hegemony is bound to triumph.\n42.\tThe struggle against maritime hegemony is an important aspect of the struggle waged by the numerous developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America to protect national resources and develop the national economy. It is also a new focus in the current struggle against hegemonism. In other economic spheres, the developing countries are also more closely co-ordinating their actions and strengthening their unity in the struggle against exploitation, plunder, dumping and monopoly by imperialism and big-Power hegemonism. The bilateral and regional economic co-operation of the developing countries is growing, and the various organizations of raw-material- exporting countries are expanding. More and more developing countries have come to realize that, in order to consolidate political independence, it is imperative to attain economic independence, and that in order to develop the national economy, it is imperative to rely on their own efforts and strengthen their mutual support and cooperation. It was by plundering and exploiting the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America that colonialism and imperialism accumulated their fortunes. Therefore, the people of these continents are fully entitled to demand repayment of this debt. However, in the light of China's own experience, colonialism and imperialism will never repay the debt and, what is more, they will create more difficulties for those countries which are defending their national independence and developing their national economy. It is futile to harbour any unrealistic notions about .them. We must persist in opposing imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism. We must rely on ourselves, rely on the people, wage an arduous struggle and exert sustained efforts. We believe that, by so doing, the developing countries will certainly become prosperous.\n43.\tTenth, there is the question of disarmament.\n44.\tThe Chinese Government has always stood for disarmament. But what we stand for is genuine disarmament, not phoney disarmament; still less empty talk about disarmament coupled with actual arms expansion every day. At present, we face the harsh fact that the super-Powers are hawking disarmament, and the Soviet Union in particular is most energetic about it. Nearly every year it comes up with some sort of proposal on disarmament at the General Assembly. Last year, it boasted of the great significance of its agreement with the United States on the so-called limitation of strategic nuclear weapons. And this year, it is even more vehement in lauding the so-called epoch-making significance of the Soviet-United States Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. Meanwhile, it has sanctimoniously proposed a 10 per cent reduction of the military budgets of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [2124th meeting]. This is Krushchev's old war which has been peddled for more than a dozen years. It has not deceived many people. How are military budgets to be assessed? To study this problem alone, a committee will have to be set up and work for many years. Can military budgets really be reduced? Anyway, nobody has ever seen this happen. We think it is better to stop this kind of empty talk, and stop it quickly. If you are really the \\\"natural and surest ally\\\" of the developing countries you should come up to this rostrum and declare openly that your military aid to all developing countries which is used to resist foreign aggression is gratis and free of charge, that you will not be a merchant of death, and that, although you have charged previously, you will not press for the payment of debt and interest, especially in the case of the struggling Arab countries. Be forthright and simple. Declare publicly that you will cancel all the military loans, that there is no need for repayment and that you will let them be gone with the wind. Would not that be more practical?\n45.\tWhat general disarmament? Actually, in the world today, it is the two super-Powers that are engaged in an uncontrollable arms race. Their aim is nuclear superiority and the nuclear hegemony with which to dominate the world. To put it bluntly, any disarmament must first of all be the disarming of these two super-Powers. But can this be realized? On this point, the United States Government is somewhat more candid than is the Soviet Government. It admits that military expenditures cannot be reduced in the context of rivalry between the two hegemonic Powers. As to the numerous small and medium-sized countries, the real problem they face is definitely not disarmament, but the strengthening of their necessary and independent defence capabilities. Even Western Europe is inadequate in defence capabilities. How much more so are the large number of small and medium-sized countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America? What have these countries got to disarm? To talk about general disarmament in these circumstances is gibberish. If such proposals were really accepted, it would mean to ask the whole world completely to disarm itself in front of the two super-Powers and allow itself to be ordered about.\n46.\tThe Chinese Government is in favour of convening a world conference on genuine disarmament. But there must be the necessary pre-conditions and clear aims for the conference. That is, all nuclear countries, and particularly the two nuclear super-Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons, particularly against non-nuclear countries and in nuclear-weapon-free zones. For example, the Soviet Union should undertake obligations in respect of the nuclear-weapon-free zones in Latin America, and they must withdraw from abroad all their armed forces, including nuclear missile forces, and dismantle all their military bases, including nuclear bases, on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible for all countries big and small to discuss on an equal footing and with equanimity and to solve the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and other questions free from any threat of force.\n47.\tSome people charge that China's position on the disarmament question is \\\"either all or nothing\\\". This is a distortion. One may ask, What difficulties are there for nuclear countries first of all to undertake the obligation, as the first step towards nuclear disarmament, that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons, particularly against non-nuclear countries or in nuclear-weapon-free zones? Is this not a truly effective first step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons? But these disarmament- advocating \\\"saints\\\" would not even agree to undertake this minimum obligation. Does this not suffice to show that they are actually imperialists who persist in arms expansion and aggression, menacing the people of the world and aspiring to world hegemony?\n48.\tThe People's Republic of China is taking part in the activities of the United Nations for the third year. We wish to say frankly that what we have experienced in the United Nations has caused us to become worried. Speeches are multiplying and resolutions are piling up in the United Nations, yet the Organization has not been able to look into matters which it ought to \u2014 for instance, the question of the prevention of nuclear war \u2014 and it is impotent in the solution of many major world issues \u2014 for instance, the Middle East question. If things continue this way, what future is there for the United Nations? However, we are not disheartened. We believe that the present conditions in the United Nations should be changed and that the Charter should be revised. How can the United Nations go on working in the same old way it did more than 20 years ago, when the world has already changed? The third world has risen up. The United Nations must be able to give expression to the desires of the numerous small and medium-sized countries, truly to give effect to the principle of the equality of all countries big or small and to cease to be controlled by the super-Powers and their small number of followers if it is to be worthy of its name. China is ready to work together with all countries which love peace and uphold justice for the achievement of this noble aim."

        "file_text": "\ufeff147.\t Mr. President, I should like once more to extend my sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session and to express my conviction that under your able leadership the session will be an active and a fruitful one.\n148.\tI take this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of our Organization, our respect and gratitude for the useful work he has done during the period between the twenty-seventh and twenty- eighth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.\n149.\tIt would be no exaggeration to say that the past year will go down in history as one marking a turning point in international relations, a year of transition from a state of cold war to an expansion and consolidation of the process of peaceful coexistence between the world's two socio-political systems. Everyone is familiar with the recent events which gave the impetus and were especially helpful in bringing about a long-term detente in the international situation.\n150.\tParticularly important among these events were the meetings held by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with President Richard Nixon of the United States of America, Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany and President Georges Pompidou of France. The splendid results of these meetings are the fruit of mutual goodwill and realism. At the same time, they mark a great success for the Soviet Union's peace-loving Leninist foreign policy, which was expressed in the Peace Programme adopted at the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n151.\tI should like especially to emphasize how important the Bulgarian Government and all our people consider the favourable changes in Soviet-United States relations. These new relations will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the entire international situation. We must stress the extraordinary importance of the conclusion on 22 June 1973 of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, which will create the genuine conditions for saving mankind from the spectre of nuclear disaster.\n152.\tWe are gratified to note the improvement in the European political climate. The results of the constant efforts exerted for many years by the socialist countries, including the People's Republic of Bulgaria, fill us with deep satisfaction. The second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began just a few days ago. That Conference opens prospects for transforming the old continent into a zone of peace and mutually beneficial co-operation based on universal recognition of and respect for the existing territorial and political realities. We are fully aware of the difficulties that remain to be overcome before the fundamental purposes of the Conference can be achieved.\n153.\tTrue mutual understanding and co-operation are possible only on the basis of mutual respect and observance of the domestic laws and regulations of each country.\n154.\tThe history of the recent past has shown that attempts to meddle in the internal affairs of States are doomed to failure. But it must be borne in mind that such attempts have hindered the process through which relations\nof peace, security, trust and co-operation are being built.\n155.\tWe believe that all the participating countries will approach the historic tasks of the European Conference with the proper sense of responsibility and that the Conference will be completely successful.\n156.\tAmong the main factors characterizing the new and favourable situation in the world, we should mention also the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam. Mankind breathed a sigh of relief when that cruel blood-bath came to an end. The Viet-Namese people won a magnificent victory and gained recognition of its right to solve its own problems and determine its own future. The establishment of a stable peace in Viet-Nam requires strict observance of the Paris agreements by the countries involved.\n157.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria, fulfilling its international duty, will continue, as in the past, to furnish assistance of every kind to the fraternal Viet-Namese people in its efforts to wipe out the after-effects of the war.\n158.\tSocialist Bulgaria and the entire Bulgarian people are determined to support the strengthening and further development of the trend towards the relaxation of international tension in Europe and throughout the world. \\\"The Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Republic of Bulgaria,\\\" said Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of our Party and Chairman of the Council of State, in a recent statement, \\\"regard it as their national and international duty to continue to help actively to promote the process of improvement in present-day international relations\\\".\n159.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria has always attached the highest importance to its relations with neighbouring countries and has co-operated in the favourable development of such relations. Politically, the Balkan peninsula is a microcosm in which the two socio-economic systems live side by side. Part of the line separating NATO and the Warsaw Pact runs through the Balkans. This complicated situation helps us to appreciate even better the successes of recent years in advancing towards detente and towards the broadening of peaceful co-operation between the Balkan peoples.\n160.\tBulgaria will continue to pursue with the same steadfastness and consistency an active and constructive policy aimed at transforming the Balkans into a model of the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social structures, into a zone of stable peace and co-operation.\n161.\tThe change in the world political climate did not come about by itself and is not the result of some fortuitous confluence of circumstances. The confirmation of the successes already achieved will undoubtedly require a great deal of determined effort. There have, of course, always been some forces-and they undoubtedly exist today-which are not interested in establishing a stable peace and in strengthening friendship and mutual understanding between peoples. It would be naive to expect that those who have incited and supported the policy of the \\\"cold war\\\" and stockpiled weapons for many years will now reconcile themselves to the positive changes that have taken place in the world.\n162.\tThe forces of international reaction also seek and find support among other forces actively opposing detente. They talk, without any justification whatever, of a \\\"nuclear diktat\\\" of the so-called super-Powers which are allegedly conspiring at the expense of other countries' interests. They are making an obvious attempt to sow doubts about the motives and objectives of the peace-loving policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the other countries of the socialist community, especially among small and medium-sized States, among countries struggling to consolidate their independence and to achieve economic and social progress, and also among the forces of the national liberation movements. They cast doubt even on the usefulness of the policy of peaceful coexistence, the principles of which underlie the Charter of our Organization.\n163.\tWe are confident that the facts will continue in the future, as in the past, to refute and expose the groundless \\\"theories\\\" of the partisans of cold war and international tension.\n164.\tThe logic of events confirms that each people striving to build a happy future for itself and earnestly desiring the same for other peoples, and each State, whether large or small, can only benefit from a general improvement in the international atmosphere. That is why we are particularly gratified to note the results of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States, held at Algiers in September 1973. In addition to important and useful decisions on individual practical problems of the present day, the Algiers Conference expressed support for the policy of detente and recognized the truth that the policy of peaceful coexistence is in the interest of all peoples and of peace throughout the world.\n165.\tWe are firmly convinced that peace and international security will continue to grow stronger. This conclusion depends upon and accords with the objective fact of today's world and the balance which has already shifted in favour of the forces of peace and international understanding. It is this prospect that the countries of the socialist community, including the People's Republic of Bulgaria, are actively working and struggling for, together with all of the world's peace-loving forces.\n166.\tWe share the conviction, expressed by other speakers, that the main task today is that all countries and all people of goodwill throughout the world should do everything in their power to make the trend towards peace and international co-operation an irreversible one. Now, more than ever, the United Nations has the mission of promoting the fulfilment of that task.\n167.\tThe danger of a resurgence of old evils is not precluded of course. The need for an active struggle and for resistance against the forces attempting to halt social progress and the free and independent development of peoples is demonstrated by recent events in Chile.\n168.\tWorld public opinion has reacted with concern and indignation to the actions of reactionary forces in Chile, which forcibly overthrew the legitimate Government of National Unity and brought about the death of President Salvador Allende, a valiant fighter for the just cause of the Chilean people and world peace.\n169.\tThe Bulgarian people wishes to express its fraternal solidarity with the Chilean people's struggle in defence of its right to develop along the path of national independence and social progress. We vigorously condemn the brutality of the reactionary forces against the best sons of the Chilean people, and we express our firm conviction that the final victory will belong to the working class, the labouring people of Chile.\n170.\tA glance at the agenda of this session is enough for us to realize how broad are the opportunities for our Organization to make a real contribution to the cause of further improving the world situation and carrying' out the fundamental task of the United Nations, which is to strengthen international peace and security. The most urgent question in this sphere concerns the peaceful settlement of the Middle Eastern conflict.\n171.\tThe situation in the Middle East still contains the lurking danger of a new explosion. The aggressive and adventuristic policy of the Israeli ruling circles is an ever-growing danger to peace in that region, which is our near neighbour. The key issue in the settlement of the Middle Eastern problem continues to be that of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967. It is the duty of our Organization to continue our active search for effective means to implement the well-known decisions of the Security Council.\n172.\tThe Bulgarian people and its Government will continue to give their full support to the Arab peoples in their just struggle for the restoration of the territories seized by Israel and for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of respect for the rights and interests of all the peoples of the region, including the Arab people of Palestine.\n173.\tThe United Nations can and must help to remove another constant source of tension and conflict, namely, .colonialism. Through the joint efforts of all peace-loving peoples, our Organization must become even more active in helping to eliminate this shameful phenomenon of our age, which flagrantly violates not only the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law but also the concepts of elementary justice and morality.\n174.\tThe events of the past year give us reason to view the possibility of a settlement of the Korean question with some optimism. It is long past time to remove the surviving anachronisms and give the Koreans in both parts of the peninsula an opportunity to solve their own problems without outside interference. The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the efforts of the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of the country and cannot but oppose any proposals that might interfere with the attainment of that goal.\n175.\tAn encouraging development in the field of disarmament is represented by the opening of the second stage of strategic arms limitations talks and the signing on 21 June 1973 of a document on basic principles of negotiations on the further limitation of strategic offensive arms by the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Talks will shortly begin on the reduction of arms and armed forces in central Europe, one of the most sensitive spots on the globe. Now it is time for an over-all settlement of the problem of nuclear weapons tests, with a view to extending the nuclear test ban to all environments and all nuclear States.\n176.\tIt is our firm conviction that a significant impetus for the solution of the complicated problems of disarmament could be given by the convening of a world disarmament conference, in which all countries, large and small, nuclear and non-nuclear, would participate on a basis of equality. Those States which try to hinder the implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolution, 2930 (XXVII), and the preparations for such a conference must bear a heavy responsibility. For that reason we believe that at the present session the General Assembly must take decisions which will make it possible to proceed immediately to practical preparations in order that a world conference may be convened in the near future. A similar appeal was made by the non-aligned countries meeting at Algiers.\n177.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria believes that the Security Council would be doing a great service in the cause of peace and the security of peoples if it accelerated the practical implementation of the solemn declaration on the non-use of nuclear weapons, adopted last year at the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  Only four countries voted against that declaration, and there cannot be any justification for delaying compliance with the recommendation of the General Assembly.\n178.\tThe strengthening of trust among States and the related possibility of implementing new measures in the field of disarmament offer prospects for freeing considerable human and material resources for the solution of the important and complicated economic and social problems confronting mankind. The new situation is unquestionably favourable for the elimination of fundamental obstacles that still hold back the normal development of international economic relations and for overcoming the economic and social lag of the developing countries and eliminating the unemployment and mass poverty that afflict millions of people in various parts of the globe.\n179.\tWe welcome with great satisfaction the new initiative of the Soviet Union concerning \\\"Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the use of part of the funds thus saved for the providing of assistance to developing countries\\\" [2126th meeting] and also the appeal for reducing the military budgets of other States, particularly States with vast economic and military potential.\n180.\tThe significance and scope of this proposal are not hard to appreciate if we consider that in recent years the world's military expenditures have amounted to approximately $200,000 million per year.\n181.\tThe merits of the measure proposed by the Soviet Union lie in the fact that it is clear, specific and feasible if the countries concerned are prepared to implement it. The peoples of the States participating in the budget reductions would also gain thereby. The developing countries would receive considerable additional assistance. The process of detente would be given a further strong impetus, and opportunities would be opened for further effective measures in the disarmament field. For that reason, we support the inclusion of the new item 102 in the agenda of the current session and will co-operate in every way to help achieve the goals set out in it.\n182. The new period in international relations offers the United Nations broad possibilities for realizing its full potential, as laid down in the Charter 28 years ago. Whether the United Nations will be equal to the demands of today will depend on what its Members actually do to convert the present favourable trends in the world into a permanent factor of contemporary international life."

        "file_text": "\ufeff118.\tMr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join with my colleagues in congratulating you on your high office. Ecuador will rightly feel a reflected glory.\n119.\tSir, I have spoken on many occasions in this Assembly and have usually felt it right to deal with the main topical and urgent issues in the field of international affairs. I do not intend to do this today. Many of them, it is true, remain as difficult and contentious as ever, but they will feature on the agenda of the various Committees of this Assembly and the views of the British Government will be explained when they come up for discussion. All of them should be soluble by patient bilateral diplomacy, assisted as the need arises \u2014 and it arises more often day by day-by the conciliation machinery of this United Nations organization for conciliation. This must be the order of the day in the middle of this twentieth century. Now, however, I wish to concentrate only on two major long-term problems in the world, both profound and in the long run decisive in terms of what I shall call in shorthand the problems between East and West and North and South.\n120.\tThe first duty laid upon the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. We have had a deeply troubled century. Twenty-one years after the First World War the world was just beginning to recover from the appalling carnage when it all started all over again. It is now 28 years since the ending of the Second World War. So far we have avoided a global holocaust, although at all times the situation has been saved only by knife-edge diplomacy. But there are signs at long last that we are just starting to learn. Whether peace has been forced upon us by the realization of the ultimate horror of the nuclear weapon, or whether the miseries of two world wars have taught us the bitter lesson that war solves nothing, unless it is that in the main the innocent pay the penalty, or whether the United Nations, if it has not preserved peace, has helped men to talk themselves into a more sober mood in which they realize that there are no slick answers to the modern problems of this world. Perhaps it is in fact a mixture of all three. But the hope must be that one way or another at this moment of time-late, it is true, but better late than never-the lesson of the futility of violence is being learned.\n121.\tHerr Brandt just now said that we should talk, not shoot, and as a European I stand here to say that it was that failure in Europe which very nearly led to the destruction of our continent; and that, surely, should be a lesson for all.\n122.\tIn his thoughtful introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General rightly reminds us that while it is easy to criticize the limitations of the United Nations in matters affecting peace and security, the Organization, and particularly the Security Council, does have to its credit real achievements in defusing disputes. Of that at least we should remind ourselves lest we lose heart. But he would be a bold man who would say that an era of universal peace is within our grasp. War, although contained, is still with us. Man has not solved his basic needs for security, for food and for shelter. At this time of the twentieth century I think we ought to remind ourselves that there is no excuse for these shortcomings apart from prejudice, fear and suspicion, for we have all the technical means that we need to provide for man's very modest needs.\n123.\tSince 1945 the international scene has been dominated by the problems arising from the totally different social, economic and political systems of the East and West and from the aftermath of rapid decolonization. In East- West relations there have been periods of comparative calm and moments of acute peril. Coexistence has been preached. But it has meant different things to different people and the shock waves of tension between the Communists and the rest have spread, and the impact has been felt world-wide. Those who have wished to avoid the contagion of the rivalry of the great Powers have not always been able to do so. The rigid confrontation of the major Powers and the continuing escalation of force and counter- force was not only a source of grave danger in itself to the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but, worse perhaps, also paralysed the use of common resources and stultified the economic development of nations much further afield - nations that otherwise would have been able to do something to bridge the gap between the developed and the developing countries.\n124. Now, at long last, these preoccupations seem to be yielding to a wider perspective. It is not, of course, easy for Communists and the rest to live together and work together when philosophy and practice are so different, but, at long last, at least there are signs of flexibility. The United States has established a relationship with China. The Soviet Union and the United States have softened the edges of their bilateral relations. It became possible for serious negotiations to begin between the Western Allies and the East over the future of Berlin. The two German States have made real progress in their joint discussions and are now both Members of this Organization-a historic step, which my Government welcomes-and if it is followed up with tolerance and with generosity this will undoubtedly have beneficial effects in Europe. The European Community, now enlarged, is finding its own identity and looks outward to fruitful contacts with the rest of the world; and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has met and defined an agenda for work leading towards detente. Up till now it is no more than that, but lest we are to despair, we must recognize it as a start in reconciliation and try to build further upon it. That being said, I must make it clear that detente must be real and not an illusion. Lip service to detente which evaporates at the first test is a trap. Like so much in life it is the will to work together for the highest common factor that counts and certainly as far as my Government is concerned the will is there. Our strong desire is that, however difficult it may be, the two political systems should live together not only without enmity but in broad accord. We will therefore take risks for peace, but at the same time we will not be duped by empty declarations into jeopardizing our security and our chosen way of life which goes with it. I would echo the words of Mr. Kissinger a few days ago [2124th meeting]: my country, like his, seeks true peace, not an armistice. Let us, therefore, share our ideas, share our resources and share our cultures. Let us resolve not to undermine but to understand, not to confront but to reconcile. We-that is, the East and the West-will have the chance to put these sentiments to the test in phase two of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. I trust that the Communist countries will be able to prove that they care for the basic freedoms of people everywhere; for, I say with great respect, it is people, not bits of paper, that politics, national and international, are about. We will try to respond in a constructive spirit in phase two of that\nConference, remembering always that, as Mr. Andersen has just reminded us-and I think it is too often forgotten-that politics are also about the quality of life.\n125.\tThe other division in the world-the division between the rich and the poor countries-is just as profound and just as likely to breed tension. This is essentially an economic rather than an ideological division. Even if there was no conflict between East and West, and even if this conflict had not sometimes spread to the third world, we would still face the great human problems caused by the vast difference between the living standards of the developing and the developed countries because of the accidents of time. I understand the emotions which break out from time to time in the wake of the colonial era. But we have a situation now in this modern world which requires not slogans, however tempting, but cool, rational analysis and a realistic assessment of what can be done under a number of headings: investment, credit, commodity arrangements, debt, aid and trade. They are all relevant to the relationship between the rich and the poor countries and during this session of the General Assembly we shall be discussing the first review and appraisal of the progress of the Second United Nations Development Decade, and I hope it is these things-and I will repeat them: investment, credit, commodity arrangements, debt, aid and trade-which will be the subjects of analysis and, if possible, of agreement. We shall not agree on every aspect of these and of other subjects. Important interests of both developing and developed countries are involved and prima facie at times they seem to diverge but, again, if one looks at each one separately under those headings that I have listed, it will almost always be proved by careful analysis that the interests of the developed and the developing are complementary and not antagonistic. Our common deliberations, therefore, will be fruitful only in so far as we make a deliberate attempt to find the common interest and act on it to a point where we all can see that we can gain as well as give. We must simply not allow politics to intervene to hamper or cripple the fine economic prospects for ordinary people in developing and developed countries. I conclude from this that the key word for the future of economic development is \\\"partnership\\\". Let us recognize the situation for what it is and work together to put it right. In short, the less emotion there is, the quicker we shall get on. For partnership to work it is necessary that each understand the realities which limit the possibilities for action of the other.\n126.\tWe are-and again I make no apology for reminding the Assembly of this-we are dealing with human beings, not with units on the economist's slide rule. So the developed countries must understand the right of the newly emerging countries to be master of their own fate, to control their economic, political and social destinies. What else is nationhood about? And in turn it should be clear that politicians in countries like my own which are governed by a parliamentary democracy have to satisfy their electors that the money which is deliberately being diverted from them is not only being well spent for the benefit of the recipients but to the long-term advantage for all. We in the Western countries-and here I can speak especially for the enlarged European Community-are tackling these questions with energy. The European summit conference last autumn gave to the outside world a high place in its programme. But we can be really successful only if we can move forward with the developing countries in a spirit and practice of partnership and create an atmosphere of mutual purpose and of mutual trust. So I repeat, partnership in this age and day is the key word to success.\n127.\tWe also have undertaken to transfer economic resources and expertise to developing countries and are doing so on an expanding scale. But the word \\\"transfer\\\" means just what it says, at least in the short term. Money and resources, in other words, which would otherwise be available to the donor country are transferred for the benefit of another and I would invite the developing countries to recognize the problems of presentation which, for example, we in the United Kingdom have when we are speaking to our own electors. We could do a lot ourselves with the \u00a3300 million or so which we agree to transfer to others. We are willing to forgo these advantages for ourselves, but the transfer of resources must be seen to be directly related to the achievement of general prosperity all round. That is the only condition we make, but I think it is reasonable.\n128.\tMy country continues to attach high importance to aid. Our official aid flow has steadily increased. In the two years between 1970 and 1972 it rose by nearly half &s much again and it is our intention that it should continue to grow. I was interested, in this context of aid and investment, in what Mr. Gromyko had to say yesterday [2126th meeting], and in particular in his proposal for a 10 per cent reduction in the military expenditure of the leading Powers [A/9191]. My recollections in this Assembly go back some way, and I thought I had recollected having heard this before. I was right. In 1958 the Soviet spokesman stated:\n\\\"The Soviet Government's proposal is to reduce the military budgets of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and France by 10 to 15 per cent and use part of the savings so effected for assistance to the under-developed countries.\\\"\nThat was debated. It did not at that time find favour, for reasons which I think were then valid \u2014 how do you measure, for example, military budgets?  \u2014 and which may still be valid now but I am not concerned in prejudging what the decision on this proposal may be not in 1958, but in 1973. But I would not like it to be thought that in other countries things have stood still on this front of aid and investment. For example, in terms of international aid our contribution in the United Kingdom is many times greater than that of the Soviet Union and, incidentally, it so happens that our total aid is already about 10 per cent of our expenditure of defence. In other words, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned, this is a field in which we should welcome more competition from the Soviet Union and from other countries.\n129.\tThere is, of course, the question of how much of the total flow of resources could be met by official aid and how much by private investment. Whatever the proportions achieved, it will remain true that the private investment will play a significant role in development and I would remind this Assembly of the Pearson report, which says as follows and I quote:\n\\\"There can be no doubt about the contribution which private capital can render to economic development. Indeed, dollar for dollar, it may be more effective than official aid . .. .\\\"\nIt is of course important that private investment should be properly integrated into the development plans and priorities of the host country. Investors should involve the nationals of the recipient State to the maximum, strive for maximum participation of local capital and reinvest a fair proportion of the profits in the enterprises of the country's enterprise which is concerned. But there is a reverse side to any coin and, as the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade put it, developing countries should bear in mind the importance of the attraction of foreign capital of conditions conducive to sustained investment. The plain fact is that private investment will not flow to the countries which do not provide the conditions in which it can bear fruit. It is therefore necessary once again to underline and emphasize that it is necessary to create an atmosphere of partnership if enough resources are to be transferred from those who have them to those who have not to make any real impact at all on the gap between the developed and the developing countries; and this applies both to official aid and to private investment.\n130.\tA pre-condition, therefore, of success is that we must get away from the concept of conflict, whether ideological or racial. We have a common and a material interest in this and it is our joint responsibility as leaders of opinion to see to it that our peoples understand the destructive implications of actions and words which are designed to fuel the fires of intolerance and, by contrast, realize the benefits which flow from partnership which is open and trustful.\n131.\tI cannot accept that the greater East-West detente must somehow be at the expense of the developing world. The reverse should be the case. If detente means anything, it must entail a liberation of resources from both East and West  \u2014  a liberation of resources for more constructive ends. In a sense, the problems of the relationship between East and West and between the developing and the developed countries are linked, and success in dealing with the one will ease the anxieties of the other. When problems exist they can either be approached in an atmosphere of tension and conflict, as if a solution can be reached only by the victory of one side and the defeat of the other, or they can be faced in the belief that reconciliation and partnership is possible and should be pursued with relentless purpose and vigour. This Organization-I believe we ought to remind ourselves - was founded on the latter premise. That was the basis and the inspiration of the Charter. Until now it has\n\nbeen confounded by political distrust and, for the reasons of which I have spoken, we have left undone much that ought to have been done together. It is in the basic belief that man has the capacity to reject his baser instincts and accept the disciplines inherent in reconciliation that we in this Assembly should formulate our policies and lead our peoples."

        "file_text": "\ufeff76.\tMr. President, I am happy to extend to you the congratulations of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates on your election to the presidency. Your illustrious career in the United Nations and your notable services in the cause\n\\\" of peace will assure the success of this session, which you are already guiding with such ability and distinction.\n77.\tMay I also pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for the distinguished manner in which he presided over the previous session?\n78.\tWe welcome the admission of the two German States to membership in the United Nations. It is a historical development of great significance which has brought us closer to the attainment of one of the most cherished goals of this Organization: universality. We also congratulate the people of the Bahamas on the attainment of their independence and the admission of their country to membership in the United Nations.\n79.\tIn reviewing the world situation may I be permitted to start with the area in which my country is situated, the Arabian Gulf. My country is vitally interested in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavoured to establish the closest relations with our neighbours. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Arabian Gulf region can be maintained only through the co-operation of its States and their respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity.\n80.\tWhatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future, they can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests.\n81.\tWe are ready now, as we have always been, to co-operate with our neighbours to create a climate of understanding and harmony, which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people.\n82.\tThe Arab States in the Gulf are sparing no efforts to expand their co-operation and to strengthen their fraternal ties with a view to establishing on firm foundations their future unity in response to the wishes and aspirations of the Arab people in the Gulf.\n83.\tWe have pledged ourselves to act together to defend our independence and resist any foreign intervention in our affairs from whatever source. That policy springs from our supreme national interest, and I am sure our endeavours in this respect will receive the understanding and support they deserve. Our success in preserving our independence and consolidating the security and stability of the area will render a great service to peace and the principles and purposes of the Charter.\n84.\tIn pursuance of those aims we have supported and will continue to support all efforts to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace free from great-Power rivalries. That is why we were most heartened by the agreement reached last August between our two neighbours India and Pakistan to settle some of the questions arising out of the armed conflict in 1971.\n85.\tThe situation in the Middle East, which vitally affects us, remains as dangerous and explosive as ever. Many lamented the fact that, while many of the world's longstanding disputes have been resolved, the Middle East problem remains as difficult and intractable as ever. Why is that so? Israel's spokesmen will tell you it is because the Arabs are bent upon the destruction of the State of Israel and the annihilation of its people. That kind of obvious and shop-worn propaganda can be ignored and dismissed out of hand. Only those who are anxious to find some excuse or justification for Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands and for its persistent flouting and violation of United Nations resolutions will subscribe to such preposterous views. Those who are sincerely and genuinely interested in a peaceful settlement must seek a far more objective and rational analysis of the situation. The question is not and never has been Israel's survival. On the contrary, the question is and has always been the survival of the Arab people of Palestine as a distinct and homogeneous community and their right to live free and secure in their ancestral homeland. That is the crux of the problem. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their basic rights, there can be no peace in the Middle East.\n86.\tAt the recent historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Algiers, the voice of the third world was heard clearly and decisively in condemning Israel's continued aggression and in upholding the rights of the people of Palestine, whose struggle to recover their usurped homeland was hailed by the Conference as an integral part of the struggle of all peoples against colonialism.\n87.\tMany speakers have referred to recent encouraging developments in the relations of the great Powers. We welcome the further steps taken to relax tensions and to end once and for all the dangerous confrontation that has divided Europe and threatened world peace and security for over a quarter-century. It is our hope that the rapprochement among the great Powers which began last year and which has gained considerable momentum during the current year will continue. There can be no greater danger to world peace than continued mistrust and antagonism between those who possess weapons of mass destruction.\n88.\tIt is undeniable, however, that the detente has given rise to some misgivings and even suspicions. There is an uneasy feeling, which persists despite repeated denials, that the removal of the immediate danger of military confrontation may lead the major Powers to falter in the discharge of their primary responsibility under the Charter to deal effectively with situations which are a threat to peace. That may be due to the fact that some of those problems do not directly affect the immediate vital interests of the major Powers. We have heard in this hall the representatives of the major Powers who have so far spoken reaffirming their allegiance to the principles of the United Nations and their intention fully to discharge their responsibilities under the Charter. But it is not enough, as some have done, to preach to us the virtues of a world where the rule of law governs, and where justice shall reign supreme and unchallenged. It is not enough to talk in resounding terms of a rosy and Utopian future while the contemporary world abounds in examples of naked aggression, brutal exploitation and injustice and oppression. If we want the rule of law to govern international relations and justice to be our guiding principle, then let us begin by dealing effectively and courageously with the problems which confront us today. Talk unmatched by action can only distort reality and make a mockery of the exhortations about a brave new world. Would those who spoke to us about the rule of law give us answers to the following questions?\n89.\tDoes the rule of law apply to the Middle East situation? What rule of law is it which permits a Member State of this Organization to continue its occupation of the territories of three other Member States? What rule of law is it which allows the occupying Power to annex formally some of those territories and change their demographic character? What rule of law is it which denies the\nfundamental rights of the Arab people of Palestine to be free and secure in their ancestral homeland and prevents them from freely exercising their rights of self- determination?\n90.\tIf we want justice to be the supreme arbiter in the affairs of men, should we not start to deal effectively with some of the most glaring examples of injustice and brutal oppression in our contemporary world, such as colonialism, racial discrimination and the continued denial for millions of Africans of their fundamental human rights and freedoms?\n91.\tEven before our independence we followed with keen interest the successful struggle other peoples waged against colonialism. The Arab nation, of which we are an integral part, has suffered greatly from foreign domination, and that is why we give our unstinted support to the struggle still going on in Africa and elsewhere, to eradicate the last vestiges of colonialism.\n92.\tAt the recent Conference of non-aligned countries in Algiers, we pledged to make a modest contribution to the liberation movements in Africa, as a token of our solidarity with our African brothers. We are ready to continue our moral and material support to those movements until they achieve the freedom and independence of their peoples in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Namibia.\n93.\tWe condemn racial discrimination in all forms and manifestations. We are ready to support all measures within and outside the United Nations, to put an end to the policies of apartheid practised by the South African Government. It is intolerable that the international community is incapable yet of dealing effectively with a situation which clearly violates the basic principles of the Charter. In two months' time we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is undoubtedly one of the most important achievements of this Organization. The Declaration has inspired many of the countries which\n,, attained independence in the last two decades. My own country has included in its provisional Constitution a bill of rights modelled on the Declaration and containing all its basic concepts.\n94.\tThe Paris agreements of last January to end the war in Viet-Nam were universally welcomed, yet we cannot but express our disappointment at the slow progress and the difficulties encountered in bringing peace to Indo-China, whose people have suffered so much. No solution will endure unless it is based on the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned without foreign interference or intimidation.\n95.\tIn the recent months there has been a great deal of publicity about the so-called energy crisis, and there have been some attempts to portray the oil-producing countries, especially the Arab States, as being the cause of this crisis because it is alleged they are arbitrarily raising the price of crude oil and using it as a weapon for political blackmail and extortion.\na\n96.\tWhat is the truth? The central fact is that the major industrial countries which are the main consumers of our oil have built their economic prosperity and industrial expansion on a policy of cheap energy. An inevitable result of this policy was to slow down the economic growth and development of the producing countries.\n97.\tNow at long last, we want to change all this. Is it not time for our people to reap the benefits of their resources, which for decades have contributed to the enrichment of other countries? Increased production was clearly not enough, since the dollar devaluation and the rampant inflation in the major industrial nations from which we import all the goods we need for our economic development has all but wiped out any benefits which we may have derived from such an increase. In any case, the rise in prices for the individual consumer is not due so much to the increase in the price of crude oil as it is to the rise in shipping costs and excise taxes, levied in the consumer countries. The consumer in Western Europe, for example, pays on the average 55 per cent of the cost of the oil he buys in excise taxes to his own Government, whereas the producing countries get only 12 per cent of what he pays for his oil.\n98.\tIn short, our policy is to get a greater share of the profits derived from the sale of our oil. I believe this is a legitimate and reasonable aim. There is a lop-sided logic in some of the opinions which we hear from time to time about oil policies of the producing countries. We are told, for example, that producing countries are under a moral obligation to cater to the growing energy needs of the major industrial countries, that in return for our irreplaceable oil we should accept depreciated and devalued currencies and that, in case of monetary surpluses, our investment policies should be bound by restrictions which are designed to serve the interests of the consumer nations to the detriment of those of the producers. If we ask, in return for such favours, some consideration for our vital national interests, such as, in the case of the question of Palestine, the faithful implementation of United Nations resolutions, and the strict application of the Charter principles, concerning the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the respect for the rights of the people of Palestine, we are accused of using oil as a weapon for political blackmail and extortion.\n99.\tThe Secretary-General, in his thought-provoking introduction to the report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add 1], has drawn our attention to the problems and difficulties facing the United Nations in a rapidly\n' changing world and the possibilities open to us, if we wish to make an effort, to make our Organization an effective instrument for peace and human welfare. I believe the time has come for us to translate into living reality the principles and ideals of the Charter. In an effort to match our words with deeds, we have already paid to the United Nations $1 million, as a token of our faith in this Organization.\n100.\tEffective international action in the field of development has so far been woefully insufficient to meet the increasing needs and expectations of the majority of the human race, who still live in conditions of dire poverty and misery.\n101.\tThe developed countries have not shown sufficient interest or concern in the difficulties which the developing\ncountries still face. Self-interest seems still to be the dominant feature of their policies to the exclusion of all other considerations. Further efforts are required, and the developing countries, conscious of their common needs and aims, must take the initiative in any new international effort. For this reason we have been greatly attracted by the concept of collective economic security, and we are ready to play our part in such an endeavour.\n102.\tWe attach particular importance to item 101 of the agenda, relating to the situation in the drought-stricken areas in Africa. We have already contributed $3 million for the relief of the region and we will be ready to co-operate and take part in any international endeavour in that respect.\n103.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm our unbounded faith in the United Nations and its principles, and our determination to fulfil faithfully our obligations as a Member State of this Organization, and to contribute to the limit of our abilities to its strengthening and success."

        "file_text": "\ufeff44.\t Mr. President, may I be allowed, at the outset, to express the deepest pleasure of the Italian delegation at seeing you preside over this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n45.\tI am also glad to associate myself with the appreciation extended to your predecessor and with the tribute paid to our Secretary-General, the faithful interpreter of the principles of the Charter and the living symbol of the continuity of this Organization, for the intelligent and successful work that he has accomplished.\n46.\tConfronted by the sad news from the Middle East, I cannot refrain from giving my immediate attention to that tormented geographical area. The sudden renewal of large- scale hostilities in the Middle East at the very moment when the spirit of detente seemed to be spreading throughout the world, and when Europe is engaged in the task of consolidating peace, provides us with a brusque reminder that in an area very close to my own country there remains a deep- rooted and profound crisis which for a long time will threaten our peace-keeping efforts. I venture to recall that the Italian Government, fully aware of the precariousness of any armed truce, had issued repeated warnings, both in this Organization and in our bilateral contacts, about the risk of a further outbreak of hostilities.\n47.\tThe Italian Government and Italian public opinion are deeply concerned at the dramatic and tragic events of\nthe last few days. Italy urges that every effort be made to\nstop the bloodshed immediately. The military operations are producing suffering and death. Sadly, they have also caused victims among the civilian population, victims for whom I must express my deepest grief.\n48.\tAt the same time we urge that the root-causes of the conflict not be overlooked. It is towards these root-causes that we must turn our attention, at these gravest of moments, with the sincerely expressed wish that our Organization will, as it faces this serious crisis, prove itself capable of discharging its basic task of serving as a centre for harmonizing the actions of States in order to maintain international peace and security. The United Nations must therefore renew its efforts with increased vigour not only to re-establish the truce immediately \u2014 this aim, in our opinion, has absolute priority \u2014 but also to eradicate the roots of the conflict.\n49.\tI would venture to add that this duty does not collectively weigh on our Organization alone. Each of its Members separately, and in particular those who bear a major responsibility for peace, are in duty bound to do their utmost to bring about a political solution. We must not ignore the danger that the Middle East conflict may lead to repercussions beyond our control.\n50.\tItaly is convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) still constitutes the basis for a just and honourable peace in the Middle East. The experience of these last six years has nevertheless shown that resolution 242 (1967), while offering the parties concerned the basic foundations for a peace agreement, will remain a dead letter unless the countries involved in the dispute make an open show of goodwill, in co-operation with the United Nations, in order to achieve a unanimously acceptable interpretation of the resolution and its subsequent implementation. The United Nations, and above all those Member States that have close relations with one or all of the interested parties, are in duty bound to invite them and urge them to tackle their problems constructively and to promote an agreement. Italy, for its part, will spare no effort to convince the parties to overcome doubts and misunderstandings and to encourage them to engage in a dialogue as a means of achieving peace. On behalf of the Italian Government, I wish to appeal to all the parties concerned to show restraint and a sense of responsibility so that reason and justice may finally prevail in the Middle East.\n\n51.\tIt has been said in many quarters that 1973 has been the year of detente. And this was certainly true until a few days ago and warranted a certain satisfaction over the tangible and significant developments achieved in 1973. These achievements have been mentioned by many previous speakers: the progress made towards normalization in Viet-Nam; the favourable conclusion of negotiations between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, which have improved the situation in the Asian subcontinent; the conclusion in Europe of the stage of soundings in preparation for a multilateral negotiation between the West, the East and the neutral countries, and the beginning of the Conference on Security and Co-operation- in Europe which is now taking place in Geneva; the ratification of the treaty between the two Germanys which has resulted in the entry into the United Nations of the two German States; the forthcoming negotiations in Vienna to achieve a balanced reduction of forces in central Europe and the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons.\n52.\tA determining factor in these positive developments undoubtedly has been the search for a new kind of relationship among the major centres of world political influence. These centres, after having initiated and experienced balanced relationships which at the beginning of the 1970s constituted a decisive political change, are tending more and more to adopt the method of permanent negotiations in order to check potential conflicts and to bring about the peaceful consolidation of world stability.\n53.\tThe new presence of Europe as an entity actively engaged in the search for new relationships between States and peoples and in the building of a peaceful order on the continent and in the world constitutes a striking development in the international situation which, as a European, I certainly cannot ignore.\n54.\tThe concerted drive towards European unity no longer reflects merely a desire by the peoples of Western Europe to expand and strengthen the process of integration so far engaged in the European Economic Community; it also reflects a striving for the responsibility which devolves upon the Community as a result of the new international reality.\n55.\tThe aim of achieving by 1980 the political unity of the countries of the European Community reflects this desire and this responsibility. And the countries of the Community are moving towards the achievement of this aim by helping both to end the confrontation between East and West and to bridge the gap between industrialized and developing countries.\n56.\tHence the process of the economic and political unification of the countries and peoples of a large part of Europe, to the extent that it fills a historical gap and provides a new impetus towards co-operation and peace, coincides \u2014 as it has indeed so far coincided \u2014 with the progress of detente and with the initiation of new relations between the countries of the third world and the industrialized countries. Suffice it to point out that the enlargement of the European Economic Community and the further progress towards political integration have accompanied the preparation and holding of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Suffice it also to think of the treaties of association concluded between the Community and certain African States, the growing network of friendly relations which the Community is building up in the Mediterranean area and in Latin America and the initiatives taken in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the development of trade within the framework of a system of generalized preferences. All this means that the European Community not only intends to achieve a model of regional economic and political integration but also is seeking to become a dynamic force and a specific reference point in the new system of relations and balances which is emerging as a more adequate response to the challenges and problems of the world community.\n57.\tThe new relationships based on negotiations initiated between the major centres of world influence have certainly helped to settle some potential conflicts. Nevertheless, the need to reaffirm the presence and the essential role of the United Nations in the process of overcoming crises and normalizing relations between States remains more than ever valid. That is because only the United Nations, through its universal and democratic vocation, can represent the aspirations and interests of all States and all peoples; and only the United Nations, created and developed on the basis of a set of principles of international coexistence, can seek a peace which not only conforms to Power relationships but also is founded on equality between States and an understanding of the aspirations of peoples.\n58.\tIt is therefore the task of the United Nations to supplement the efforts of the major centres of political influence by action which reflects the need for participation of all States and the democratic awareness of the world. That is action whereby the United Nations, seeking to build peace upon justice and to base that peace on the major principles of the .Charter, must plan for peace and reaffirm it in all fields where it is threatened by delays in the achievement of progress which may bring to all men and all peoples dignified and democratic conditions of life.\n59.\tThere still remain some problems and disputes which have not as yet been settled. They can be tackled only by the application of the major principles of the United Nations, such as the self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights, the sovereign equality of States, and the renunciation of the use or threat of force. I refer to the crisis in the Middle East \u2014 which I have already dealt with \u2014 the remnants of colonialism in Africa, apartheid, racial discrimination, the serious violations of fundamental freedoms of individuals and of peoples which occur also on other continents, and the problems of the normalization of political relations in Asia.\n60.\tAmong other problems whose settlement involves the full implementation of the principles of the United Nations I shall mention here those of colonialism and apartheid. And let me say at once that the recent news of violence in southern Africa has had a strong impact on Italian public opinion. The Italian people demand a renewed undertaking on the part of the United Nations to initiate in the areas still under colonial rule constructive negotiations between the administering Powers and the liberation movements in order to bring about a process of peaceful and speedy decolonization. These are problems on which we have repeatedly expressed our views; and we have voiced our full disapproval of the adverse effects which our failure to solve them has had on the peoples concerned and on our progress towards the attainment of subsequent goals of free political coexistence between men.\n61.\tThe statement of these principles reminds us that there are still many countries where the right of peoples to choose freely their own political and social institutions and where the rights of the individual to life and liberty are suppressed because of recurring tendencies to impose or maintain political formulas and regimes by underhand coercion and violence of arms.\n62.\tThe Italian Government has followed with regret and concern the events which have taken place and are still taking place in Chile, where a coup d'etat led to the overthrow of the constitutional Government, the suppression of democratic institutions and the tragic death of President Allende.\n63.\tViolence in political life, wherever and in whatever form it occurs, leads to the disregard and suppression of human rights. Italy maintains that respect for human rights, set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and proclaimed in the United Nations Charter as the basic objective of co-operation between States, constitutes everywhere the basis for ensuring political coexistence and for guaranteeing, both within States and in international life, the renunciation of the use of force and the free development of the values and aspirations of peoples.\n64.\tOn the continent of Asia also there still exist problems whose solution requires the rigorous application of United Nations principles.\n65.\tThe Paris agreements on Viet-Nam, the Vientiane Agreement on Laos and the end of the bombing in Cambodia constitute the premises for the gradual restoration of normal relations in Indo-China. Now that the war in VietNam and Laos is over, we must try to defend the peace there; but above all we must place it on more solid and more genuine foundations, namely, full respect for the will of the peoples concerned to establish a freely chosen political and social order and a climate of reconciliation and fruitful progress.\n66.\tOn the Korean peninsula also the efforts made by the two Koreas to normalize their relations are encountering difficulties which may become if the delicate balances existing within the region and the desires of the Korean people are respected and if there is no outside interference.\n67.\tThe most serious problem now facing the States Members of the United Nations, whether on the regional or the world level, is not so much to reaffirm the major principles already solemnly proclaimed in the Charter as to bring about their practical implementation. That is a task which in Italy's view may be accomplished mainly through a joint effort of political will by the States which are called upon to establish more peaceful and more balanced relationships throughout the world.\n68.\tThat co-operation may be achieved at the regional level, as may be proved by the significant test constituted by the convening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, but that Conference must not limit its scope to another redrafting, in more or less solemn terms, of a code of behaviour which already exists in the universal conscience. On the contrary, it must pursue the aim of equating European reality with the major principles of our Organization and it must remove the divisive factors which have so far prevented their full implementation on the continent. It must create the conditions for the gradual removal of barriers between States and peoples and for the initiation of new relations between them which are more open and dynamic.\n69.\tWith regard to the concern with which international public opinion has been following the measures recently\ntaken against citizens guilty of having expressed a form of political dissent, I wish to stress that the real success of the Conference will be measured by its ability effectively to enhance the quality of life and the dignity of man. In that sense, the promotion in Europe of broader contacts between individuals and the freer exchanges of information, ideas and scientific and artistic products will increase the political awareness of citizens and together will raise the level of social progress, as measured by the extent to which rights and freedom are enjoyed. The possibilities given to Europeans of understanding and meeting one another beyond national frontiers will signify the progress from a Europe marked by divisions to a Europe of peace, intent on seeking more advanced forms of social coexistence.\n70.\tWhat I have said so far about Europe is valid, mutatis mutandis, for the other continents also. At the world level, however, the way towards the implementation of the major principles in international relations lies more than ever in the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.\n71.\tThe Italian Government has already had the opportunity of expressing its views on the matter. We maintain that full respect for the Charter and the political will of States to apply it correctly represent the necessary premise for restoring effectiveness to United Nations action. We are, however, also convinced that some of its structures must be modified in order to ensure more responsible participation of small and medium-sized States in the decisions and tasks of the Organization.\n72.\tThe expansion of the membership of the Economic and Social Council and the strengthening of its operations represents a positive event. We hope that the Security Council, too, may in the not-too-distant future reflect more accurately in its membership the changes that have come about in the world community during the last quarter of a century with the attainment of independence by so many States and with the evolution of influential relationships on the world scene. We also hope that by the establishment of new machinery the Security Council will be able to improve its fact-finding and peace-keeping functions.\n73.\tA strengthening of the procedures for the settlement of international disputes, especially through a review of the role of the International Court of Justice; a further clarification of the powers of the Economic and Social Council to co-ordinate the specialized agencies and the programmes designed to implement the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]\\ the search for more coordinated procedures for ascertaining violations of human rights and for struggling against racial discrimination; the replacement of the Trusteeship Council, which has almost concluded its task, by a council for Non-Self-Governing Territories and for decolonization: these are some of the questions which we suggest Member States should ponder in order to bring about a genuine modernization of the structures and capacity for action of the United Nations.\n74.\tUndoubtedly, the United Nations has traversed a long path towards the attainment of universality, which represents important stage in the reaffirmation of its role. The entry into the world Organization of the two States of the\nGerman nation and of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas brings closer the moment in which the United Nations can achieve real universality. To complete this process we shall have to accelerate the accession to independence by the countries still subject to a colonial regime and normalize relations between the divided States such as Korea and Viet-Nam.\n75.\tItaly, which has always advocated the principle of universality of the United Nations, will continue to work for the attainment of this aim as soon as possible.\n76.\tPrecisely because of the ever-growing participation of States, the United Nations has been able in recent years to extend the scope of its action. Today, the United Nations is launching a campaign on all fronts for the liberation of mankind from the major evils which afflict it: the armaments spiral, under-development, hunger and the destruction of the environment. In this context I should like to recall the initiative of the President of Mexico for the adoption of a charter on the economic rights and duties of States, an initiative which we favourably accepted for the reasons which prompted it and in the study of which we are participating with interest.\n\n77.\tWhat must be done is to implement the comprehensive and indivisible concept of security that befits the United Nations and is founded on the awareness that, in order to ensure peace the root-causes of tension must be eradicated.\n78.\tIn this context I will refer only to the United Nations effort to promote a global development strategy capable of bringing about a more equitable distribution of resources and technology in favour of the less-advanced States, to the major negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund, to the noble initiatives \u2014 notably the suggested world food conference \u2014 undertaken to confront the dramatic challenges of hunger and over-population throughout the world and, last but not least, to the general awareness of the fact that a world environment policy can no longer be postponed.\n79.\tIt is against that comprehensive background, in the framework of a global strategy of peace which may confront world problems in their entirety and interrelationship, that we must consider also the disarmament problems.\n80.\tThe Soviet-American negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons and the start of a negotiation on the balanced reduction of forces in central Europe constitute so many positive elements which must be integrated with the efforts of the United Nations itself if we are to move towards the objective of general and complete disarmament. Italy continues on each and every occasion to be actively engaged in the search for progress in disarmament. We are pursuing this search in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva which technically still constitutes, in spite of recent difficulties, the body best equipped to negotiate specific and workable measures. Italy also intends to remain active in the efforts deployed to bring about a World Disarmament Conference which, if it is effectively prepared with the participation of all the nuclear Powers, could become the most useful instrument for bringing about general and complete disarmament.\n81.\tThe United Nations was created in order to base international relations on peace and law and to guarantee to all peoples the right to decide their own destiny and to be free from all foreign interference and all forms of coercion. Since States and peoples are made up of human beings, today more than ever the enrichment of the quality of life \u2014 the quality of life of all men, wherever they live \u2014 is essential for ensuring that relations between States will also develop in a framework of security and harmony. The rights of States and peoples may be achieved more fully in a climate of peace and security when the rights of the individual can expand and develop within all regions and within all social systems.\n82.\tIt is in that spirit that Italy reaffirms its complete support for the United Nations and the principles set forth in the Charter and its resolve to co-operate in the formulation of a comprehensive policy for peace, which may also promote all the values in which man's desire constantly to overcome himself is embodied."

        "file_text": "\ufeff210.\t It is a source of great pleasure for me to congratulate Ambassador Benites, on behalf of the Lesotho delegation, on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that he will \u2014 as he has already demonstrated \u2014 guide the work of this session to a successful and fruitful conclusion.\n211.\tI should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on its accession to independence and its subsequent admission to membership in this world Organization. On the basis of its history, my delegation is convinced that the Bahamas will be an active and effective Member of the United Nations, especially in the field of decolonization.\n212.\tMy delegation hails the admission of both Germany s to membership in the United Nations because it is a significant landmark in the history of this Organization. It is a great achievement in diplomacy and a giant step towards making the United Nations a truly universal Organization.\n213.\tMy Government will be happy to lend its support to the admission of the remaining divided nations to this Organization to ensure that all peoples are adequately represented in our deliberations.\n\n214.\tI speak before you on behalf of a people who, alongside others, lost their own in the two major wars of this century. We welcome the detente amongst the big Powers. We were happy at the signing of the Paris peace agreements on Indo-China and the lowering of tensions in Europe is for us a matter of satisfaction. Indeed I believe that mankind is now poised to seize the opportunities for a more durable peace that are offered by these developments.\n215.\tBut these opportunities for a more permanent peace will be lost if the basic human rights of all peoples are ignored. There can be no peace that is based on the sufferings of others. The hunger and poverty of the vast majority of humanity are no basis for a permanent international regime which provides for mutually satisfactory accommodation of the interests of all peoples.\n216.\tAs Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany said last week so eloquently:\n.. human distress is conflict. Where hunger prevails, there can be no peace in the long run. Where bitter poverty prevails, there can be no justice. Where a man's very existence is threatened for want of basic daily needs, it is not permissible to speak of security.\\\" J\n217.\tThe denial of human rights to others either on the basis of race or any other characteristic can contribute no more to humanity than deluding us into interpreting temporary armistices or the absence of bloody conflicts as peace.\n218.\tThe allocation of resources to military expenditures by the rich countries continues to increase, while in the rest of the world the basic daily needs of millions of people have no hope of being satisfied.\n219.\tIt is in the context of this reality that this Organization, whose principal function is the maintenance of international peace, should take concrete decisions to alleviate man's suffering as a pre-condition to a more permanent peace structure.\n220.\tThe urgency of meeting this reality is underlined by the current indications of a world-wide food shortage. No one can dispute the fact that such a shortage, unless redressed, will create conditions in the third world which will undermine social institutions and stability.\n221.\tThis Organization should galvanize man's creative abilities in science and technology to solve the perennial problems of drought, which afflict many countries of the developing world. My country is among those which have suffered drought year after year. We do not hope to rely solely on relief foodstuffs from the rich countries. We hope more permanent solutions can be found to alleviate problems arising from these conditions.\n222.\tMy delegation in this context welcomes the initiative of the United States Secretary of State for the convening of a world food conference [2124th meeting] and we sincerely hope that the energies that detente between the super-Powers and other big Powers has released will be devoted to the realization of that most fundamental of human rights, the right to live.\n223.\tOn behalf of the Lesotho Government I wish to register Lesotho's opposition to the recent spate of nuclear tests because, inasmuch as these tests are irrelevant to the essential needs of humanity, they militate against international co-operation and endanger the lives of human beings as well as the living resources on which they depend. They are regrettably carried out in a spirit of overt defiance of international public opinion and of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n224.\tWhen the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade was adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)], some of us were hopeful that the international community had at long last become aware, in the interests of durable peace and stability, of the pressing need to combat the scourges of mass poverty, unemployment, disease and malnutrition plaguing the developing countries. But the first over-all biennial review and appraisal of progress has already shown how dismally over-optimistic we were.\n225.\tThe gap between the planned objectives and targets of the Strategy and their achievement in the wide spectrum of the problem areas o+ socio-economic growth and development, as elaborated in the Strategy itself, remains as wide and frightening as ever. To quote but a few areas of critical importance to the development effort of such least-developed countries as mine, there has been a failure on the part of developed countries as a whole to achieve aid goals of 1 per cent of gross national product, a failure to achieve official assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross national product, insufficient action to help developing countries gain access to export markets in spite of the newly introduced generalized system of preferences, failure to evolve a concerted policy on debt relief, and a tendency to pay lip service to the interests of developing countries in multilateral trade and monetary negotiations. I cannot hope to exhaust the whole list of disappointments or shortfalls here, and of course some individual developed countries have performed better than others in various fields. But all in all, the economic and technological gap between the \\\"have\\\" and the \\\"have not\\\" countries, or between the north and the south, is ever widening. As one expert study on the subject concludes, the International Development Strategy remains \\\"much more a wish than a policy\\\". The situation gives the impression that the Strategy was adopted with no intention of implementing it, and if this is the case my greatest fear is that the credibility of the consensus of this august body is being terribly undermined.\n226.\tIn my view the bleak and disappointing results of the first two or three years of the Second Development Decade make it urgent and imperative that both the developed and the developing countries should vigorously make a concerted effort, not only to implement the existing targets and policy measures of the Strategy, but also to seek new areas of agreement, to widen and deepen existing ones, to evolve new concepts and standards and to seek agreement on additional measures. As an extension of the new east-west policy of detente, both rich and poor countries should seriously strive to establish new structural relationships on the basis of equitable co-operation and partnership, as well as mutual benefit. The world community ought to realize that, while the basic responsibility for the\ndevelopment of the developing countries rests with those countries themselves, development, like maintenance of world peace, is a global problem that transcends national frontiers and very often defies national solutions, and it is therefore a joint responsibility of all nations.\n227.\tAs members of the General Assembly are very well aware, Lesotho is one of the hard-core among the least developed of the developing countries. In addition to the problems that are common to all countries which are similarly classified, Lesotho is plagued by unique problems which other developing countries are fortunate enough not to experience. The source of those unique problems is Lesotho's own geographical situation, which is such that it is the only State Member of the United Nations whose territory is completely embedded within the territory of another State Member of the United Nations, whose political philosophy is, furthermore, directly opposite to its own.\n228.\tAt this stage I can only express the hope that special measures in favour of the least developed among the developing countries, as well as special measures in favour of land-locked developing countries, envisaged-in the International Development Strategy and elaborated upon and refined by other forums or agencies will be translated into reality as a matter of priority, taking into consideration the unique geo-economic position of my country. I should like to state that the Government of Lesotho stands ready to support any efforts aimed at evolving institutional arrangements for the implementation of such special measures. The idea of the creation of special funds is attractive to my delegation, but in the event that this is not sufficiently palatable to the majority of developed countries I would like to give support to the use of the United Nations Capital Development Fund in favour of the least developed among the developing countries, in the hope that the developed countries will now be more favourably disposed towards increasing their contributions to the Fund.\n- 229. My Government fully supported the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme, as well as the establishment of the Fund of the United Nations Environment Programme. We hope that the establishment of the programme will lead to an internationally co-ordinated solution to the problem of the pollution of man's environment, which is one of the most recently recognized hazards to human survival. We also hope that in addressing themselves to these problems both the Governing Council and the secretariat of the United Nations Environment Programme will attach as much importance to the problems of the spread of deserts as to the loss of productive soil through soil erosion. In my country soil erosion is the greatest environmental problem which we have for many years been trying to solve. Our efforts have so far not met with any success. Our very limited arable land is annually being swept away to the oceans by soil erosion, thus undermining our annual increase of agricultural output. The hazard to human life posed by the spread of deserts such as the Sahara Desert is too recent an example to need emphasis.\n*\n230. With the passage of time the Middle East situation, as is evident from recent events, is becoming more and more complicated. As the attitudes of parties to the conflict continue to harden, the United Nations peace-making machinery seems to be manifesting symptoms of fatigue and helplessness. This conflict is gradually becoming the . pivot of the world's energy crisis. In addition, a colonial situation seems more than ever before to be developing in the occupied territories, which makes all the more tragic the fate of the Palestinian people. It is the view of my Government that any measures calculated to change the character of those territories would only complicate the solution of the problem. Even under these greatly changed circumstances, Security Council resolution 242(1967), if not distorted, still provides a reasonable framework for its solution.\n231.\tIn southern Africa, 35 million African people continue to be politically dominated and economically as well as morally exploited by a handful of settlers of European descent, who use their overwhelming military and economic power to deny their subjects even the most basic of human rights and freedoms.\n232.\tWe in Lesotho continue to insist that a just solution of the Rhodesian crisis must of necessity be preceded by the release of all political prisoners; the revocation of the current state of emergency; a watertight guarantee of freedom of expression and of assembly; the repeal of current discriminatory legislation; and the convening of a genuinely representative constitutional conference, whose decisions would have legal effect only if approved by all Rhodesians on the basis of unqualified universal suffrage.\n233.\tThe solution of the Rhodesian problem is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. We believe also that it is the duty of the international community to assist the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe morally, materially and in any other way possible. The continued existence of the Ian Smith regime is incompatible with the establishment of durable peace in southern Africa, as has been demonstrated by its past military excursions and its senseless economic blockade of Zambia. In addition to the fact that its persistence is a threat to the security and sovereignty of the independent African States which neighbour it, it is a potential source of racial conflict which may one day engulf the whole of southern Africa, unless events in that part of the world follow a different course.\n. 234. While the world continues to be shocked by the revelations of the atrocities of Portugal in its colonies, some of Portugal's powerful western allies continue to deny that their military and economic assistance is used in the perpetration of those atrocities. I submit that, if the Imilitary, economic and technical resources which are placed at the disposal of Portugal are not used in Portuguese wars against freedom movements, that kind of aid to Portugal at least frees resources of Portuguese origin to be deployed against the human rights of Portugal's colonial subjects, to stifle the liberation struggle and to perpetuate Portuguese political domination and the economic exploitation of Angola and Mozambique.\n235. In conformity with my Government's policy, Lesotho was among those countries which blessed the Secretary-General's initiative in making contacts with Pretoria over the question of Namibia. Addressing itself to the stark realities of the situation, Lesotho is now beginning to entertain serious doubts on the wisdom of this dialogue, as South Africa's continuing Balkanization of the territory, even during the course of the negotiations, is clearly calculated to prejudice any possible satisfactory outcome.\n236.\tOn the situation prevailing in South Africa the views of my Government are well known. My Government has stated many times before that the people of South Africa would soon come to the conclusion that they had no alternative in the solution of the apartheid problem but resort to the use of force. My Government has also observed' that apartheid was likely to lead to the tragedy of racial confrontation-confrontation that could not be confined to Africa but that would result in racial hatred and bitterness throughout the world. It is clear to us that, unless there is a change of heart on the part of the South African Government, racial violence is going to become a feature of life in southern Africa.\n237.\tMy Government has always espoused a policy of friendship with all States and good neighbourliness in particular with all the countries of southern Africa. We seek confrontation with no one. Our policy of good neighbourliness in no way diminishes our commitment to the United Nations principles on the universal rights of man; therefore we shall never cease to condemn the evils of apartheid, racism and colonialism.\n238.\tIn our own society we shall continue to reflect the common humanity of man. We shall continue to provide refuge to the victims of apartheid, racism and colonialism. In our schools we shall continue to provide places for people of all colours to enable them to develop their intellectual capabilities to the fullest extent possible in an atmosphere free from racial bigotry.\n239.\tOur foreign policy is dictated by our national interests. In the formulation of those interests we shall continue to be guided by our obligations under the Charter and our commitment to peace and justice.\n240.\tAllow me to express the profound appreciation of my Government at the expressions of sympathy and condolences extended to my Government and the families of the Lesotho nationals who lost their lives or suffered injuries in the recent shootings at the Carletonville Mines in South Africa. These expressions of sympathy give us reason to believe that the international community is still fully conscious of the value of human life and the dignity of the human person. I wish to assure you that the Lesotho Government has made arrangements for the interests of those affected and their dependants to be looked after by counsel in the proposed judicial inquiry into this incident.\n241.\tFinally, I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Kingdom of Lesotho has today accorded full recognition to the new sovereign State of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. On behalf of my Government I wish to congratulate the Government and the people of Guinea- Bissau on the bold step they have taken."

My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to the two German States and to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on joining the United Nations. It is only three years since Fiji, immediately on attaining independence, joined this august body, but from our brief experience we are convinced that the United Nations will be able to discharge its responsibility under the Charter more effectively the more fully representative it is of all mankind.\n74.\tAs a small country, we are fully appreciative that the greatest virtue of this world forum is that, despite differences in size, wealth and political systems, all countries can come together freely to discuss and consult on a wide range of problems of common concern and to take appropriate measures to resolve them. We have also learned in the short time of our membership that the collective will and wisdom of this world forum can sometimes be frustrated by self-interest, national pride and other weaknesses among its members. With those weaknesses eliminated, the potential for success of this Organization is incalculable.\n75.\tThe demonstration by the United Nations of the advantages of diversity and co-operation is particularly important to Fiji because we have a multiracial society. We believe that differences in race, religion, language and custom can add richness and variety of texture to our composite society. All sections of our multiracial community are accordingly agreed that our future must lie in developing a relationship based on equality, mutual respect, tolerance and understanding. These values are enshrined in our Constitution.\n76.\tSituated in the South Pacific, Fiji seems remote from the international scene. Indeed, we in the South Pacific have sometimes felt that ours is a neglected region of the world. As world leaders travel to and fro on important missions, one does not hear of them visiting the South Pacific, although our problems are just as varied and as complex as those one may find anywhere. External events can and do have disturbing effects on race relations in Fiji. The expulsion of Asians across frontiers, armed conflicts involving Moslem and Hindu religious communities, and racial tensions in predominantly white communities-these threaten and undermine the success of our policy of multiracial harmony. You, Mr. President, and the representatives present this afternoon need not be reminded of the disruptive effects of the economy of a country such as mine of currency devaluation and revaluation decided on by others without consultation with and apparently without concern about other countries which are likely to be adversely affected. So interwoven are our interests and welfare in an ever-shrinking world that the need for devising and observing agreed international standards in all fields of human endeavour is absolutely vital.\n77.\tIt is, therefore, a matter of great importance to Fiji to look to this world body not only for sympathy and understanding of its problems but also for its determination to set, and to promote the universal observance of, certain practical standards for the benefit of the international community. Surely these standards must include freedom to decide one's destiny, racial equality and harmony, respect for international law and order and a greater realization of the fact that we are all, large and small, interdependent.\n78.\tYet it is a sad reflection on the state of world affairs today that, 25 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the dignity of man and basic human rights are still being denied in southern Africa. Political domination based on the perpetration of racial injustice and economic exploitation can only heighten tensions and instability in the area.\n79.\tThe problems of race relations in southern Africa are complex and not easy to solve. It is my delegation's view that a solution based on dialogue and peaceful change can and should be found. In regard to United Nations work relating to southern Africa, my delegation urges that we do not lose patience in the pursuit of solutions by dialogue and other peaceful means. If the South Africans, the Portuguese and the illegal Smith regime appear to have hearts of stone, we would counsel patience, persistence and perseverance as against threats and the use of force. We would counsel that we watch for and exploit to the full any signs of readiness to talk, of softening of hearts and of the slightest change in known positions. In our view, it would be unproductive, and indeed highly dangerous, if we were to consider the use of force as the only means of achieving self-determination and independence in southern Africa. We believe that the United Nations has made and can continue to make a real contribution towards bringing about this beneficial change. It is, therefore, a matter of serious concern that some responsible Members-while declaring in this forum their support for the principles of the United Nations Charter and for the rights of self-determination and independence of dependent peoples, and their opposition to the policy of apartheid-have not in practice adhered to international measures designed to help the oppressed peoples in the area. They have in fact directly and indirectly encouraged the very Governments the United Nations is trying to persuade to abide by internationally accepted principles which we are all pledged and charged by the Charter to pursue.\n80.\tAnother form of injustice which calls for urgent effective and concerted international action is the increasing incidence of acts of politically inspired terrorism against innocent individuals. We refer to the hijacking of commercial aircraft, kidnapping, the use of letter bombs- and other such devices. Fiji will continue to support any internationally agreed preventive measures, and regards this as a matter of the highest priority for the United Nations. However, here again, measures to combat illegal terrorist activities and, indeed, to promote universal respect for international law and order will work only if all nations co-operate in observing them. The sense of urgency and the strong desire to rid the world of terrorist acts should not be permitted to be blunted by the supporters of their perpetrators.\n81.\tFiji has on numerous occasions voiced in this Assembly and in other international forums its strong opposition to the continuation of all nuclear-weapon tests in any environment, and in particular nuclear testing in I the atmosphere in the South Pacific. With 300 scattered islands and with limited land resources, Fiji regards the sea and its resources as matters of vital importance in its efforts to improve the quality and standard of life of its people. It is for that reason that Fiji is seeking, at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the recognition by the international community of the special needs and interests of mid-ocean archipelagic States. But it is for the same reason that the Government and people of Fiji have taken very seriously the resumption by France of atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific.\n82.\tWe appreciate that the primary concern of a country must be to safeguard its national security against external aggression, but it must be equally recognized that we are all members of a world community and action taken by one member can impinge on the rights of others. It is, therefore, to be regretted that, as a responsible member of the international community, France has continued to conduct nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a point far removed from its own metropolitan territory, thus endangering the marine resources, health and lives of peoples of the South Pacific region.\n83.\tThe international community has shown its strong opposition to nuclear weapons and nuclear testing in numerous resolutions and various international treaties and in the recurring appearance on the agenda of the General Assembly of items dealing with disarmament and the creation of nuclear-free or peace zones. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban Treaty,  whose basic aim is to end the nuclear arms race and thus eliminate the need for nuclear weapons and their testing. Yet France has ignored the call of the international community for the halting of all atmospheric nuclear-weapon testing in the Pacific or elsewhere, and its call for all States that have not done so to adhere to the partial test-ban Treaty. It has chosen to disregard the terms of an interim injunction granted by the world Court.  At a time when the world community is actively concerned with the law of the sea, France has cordoned off a large area of the high seas far beyond the boundary of the territorial sea of its testing site. This is a dangerous encroachment of the long-standing principle of freedom of the high seas, and when States continue to show a total disregard for accepted international legal norms, it is the world community as a whole that suffers. Only last week, the South Pacific Conference, meeting in Guam, passed a strongly worded resolution in condemnation of these tests and all other nuclear tests. The Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission was asked by the Conference to transmit the resolution to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the information of its Members.\n84.\tIt follows that Fiji will welcome the opportunity to discuss with our Pacific neighbours the proposal for a nuclear-free zone in the region as mentioned yesterday by the Prime Minister of New Zealand.\n85.\tI have already referred to the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea. The issues to be discussed at that Conference are of immediate concern to my country, as indeed to other States, for the seas not only surround us but also join the component islands of Fiji into one nation. My country, as a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, which is preparing the Conference, is very much aware of the complexity of the issues and the diversity of interests which have dogged the Committee's work. My delegation believes that the Conference can accomplish its complex and difficult task only if all interests groups decide to demonstrate a genuine willingness to resolve the intractable issues facing them. What is necessary on the part of all States is the political will to negotiate and a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation. What we look for is not only a sense of realism in the claims to national jurisdiction, but also a willingness on the part of the major maritime Powers to recognize the fact that a new law of the sea is evolving. In our view, the international community must choose to establish a new order of the oceans for the benefit of all, or else risk allowing the present situation to degenerate into a new area of tension, lawlessness and uncontrolled exploitation, from which only the more developed few will benefit.\n86.\tWhat the Secretary-General has called the \\\"new balance of prudence\\\", accompanying the detente between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the United States and China, has raised hopes for a more peaceful world. The successful completion of the first phase of the strategic arms limitation talks, the launching of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and talks on force reductions in Europe, and the presence in our midst of the two German States-these have all borne witness to this new mood. The reduction of fears of survival is an objective which must continue to be pursued.\n87.\tBut what has the detente meant to the international community and to this world Organization in particular?\nMilitary arms expenditures are still rising. Nuclear-weapon tests are still being conducted. The risk of miscalculation and misconception of motives and intentions remains a constant threat to a detente based on a precarious nuclear balance. Because of continuing disagreements among the nuclear Powers, general and complete disarmament has remained an unattainable objective. Real peace has not come to Viet-Nam despite the official cease-fire. American bombing in Cambodia has now ceased, but war continues in that country. The Middle East remains an area of acute tension, and for decades the inhabitants of the region have not known the normal living which it is their birthright to expect and to enjoy. Dialogue has been established between the two Koreas, but no real progress has been achieved in normalizing relations in order to achieve their peaceful reunification.\n88.\tThe recent agreement between India and Pakistan on the future of war prisoners has demonstrated to the world community that a lasting settlement can be brought about only by frank and peaceful dialogue between the parties directly involved. No one can benefit from armed conflicts or confrontations, whatever their outcome; we can all benefit from peace.\n89.\tThe United Nations was set up, according to its Charter, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It has, on many occasions, helped to reduce tension and risk in a conflict situation and to facilitate the re-establishment of dialogue. But because of continuing disagreements among the major Powers, the United Nations peace-keeping operations have been at best a voluntary exercise, and in fact there may perhaps have been situations where the parties concerned have considered a United Nations presence an excuse to avoid serious dialogue.\n90.\tFor countries like my own, the real detente must also embrace increased international co-operation in promoting economic and social development. The existence of widespread conditions of mass poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and of glaring inequalities of income both between and within countries is a potential source of tension in the world today. Permanent peace and stability can, therefore, be achieved only through a new sense of international commitment towards mutual assistance and co-operation.\n91.\tIn this connexion, my delegation would like to express the sincere gratitude of the Government and the people of Fiji for the prompt response of the international community, through this Organization and bilaterally, in providing assistance for hurricane and flood victims in Fiji late last year. This was a clear demonstration to us of a joint and deliberate commitment to assist the less fortunate sections of the international community.\n92.\tThe present session will be the occasion for the first biennial review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, which is geared specifically towards assisting the acceleration of social and economic development in the third world. In this regard, the Strategy lays particular emphasis on the need for increased transfer of resources through both development assistance and trade. But we would prefer to regard the creation of favourable trade conditions and trade itself as the best form of aid; for it is only in increased trade that we can hope to realize our aims through our own efforts, without a sense of external obligation or a continuing heavy dependence on special assistance from outside.\n93.\tLike many other developing countries, Fiji has a limited home market and its principal exports are two primary commodities, sugar and copra, which are subject to price fluctuations on the open market. Fiji is therefore heavily reliant on foreign trade as the source of essential foreign exchange. It is thus a matter of vital necessity to us that we find assured outlets and secure stable and remunerative prices for our primary exports. Additionally, because of the continuing deterioration in the terms of trade of commodity exports, it is of utmost importance that there should be some direct relative between primary export prices and the price of goods for which they are traded. The study of some mechanism to provide this relativity should be a priority call upon the research agencies of this great Organization.\n94.\tThe current negotiations for the renewal of the international agreement and multilateral trade talks through GATT, and the forthcoming negotiation between the enlarged European Economic Community and the developing associate and associable countries, have a direct bearing on our efforts to improve the quality of life and the economic standards of our people. However, the success of these negotiations will depend ultimately on the attitude taken by the developed countries.\n95.\tThe International Development Strategy, to which we all subscribe, comes out clearly in favour of commodity agreements for assuring equitable and remunerative commodity prices. This is the type of aid we most need. We appreciate that where such agreements involve restricting domestic production-as with beet sugar in Europe-the fear of hardship and unemployment can give rise to powerful sectional opposition in the developed countries. This can be true also when other measures to improve the terms of trade of developing countries involve reducing protection on locally produced goods. But the developed countries have the necessary capital, technology and skill to diversify into alternative lines of production and thereby minimize any loss of employment opportunity. The developing countries have not, and must continue to rely heavily on the export of primary commodities and semi-processed agricultural goods.\n96.\tThe last decade has been a period of very rapid development in the South Pacific. Many Territories in the area have gained independence: first, Western Samoa and Nauru; then, Tonga and Fiji; and now Papua New Guinea will shortly achieve its independence. The Cook Islands are self-governing and Niue Island will achieve this status next year.\n97.\tConcurrent with this development is the steady growth of a sense of Pacific consciousness among the countries and Territories in the region. It is not so much a birth as a rebirth or rediscovery of old links and ties temporarily broken by the division of the area into metropolitan spheres of influence. This growing spirit .of co-operation has manifested itself both in the establishment of new regional institutions, like the University of the\nSouth Pacific, and in changes within existing regional bodies, like the South Pacific Commission, whereby the Pacific island members now have a far greater say in controlling the organization, including its budget and work programme.\n98.\tThe most exciting recent development is the emergence of the South Pacific Forum, a grouping which grew spontaneously from within the region, bringing together Australia and New Zealand with the independent island countries of the South Pacific in a common endeavour to establish a new free and independent association based on better understanding and more effective co-operation. With this underlying notion the Forum has set up the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation to try to modify the existing pattern of economic relationships between countries in the region and those outside it.\n99.\tThese are trends which reveal an increasing awareness of common regional interests. They also show that countries in a region, despite wide disparities in their stages of economic development and differences in their ethnic composition, can come together in a partnership to promote the well-being of their peoples. But the essence of this regional relationship is that it is outward-looking.\n100.\tWe believe that peace, security and orderly economic and social progress can be brought about only by all States coming together and pooling their resources for the benefit of mankind. What this requires is not that States should surrender their sovereignty but that they should be outward-looking and that they should regard others on the basis of equality, mutual respect, tolerance and understanding.\n101.\tWhat is required is that all the Member States should constantly bear in mind that this great Organization can achieve a great deal more in its international peace and security efforts, in economic and social development and in its other aims only if it has the full and continuous support of all its Members. Where we have failed or have not been effective is where this support has been lacking or inadequate. Thus the call to all Members which want a strong United Nations, more especially to the major Powers and the developed countries, is not only to criticize it for its shortcomings from outside but also to advise and empower their representatives within the Organization to remedy its weaknesses and to give the United Nations their wholehearted support which it so fully deserves."

        "file_text": "\ufeff20.\t Mr. President, allow me first of all to take this opportunity to join my colleagues who have preceded me in expressing the deep gratification we all share in seeing you assume this highly respected and immensely responsible office of the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. Your unanimous election to this office bespeaks the confidence you personally enjoy in this august assembly. Above all, it is an expression of the great respect and admiration we have towards your great country and your great people.\n21.\tFor my country and Africa, you represent not only your country, Ecuador, with which we enjoy warm relations, but also the sister continent of Latin America, with which Africa is linked in solidarity by common social, political and economic backgrounds and the growing co-operation in our common struggle to free our peoples from the vestiges of political and economic imperialism. There is, therefore, no need for me to state that you represent that solidarity and common cause. We remain convinced that under your able and enlightened guidance this session will be crowned with unqualified success.\n22.\tMay I also pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Trepczynski, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, who during the last session of the General Assembly conducted his office with the highest degree of responsibility, dedication and wisdom.\n23.\tBefore continuing with my statement, allow me to address myself to a very important and perhaps one of the most historic events of our time in the continent of Africa. I refer to the declaration of independence by the gallant people of the State of Guinea-Bissau.\n24.\tThe State of Guinea-Bissau, after holding a democratic election last year, has now completed the process of exercising its right to self-determination and independence by declaring its State to be an independent State. This has been achieved after many years of hard struggle and much bloodshed by the people of that country under the correct and the dynamic leadership of the PAIGC. \n25.\tI am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania yesterday accorded full recognition, diplomatic and otherwise to the new State of Guinea-Bissau.\n26.\tOn behalf of the Government and people of Tanzania I wish to congratulate the new State and the people of Guinea-Bissau on the bold step they have taken. Tanzania is fully aware-I repeat, Tanzania is fully aware-of the consequences of such a step.\n27.\tAs the proclamation rightly pointed out, the struggle of the people of the new State will continue to be waged with greater vigour and determination, until those small parts of Guinea and Cape Verde which remain under the occupation of the Portuguese aggressors have been completely liberated. In that struggle for the consolidation of national independence and eradication of foreign occupation, Tanzania will provide its maximum support. It will also be our duty to do all we can to help this new State join the family of nations in this our United Nations, should they so desire. This is going to be one of the historic test cases to indicate whether the United Nations can stand firm on the side of self-determination, independence and freedom.\n28.\tWe strongly appeal to the whole membership of the group of non-aligned nations and to all States to extend recognition to this new State.\n29.\tIt also gives me special pleasure, on behalf of the Government and the people of Tanzania, to welcome the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a country with which we share a common background and aspirations. Its attainment of independence and subsequent admission to membership in the Organization is yet another victory of the ideals for which the United Nations stands, namely, the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence. We look forward to close collaboration and co-operation with its delegation.\n30.\tThe admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization is an important and historic event. The presence here of those two States is a manifestation of that spirit of detente which we welcome. It brings nearer the realization of the lofty goals of universality which is so fundamental for the effectiveness of our Organization.\n31.\tIn welcoming the German Democratic Republic we take cognisance of the significant role which the Government and the people of that country play in the liberation struggle of the colonial peoples and their support for justice and freedom in all its forms and manifestations.\n32.\tIn equally welcoming the Federal Republic of Germany, we would wish to express our earnest hope that that Government will assume its obligations and responsibilities in a concrete manner with regard to the problem of southern Africa. We have noted with interest the vigorous efforts which that Government, under the leadership of Chancellor Brandt, has deployed on the question of detente in Europe, and we sincerely hope that equal concern will be manifested in the problems which are so vital to the African people. After all, it is only through understanding clearly the problems of southern Africa that the Federal Republic of Germany can hope to have meaningful friendly relations with Africa.\n33.\tOur warm welcome also goes to the Office of the Permanent Observer of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has just opened its offices at the United Nations. While this is a modest step towards the final goal, our primary hope remains that the Korean people will be allowed to reunite peacefully and without external interference so that that great country may one day also join our Organization as one country.\n34.\tThe Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania learned with great shock and profound sorrow of the tragic and untimely death of President Salvador Allende of Chile. As we know, the constitutionally and democratically elected President Allende fell in the violent military take-over which recently befell the Chilean people. He died in combat, fighting to defend the ideals he had pursued throughout his life, the ideals of freedom, justice and human dignity.\n35.\tPresident Allende was a staunch patriot, one who pursued the economic liberation to which the people of Chile look for the fulfilment of their aspirations. He devoted his entire efforts to the liberation of the Chilean people from the evils of ignorance, poverty and disease. He sought hard to transform Chilean society into a socialist society where prosperity would go hand in hand with equality and justice. Under his leadership the Chilean people had made great strides towards the fulfilment of those goals, but the forces of imperialism, reaction and injustice have relentlessly accelerated their pressures to undermine the efforts of the Chilean people. The tragic events in Chile are the culmination of the long and well-known machinations of reactionary forces. They demonstrate the ruthlessness of neo-colonialism and economic imperialism.\n36.\tThe death of President Allende is a great loss to all those who strive to build a prosperous world where justice and human dignity will prevail. It is, indeed, a singular blow to the third world. President Allende has died a martyr to those ideals, not only for his own people but for the entire masses of the world. His life has been terminated, but we in Tanzania believe that his spirit will continue to spur us on, in pursuit of the lofty ideals for which he sacrificed his life. The Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania extend their profound and heartfelt condolences to the family of President Allende and to the people of Chile.\n37.\tThe developing world must learn from the events in Chile that international monopolies will go to any lengths, including murder, to ensure their continued exploitation of our countries. We raise our hats to all those victims of the murders which are now going on in Chile in an attempt to silence those who stand for the complete liberation of their country.\n38.\tAs we gather here it is pertinent to note that the trend of events in the world has been towards the reduction of tension. The adoption of the policy of negotiation instead of confrontation among the major Powers of the world, as exemplified by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other contacts elsewhere, have all been moves designed to increase the possibility of peace. Tanzania welcomes that trend. However, while we welcome such trends, notice must be taken of the fact that these improved chances of peace have not necessarily brought justice. There are still very many places in the world where justice is flagrantly flouted and injustice venerated. In Indo-China, despite recent developments towards peace there, the aggressors still support the puppet regimes in Cambodia and Viet-Nam against the forces of liberation. In the Middle East, forces of occupation continue to consolidate and enjoy the fruits of conquest, contrary to the principles of our Charter. State terrorism is being adopted as an instrument of policy and the rights of Palestinians are being flouted. And in southern Africa, despite all manifestations of the people's will against oppression, relentless efforts are being made, sometimes with the connivance of some of those Members of our Organization primarily responsible for peace-keeping, to continue that oppression.\n39.\tThese situations, which are fraught with injustice, could still reverse the very significant steps which have been made towards peace. Peace can only last if it is based on a firm foundation of justice, for without justice the world can have only the facade of peace. In this context, note must be taken of the fact that so long as there still remains one spot in the world where injustice exists, that spot could jeopardize all efforts which are being made for the attainment of world peace. Lack of security in one continent affects the security of the other continents. That is why peace must be based on justice everywhere. It is an illusion, for example, to build the foundations of peace in Europe and neglect the explosive situation in southern Africa. Inevitably, the events in that region will affect the security of the European continent. Let me repeat \u2014 justice must be universal and indivisible or peace will not last.\n40.\tThe Middle East remains an area of high tension. Injustice and aggression continue to be perpetrated and consolidated. Israel not only has continued to cling to the territories that it illegally occupies but has also adopted measures geared towards the permanent occupation of some of those lands. That has remained so despite all the efforts which have been exerted in search of a solution. The Government of Israel has become so arrogant, so contemptuous, that it not only has refused to respond favourably to numerous warnings and calls by this Organization but has also embarked on deliberate and calculated acts of aggression. It has adopted terrorism as State policy. It was in pursuance of that policy that that Government, in contempt of all norms of international practice and in breach of international law, violated the air space of ILebanon to intercept a civilian aircraft on a scheduled flight and thereby endangered civilian life. That Government has sent its troops into Lebanon, sometimes even in the presence of television cameras, to commit murder. And how can we forget the despicable and senseless act of shooting down a civilian Libyan aircraft, with the tragic loss of so many lives?\n41.\tBy any standards, this is an incredible record of violation of the principles of the United Nations. There\\\" is no doubt that these acts have made the situation more explosive and peace all the more elusive.\n42.\tIn the face of this serious threat to international peace and security, the United Nations must fully assume its responsibility if we are to avert another military confrontation in that area. The United Nations must act, and act decisively, to eliminate the consequences of aggression and in favour of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Considering the obduracy and intransigence of Israel in this connexion, the United Nations can no longer be content with the passage of mere moralistic resolutions. Enforcement of the decisions of the Organization is indeed long overdue.\n43.\tLet me now turn to the question of the Palestinian people. It is absurd for our Organization and indeed cruel, to say the least, that thousands of Palestinians should be made to live in tents for ever. Yet every time this Assembly meets we seem to sweep under the carpet the Palestinian problem which actually is the root-cause of the Middle East question.\n44.\tIt would be illusory to imagine that the Middle East question could be solved without finding a solution to the Palestinian people's plight. To ignore this is, to say the least, to postpone the inevitable. It is, therefore, the hope of my delegation that this Assembly will sincerely look into this matter and start to find a just solution which the Palestinians have for so long awaited from this Organization.\n45.\tAt the beginning of this year an agreement was signed in Paris with a view to bringing peace to Viet-Nam.  It was an agreement that sent a welcome wave of deep relief throughout the world. For the immediate effect of that agreement was to bring an end to the traumatic savagery that had so vividly characterized United States imperialism in that unhappy land for more than a decade. The world could not but feel relieved at that important development, which signified a great victory for the Viet-Namese people and the forces of peace throughout the world. Like the rest of mankind, therefore, the Government and people of Tanzania welcomed the Paris Agreement.\n46.\tThe Paris Agreement testified to the resilience of the Viet-Namese people and demonstrated the invincibility of a people struggling for its rights against formidable odds. It was clearly shown that brutality and the might of even the most powerful of nations could not and cannot subdue the will of a people determined to be free. That is the lesson of Viet-Nam and that is the inspiration which all those who are struggling for freedom and justice draw from the indomitable spirit and heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people.\n47.\tIt is regrettable that the lessons of Viet-Nam have not been fully comprehended in relation to Cambodia. There the United States continues to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Cambodian people by propping up the puppet regime of Lon Nol. While bowing to the legitimate demands of the American people and the international community to put an end to the barbarous bombing, the United States\n. continues to bolster the economic and military capacity of that besieged regime, desperately trying to give reality to its pretences. It is our hope that, instead of proceeding on this misguided course, the objective realities of Cambodia will be realized and the international community as a whole will accord recognition to the only legitimate and rightful Government of Cambodia, under the leadership of the Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\n48.\tThe people of Indo-China have known war and suffering for too long. They are as much entitled to enjoy peace as those who are responsible for their misery. But the only way to achieve this noble objective is to leave the people of that region to determine their own destiny.\n49.\tThe people of Korea have for many years been divided, largely because of foreign interference \u2014 again by the United States. The situation in Korea is both ironical and anachronistic. Ironical, because the name of the United Nations and its flag continue to be used as a cover for foreign troops which serve the interests of imperialism through war-mongering and other forms of instigation and promotion of conflict. Anachronistic, because we are made to understand that the era of the cold war is ended. Yet the victims of the cold war continue to be divided from kith and kin. The longer we allow this situation to continue the more cynicism we invite from those who look to the United Nations for salvation.\n50.\tThe Korean people have rejected foreign interference in Korea's internal affairs and pledged to unite through peaceful means. Failure by the United Nations to respond to these favourable indications of the possibility of a peaceful reunification of Korea cannot but display hypocrisy on our part, and heavy would be our responsibility for any worsening of the Korean situation. I find it very strange that, while we all talk about the role of the United Nations as being primarily to promote peace in the world, the flag of this Organization is being used by one \u2014 I repeat, one \u2014 super-Power for aggressive purposes in Korea. Yet when the matter is raised we all seem either not to care or to imagine that to say no to such a super-Power would break up our Organization. We ought to tell this superpower that we can no longer tolerate the use of the United Nations flag to further the international aggrandizement of a super-Power.\n51.\tIt is therefore, the hope of my delegation that, in connexion with the new item on the creation of favourable conditions for an independent, peaceful reunification of Korea [item 41 (b)], the draft resolution sponsored by more than 20 Powers and calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and the termination of the so-called United Nations Command in Korea,, will this year be adopted and implemented immediately.\n52.\tIn Africa, the injustice of colonialism and racism sustained by the continued intransigence of the colonial, racist minority regimes remains.\n53.\tIn the Portuguese colonies, the situation has taken an even more sad turn. As the tide for liberation grows, and as the people, led by their national liberation movements, gain more victories, the Portuguese authorities become more desperate. They have resorted to barbarous acts of violence and genocide. The callous murder of the gallant fighter and leader of the people of Guinea-Bissau, Amilcar Cabral, is an eloquent testimony of this desperation and their bankruptcy in policy. In Mozambique, Angola and Guinea- Bissau that regime has committed atrocities and mass murders of extraordinary proportion. The recent murders at Wiriyamu in Mozambique is only one of the many similar massacres \u2014 I repeat, it is one of the similar massacres \u2014 that that regime has been committing in Africa. Mass murder is being used as an instrument of policy to perpetuate a colonial situation. It was indeed naive and ridiculous for the Portuguese to attempt to vindicate their innocence by sending a hastily hand-picked group of journalists to investigate murders, when all we know is that they went on a guided tour arranged by the very Portuguese who selected them. If the Portuguese were really interested injustice, in finding out whether the murders in Wiriyamu took place or not, then they would institute an impartial inquiry.\n54.\tThe rejection by the Portuguese authorities of a call by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for an- impartial investigation of those who were involved in the massacre clearly confirms the perpetration of these brutalities. The international community must remain convinced of the authenticity of these murders. After all, the disclosure was made by honest. God-fearing Catholic priests who in our view had nothing to gain from fabricating such cold-blooded murders of defenceless women and children.\n55.\tThese massacres are sufficient reason for taking all the measures against Portugal which were taken against the Nazis, who continue to be hunted for their crimes up to the present day. In this context, therefore, those who collaborate with Portugal in trade, in the supplying of arms and a training programme for soldiers, or in giving any form of support and assistance must reflect on the result of their actions. Any form of collaboration with Portugal not only gives it the desperately needed political support and a sense of respectability, but indeed enables it to perpetuate the colonial situation, and to commit more mass murders for which those who provide such support cannot remain blameless.\n56.\tThe illegal minority regime of Rhodesia not only has increased oppression in that country, but has shown the boldness of desperation by sending troops to fight in Mozambique, and threatening neighbouring Zambia. Internally, it has adopted measures of repression to suppress the people of Zimbabwe. It has recently committed several cold-blooded murders of freedom fighters. Collective punishment has been introduced and carried out. The leaders of the nationalist and liberation movements have either been detained or restricted in their activities. Measures to introduce apartheid have been accelerated. Yet, the people have consistently and with determination continued to reject domination. They have conclusively rejected the sell-out proposals as reflected in the Pearce report. The forces for freedom in Zimbabwe continue to agitate for meaningful change, and the liberation movements have consolidated their activities in Zimbabwe. The requirements of the situation dictate that this Organization and its Members give support to these efforts and intensify our action against that regime.\n57.\tSanctions not only should be comprehensive and total, but must, in particular, be extended to all mail and air transport. They should also be extended to the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa as well as to South Africa, which have been the greatest \\\"sanction-busters\\\". It is pertinent, in this connexion, to emphasize the importance of implementing the United Nations resolutions and the denial of all co-operation with the illegal regime in Rhodesia. It was in recognition of this cardinal principle that my Government was dismayed by the violation of sanctions by the United States in its importation of chrome 6\nfrom Rhodesia. We hope, therefore, that the United States Government will now take the necessary measures to ensure the scrupulous observance of the Security Council decisions on sanctions, especially when the United States is one of the permanent members of the Security Council. In this connexion my Government expresses its appreciation to all those well-meaning American legislators who are exerting their efforts to secure the repeal of the Byrd amendment to the Military Procurement Act of 1972, which would lead to the reinforcement of the Security Council sanctions. We call equally upon all those States which, in one form or another, violate these mandatory sanctions to take appropriate measures to put an end to such violations.\n58.\tThe problem of Namibia remains unresolved. When the idea of initiating contacts between the South African racists and the Secretary-General was first put up, my Government viewed it with scepticism. We very much hoped that our scepticism would have been proved wrong. However, the results of these talks have confirmed our original fears. Not only have the South African racist authorities refused to answer positively the questions put to them, but they have also shown a great lack of good faith by going ahead with the implementation of apartheid measures in Namibia.\n59.\tThis bad faith has been demonstrated through the creation of the so-called homelands in Kavangoland and elsewhere, and the establishment of the so-called advisory council against the expressed wishes of the people of Namibia. They have, further, arrested people who have been opposed to the continued illegal presence of that regime in Namibia. The racists have used these talks to entrench themselves in Namibia, while attempting to confuse the international community and world opinion as to their true intentions. Yet, the people of Namibia have continued to express their opposition to such entrenchment with firmness and determination.\n60.\tThe failure of the recent so-called elections for the establishment of homelands in Namibia is eloquent evidence of this. We find no encouragement, therefore, in the continuation of the contacts which were initiated in 1972 between the Secretary-General and the South African racist authorities pursuant to Security Council resolution 309 (1972) and the other subsequent resolutions.\n61.\tWe would all the same wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring effort in this regard, which is a reflection of his genuine concern over the problem of Namibia. What is now urgently needed is the intensification of support and the provision of material assistance to the people of Namibia, through their liberation movement, in their just struggle. Of no less importance is the need for all States to abide by all the appropriate measures of the United Nations and all its organs geared towards the liquidation of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African racist regime.\n62.\tWe meet in the wake of another Sharpeville-like massacre of innocent people by the South African racist authorities at Carletonville, South Africa. Those callous murders not only illustrate the decay of the South African system; they also portray the utter disregard for human life by the South African apartheid regime. The rationalization of these murders and the commendation of the conduct of the murderers by the South African authorities is further evidence of their degeneration. South Africa's consistent role as a bastion of colonialism and racism in southern Africa and its willingness to accept the role of bolstering the already outlawed illegal regime in Rhodesia serve further to expose the brutal and lawless nature of the Pretoria regime. Yet to many of us in this Assembly South Africa's unrepentant and persistent aggression against our very humanity is a matter of common knowledge, its recalcitrancy is already legendary. But the question that arises is how long we of this Organization can remain impotent in the face of this inhumanity. How much longer can we tolerate the myth that the regime of the racists in Pretoria can speak on behalf of the people of South Africa? I submit that each day that apartheid is allowed to reign supreme in South Africa constitutes 24 hours of scandal and disgrace for civilized humanity and our Organization.\n63.\tWe must all resolve to take definite and effective measures to end this anachronistic system before its effects engulf us all in a racial holocaust. In this connexion, I should like to inform this Assembly that Tanzania, in its fight against racism in southern Africa, devotes a lot of time on the radio to combating racism. I should like to take this opportunity to invite the Office of Public Information of the United Nations to take advantage of and to utilize our facilities. This will indeed be our humble contribution to the fight against racism. My Government would be prepared to take up this matter with the people concerned in the Secretariat.\n64.\tThis year the United Nations is to convene the preliminary session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which this Assembly decided should take place next year [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)/. At its last session in Geneva this summer the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction was to finalize its work to enable the Conference to proceed as scheduled. Although the Committee has failed to produce the agreed draft articles on some of the subjects and issues, it is worth while noting that, in trying to formulate the draft articles, a thorough, substantive and political debate was conducted. We believe that the Committee has done what was possible under the. circumstances prevailing. No prolongation of the mandate of that Committee is likely to produce any better results. It is therefore the view of my delegation that the Conference can and should proceed as scheduled. I should like to state from this rostrum that if the Conference is held in Chile now, under the present junta, my Government will not attend.\n65.\tEvents in the arena of the oceans point to the urgent need for the international community to take appropriate action if a scramble, with all its consequential evils, is to be avoided in that area of the globe which not only constitutes the greater portion of our environment but also bears immense living and non-living resources. To allow such a scramble to happen will spell not only the revival of aggravation of political tensions and further deterioration of the ocean environment but also the passing into the hands of a few technologically advanced States of the inestimable wealth which lies in the ocean space.\n66.\tThe situation facing us indicates the urgency of holding the Conference on the Law of the Sea without any further delay. Let us not allow this opportunity to slip from us, lest it be too late and the impending situation, as it threatens to occur, becomes impossible to reverse. Let me repeat that we hope the organizers of the Conference will find it possible to select a venue other than Chile, the venue that has been envisaged.\n67.\tWe see today in the world economic situation much that could be improved. When the Second United Nations Development Decade was launched, we placed much hope in its success.' Yet the results have been disappointing, judging by the performance of the year 1972. Only one third of the developing countries exceeded the over-all target of a 6 per cent annual growth rate. Half of these territories failed to achieve even a 5 per cent annual growth rate and in one fifth of these countries there was an actual decline in the per capita income. The low-growth group accounted for about 40 per cent of the population of the developing countries.\n68.\tThis situation has arisen largely because of the mood of uncertainty in trade patterns and monetary systems. The failure of the developed countries to meet their commitment to transfer resources to developing countries has not helped matters. While the price of manufactured goods has gone up, that of primary agricultural products has gone down. The measures taken by the developing countries, therefore, have been subjected to conditions beyond their control and hence they have not been able to reap the benefits of their increased efforts. Debt servicing by the poorer nations is becoming increasingly unbearable, if not intolerable. Thus, this unwelcome economic situation has resulted in several adverse effects on the economies of developing countries. Should things be left to follow this present trend, it will not be just a matter of the gap between the haves and have-nots widening, but, more importantly, we shall be doing further violence to the principles of this Organization to improve the economic and the social situation of the peoples of our world.\n69.\tWe in Tanzania have learned one hard fact, that there is no substitute for the theory of self-reliance; that in spite of the many conferences we may go to on the question of economic development, we must nevertheless understand that it is only through self-reliance that we can find meaningful progress for our country.\n70.\tIn my address I have attempted to discuss some of the burning problems of our era. Throughout, I have emphasized the need to extend the spirit of rapprochement and to gear the purposes of just solutions to the outstanding problems which continue to bedevil us. Throughout, I have emphasized that the prerequisite of durable peace is the eradication of all injustice. For, as the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States, held in Algiers, pointed out:\n\\\"As long as colonial wars, apartheid, imperialist aggression, alien domination, foreign occupation and power politics, economic exploitation and plunder prevail, peace will prove limited in principle and scope. In a world where, besides a minority of rich countries there exists a majority of poor countries, it would be dangerous to increase such division by restricting peace to the prosperous areas of the world while the rest of mankind remained condemned to insecurity and domination by the most powerful. Peace is indivisible: it could not be reduced to a mere shifting of confrontation from one area to another, nor should it condone the continued existence of tension in some areas while endeavouring to eliminate it elsewhere. Detente would remain precarious if it did not take into consideration the interests of the other countries.\\\" \n71.\tThe millions of Africans who still live under the humiliation and the degradation of slavery under colonialism in their own countries are waiting to hear from this Organization whether they, too, can one day expect freedom and justice from us.\n72.\tThousands of children who have been made orphans by the bombs and massacres of the enemy whose conduct debases our very humanity are asking us, asking the United Nations, whether they too will one day raise their children in conditions of peace which we in the United Nations have so much talked about.\n73.\tMillions of women and children in Indo-China .who have never known \u2014 I repeat, have never known \u2014 a home are looking to us to create a world where they, too, can one day sleep under a roof without the fear of war.\n74.\tIn the Middle East I can hear the voices of a million Palestinians asking the United Nations how long they can continue to live a life that has neither hope nor expectation.\n75.\tIn Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, even in some poorer areas of Europe, in the slums of the big cities of the world where millions have never known the luxury of two meals or the pleasure of bread and butter, I hear the same question, How long until our Organization and the multitude of our economic conferences will be meaningful to them to ensure their ability to have two meals a day?\n76.\tHow long? How long shall this Organization continue to feed such hopes with slogans and unimplemented resolutions. This Organization has a herculean task towards the fulfilment of these hopes.\n77.\tLet us therefore rededicate ourselves to the cause of building peace on the firm foundation of justice. It is only by doing so, that we shall be able to achieve the objectives of the Charter \u2014 peace for everyone, everywhere, based on justice and respect for human dignity."

        "file_text": "\ufeff77.\t After greeting you, Sir, most respectfully, I am happy to begin my intervention, as head of the Nicaraguan delegation, with an expression of congratulations to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who was elected President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. To his outstanding personal achievements and his long experience in the work of this Organization must be added the fact that he represents Ecuador, a country that enjoys a preferred place in the affections of us all. Latin America has been honoured by this choice.\n78.\tMay I also congratulate Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for the wise and efficient manner in which he presided over the session of the General Assembly last year.\n79.\tI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, whose untiring efforts in favour of the purposes of the Organization deserve our full recognition and appreciation.\n80.\tI come before this world forum as representative of a country that only nine months ago was the victim of a devastating earthquake, which almost entirely destroyed our capital city.\n81.\tThis painful tragedy was an occasion for an expression of human solidarity in the form of assistance rendered to us in such a noble, generous and timely manner by international organizations, Governments and private individuals alike. May I express to them all the profound gratitude of the people and Government of Nicaragua who will never forget those who lent them a helping hand in their hour of need?\n82.\tI wish most especially to tell Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, that the Nicaraguan people will never forget his interest, his efforts and his constant preoccupation with the tragedy that beset our country. We are also most grateful to him for his vision in choosing his able assistant, the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Bradford Morse, to direct the assistance rendered to our country.\n83.\tI could not come before this General Assembly without being the bearer of the expressions of gratitude of our people for all the co-operation extended to it without any discrimination in such tragic? moments.\n84.\tThanks to the assistance it received, the Nicaraguan people has been able to overcome its grief, and the work of reconstruction is well under way. It is, however, a hard struggle, and our people look to this Assembly for a resolution that will lay down the necessary norms in order that we may find in the United Nations greater facilities to help us out of our despair and assist us in the reconstruction of our destroyed capital city, without disrupting our economy, while at the same time assisting our people in its spiritual and material resurgence, and helping it to overcome the trauma that still has our children and adults in its grip. A sister country, a peaceful and friendly people, must not be abandoned, for now, more than ever, they need your co-operation, the co-operation I am requesting with the dignity and patriotism of which we Nicaraguans have always been so justly proud.\n85.\tI believe that in our hearts we all harbour mixed feelings regarding the attitude of the international community and the behaviour of political groups and States.\n86.\tOn the one hand, the situations of conflict in the Middle East have not been solved, and there is not even a glimmer of hope for their solution, while the danger exists that violence may again erupt at any moment.\n87.\tMoreover, we have been witnessing an increase in terrorist acts which are repugnant to human conscience and the only effect of which is the repudiation of those who commit such atrocities and of those who favour or allow such acts to be perpetrated.\n88.\tOn the other hand, we are extremely pleased with the turn of events in the relations between the larger and more powerful countries on earth. They have abandoned the cold war policies and, setting aside ideological differences, have reached agreements that augur greater co-operation among them for the benefit of world peace. It is not that we intend to leave to the great Powers the exclusive responsibility for peace, for all of us, large an; small, must co-operate towards that end. But we must be realistic and recognize that, while all co-operation efforts have the same intrinsic value, they do not carry the same weight.\n89.\tIt is only fair to recognize that such concrete achievements in the search for peace as the end of the fighting in Viet-Nam and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin have been the result of diplomatic negotiations between the great Powers, rather than of the efforts of smaller countries or deliberations in the world forum of the United Nations.\n90.\tAnd yet, rather than discourage us, such achievements should encourage us to support this Organization, to correct its deficiencies and strengthen its authority and prestige.\n91.\tIn addition, we must never forget that true peace is not based on the absence of violence alone; it must be founded on justice \u2014 not only justice for individuals within States, but justice for States within the international community. And just as internal peace cannot be achieved while social injustice continues, so, too, there can be no international peace while there are irritating differences, such as the existence of highly developed countries, on the one hand, and, on the other, under-developed countries, whose populations not only struggle against poverty, disease and ignorance, but are deprived of the right to an equitable share in the natural wealth and resources of their countries. I sincerely believe that the United Nations can, and must, play an important role. We must all pledge our efforts to this end.\n92.\tI must make special reference to the satisfaction with which we have welcomed the arrangement between the two German States which has made possible their admission as Members of this Organization. We believe that such an arrangement might serve as an inspiration to other countries that are in a similar situation and help them to settle their differences.\n93.\tIt is the foreign policy of my country to support any initiative aiming at the establishment of peace and security. But we believe that true peace cannot and should not be imposed. Rather, we must try to create a favourable climate for co-operation among States, and especially we must help to facilitate means of communications between States in conflict, so that it will be primarily those States that will seek mutually acceptable solutions to their differences. Resolutions which tend to exacerbate tensions, to intensify differences and harden positions will never benefit the cause of peace. Quite the contrary; by such means we would only be contributing to a prolongation of the conflict.\n94.\tThere is not a single State that does not pay lip-service to the cause of peace, but in many cases that dedication is not translated into deeds. When the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is not accepted, or when it is accepted with reservations that make it inoperative, we are not working for peace. When manifestations of colonialism over peoples sufficiently prepared to choose their own destiny continue, we are not working for peace. When obstacles are raised to disarmament, and particularly to the elimination of chemical, bacteriological and atomic weapons, we are not working for peace. When human rights are not respected, and when due support is not given to international co-operation for development, we are not working for peace.\n95.\tI believe that the consideration of the question of the economic and social consequences of the arms race and its highly detrimental effects on world peace and security [item 29] is of particular importance. Two years ago we welcomed with satisfaction a report on this subject prepared by the Secretary-General.  We must now keep this report before us, ponder its contents and use it as a source of inspiration in our deliberations on questions dealing with disarmament.\n96.\tI stated earlier that, in my country's view, there can be no true peace without development, and that the achievement of that development calls for active international co-operation.\n97.\tIn accordance with the Charter of our Organization, the Economic and Social Council, under the authority of the General Assembly, should determine the international policies for co-operation in the economic, social, educational and health fields, as well as the co-ordination of such activities. My country is gratified at the large number of ratifications of the amendment to the Charter which was approved in 1971, and which has raised to 54 the membership of the Council.\n98.\tMy country believes that this increase in the membership, which will allow for a more equitable geographic representation for the distribution of seats, will strengthen the Council and help it better to discharge its functions. We may even hope that within the Council we may reach that much-desired agreement between developed and developing countries concerning their respective responsibilities in the field of international co-operation.\n99.\tDuring my country's recent emergency, to which I have already referred, we received ample co-operation from the various United Nations development funds and programmes for development. May I again express my gratitude to the countries that contributed such assistance and the officials who administered it? Nicaragua believes that special priority should be given to the strengthening of such funds and programmes and to the creation of sufficient fund allocations to assist Governments in cases of natural disasters and similar contingencies.\n100.\tWe should also contemplate assistance for the forecasting and prevention of disasters, as well as measures aimed at preventing or reducing damage.\n101.\tParticular importance should be attached to the United Nations Environment Programme adopted last year. The proposed United Nations Conference-Exposition on Human Settlements should also prove beneficial to mankind.\n102.\tIn the course of our deliberations we shall have before us the report of the Trade and Development Board [A/9015/Rev.l] of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD].\n103.\tWe fully understand that the debates in UNCTAD on the liberalization of trade were difficult, and we express the hope that this year's round of negotiations held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will succeed in eliminating the barriers that prevent or hamper trade among nations, and in many cases unfavourably affect the developing countries.\n104.\tThe Trade and Development Board is seized of the proposed charter on rights and duties of States drawn up by a working group following on a proposal of the President of\nMexico, Mr. Luis Echeverria Alvarez. Nicaragua believes that in the present circumstances of inflation, high cost of living and monetary instability there is an urgent need to accelerate the process which would make it possible to crystallize basic principles on this most important subject.\n105.\tWith reference to human rights as enshrined in the' Universal Declaration, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of which is to be celebrated on 10 December this year, my delegation will support proposals aiming at the strengthening of international protection, particularly in the case of armed conflict, religious intolerance and racial discrimination.\n\n106.\tAs regards the legal questions before us for consideration, my Government believes that the items dealing with international co-operation in the peaceful uses, of outer space [item 30] and 'the preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [item 31] are of particular significance. We believe that much progress has been made but that there is still much to be done and, in particular, that ye must lay emphasis on devising ways and means that will enable developing countries to share in the utilization of outer space, thus benefiting from the progress achieved in space technology.\n107.\tBut we consider the question of the law of the sea to be of even more immediate interest. Last year we agreed to hold the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, with preparatory meetings to be held in November and December of this year and a second stage to discuss matters of substance next year. In our view, this time-table should be maintained. Should the preparatory work require longer, I believe that the work could still be completed in the time available to us.\n108.\tWe are firmly convinced that the law of the sea must be updated, and the sooner the better, thus eliminating an\n' important source of actual and potential conflict. Should the present situation continue, those conflicts would be aggravated and would endanger world peace.\n109.\tNicaragua advocates the creation of a zone beyond the territorial sea of each State wherein that State would enjoy exclusive rights over the natural resources of the sea without impinging on the legitimate interests of the international community, especially as regards navigation. Only thus would it be possible for each State to meet its responsibilities for preserving its natural resources for the benefit of its people without infringing the rights of others.\n110.\tAs regards the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, where the possibilities of commercial exploitation increase daily, every effort should be made to secure a consensus on a system of management leading to the utilization of this common heritage of mankind.\n111.\tThe agenda includes as items for deliberation a draft convention drawn up by the International Law Commission on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons [item 90], and \\\"Measures to prevent international terrorism which endangers or takes innocent human lives or jeopardizes fundamental freedoms, and study of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts of violence which lie in misery, frustration, grievance and despair and which cause some people to sacrifice human lives, including their own, in an attempt to effect radical changes\\\" [item 94].\n112.\tAlthough these two items are not necessarily connected, they are closely related in practice. On this subject,\nI\tshould like to quote General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who addressed this Assembly in 1970 when he was President of Nicaragua, and said:\n\\\"Our America also lives these upheavals. With the unwise granting of refuge to airplane hijackers, mankind is threatened; with the kidnapping and murder of diplomats and other persons, the most fundamental rights of man are violated; with the abuse of the right of asylum, the substance of a humanitarian American institution is distorted; and with mass exiling, political imprisonment and firing squads, the despair of peoples is increased. Until these activities are no longer indulged in, there can be no real peace in the world.\\\" \n113.\tMy country has ratified the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of Terrorism Taking the Form of Crimes against Persons and Related Extortion that are of International Significance. It has also ratified the Conventions of Tokyo, The Hague and Montreal on air piracy and is ready to support any measure aiming at the prevention and repression of these crimes which are repugnant to the international conscience.\n114.\tWe believe that, rather than embarking on theoretical debates on the causes and definition of terrorism, which can be prolonged indefinitely, we should focus on concrete and practical measures.\n115.\tWe also believe that at the current session of the General Assembly we must consider the functions of the International Court of Justice and the reform of its Statute as far as its headquarters is concerned, subjects that have been before us for consideration on repeated occasions. It is very important to give that body of our Organization the greatest possible support so that it may better discharge its functions for the solution of international conflicts.\n116.\tAs I come to the end of my statement, I should like to reiterate the determination of my country to co-operate in the strengthening of peace and justice among nations.\n117 If we proceed thus, we shall have implemented the fundamental principle of our Organization and helped to bring happiness to the whole of mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff60.\tMr. President, it is no mere duty but a real pleasure for me, in coming to the rostrum, to pay a tribute to you, the distinguished representative of Ecuador, and through you to the great Latin American community. I greet your country also as a good Pacific neighbour in the southern hemisphere, and we express the hope that every success will attend your efforts.\n61.\tThis is a session of the Assembly at which we will be assessing the growing relaxation of tensions and the breaking down of the old barriers between East and West.\n62.\tThe debates and the welcome action taken here on new Members are, of course, both a symbol and a practical result of these developments. But other results of the new relationship among the great Powers have still to be translated into practical benefits for the smaller countries and for this Organization. That new great Power relationship, that relaxation, has been brought about by a concert of convenience among the few. But we, the smaller nations, who need stable peace, co-operation and international order cannot rest satisfied with such a temporary and fragile situation. We have to find a way to build upon the relaxation, to bring it within a larger, more constructive and more permanent framework of international order.\n63.\tA \\\"balance of power\\\" among the great Powers has doubtless contributed to the new spirit of relaxation in international affairs; and to that extent we of course welcome it. But we are not naive. \\\"Balance of power\\\" in the past has been merely another term for the continuation, in a different guise, of competition and rivalry. The great Powers have continued their efforts to shift the balance in their direction; and in due course they have miscalculated, the balance has collapsed and major wars have occurred. In so far as similar elements are inherent in the present situation the world will continue unstable and the detente will be fragile. For, let us not forget, the great Powers still remain free to undertake their unilateral actions. And some of those unilateral, often sadly misguided, actions have brought great suffering in recent years and set back the progress of wide sections of the whole human family. In this nuclear age unfettered freedom on the part of the more powerful members of the family of nations is too dangerous. The great Powers are beginning at last to show signs of recognizing this. We, and they, in their interests as well as ours, must move to repair the damaged structure of international order. They are establishing some sort of balance among themselves; our task is to build a framework for a healthier relationship between the so-called great and the small.\n64.\tAs the head of a newly elected Labour Government, I come to the international scene new; but the needs of the day seem startlingly obvious. Leaving aside the question of international security and international order, the chief need among nations is the same as the chief need within individual nations  \u2014  that is, to achieve economic and social justice. That is the principal concern of my own Government at home; and I am convinced that it must also be the focal concern of the United Nations.\n65.\tWe view with profound concern and dismay a situation in which, more than a quarter of a century after the United Nations was founded, the most critical of issues show no sign of improvement. I refer to the immense and growing gap between standards of living in the industrialized countries and the developing countries. I refer to the world food situation, which is more difficult than at any time since the aftermath of the Second World War. I refer to the rapidly multiplying world population and the other pressures on available resources. These are the obvious ills of international society, complicated still further by an international monetary instability that jeopardizes the development plans of all countries, by the rapid price inflation in much of the world and, this year, by crop failures and famines.\n66.\tWe are in no doubt about the need to tackle more seriously the deepening division between the rich and the poor. It is depressing and deplorable  \u2014  indeed it is intolerable  \u2014  that most of the international conferences of the last decade or more have ultimately evolved along lines dividing the developed from the developing and in ways and with results in some cases which have reflected no credit on countries which were better off than others. Somehow-and sooner, not later  \u2014  resources must be more equitably shared.\n67.\tA few countries, a minority of the human family, are using the bulk of the world's resources-resources which we now increasingly realize are exhaustible. Yet, ironically, the ever-increasing consumption of these resources is steadily bringing less and less real enjoyment to the favoured few. An increasing number among them are realizing the dead end  \u2014  the literal dead end  \u2014  of a philosophy and a way of life favouring the accumulation of material things to the point of greed and senselessness. It is a philosophy that in its time brought immense material benefits; but the cost to society of its pursuit to excess is now being plainly revealed. Rich countries, at some time, must appreciate that enough is enough. The richer countries must turn consciously towards improving the more intangible qualities of life for themselves while making their energies and skills available to improve, to a far greater extent than ever before, the material level of life for the majority of poorer countries.\n68.\tI mean, in other words, that a change in attitudes is required. If not, we run the risk that solutions will impose themselves by means of famine, pestilence, the exhaustion of resources and every form of social unrest and war. There is no need to manage so foolishly the resources of this beautiful planet. If this smacks of Idealism I make no apology for it. If there are no ideals there is no hope. We could do with more of the idealism with which we entered the post-war era  \u2014  an idealism which has been pressed out by the weight of paper and speeches and resolutions and, yes, by the many sobering practical experiences of the last 28 years. One could, I can see it. be disillusioned and cynical. But it is imperative that we should act as if we believe the human race has a future. This may be idealistic, but I am not talking idealism, I am talking practicalities. The world has to move on to new courses if we are to survive. It is a matter of practical common sense.\n69.\tMy Government, since taking office, has been trying to put its convictions into effect  \u2014  though I speak in no boastful way, for I am conscious of how small our efforts are when measured against the needs of others. But we are trying to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our domestic policies. We have reviewed our mutual assistance programmes against the internationally accepted targets which now form part of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We did so because it seemed to us that there was no greater or more urgent priority confronting us in international affairs  \u2014  at least among those priorities which we, as a non-great Power, were in a position to do anything about. We were especially concerned about the possibility of failure of the Strategy for the Second Development Decade implicit in the decision of many countries to maintain reservations about the targets of the Strategy. In a world where millions continue to go hungry New Zealand has not felt able to rest on its achievements despite a steady growth in the size of our aid programme in absolute terms.\n70.\tMy Government has therefore withdrawn previous reservations  on the Strategy targets. We shall seek to meet them. Notably, we have drawn up a programme of government aid which aims to increase more than threefold the existing flow of aid over the next three-year period. We hope to play our part through membership in the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme next year in ensuring expanded and equitable policies of United Nations aid for countries in need of it.\n71.\tThe process of working to improve conditions of life can never be one-sided; it is a mutual one. In the South Pacific in particular and in South-East Asia, which are areas of close interest to us, we look forward to continued co-operation with the countries of the region. Their resources and skills and the efforts of their peoples are an all-important factor and will deserve the major credit for success if the Second Decade's targets are gained. We have seen the way self-government and independence have drawn forth those skills in small South Pacific territories for which New Zealand was once responsible  \u2014  Western Samoa and the Cook Islands. We look forward to the same constructive development and co-operation in the case of the island of Niue, whose representatives will be discussing their plans with you at this session.\n72.\tWhat I have been saying grows out of my Government's strong feeling of the necessity-and, one can say increasingly, the inevitability-of social cohesion in the world today. This is not a unique notion of Labour Governments everywhere, but is rather the root idea of the United Nations Charter itself. We are all part of the one human family. Some of us welcome this, but the plain fact is that all of us have no choice but to adjust ourselves to this central fact of human existence.\n73.\tObviously a great deal more than aid is needed. Action has to be undertaken on many fronts. For instance, we heard with interest the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States of America for a world conference on food [2124th meeting]. Such a proposal naturally interests a country like New Zealand, which is deeply involved in the production of food, and we welcome it. But immediately we consider such a proposal we realize afresh how interconnected all the problems of the world are. People are hungry, but in some countries farmers are paid not to produce, and land is taken out of production. Other food-producing countries, like ours, have difficulty in getting access to northern hemisphere markets, because agricultural arrangements have been established which have nothing to do with efficiency but a lot to do with politics and protectionism. Unless fanners can sell their products at fair prices more food is not likely to be produced. Without freer trade in agricultural products it will be difficult lo get Imore food to the people who need it. Thus we hardly start to talk of food before we are face to face with the fundamental issues raised by the new round of negotiations among the States parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And the GATT round takes us to a series of other interconnected issues. Yet the basic problems are not really mysterious at all or incapable of resolution if the will is there. Somehow the resources of this planet and the needs of the human family have to be matched. It can be done and it can be done in a way that would benefit all and harm very few.\n74.\tBoth the proliferation of nuclear weapons generally, and the testing of nuclear weapons and devices in the atmosphere, notably in the. South Pacific, have caused New Zealand deepest concern. We view with disquiet the whole attitude of mind by which nuclear weaponry is preserved and indeed fortified as the years go by. In every way possible  \u2014  by protests to the Governments concerned, by action in the General Assembly, by application to the International Court of Justice  \u2014  we have made every effort to bring about the cessation of nuclear testing. But ,the testing in the Pacific zone has still persisted.\n75.\tIn the more general context we have heard with dismay recently of the reported acquisition by the Soviet Union of a more advanced weapons delivery system which will increase the danger of a new round of nuclear weapons escalation. This news underlines the urgency of achieving further progress in disarmament.\n76.\tThis Organization has recently marked the tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban treaty. But there have been more explosions on the average each year since the Treaty was signed than in the years of the nuclear age that preceded the Treaty. Testing continues unabated. Two nuclear Powers have deliberately ignored the Treaty and have continued with intensive programmes of nuclear testing in the atmosphere, with scant regard for the environment in which we all live or for the growing outcry from world opinion. The remaining nuclear Powers which are parties to the Treaty have continued with underground tests, thereby affording the two Powers that are not party to the Treaty with a pretext for pressing ahead with their own programmes. There has been a lamentable lack of progress in the preparation of a Treaty which would impose a comprehensive ban on all testing, in spite of the undertaking contained in the preamble to the 1963 Treaty to work for such an agreement.\n77.\tIn the absence of a comprehensive agreement, accepted by all the nuclear Powers and backed by the overwhelming weight of world opinion, there must remain an acute and continuing danger that still more countries will seek to acquire nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons - measurably advances the certainty of nuclear war, and only a universal ban on weapons testing can eliminate this grave threat. I am convinced that the people of every country are sick of war and the threat of war. They do not want nuclear weapons and their attendant threats. They want peace and they want more progress towards it. Is it impossible for Governments to be moved by the desires of ordinary people?\n78.\tJust as we shall not solve the problems of pollution, or the exhaustion of the planet's resources, or the growing gulf between the rich and the poor, unless we change our attitudes towards the accumulation of things, so we shall not solve the problems of war and of international order unless we change our attitudes towards power and the accumulation of power. Arms are the potential for war, for mass slaughter, for the human family to destroy itself. Let us keep in the forefront of our thinking a conviction that war is now unacceptable as an instrument for achieving national aims.\n79.\tMight we not then deduce the consequences of this truth? Shall we continue to recognize nations as \\\"great Powers\\\" merely because they have the capacity to inflict greater damage than any other nation? Of course if they acted, under the Charter, as protectors of the human family, they might be so recognized; but in the last 28 years they have demonstrated convincingly their incapacity to rise to such a role; they have failed to match power with responsibility. Sometimes the shepherds have preyed upon the sheep. Might we not therefore respond by questioning the scale of values that puts power at the top? Might we not insist on a different scale of values, a human scale, a civilized scale, a scale based on the belief that the truly great country is the country which shows concern for the quality of life both of its own people and of its neighbours? We have to eliminate the very institution of war from international dealings. Let us therefore start adjusting our attitudes and bring that changed approach to this very Organization. In that way we might prepare the ground for the changes which are required if the United Nations is to meet the needs of human beings here and now and in the challenging years immediately ahead of it.\n80.\tFor-and do we doubt it? -so long as the old attitudes persist, so long will those nations that aspire to so-called greatness strain and swell themselves to reach the critical bulk and dignity. To attain the honour of sitting at the \\\"top table\\\" they will waste natural resources and cause damage and concern to their neighbours. But let us see for what it is the absurdity of a lonely few sitting at their top table with their obscene weapons which they can use only by committing suicide. That \\\"honour\\\" is surely now an empty one-if it ever was otherwise. Let us develop values that are relevant to the real world and get to grips with the real business of mankind.\n81.\tIn the case of at least one of the great Powers many citizens are realizing the basic truth about power in the nuclear age and are moving to work out its implications. But in the meantime, what do we, the smaller Members of the United Nations, do  \u2014  we whose requests and pleas are arrogantly brushed aside, perhaps not even listened to?\n82.\tThe small Powers should demand a more effective voice in disarmament negotiations. Let us begin at this session of the Assembly with a concerted call for the earliest possible conclusion of a treaty to ban all forms of nuclear-weapons testing. If no significant progress is made through the existing machinery within one year, the Assembly should, I suggest, consider calling a general conference to draft such a treaty.\n83.\tWe have also to confront the simple fact that in the last 10 years or so international law and international organizations have been the casualties of the cold war. We face a desolate landscape within the United Nations. Some Powers have either ignored the United Nations or brought threats to it only when diplomacy had failed and it was too late for the United Nations to act effectively. How often have they then blamed the United Nations and justified their own unilateral actions by its alleged ineffectiveness? It is now for the smaller countries to take up the task of making this Organization work. If the great Powers will also show a change of approach, the United Nations, and mankind with it, will get back into business.\n84.\tI have already mentioned the possibility of a concerted call for a treaty to ban all nuclear-weapons testing. The small Powers may also wish to consider carefully the possibilities of partial disarmament or demilitarization on a regional basis where circumstances and geography make it appropriate. One of my Government's first acts after election last year was to change New Zealand's vote at the Assembly in order to express its sympathy with the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. At the Conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Ottawa in August, New Zealand joined in a unanimous endorsement of the action of the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in adopting a declaration to make South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. In the words of the Commonwealth communique of 10 August 1973, we regard that initiative as a positive contribution towards peace and stability in that region. New Zealand looks with favour also on the establishment by treaty of nuclear-free zones such as that accorded by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), and we intend to consult with our Pacific neighbours about the feasibility of establishing a similar kind of nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific region.\n85.\tIn the field of the settlement of disputes the small nations could achieve gains by showing a readiness to submit disputes to the International Court or to arbitration. There is a disturbing tendency for some influential countries to pay lip-service to the importance of international law and the role of the Court, but in practice to take all possible steps to avoid its jurisdiction. The more countries that accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court the more internationally unacceptable such evasive practices will become and the greater will be the pressure for the unreserved acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.\n86.\tSmall nations can help to prevent wars and to assist the peaceful resolution of tense situations by strengthening the peace-keeping role of the United Nations. They can do this by earmarking units on which the United Nations may call for peace-keeping purposes. My own Government has decided to train units of its defence services in readiness for participation in future United Nations peace-keeping operations. Small nations may, I believe, express justified disappointment at the lack of progress hitherto recorded by the Assembly's Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. Recognizing the valuable contributions made by Canada and one or two other members, they should press for the completion of the Committee's mandate set out in resolutions dating from 1967. There is no doubt that the Secretary-General must be given moral and practical support in the initiatives he may have to take in the exercise of his responsibilities in regard to peace and security.\n87.\tIf we think of ourselves as a single family, and if we are going to work together for economic advancement, for the prevention of pollution and other ills, and to escape the threat of war, it follows that we must work together on racial discrimination, which is, justly, one of the major preoccupations of our Organization. This has been a year in which a number of situations affecting human rights have constituted gross affronts to the ideals of the United Nations. In some countries with serious racial problems great efforts have been made and substantial progress achieved in the direction of racial equality, as has happened, for example, in our host country during the lifespan of the United Nations. In other countries racial segregation continues, notoriously, to be enshrined in government policy. In still other countries members of a racial minority who wish to emigrate are subject to onerous conditions and delays, and in yet* another country, members of a racial group have been expelled at short notice and stripped of their possessions without compensation. To these and other situations the response of the United Nations membership has varied widely; some have virtually ignored them.\n88.\tMy own Government is opposed to racial discrimination and oppression no matter where it is practised, by whom, or in whatever form. We have been combing through United Nations resolutions and taking whatever action is appropriate to ensure that our own house is in order. Above and beyond those obligations we have voluntarily accepted a visit from a United Nations representative investigating the problems of indigenous populations. New Zealand is, as far as I know, the first country to show a United Nations mission all aspects of its internal racial situation. We hope that the report of this mission shortly to be presented  will be of value not only to New Zealand but to the United Nations as a whole.\n89.\tIn concert with others, New Zealand will work towards re-establishing the Organization as a protector of the interests of the majority of States, and in particular of the small States. The calls for justice and equity made by the huge new membership must be listened to and heeded. The aspirations of the smaller Powers, their fears, their determination to build a world without war, a world where the rule of law prevails, a world where the weaker will not be subservient to the political and economic interests of the stronger-these demands cannot be ignored. We agree with the Secretary-General that we need action, innovation and determination if mankind is not to be overtaken once again by the dark destructive or selfish side of human nature. We are eager to play our part in creating a true family of man.\n"

We refuse, however, to be dictated to; we refuse, however, to be subjugated by long occupation; we refuse, however, to remain occupied. We are struggling, not because we guarantee success, but because we have no option but to struggle. That is our national duty. That is the only Diktat we are obeying and going to obey.\n83.\tIf this United Nations was established also to uphold human rights, then I think this is a good opportunity to inform the nations here united of the latest vile actions against human rights. This morning I received from my Government the information that as a result of attacks by the Israeli Air Force on Port Said and on other towns in the Nile delta, one of the most densely populated areas of the world, and on the suburbs of Cairo, 307 victims were killed or wounded. A few hours later \u2014 at 1415 hours precisely \u2014  the toll had risen to 500 persons murdered.\n84.\tAs a result, our morale is rising; our anger is rising; our determination to put an end to this policy of brigandry and lawlessness is increased.\n85.\tThat is Egypt's contribution to this year's general debate."

        "file_text": "\ufeff135.\t We frequently hear the question, What can be done in order that mankind may live in peace and security without fear for the future, and so that all its efforts may be concentrated on providing a better life for each country and for every individual? There is certainly no easy answer to this question. But experience in the past has shown that whenever peace-loving peoples have been able to achieve solidarity and unity, this has benefited peace and international security and has helped to solve all the most burning issues. Fortunately, recent examples give us hope that most peoples now understand the significance of the solidarity and unity of all peace-loving forces in order to strengthen peace and universal security.\n136.\tI refer to a number of events which have occurred in the last few months of 1973. Of these I would single out first and foremost the exceptional significance of the July meeting in the Crimea of the leaders of the Communist and workers' parties of the countries of the socialist commonwealth, of which the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is an integral part.\n137.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries \u2014 a very important factor in present international relations \u2014 which took place at the beginning of September 1973 in Algiers, was also of undoubtedly great significance.\n138.\tAt both these forums it was emphasized how important it was for peace and social progress throughout the\n11\nworld that all anti-imperialist forces should work together. And the general debate at the present session has shown that the overwhelming majority of States and peoples of the world realize the need for joint action and determined efforts to achieve the peace and security of nations, and the need for peaceful and constructive co-operation between all countries in the interests of social progress and development.\n139.\tThe successes recently won by the peace-loving section of humanity in its struggle for peace and peaceful co-operation between countries with differing social systems are undeniable. The continuing process of international detente is of prime importance for all mankind. The United Nations is therefore faced with the immediate task of becoming fully involved in this process, the purpose of which is to reach a fundamental turning point in international relations \u2014 by casting off the remaining traces of the cold war and turning towards peaceful co-operation. The United Nations can help in this process by its efforts to clear up conflicts and crises and to work out fundamental postulates to guarantee international peace and security. If we want good multilateral relations in the world, and if we want our Organization to fulfil its duty to mankind, then it must necessarily rely on good bilateral relations between countries.\n140.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic attaches particular significance to this highly important principle. We want to have friendly good-neighbourly relations with all our neighbours. A great deal has been done recently to bring about this fundamental change in international relations, whether bilateral or multilateral. In this respect we particularly welcomed the results of the talks between the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, and the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States and France. We value highly the signing of the Soviet-American Agreements, which are not only a valuable contribution to the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, but are also helping to improve the international atmosphere as a whole and to strengthen the foundations of international security.\n141.\tAn historic event, in our view, is the progress made as a result of the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was one of those socialist States which, as early as 1966, took the initiative of proposing that steps be taken in Europe to ensure the security of all States in that area, whatever their social system, and to provide an opportunity for comprehensive and mutually advantageous cooperation. \n142.\tCzechoslovakia's interest in these developments stems not only from the sad experience of our people during the first half of the century, when the continent of Europe became the theatre of two catastrophic world wars; it also stems from the fact that we consider the preservation of peace, the prevention of war and the creation of peaceful conditions to be a fundamental task which will make it possible to develop fully peaceful co-operation between the nations of Europe and thereby also to develop and apply the principles of peaceful coexistence between States with differing social systems.\n143.\tA successful start has already been made in Helsinki on discussing the creation of a system of security and cooperation in Europe. We regard this not merely as something that would benefit the peoples of Europe, but as an important first step, one that will help to make this development serve as an encouragement to nations in other parts of the world.\n144.\tWe subscribe to the view that it would be extremely useful if developments analogous to those observed in Europe were also to occur in Asia. The creation of a system of collective security in that area would, we believe, be a first step towards solving contentious issues, removing negative factors in Asia, and guaranteeing the vital interests of the peoples of that part of the world.\n145.\tOne major contribution to the creation of conditions that will reinforce the system of collective security in Asia is the ending of the war in Viet-Nam, which has brought peace, after so many years of suffering, to the heroic VietNamese people, who have been fighting imperialist aggression for more than a generation.\n146.\tWe welcome the achievement of the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos, and the progress made in putting that Agreement into effect. We believe that throughout the region of Indo-China genuine peace will triumph sc n and that the peoples of all countries of that area will be  able to settle their own affairs without outside interference. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, like all peace-loving nations of the world, will continue to give resolute support to the Viet-Namese people.\n147.\tScrupulous observance of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam, signed at Paris on 27 January 1973 and the joint communique on the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam of 13 June 1971 is essential if peace is to be preserved in that area.\n148.\tIt is most heartening to see that conditions are gradually emerging for the normalization of relations also in the area of the Indian subcontinent. We believe that the People's Republic of Bangladesh will shortly take its place among us. Another factor that would, we believe, be of particular significance for the creation of favourable conditions for strengthening peace and security in the Asian region is a normalization of the situation in the Korean peninsula, where fresh signs of constructive developments hold out hope that, thanks to the important initiatives taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, normalization can be achieved.\n149.\tWe support these initiatives because their aim is to bring about a democratic reunification of the country by peaceful means, without any external interference. We believe that it is essential for the United Nations to encourage these aspirations by endorsing unreservedly the justified proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n150.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic also has made its contribution to the process of improving the international situation, particularly on the continent of Europe. We have taken steps to normalize our relations with our western neighbours, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany. Essentially, everything was settled in our bilateral relations, and it is to be regretted that by the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Munich Agreement, which marked the beginning of untold sufferings for the Czechoslovak people, we have been unable to close this unfortunate chapter in the new history of mankind honourably. We hope, therefore \u2014  as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Husak, said recently \u2014 that the goodwill of the Czechoslovak Government will, sooner or later, be met with clear understanding on the part of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and that the process of normalization will be completed successfully.\n151.\tThis was referred to recently by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Brandt [2128th meeting]. Like him, we hope that the treaty, which has already been agreed upon, will be signed shortly.\n152.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has traditionally maintained good relations with the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Moreover, it is extending those relations and giving those countries every possible assistance with their economic and social development. It is also developing, and is prepared to continue developing, relations with the western capitalist countries on the basis of equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation. More decisive and more active efforts by the United Nations to carry out its fundamental mission \u2014  to strengthen peace and international security \u2014 would undoubtedly be of great significance in speeding up developments towards further international detente.\n153.\tIt is gratifying that at the opening of the present session we had an opportunity to welcome the admission of the fraternal German Democratic Republic, and of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to membership in the United Nations. That will not only help to extend the universality of the United Nations; it is also a symbolic expression and confirmation of the changes that have occurred in the world. All the peace-loving countries brought together in the United Nation's ought to bear in mind constantly that efforts to establish durable peace and security require that systematic, deliberate and timely steps be taken that will increase mutual trust between nations. We are referring, for example, to the fact that the Security Council must take steps to put a very important decision into effect speedily: resolution .2936 (XXVII) on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, which was solemnly adopted at the twenty- seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is also essential that progress should be made in convening a world disarmament conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII)]. We feel we must stress the constructive part that has been played by all those who have made efforts in the meanwhile to bring this about, but it is astonishing that a number of countries \u2014 including some which, according to the Charter of the United Nations, bear particular responsibility to mankind \u2014 have not displayed sufficient interest in the work of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Consequently, steps should be taken at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to satisfy all legitimate interests, taking into consideration any constructive proposals that would speed up progress in the Special Committee's practical preparations for convening a world disarmament conference.\n154.\tComplete disarmament has been man's age-old dream. We are aware that to achieve this aim is an extremely complex and difficult undertaking. We must therefore welcome any step forward that we may take. One such step would undoubtedly be the implementation of the Soviet proposal made at this session [2126th meeting] by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. Gromyko, that the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council should be reduced by 10 per cent, and that part of the funds thus saved should be utilized to provide assistance to the developing countries. We sincerely welcome the inclusion of that item in the agenda of the General Assembly. We hope that discussion on it will be fruitful, and that the implementation of the action proposed will serve as an example to all other countries, particularly those with considerable military potential. In this way, it would be possible to accelerate the present trend towards detente in the world, and the nations of the world would reap definite material benefits. There are still many serious obstacles on the road to universal peace and security for all nations. There still exist forces hostile to peace which ignite and preserve centres of tension and war, and which see advantage for themselves in thus working against the interests of peace-loving peoples. Those forces are trying to extract some benefit from the inertia of the cold war. They try to make others believe that detente in the world and an improvement of relations between peoples that until recently were hostilely disposed towards one another is not in their interest.\n155.\tBut who would benefit from a deterioration in the international atmosphere? After all, if we do, not solve the basic problems of international security and disarmament, we cannot improve, as we should like to, standards of living throughout the world, including those of the developing countries.\n156.\tThe forces of aggression, imperialism and colonialism are the instigators of a tension which, despite the general tendency to international detente, still exists in certain parts of the world, causing untold suffering to the peoples of those areas and threatening universal peace and the security of nations. It is deplorable that the efforts of the peace-loving nations and of the United Nations have not yet produced satisfactory results everywhere. It is therefore essential that those efforts be continued with even greater determination and that everything be done to ensure that the existing centres of war and tension, particularly those in the Middle East and in southern Africa, be eliminated.\n157.\tThe situation in the Middle East is particularly dangerous and alarming. It is the result of the aggressive and expansionist policy of Israel, which has refused for many years to heed the well-known resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly, which are the basis for a just settlement of the conflict in the Middle\nEast. Israel, in defiance of those resolutions, is intensifying its aggressive activities against neighbouring Arab States, is deliberately taking steps to annex occupied Arab territories and is flagrantly trampling on the rights of the Arab people of Palestine.\n158.\tIt is quite clear that Israel and all those who support it are becoming increasingly isolated, and that Israel, because of its illegal, terrorist and aggressive actions, finds itself resolutely rebuffed by all those who respect international law, as is demonstrated by the work of the Security Council this year and by its resolution 337 (1973).\n159.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has consistently subscribed to the view that the situation in the Middle East should be settled on the basis of a withdrawal of all Israeli troops from occupied Arab territory, and on respect for the independence and the legitimate rights of the States and peoples of that region, including the Arab people of Palestine.\n160.\tNo less a danger to the freedom of nations and to universal peace and security is the existence of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid, which are particularly strongly entrenched in southern Africa. Contrary to resolutions by United Nations organs, and in particular to the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], adopted on the initiative by the Soviet Union, the South African and Southern Rhodesian racists and the Portuguese colonialists continued to commit criminal acts against the African people, not even stopping short of genocide, and committing crimes that will never be forgotten by mankind.\n161.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic \\7ill continue, as before, its resolute support for the national liberation movements in southern Africa and in the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique, and also in Guinea-Bissau, whose heroic people has achieved in its struggle a resounding victory as a result of the proclamation of the independence of that country. As before, we shall continue to support efforts to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism throughout the world; in the forum of the United Nations we shall do everything necessary to achieve that goal.\n162.\tThe struggle of nations for national and social liberation and for democracy is being resisted by all the reactionary forces, which do not hesitate to employ any means to reverse the course of history, as has been demonstrated by the violent putsch by a military junta against the legitimate Government of the Republic of Chile. One of the first victims was Mr. Salvador Allende, a great scion of the Chilean people. The Czechoslovak people unreservedly condemns the violation of constitutional freedoms and democratic rights, and the bloody repressions and atrocities unleashed by Chilean reaction, supported from outside and acting against the progressive and patriotic forces in Chile. The Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic could not remain indifferent to this, and decided to break off diplomatic relations with the military junta in Chile.\n163.\tIt would be an unforgivable anachronism if the present trend towards detente and the development of cooperation between countries with different social systems that we are witnessing were not to have an appropriate influence on international, economic and trade relations in general, and on the activities of the various bodies of the United Nations system in particular. The principled viewpoint of the socialist countries regarding the development of international relations was clearly expressed in a communique at the twenty-seventh session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in Prague, which said:\n\\\"The active peace-loving policy of the countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance designed to assert in international relations the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence and the relaxation of international tension in the world provides conditions for a further extension of mutually advantageous economic, scientific and technical ties between States with different social and economic systems, especially in Europe.\\\"\n164.\tParticularly noteworthy in this connexion is the proposal to adopt a charter of the economic rights and duties of States [see A/9142], the text of which has already been drafted in United Nations bodies. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has supported that proposal from the very beginning and is convinced that the charter can become a key document that will ensure progressive principles governing international economic relations and thereby serve as a dynamic instrument for developing those relations on a basis of equality, mutual advantage and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\n165.\tThe United Nations is a significant and important organization. It has a position in the world which places great responsibility on it. The United Nations will maintain that position and its significance only if it does not mark time, and if it does not hesitate to become completely involved in the fight to ensure that the shift towards detente and co-operation between States with different social systems becomes a constant feature of contemporary world development."

As a Latin American you will understand that my words are mingled with sadness: sadness about the death of a statesman from the continent you represent, Salvador Allende of Chile, who had earned the respect, and indeed admiration, of many peoples in all parts of the world; sadness because his death not only meant the end by violent means of this democratically elected President, but of a form of democracy which, once it had overcome its tremendous initial economic setbacks and the hostility it encountered, could have become exemplary for vast masses of peoples still longing for justice and for their share of prosperity, so long overdue.\n133.\tThe world, which is the subject of the general debate, is undergoing rapid change. Not only in my country, stress today is laid on well-being rather than on prosperity only. Increased importance is attached to the control of the use of raw materials with a view to slowing down the otherwise rapid depletion of the world's resources.\n134.\tAlso, greater importance is given to such control of the environment as will make the world a tolerably attractive place to live in. Emphasis is shifted from machine to man and-as everything we do is, after all, for man's benefit  \u2014  ensuring him a firmer grip on the institutions which control the society he lives in.\n135.\tWe realize that both on the national and on the international level all the changes that recently have taken place and all the new priorities being set are creating new problems and new difficulties. We are still in the process of building new relationships with former adversaries. This, of course, is not an easy process and it may have caused an increase, internationally, in uncertitudes.\n136.\tHowever, the ideological conflicts are becoming less obtrusive. What now is at issue is, rather, agreement on the balance of power. The decline of the preponderance of ideological conflicts creates an opportunity to establish new priorities. Those who have engineered this new development in the United States and China, in the Soviet Union and Japan  \u2014  deserve our gratitude. They have unlocked new doors, and have opened up vistas of a new international order. In this context I wish to mention also Chancellor Brandt, who by his imaginative Ostpolitik opened a new era in East-West relations. His speech at this meeting provided impressive evidence that the Federal Republic, under his wise leadership, considers the promotion of peace, security and political detente as its primary aim.\n137.\tOne of the most important changes that the country I here represent has undergone has been that the generation which actually went through the Second World War has been succeeded by a new generation, which lived for years with the Viet-Nam conflict. This new generation gives highest priority to the strengthening of peace in the world. The Netherlands Government has embraced that view. An active peace policy occupies a central position in my country's foreign policy. The Netherlands will seek to prevent conflicts from arising and to assist in resolving conflicts. In the broader context, therefore, my Government will seek to remove anything that gives rise to strained relations; to remedy the injustices in the world; to combat the unfair treatment of man by man; and to help bridge the intolerable gap between prosperity and poverty, both in the world at large and within individual States. Needless to say, those who pursue such an active peace policy cannot stand idly by as tensions caused by colonialism rise to ever more dangerous levels, simply because colonialism is so slow to die.\n138.\tFrom the focal point of our policy-the desire to place man squarely in the most peaceful setting possible \u2014 I propose to give the Assembly the views of my Government: on the position of the Netherlands as regards Atlantic co-operation; on the search for European security and a continued detente; on the progress of European economic and political integration; on co-operation with the third world; and, lastly, on the central role of the United Nations.\n139.\tA peace policy is by necessity also a policy of stabilization; consequently the Netherlands is an active member of the body of co-operating Atlantic nations which have joined hands in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. Perilous imbalances might develop were it not for NATO; the proliferation of nuclear weapons might, indeed, become an immediate danger. On the other hand, nothing should be rigid in a changing world. Accordingly, we are assisting in the search for ways in which to adapt and improve Atlantic co-operation. Relations between the United States and Europe have evidently been suffering from a certain erosion. We would not regard it in the interest of peaceful relations in cue world if the allies were to drift apart.\n140.\tMy Government believes the time has come for the reformulation of the aims of Atlantic co-operation and has submitted the following proposals to its partners.\n141.\tWe propose that it be stated categorically that the members of the alliance guarantee man's rights and freedoms.\n142.\tWe propose that the fate of the poor nations of the world be made one of the Atlantic nations' major concerns.\n143.\tWe propose that henceforth the furthering of detente be made paramount among the objectives of Atlantic endeavours.\n144.\tThe detente which we shall strive for must take the interests of the third world fully into account.\n145.\tIndeed, any policy designed to strengthen peace is a policy of deliberate efforts to promote detente. It is for that reason that the Netherlands Government is endeavouring to be inventive as it plays its part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We are doing so with the firm desire to produce results, while remaining aware that the road will be long and difficult. Any adjustment takes its time.\n146.\tFor many a partner in that Conference in particular but not exclusively the group of East European countries, it will not be easy to subscribe to our views on the free exchange of ideas and information. None the less, our views on this subject are so fundamental and inherent in our way of- life and the structure of our society that we are prepared to bring it up time and again, annually if so required, and to continue the search for elements on which we can agree as the dialogue between the nations of Europe proceeds.\n147.\tIn the long run a European continent, divided by artificial barriers, behind which freedom of speech remains restricted, cannot be conceived. Every society is exposed to change.\n148.\tThose who are in the creative vanguard of the arts and sciences usually are most apt to register the need for change. Their thoughts, if phrased in freedom, tend to become the forces of renewal and survival. To restrict their freedom of speech is to condemn society to stagnation and regression. We call on our partners in the present European dialogue to see these remarks not as an intervention in their internal affairs but as a reflection of the firm conviction that the cause of detente will be promoted by respect for human freedoms in all parts of Europe.\n149.\tPursuing a policy of peace also involves helping resolutely, and with initiative and confidence, to reinforce European co-operation. In my view, the European Community has for the time being reached its geographical configuration. The European union will be a reality. The question we are now faced with is what kind of European union we are going to build.\n150.\tThe first option is some sort of super-Power. The Netherlands would not feel at home in such a Europe. The second option is a Europe that would withdraw from the world into isolation and outdated neutrality. The Netherlands would not feel at home in such a Europe either. The third option, however, is a Europe in which the consequent gain in prosperity would be invested in an outward-looking community, with new civic norms and a new social policy.\n151.\tConsequently, we hope to be part of a Europe that sets great store by mutual understanding, feelings of solidarity between the privileged and the less prosperous,\\\" tolerance based on the various social groups which have a sense of social and economic responsibility towards each other. Only that kind of Europe can become a truly stable element in the world and thus consolidate peaceful relationships. Europe is moving along the road to that objective, sometimes fairly rapidly, sometimes with a certain hesitation. My Government is prepared to transfer national prerogatives to the European institutions as we proceed along that road. We and our partners in European economic and monetary co-operation are now seeking ways to expedite the establishment of an economic and monetary union, ways in which to integrate and harness this gigantic economic and monetary potential. I\n152.\tThe European Community has already embarked upon a policy of establishing new structural relationships with the outside world. My Government is ready to accept, together with its partners, considerable responsibilities for the promotion of the well-being of the third world, including the countries already linked to the Common Market by association as well as those not to be associated. All those countries must be enabled to overcome the curse of backwardness and economic discrimination if, as my Government desires, new foundations for lasting peace are to be built.\n153.\tI need hardly say that all those major, fundamental problems can be solved only if the institutional conditions for solutions are satisfied. We need alert institutions capable of taking decisions quickly and capable of rendering an account of their decisions to the European Parliament in a democratic fashion. My Government will also be prepared to transfer national prerogatives within the framework of European political co-operation-today still largely of a consultative nature-once the cohesion between the partners has progressed to the point at which the community of interests returns more to us than the amount of self- determination we surrender. If this process could gradually gain momentum, the countries of Europe would be making a major new move towards creating international peace and security.\n154.\tThe situation in the third world has not improved. Economic growth and the achievement of prosperity are in stagnation. Today fewer people than 10 years ago are touched by the impact of the development process. Our development efforts have failed to change the structural relationship of inequality and dependence between the poor and the rich nations, as well as within developing countries. Development has failed to reach the lower strata of society.\n155.\tThat state of affairs cannot continue. We cannot accept this injustice of persistent backwardness with its grave, hidden tensions and consequent threat to world peace.\n156.\tWe shall have to review the situation. This Assembly must examine whether we should not radically modify our terms of reference, whether the priority of economic growth should not be supplemented by the priority of income distribution as an equal and concurrent objective instead of one consecutive to growth.\n157.\tOur objective should be reformulated as \\\"growth plus structural change\\\". Consequently, my Government intends to put greater emphasis on problems of income distribution and self-reliance and on the structural relationship between developed and developing countries. Self- reliance and distribution of income and economic power, in fact, loom just as large in the domestic policy of my country as in our foreign policy.\n158.\tGreater emphasis on these elements of development inevitably raises the question of national sovereignty of all countries, including the underprivileged. But in recent history, sovereign independence, important and indispensable as it is, has, in many cases and in many respects, remained an empty shell. I hope that the same will not be true of the problems of distribution and self-reliance.\n159.\tMy Government wishes to take an active part in the discussion of these matters. We believe that the radical shift in the development process to which these discussions should be directed should take place in a multilateral context, preferably in the framework of global co-operation and of a joint review and appraisal of our common efforts. We shall accord to this a high priority, because we accord a high priority to the consolidation of peace.\n160.\tIn the search for peace, an efficient world organization is indispensable. If I sound a note of criticism about the activities and operations of the United Nations at this stage, I wish at the same time to reaffirm the continuing loyalty of my country to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n161.\tAt present, the stars of the Organization are not very propitious. The political will of the Organization's Members to help create, strengthen and consolidate the conditions for peace throughout the world should find expression within the Organization. But, on the contrary, in the last few years we have witnessed increasing confrontation; delays in taking decisions, for instance, on disarmament; and a distorted use by various Members of the United Nations family through ever more frequent appeals to the specialized agencies for political action, for which, in fact, the political organs of the Organization are intended. We are not suggesting that there should be new proposals for amendments to the Charter to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for the fostering of world peace. Many improvements needed can be effectuated within the existing Charter, provided that there is the will to do so.\n162.\tOne improvement might consist in making the Organization still more universal; my Government is prepared to assist in achieving this. We further are of the opinion that improvement of the procedures and the implementation of international legislation are required. We hold the view that in international disputes Member States should more frequently have recourse to instiutionalized fact-finding. That would create a better basis for the rapid and effective settlement of those disputes. The International Court of Justice should be given a more authoritative part to play, all the more since the new rules of the Court may accelerate its procedures. The Court should not be made a forum in which to thrash out political differences, but it should provide additional opportunities for settling disputes by peaceful means.\n163.\tThere are still many strained relations that are a threat to peace. In particular, our attention should be focused on the problems of southern Africa. If we remain idle spectators, the problems and strained relations besetting that part of the world will inevitably culminate in conflicts, the world-wide consequences of which would be incalculable. The remnants of a colonial era are just as much out of keeping with today's world as is the policy of apartheid. Therefore, the Netherlands Government will apply the sanctions against the illegal regime in Rhodesia with the utmost severity, in the fervent hope of promoting self-determination in that country. Therefore, the Netherlands will give humanitarian aid to the peoples in the colonial areas of southern Africa via the liberation movements - preferably through the intermediary of international organizations-and will support the claims for external self-determination of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique. Recent reports emanating in particular from Mozambique have caused grave concern in my country.\n164.\tMy Government once more urges Portugal to come to an understanding with those peoples and thus to build up a new relationship. We address a similar appeal to the Government of South Africa on the Territory of Namibia and, in addition, we urge South Africa to turn away from the policy of apartheid. We believe that it should be possible to continue the discussions on the subject within the United Nations and that they should not be cut short by expulsion or the severance of bonds.\n165.\tThe other main threat to peace remains the explosive situation in the Middle East. At this moment I wish to touch only on one side of the problem which becomes increasingly important, the question of the refugees. The Netherlands is prepared to render active assistance with a view to relieving this source of tension, for example through an investigation of the extent to which the restructuring of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East or the creation of new organs, might help to alleviate the human suffering and economic disruption resulting from the Middle East's political quandary.\n166.\tIt need hardly be said that substantial progress in disarmament and the control of arms is a sine qua non for a peaceful world order. My Government favours the imposition without delay of a ban on underground nuclear tests. Although there is probably no infallible detection system as yet, the Netherlands regards it as essential to check the arms race, since the nuclear danger continues by means of qualitative improvement of nuclear weaponry. Next to that, we shall continue to press for a ban on chemical weapons. Considerable priority will have to be accorded to restricting the use of indiscriminate weapons and inhuman methods of warfare causing excessive suffering.\n167.\tThis General Assembly will be concerning itself more especially with institutional problems with regard to disarmament. We are prepared to approach every proposal with open minds in respect of both the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We should also welcome a World Disarmament Conference, provided all nuclear Powers were willing to take part. But what is more important than any institution is the political will to go forward.\n168.\tAt this very moment in the context of a peace week, the combined churches of the Netherlands strongly call upon my countrymen to unite in the promotion of conditions for peace. As a consequence, the display of political will of those responsible for the furtherance of peace will be closely observed in my country.\n169.\tThe Charter of the United Nations establishes a clear link between the maintenance of international peace and security, the creation of conditions of economic and social well-being and the promotion of universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without discrimination. If we clarify this link in terms of peace and justice, it would seem that there is no peace in the true 14\nsense as long as there are situations of grave injustice in relations among the States and within the States. Peaceful co-operation between States will not mean very much if peoples and individuals remain the victims of grave injustices. After all, it is not the State as such, or an organization of States for that matter, but the well-being of human beings that is the ultimate object of our endeavours.\n170. For that reason the Netherlands Government wishes to reaffirm at this very session of the General Assembly, when we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the pledge contained in the United Nations Charter: the pledge that Members will take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. The date 10 December 1973 will be not only the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration but also the beginning of a Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. The still rampant practice of racism and racial discrimination has a devastating effect on the minds, the hearts and the fate of people and on the very essence of peace and justice. The United Nations has undoubtedly made great efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination and apartheid, especially by making people conscious of the inherent dangers of these grave types of discrimination. They, however, still persist as an evil against which all the forces of goodwill must be mobilized. If we consider the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration and in subsequent international instruments in the field of human rights, we can see an unmistakable gap between the ideals proclaimed and the realities of life in the world.\n171.\tLastly, I should like to call attention to a serious matter which is not often raised before this forum, namely, the disregard of article S of the Universal Declaration-and article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]-that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Reports from various parts of the world provide evidence that this appalling practice has become rife and is often used against people suspected of having committed a political offence. The Netherlands people and Government are gravely perturbed at this practice and wonder whether the United Nations could not take appropriate action. A strong appeal that such practices be stopped forthwith might have considerable moral impact, but I also press for the adoption of an expedient such as impartial inquiry, in order to bring the facts to light. The Netherlands Government is prepared to co-operate in any initiative of that kind.\n172.\tThe United Nations is to be, in the words of the Charter, a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. Glancing back over the years, one cannot escape the impression that there is still much to be done in this respect. I do not hesitate to pledge once more my Government's dedication to the aims and purposes of the Charter and its willingness to make its contribution in this respect."

        "file_text": "\ufeff39.\tI would first like to extend to you, Sir, the warmest congratulations of the Australian delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly. There has been for many years now a growing sense of community between us in Australia and our Latin American neighbours across the Pacific Ocean and a developing sympathy, understanding and awareness of our common problems and mutual interests.\n40.\tThe history of the United Nations since 1945 has been marked by outstanding contributions from a series of distinguished representatives from Latin America and none more so than your own. Your profound experience of the United Nations spans two decades, in the second of which in particular you have been able to play a guiding role in a wide range of United Nations activities. It is fitting therefore that we should now have this opportunity of saluting you as President of the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly.\n41.\tI might begin by recalling that the present Australian Government came into office less than one year ago, towards the close of the last session of the General Assembly. This is thus the first opportunity for a minister of the present Government to appear at the rostrum of this Assembly and explain its broad philosophy and the policies it is pursuing now and for the future. I regard it as a privilege to be here and to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.\n42.\tI want to emphasize first that those ideals which inspired the Australian delegation in helping to draw up the Charter in 1945 are valid today. At the San Francisco Conference the Australian delegation saw the United Nations as an instrument for peace and for human welfare everywhere. We conceived of its Charter not only as a charter for politicians and diplomats but as one aimed especially at promoting the dignity and well-being of the ordinary man and woman. We saw this Organization as a means for leading dependent peoples towards independence and as a means of eliminating discrimination of all kinds, including discrimination based on race. These are all clearly written into the Charter, and through such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights they have received further expression in this Assembly and in other United Nations organs as the years have passed.\n43.\tWe hold fast to these ideals, and the philosophy that guides the Australian Government today is a positive philosophy of faith in the United Nations, in its enduring principles and in its ultimate capacity to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of all mankind.\n44.\tWe are living at a time of constant change in the international scene, not all of it rapid, not all of it for the better, but much of it directed towards the end that we all ardently wish for, which is peace and security everywhere and the promise of a better life for peoples everywhere. In spite of disappointments and frustrations we can at least sense an atmosphere of relief from old tensions and an easing of old postures. I have in mind the European security pact negotiations, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the various movements towards peace and neutrality in Asia. The international community has been enriched by the full and energetic participation of the People's Republic of China.\n45.\tOn the debit side I need only mention as examples the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East, the continued fighting in the countries of Indo-China and the recent grievous developments in Chile.\n46.\tLet me try to identify the main principles and guidelines that set the general direction of Australian policies, and to place them in the context of the United Nations, its purposes and its operations. There have been some changes in Australia's outlook on the world and consequently in its national policies \u2014 changes which we have considered necessary and indeed overdue and which reflect our conception of a new and dynamic approach to our domestic affairs and our international relationships.\n47.\tIt was during an earlier period of office of the present Australian Government that the late Mr. Evatt, our then Foreign Minister, took a leading part in the drafting of the Charter. Nobody will claim that the Charter is perfect, but bearing in mind the transformation undergone by the United Nations since 1945, it has proved a remarkably durable and adaptable instrument. At the same time we acknowledge that there is room for modification of some of its provisions to accommodate changes that have taken place in the balance of influence of Member States. We will view with sympathy and support efforts in this direction, while recognizing that there are limits to what can be achieved.\n48.\tOne conspicuous element in Australia's faith in the United Nations is the enduring principle that discussion and dialogue are essential to the work of the Organization. We accordingly welcome as a major development the decision that, after a lapse of three years, the question of Korea should come under scrutiny and discussion in this Assembly.\n49.\tAustralia, as a member of the United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] in Seoul, has been seeking to prepare the ground so that the Assembly's handling of the Korean question may help to lessen tension, facilitate accommodation and improve the prospects of Korean reunification. UNCURK itself has taken a timely initiative in recommending, in its annual report to the Secretary-General [A/9027], that it should now be dissolved. Australia's efforts have been directed towards promoting conciliation and consensus on the Korean question. We wish to ensure that the renewal of the Korean debate should not be a polemical confrontation which would only be detrimental to the spirit of harmony and good relations which we are seeking to promote. We hope that the parties will be able to adjust to each other's positions without trying to push each other into a corner, and that the Assembly will arrive at a constructive consensus.\n50.\tWe have been active in extending our bilateral relationships throughout the broad region to Australia's north and east. In addition to establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China we have moved quickly to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and have begun trade and other exchanges with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We have at the same time sought to broaden and deepen our long established relations with the other Asian and Pacific countries including t he group of States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and our close neighbour, Indonesia.\n51.\tThis twenty-eighth session of the Assembly marks a further notable step towards the attainment of the ideal of universality of membership of the United Nations. My delegation has been most happy to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, both of which now have diplomatic relations with Australia. Their presence here is a symbol and a measure of lessening ideological tensions and a re-endorsement of international coexistence.\n52.\tWe also warmly welcome to membership in the United Nations the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, which on its attainment of independence earlier this year we have already welcomed as a fellow member of the Commonwealth of nations.\n53.\tWe in Australia have been sufficiently encouraged by the recent progress in negotiations among the countries of the south Asian sub-continent on their difficult and complex problems to hope that the remaining obstacles may soon be removed to the admission of another Commonwealth country, Bangladesh, to membership in the United Nations.\n54.\tOur Government is deeply conscious that to realize the full benefit of our philosophy we must eliminate some of the heritage of the past, such as colonialism and racism, before the welfare of people around the world can be improved. Australia believes that it can take some modest credit for its part in ensuring that the chapters on economic and social welfare were included in the Charter. Those chapters provide the United Nations with the incentive and the means to advance human welfare and to adapt international action to the needs of the present. We know that some of the paramount objectives have fallen far short of achievement. We have poverty in most of our Member countries. We do not have the stability in trade and financial relationships among United Nations Members that we would like. But we have the means available to us to formulate solutions to the problems of the developing countries and to the problems of stability among all countries. The Australian\nGovernment believes that we should utilize these means to the full.\n55.\tOur Government's purpose of promoting human freedom, human dignity and human welfare calls, of course, for domestic as well as international action. We aim to enlarge welfare and social security and especially to protect the more exposed sections of our community. We are concerned not only with welfare in the broad sense but also with removing discrimination and with looking after those, of our people, including particularly our aboriginal people, who have suffered from discrimination in the past.\n56.\tDuring the present Assembly we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This anniversary of one of the most significant and enlightened achievements of the United Nations gives governments an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the promotion of human rights in their own societies and internationally.\n57.\tIt is a fundamental objective of Australia's approach to ensure that our own policies are soundly based on respect for and the protection and enhancement of civil liberties and basic human rights. When our present Government came to power, it immediately began to examine all the international instruments concerned with human rights with a view to determining what action we should be taking to give effect to them. Already this year Australia has ratified a number of Conventions of the International labour Organisation dealing with the right to organize and bargain collectively, equal remuneration for men and women, and the elimination of discrimination in the fields of employment and occupation. We have put in hand action to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n58.\tRespect for human rights and opposition to discrimination lead naturally to positive support for the process of decolonization.\n59.\tThe Australian Government supports the principle of decolonization for all dependent territories and is participating fully in the efforts of the international community to induce the metropolitan administering Powers to take all steps necessary to ensure that peoples in dependent Territories are enabled to exercise their right to self-determination. Suiting the action to the word, Australia in January of this year rejoined the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, of which we had been an original member.\n60.\tThe most acute of the colonial problems remain centred on southern Africa, although the processes of decolonization are still to be worked out in many other areas as well. I have personally had the honour to be received with notable hospitality and generosity in seven African countries during visits undertaken to further Australian sympathy, knowledge and understanding of African problems.\n61.\tWe have been working as a member of the Security Council for the strict enforcement of sanctions against the illegal racist regime of Zimbabwe. Indeed, we see these sanctions as a test of the sincerity of Member nations to act in accordance with the principles and obligations of the Charter. We in Australia are determined to enforce them in full, and we will continue to deny the illegal regime any recognition or respectability.\n62.\tWe also see as a test of the sincerity of Member nations their attitude to the intolerable practice of apartheid in South Africa. This is a practice which we utterly reject. We shall continue to take every opportunity to condemn it and to co-operate with all those seeking responsibly to eliminate it.\n63.\tWe understand the frustrations that have led the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the non-aligned countries to adopt the position that armed struggle is essential to end colonialism and racial discrimination. While we sympathize with the aims of the national liberation movements in southern Africa, we ourselves stop short of endorsing the use of force to attain these and indeed any other objectives. We hope that, through the application of the principles of the Charter, liberty and equality may be achieved without the tragedies of war.\n64.\tAustralia values its continuing co-operation with the Special Committee and the Trusteeship Council in the Territories for which Australia is still the administering Power.\n65.\tOur principal residual responsibility as an administering Power rests in Papua New Guinea, the largest and most populous Territory remaining within the United Nations Trusteeship System. The termination of the Trusteeship Agreeement is now in sight. In close co-operation, the Government and House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea and the Australian Government are moving purposefully to bring Papua New Guinea to sovereign membership in the family of nations.\n66.\tSince 30 April 1973 the ministers of the Papua New Guinea Government have had effective control over virtually all aspects of the internal government of the country. Formal self-government will come on 1 December this year; certain policy functions such as defence and foreign affairs will not, for constitutional reasons, be transferred until independence, but these functions are already being exercised by Australia only after the fullest consultation with, and advice from, the Government of Papua New Guinea.\n67.\tEarlier this year the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly affirmed its right as the duly elected parliament of the people to decide when independence is to come. The Australian Government acknowledges that, on the question of independence as on the question of self- government, the House of Assembly should give effect to the wishes of the people. We expect Papua New Guinea to proceed to sovereign independent status by 1975 as a politically unified nation with a freely elected central government. We have pledged substantial and comprehensive help to the Government and people of an independent Papua New Guinea, which will naturally have a special place in the affections of the Australian people and in our network of political and other relations. Australia is not seeking any exclusive relationship with Papua New Guinea, which will want to find its own place in the international community.\n68.\tThe principle that well-to-do countries have an obligation to help those that are poorly off ranks high in the estimation of our Government, and we have taken a fresh look at our policies and programmes of development assistance with the aim of making them more sensitive and responsive to the requirements of the developing countries . To that end we have decided that there should be a separate government agency to administer Australia's development assistance programmes. We intend that our programmes of bilateral assistance should be increasingly directed to activities that will have the effect of spreading social and employment benefits.\n69.\tWe are also particularly conscious of the wish of developing countries to increase their exports and to bring bilateral trade more into balance. Our recent decisions to effect an across-the-board 25 per cent reduction in tariffs and to revalue the Australian dollar for the second time in nine months taken together represent a constructive attempt to play our part in liberalizing international trade. The tariff cuts are to be accompanied by significant new tariff preferences for imports from developing countries, which will greatly extend and elaborate Australia's scheme of generalized preferences first introduced in 1966. We are also giving improved technical assistance to developing countries to help them exploit their opportunities in the Australian market.\n70.\tThe current financial year will see an increase in all of Australia's major economic and technical aid programmes, and we are now for the first time giving vigorous support to the efforts of the United Nations in the population field. Although, as before, Australian aid will continue to be channelled mainly to the countries of Asia and the Pacific, we will next year be making increases in allocations to African countries as well as in our contributions to the major United Nations and other multilateral funds. Australia accepts the principal target of the International Development Strategy and will aim to raise its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product.\n71.\tIn the past, Australia has taken a cautious approach to the question of the link between the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and development assistance. The present Australian Government supports the studies on this matter undertaken within the IMF Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues since we are conscious that the overwhelming majority of developing countries believe that their interests would be significantly advanced by some form of link.\n72.\tAustralia shares the deep concern expressed during this general debate about the world food situation. Our Government is determined that Australia should make a positive and constructive contribution to the international efforts to alleviate the distress and hardship resulting from this situation. Accordingly, Australia has reacted favourably to the proposal by the Secretary of State of the United States that the Assembly should consider organizing a world food conference in 1974 [2124th meeting, para. 71]. We have noted that the essence of Mr. Kissinger's proposal is similar to that in the action programme for economic cooperation adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/9330 and Corr. 1, p. 99], which advocates the convening of an emergency joint conference of FAO and UNCTAD on this problem. Australia is flexible about the procedure for organizing the conference, but we are determined to join with others to find the most suitable, the most immediate and the most efficient way of bringing the attention of the international community to the problem of the world food supply with a view to reaching a practical agreement on the way in which it could be rationally and humanely managed.\n73.\tThe principles which guide Australia's policy of active support for the United Nations through the protection and enhancement of human rights, through opposition to colonialism and racism and through acceptance of the obligation to help those who are poorly , off are all part of a Central concern with the kind of life that our people can enjoy and with the kind of environment in which they are to live. The first responsibility for maintaining a congenial environment for mankind's working and leisure hours must rest with our own and other individual Governments, and Australia for its part is now equipped with an administrative apparatus which is being geared to take sensitive account of our people's interest in maintaining the quality of their surroundings.\n74.\tBut there is also much that countries can learn from one another. Placed as we are in a large island continent offering wide extremes of climate and terrain, we believe that we have some experience of our own which we can share with the international community in return for the lessons we can learn from abroad \u2014 experience in combating air and water pollution, in preserving our natural heritage and in contributing generally towards a satisfactory, and indeed an improving, quality of human living.\n75.\tAnd so from the beginning, Australia took a lively interest in the proceedings of last year's United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm. We have declared our support for the achievements of that Conference, and intend to pursue policies that accord fully with the Stockholm principles. We are also contributing substantially to the United Nations Environment Programme.\n76.\tThe proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons are clearly incompatible with the outlook of any Government and people concerned with the quality of life. These activities divert into unproductive channels the resources, energies and skills which could much more profitably be expended on programmes for the political, economic and social development of the international community.\n77.\tAustralia ratified the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty in 1963, and our Government, this year ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the sea-bed arms control Treaty.  Australia pledges its full support to the efforts of the United Nations to achieve general and complete disarmament subject to effective means of verification, and our Government is now taking steps to ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)].\n78.\tWe find it deeply regrettable that the Governments of two nuclear Powers have continued to conduct nuclear- weapons testing programmes in the atmosphere, with associated hazards for present and future generations, despite the repeated expressions of disapproval by the United Nations and other international bodies and by individual countries. I take the opportunity to recall that on 22 June last the International Court of Justice gave an order for interim measures to restrain the Government of France from conducting atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific which would deposit radio-active fall-out on Australia. \nAustralia is opposed to all forms of nuclear-weapons testing in any environment by whatever State, and we fully endorse the statement by the Secretary-General that \\\"the time has now surely come for a general agreement to stop all nuclear-weapons testing\\\".\n79.\tThe air and seas of our planet are accessible to all the nations of the world. Just as the international community cannot tolerate misuse of the earth's atmosphere for any purpose whatever, so we must try to ensure that the oceans are not misused.\n80.\tThe United Nations has been grappling for almost three years now with the task of preparing for a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea. The fact that progress has not been as rapid as we might wish is a measure of the importance of the subject and of the diversity and complexity of interests that will have to be accommodated in the new system of law.\n81.\tAs a matter of priority, the General Assembly must at this session review the progress of the preparatory work and confirm the decisions it took at its last session to convene the conference in 1973-1974. Australia, as a coastal State with interests in every aspect of the law of the sea, has a concern second to none in achieving agreement on a satisfactory convention. We hope that the Assembly, with an appropriate sense of urgency, will reach early agreement to convene the organizational session of the conference later this year and the substantive session in 1974.\n82.\tFew delegations at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 could have envisaged the radical transformation of the United Nations that has taken place. The vast majority of the world's people are now represented here. Australia is encouraged by this remarkable achievement and by the work of the United Nations in promoting the fundamental principles of peace and human welfare. We intend to be as active at home as internationally in giving effect to the basic principles of this Organization. If, as we hope, we are now entering a more promising era of reconciliation, accommodation and peace in international affairs, the United Nations will be able to muster great energies and to concentrate more effectively on the economic and social problems of development and on improving the quality of life everywhere. Those noble purposes call for renewed dedication, unstinting co-operation and a ceaseless effort from every Member of this Organization, and we in Australia are determined to provide all three."

        "file_text": "\ufeff162.\tMr. President, at the outset, I should like to extend in the name of the delegation of Burma our warm congratulations to you on your election as President of the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly. Your distinguished career and your wide knowledge of world affairs and of the practices of the United Nations are a guarantee to us that under your able guidance the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly will be conducted efficiently and effectively towards a successful outcome.\n163.\tLet me also pay tribute to our outgoing President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for his wise steering of the affairs of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly and the vision with which he fulfilled the functions of his high office.\n164.\tThis year we have in our midst the delegations of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. I should like to offer to them on behalf of the delegation of Burma our warm congratulations and friendly greetings on the occasion of their admission to the family of the United Nations. By their presence in the United Nations they will be able to make a fuller contribution towards the realization of the purposes of the United Nations.\n165.\tThe over-all impression which emerges from the present course of world developments and changing power relationships is that we are passing through a critical period in the general relationships between nations and are now at a juncture, in international relations, of general relaxation of tension. On the other hand, this seemingly favourable trend in international relations is somewhat thwarted by the fact that the world political, economic and monetary scene is still essentially far from stable, and we should like to dwell briefly on some of the aspects which lead us to think along these lines.\n166.\tThe prevailing trend towards detente in international relations has generated positive processes hopefully opening up prospects for a more peaceful world order. Against that background some former opposing great Powers, recognizing the need to coexist with one another, have sought to normalize their relations and other disputant Powers have begun to seek accommodation of their mutual problems. While those moves have resulted in a lessening of tensions in many parts of the world, the continued existence of tensions and armed conflicts in certain regions calls for renewed efforts for their elimination.\n\n167.\tWith the growing readiness of States to improve their relations and mutual security in the spirit of detente, the quest for international peace and security is beginning to gain strength among the majority of nations inspired by the basic concern to work for the creation of conditions towards this end. The tendency is gradually emerging among nations today to seek new options other than great- Power protection to ensure a peaceful environment in the interests of their own security. Speaking of developments nearer home, in the form of initiatives coming from within the regions which have been prompted by these considerations, we notice the movements under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and of the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of intervention by the outside Powers.\n168.\tSince the conclusion of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly certain important developments have taken place in our part of the world. Of particular international significance is the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam, signed in Paris on 27 January 1973, and the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos of 21 February 1973. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of every Indo-Chinese State to determine their own future without any outside interference. It acknowledges the inadmissibility of outside intervention in the internal affairs of any of these Indo-Chinese States. It provides for the settlement of the problems existing in the countries of Indo-China by the Indo-Chinese parties themselves on the basis of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the other's internal affairs. These simple principles embodied in the Agreement, which are of universal application in relations between States, are by no means new principles. What is significant is that they are acknowledged and reaffirmed after years of bitter conflict in Indo-China, which has seen massive intervention by outside Powers and which has brought untold suffering to the valiant Indo-Chinese peoples and immeasurable damage and destruction to their countries.\n169.\tThe delegation of Burma is gratified at the prospect that the peoples of the countries of Indo-China will be able to determine, without external interference, their own political status and to pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. However difficult their tasks of national reconciliation, concord and national reconstruction, we have faith that they will be able to work out among themselves satisfactory solutions to their own problems and to rebuild their nations successfully. Belonging as they do to South-East Asia, the Indo-Chinese States, like other States in the region, will have to play their part in the region and will have to share in its future. The restoration of conditions of peace and stability in Indo-China will open up new prospects of consultation and co-operation among the countries of the region for building up the kind of Southeast Asia they want. It is therefore essential that the peoples of the Indo-Chinese States reach speedy settlement of their own problems and that no further outside interference take place on whatever pretext.\n170.\tBurma welcomes the Delhi agreement of 28 August 1973 which, we believe will pave the way to a peaceful settlement of the problems of the Indian subcontinent. Burma is also in full accord with the desirability of obtaining conditions of relaxed tension in the Indian Ocean, being of the view that this would be conducive to the peace and stability of the States bordering it. Admittedly, the legal, political, and military implications are many-sided, and we are inclined to take the view that reasonable time will be needed for steps to be worked out to improve the chances for creating an atmosphere favourable for countries within the region, as well as for outsiders active in the region, to acknowledge their mutuality of interests. We express the hope that the proposal for a peace zone in the Indian Ocean will eventually mature and receive the support and cooperation of all States concerned.\n171.\tIt distresses us particularly that the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated. While the United Nations continues its quest for new initiatives to resolve the problem, we would urge the countries of the region most directly concerned with the problem to exercise restraint and to avoid further bloodshed and destruction and to try instead to arrive at a negotiated settlement. We express the hope that it will still be possible to reach a peaceful settlement of the problem on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n172.\tAnd now I turn to the issue of colonialism, racism and racial discrimination as they relate to relations between the rest of Africa and the States of the south of the continent. I refer here to questions of colonialism in the Territories under Portuguese administration, racism in Southern Rhodesia and racial discrimination in the form of apartheid in South Africa. The General Assembly has been dealing with these issues over the past two decades and yet the prospects of a solution are no nearer. Over-all development in the past year has heightened fears that the mounting sense of tension in South Africa is moving ever faster to a critical point of explosive proportions. Colonialism in the Territories under Portuguese administration, racism in Southern Rhodesia and apartheid in South Africa continue to persist in flagrant violation of all accepted norms concerning the dignity and worth of the human person. At a time when the greater part of the international community is seeking more positive relations to build a better world than we have known, a fraternally linked Africa no doubt could contribute a great deal towards international peace and security.\n173.\tThere can be no question that the ultimate goal for mankind as a whole in the field of disarmament must be the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Burma has always supported that goal, but has felt at the same time that the most realistic approach to that end is to direct our immediate efforts towards achieving agreements on what are referred to as collateral or partial measures, which hold far better prospects in present circumstances. Two such measures which are urgently needed are, in our view, the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons and the achievement of a comprehensive test ban.\n174.\tMy delegation shares the general disappointment at the lack of any material progress towards agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons. A large number of suggestions were made at the 1973 session of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament with a view to inducing movement towards agreement. However, positions on the fundamental issues involved have remained frozen and, in some cases, seem to have hardened.\n175.\tIt is now 10 years since the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water. Having consistently opposed the testing of nuclear weapons in all environments, Burma became a party to the Treaty in the belief that it represented an important step forward towards the realization of a universal and comprehensive test ban in all elements. In the circumstances, my delegation considers that the General Assembly should urge the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to redouble its efforts at its next session with a view to the early conclusion of a convention on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons and a comprehensive test ban.\n176.\tI now turn to a subject which constitutes a central issue of our times \u2014 the problem of the ever-widening gap between the developed and developing countries. The level of existence of countless millions of people in the developing part of the world is still pitifully low. Those people are often still undernourished, uneducated, unemployed and wanting in many other basic amenities of life. While a part of the world lives in comfort and even affluence, much the larger part suffers from abject poverty. In fact, the disparity is continuing to widen. The most acute problem in the present period of world economic relations is the instability of the world trade and monetary situation, the consequences of which bear heavily on the developing countries, thus placing the very question of their economic development in serious jeopardy. As we are all aware, two decades ago the developing countries set out to accelerate their pace of development. Despite national and international efforts at development the achievements have been meagre and present indications are that the gap will continue to widen.\n177.\tFor developing countries the major source of foreign exchange to finance the process of economic development comes from foreign trade earnings. The central problem for the developing countries is the persistent deterioration in their terms of trade in their position as traditional exporters of primary products. The adverse trends in commodity trade for the developing countries are well known. The industrially developed countries lay down the prices 6f raw materials and semi-finished products, the prices of which continue to deteriorate steadily and are unable to keep pace with the rising prices of imported industrial products which developing countries must pay. As a result, the share of those countries in world trade continues to decline. A generalized system of preferences has been offered as the answer to the developing countries' demand for equity in world trade, but in practice the procedure has proved so lengthy and encumbered with exceptions that it has not had the desired maximum effect. For the effective functioning of the preferential system it must be complemented by related assistance and trade promotion. The trade question is linked to the cost of shipping, for shipping is largely owned by the developed countries and as a result the rising cost of freight charges for exports and imports is having increasingly adverse effects on the balance of payments of the developing countries, especially those in the least developed category.\n178.\tThe lasting self-supporting growth of a country cannot be achieved by development aid alone, Even if considerably increased, such aid can only be marginal to a country's development. Moreover, development assistance has in the past two decades been a record of increasing indebtedness. From all this it is clear that, apart from development aid, there exists a necessity for the industrially developed countries to contribute to building up the earnings of the developing countries through improved access to their markets.\n179.\tThe magnitude of the problems encountered by the developing countries has been further compounded by the international monetary crisis, which has adverse effects on the currency reserves, imports and terms of trade of the developing countries. In this era of trade and monetary politics, when political relations between States are increasingly determined by economic considerations, it has become more than ever necessary for the developed and developing countries to collaborate as equal partners; otherwise the fear that the two will soon be heading on a collision course may inevitably materialize.\n180.\tLastly, may I be permitted to state our view that however big or small, powerful or weak a nation, there is a need now, far more than ever before, for Member States of this Organization to. redouble their efforts to make the United Nations an effective arena of action. The direction of United Nations persuasion lies in a two-fold challenge \u2014  how can it be a force for peace, and how can it be a force for greater economic and social equality? The international political and economic relations to which we have been accustomed since the end of the Second World War are undergoing profound changes. Ours is an era of adjustment. It is therefore imperative for Member States to have deeper faith in the Charter and to place more reliance on the United Nations system in the solution of their problems, in order to follow faithfully the path of structuring their relations in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Notwithstanding its imperfections, the United Nations and its organs provide us with a unique field for initiatives in all areas of international co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff141.\tStanding here today addressing this great Assembly for the first time I am deeply conscious of the honour my President, His Excellency Dr. Siaka Stevens, has conferred on me by conveying through me his personal warm greetings and salutations, as well as those of his Government and the entire people of Sierra Leone. We congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of this twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We doubt not that you will guide our deliberations here admirably.\n142.\tWe wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, under whose active, energetic and wise leadership the twenty-seventh session tackled seriously so many important African issues.\n143.\tWe wish also to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for his heroic efforts in the Herculean task of being our Secretary-General. Under his aegis the influence of the United Nations has been brought to bear on the many areas of conflict, particularly in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. His efforts demand our admiration and, even more so, our support. His participation in the recent deliberations of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States provides reassuring evidence of the co-operation between the United Nations and other organizations with similar objectives. Sierra Leone wishes him well and hopes that his efforts will be crowned with ever-increasing success.\n44. It gives me, personally, particular pleasure to extend our warm welcome to the new Members of the United Nations: the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The bonds between Sierra Leone and each of these countries are strong, but I can and do feel the joy of this great occasion more particularly for more personal reasons.\n145. Sierra Leone is a small country but a nation totally committed to the ideals of this Organization. It is our belief that the strength and saving grace of this institution is that nations, irrespective of size, can, rightly motivated, contribute adequately and effectively to this world body. It is our view that in the United Nations lies the only reasonable hope for the peoples of this world. It is for that reason that I am happy and proud to pledge in all sincerity the fullest co-operation of my delegation towards the attainment of the ideals, purposes and principles of our Organization. It is our view that there is a duty incumbent on each and every Member State to work towards a truly harmonized community of nations. To do so we must folly appreciate that we belong to a community of nations. We must appreciate that irresponsible pursuit of what we misguidedly consider to be our nation's self-interest is short-sighted folly; that at best the result of such an endeavour is a balance of fear and at worst an unimaginable holocaust. It should not be difficult for thinking men to appreciate that, in a world as tiny as ours-and getting tinier every day-to ask, \\\"Am I my brother's keeper? \\\", is to ask the obvious.\n146.\tWe believe the time has come for every Member State to eschew propagandist slogans and to work diligently towards the goals of our Organization, for an ordered world dedicated to the pursuit of the goals of peace \u2014 the mounting of an effective assault upon the diseases that still ravage mankind, and an improvement of the poor standard and quality of life at present available to 90-odd per cent of the world's population.\n147.\tIs it not high time we stopped talking interminably about the gap between the haves and the have-nots? Is such talk an end in itself? Are we going to continue talking about it and doing nothing else? The reduction of the gap, I suggest, not only is worthy of the attention of the galaxy of talent available to this Organization but should be one of our association's priority action programmes. Therefore, Sierra Leone proposes that the following be included on the agenda of the twenty-eighth General Assembly session as an important and urgent item: Reduction of the increasing gap between the developed countries and the developing countries. \n148.\tIt is for reasons such as those just mentioned that my Government welcomes the detente of recent years. This positive trend, we are confident, will manifest itself in a wider measure of agreement and co-operation, not only among the super-Powers, whose individual interest dictated this mutual accommodation, but also among all States, because the welfare and survival of humanity depend on continuing peace, continuing stability and continuing international understanding.\n149.\tWe cannot hope in the brief span of one statement to this Assembly even to review, let alone pretend to solve, all the world's problems. We can, however, highlight some of the more disturbing, and this I intend to do during the next few minutes.\n150.\tThe misery that has recently plagued 10 million people of the Sahelian region on the continent of Africa as a result of drought is still not a past event. While we must express our sincere appreciation and thanks to the various Governments and international institutions, not least the specialized agencies of our own Organization, for quickly rushing aid to the millions of starving victims, I would make an appeal to the Member States of this world body for this disaster to be given even greater publicity through the mass media so as to elicit greater short-term and long-term relief, as well as rehabilitation programmes, from the entire international community.\n151.\tOn the African continent the problem of decolonization continues to manifest itself in its most atrocious forms.\n152.\tThe Rhodesian problem has grown increasingly worse over the past eight years, and, in spite of the persistent efforts of OAU, this Organization and other progressive forces of liberation, the intransigence of Mr. Smith and his racist oligarchy are making it almost impossible to arrive at a peaceful solution of this explosive problem. By a systematic introduction of racist legislation and practices, by oppressive rule accompanied by the bullets of madmen, by blatant disregard of the voice of the masses, this illegal regime continues to entrench itself, contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the international community. Recently this intolerable situation has been exacerbated further by the closing of the borders with Zambia, an act which can justly be described as economic aggression. It is now all too evident that the British Government cannot or will not by itself resolve this issue. It is thus only by the determined action of all members of this community, both individually and collectively, that we can hope to achieve any meaningful results by means other than conflict and bloodshed. Unhappily, the sanctions on which this Organization has decided are being imposed either partially or half-heartedly by those whose compliance is likely to make the greatest impact on the Rhodesian economy. Unless there is a change of heart in this direction, the only other possibility-a solution by force of arms \u2014 with all its attendant horrors and inevitable high cost in terms of human life, will be the personal responsibility of each and every one of us who failed to support faithfully this Organization's call for sanctions. Let not the blood of the Zimbabweans be on our hands and on the heads of our children.\n153.\tWe recommend and continue to urge a widening of sanctions both in scope and in intensity, to include, in particular, travel, communications, sports and all other economic, political, social and cultural activities, because we are convinced that, in a world in which nations have become so increasingly interdependent, political, economic and cultural isolation are bound to make a corrective impression on even the most intransigent regimes.\n154.\tIn Namibia, history appears to have stood still or to be moving backwards. It is deeply regretted that in spite of the decision and the subsequent actions of this body to assume the administration of that Territory and free its inhabitants from the clutches of the South African Government, we are witnessing instead the dismemberment of Namibia into homelands in preparation for the wholesale importation of apartheid.\n155.\tThe Namibian issue is a test of the efficacy of the United Nations. No Member State therefore can treat it with indifference without betraying the principles that give this Organization its meaning. It is the sacred obligation of every Member of this Organization to co-operate fully in the search for a just solution of this problem. My delegation would therefore support whomever this Organization considers fit to appoint as its Commissioner for that hapless Territory.\n156.\tIn order to ensure that the measures decided upon at this session will meet with a greater measure of success, we once again call upon the South African Government, as a Member of this world Organization, to recognize its obligation to co-operate with the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia so that we may bury once and for all one of the last surviving skeletons from the League of Nations. Failure to heed such a call must be taken as disrespect for and lack of interest in our Organization.\n157.\tIn Angola and Mozambique, the Portuguese colonial war continues with unabated intensity, punctuated now and then by episodes of wanton massacres of women and children and acts of blatant aggression against neighbouring African Territories.\n158.\tThe most recent example of this was the revelation of the massacre of 400 men, women and children in the village of Wiriyamu in the Tete Province of Mozambique. It will be recalled that the Special Committee stated that Portugal could not escape responsibility for its \\\"barbarous acts\\\" against the oppressed populations of the Territories under its domination and declared that the evidence gave further proof of the regime's total disregard for human life and basic human values.\n159.\tWe would like to endorse fully the Committee's consensus that all individuals representing Portuguese military and civilian authorities involved in the reported atrocities must be placed at the disposal of United Nations representatives for systematic interrogation. \n160.\tWe have seized every possible opportunity to point out that, although the military initiative is Portugal's, yet without the economic and military support of its NATO allies the Portuguese colonial dream would long ago have been abandoned. Consequently, those who give comfort and assistance to the perpetrators of the bestialities of this colonial war must, of necessity, share the blame for its horrible consequences. On this occasion we salute the brave freedom fighters who, against overwhelming odds, are holding high the banner of liberty, and we shall continue to give them every encouragement and support in their just struggle.\n161.\tClosely linked with these colonial problems is that of the policy of apartheid practised by the South African Government.\n162.\tIn condemning apartheid we need only to look back to the recent repetition of Sharpeville to establish the fact that time has not improved the position. Unarmed miners were brutally killed in cold blood because they simply asked for better conditions of work. They were not even asking for their lands of which they have been unjustly deprived. How then can we hope for a peaceful solution to apartheid when its perpetrators are also wanton killers.\n163.\tWith unrestrained ferocity the South African Government is systematically eradicating all enlightened opposition to its policy of racial segregation and racial oppression, completely insensitive to the feelings of the world community and the aspirations of the vast indigenous majority. It is common knowledge that we have repeatedly appealed to the South African Government, through the Special Committee against Apartheid, the Security Council, OAU and the non-aligned movement, to liberalize its policy of discrimination on the basis of colour. The Manifesto on Southern Africa in particular proposed, in unequivocal terms, an honourable basis for the solution of a most dishonourable problem. In spite of all these endeavours, however, we are again compelled, from this rostrum, painfully to review this unhappy story of man's extreme inhumanity to his fellow man.\n164.\tGiven the history of the situation, it is obvious that we can no longer expect any positive voluntary response from the South Africans. Our only hope, therefore, is to appeal to the rest of humanity to redouble its effort to eradicate the stain of apartheid and racial discrimination from the face of the African continent. If we fail to do this, the ghosts of Sharpeville and the blood of the innocent miners will forever haunt the conscience of the world, and the South African situation itself will pose an increasing threat to the peace and security of southern Africa and the world at large. We appeal for a total boycott of South Africa, because again, as with Rhodesia, we feel that the effects of isolation \u2014 military, economic, diplomatic and cultural-can only be salutary. We also ask ourselves, however, despite the fact that we believe fervently that membership of our Organization must be as universal as practical, can South Africa, with its blatant disregard of the fundamental principles of our Organization, remain a Member?\n165.\tOn the Middle East situation we express the deepest possible concern that the Government of Israel has not to date recognized the wisdom of complying with Security Council resolution 242(1967). Sierra Leone cannot support the acquisition of any territory by any country through force.\n166.\tEarlier in the year we welcomed with great relief the news that armed conflict in Viet-Nam, with its tragic toll of lives and property, was finally being brought to an end through the Paris peace Agreement. Conflicting reports suggest, however, that the embers are still glowing, and we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all the parties in that conflict to exercise responsibility and restraint if lasting peace is to be restored to the people of that troubled and divided country.\n167.\tIn Korea, the continued division of that once united country represents a most delicate situation. As we debate this question for the last time in the General Assembly, we wish to lay great emphasis on the need for the Korean people themselves to be allowed to work together for the reunification of their homeland.\n168.\tIn the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent the news of reconciliation among the combatants provides the refreshing evidence of responsible statemanship. we trust this spirit of reconciliation will continue and that before long we shall witness the release and exchange of all remaining prisoners of war, as well as the admission of the new state of Bangladesh into this community of nations. Unhappily however, dark clouds continue to hover over Asia, as evidenced by the Cambodian conflict. With the Vietnamese experience so vivid in our minds, it seems hardly necessary to dwell on the unwisdom of pouring in arms and men in order to try to subdue the determined will of the Cambodian people. \n169.\tWhile we welcome the progress made so far in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, we cannot be complacent about the whole disarmament situation. Nuclear arms continue to pose a very real threat to peace, and the continuation of nuclear tests, particularly in the atmosphere, 10 years after the signing of the partial test-van Treaty gives cause for great concern. It should by now be clear to all that nuclear confrontation cannot guarantee universal peace, because the balance of terror can only provide a sense of insecurity. Moreover, the increasing cost of the arms race is such a constant drain on the limited and diminishing resources available for development that its continuation can only perpetuate and widen the development gap and provide evidence of misguided motivation. We have noted with satisfaction the efforts being made by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to involve the developing countries in the use of benefits of space application.\n170.\tThe convening of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, scheduled for Chile in April and May 1974 is becoming more and more uncertain. My delegation supports the holding of this Conference not least because the existence of varying national stands particularly on the question of limits of territorial waters demands consultation and negotiation to harness and exploit man's common heritage for the benefit of all mankind.\n171.\tIt is my country's view that the resources of the sea must be exploited like all the other resources of this earth for the benefit of all mankind and that the industrially developed nations must not seek to seize the opportunity of their technological advancement to monopolize the exploitation and utilization of the mineral and living resources of the sea and the sea-bed. Any such attempt would be hazardous in the extreme, for in this day and age it would be stoutly resisted even by the smallest and the poorest of the developing nations.\n172.\tIn a rightly motivated world we would not need to be told that the strong must not trample the weak nor the rich exploit the poor. But, alas, this is what obtains today.\n173.\tIn 1970, Member States unanimously adopted an International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which aimed at diminishing the gross inequalities in economic growth and material welfare among the nations of this world, and attacking poverty in ways that would improve the conditions of the poorest groups within the poor countries. \n174. Three years have now elapsed and the gap which that strategy sought to bridge seems on the conrary to be growing wider every day. Indeed, it is ironical that with the growing entente among the industrial nations, there has developed an attitude of nonchalance towards the poverty-stricken areas of the world. The developed nations have been able to meet neither the goal of a net transfer of 1 per cent of the their gross national product nor the 0.7 per cent target set for the United Nations development decade. \n175. My country notes with satisfaction the recent discussions on a new international monetary order and the establishment of a committee of 20 under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund  whose aim is to enlarge the representation of the developing countries. we are convinced that such a step would be useful in remedying the present world monetary crisis and altering the direction of the flow of finance.\n176.\tWe are, however, much concerned about the growing protectionism practised by the developed countries against the primary products of the developing nations.\n177.\tMy country is quite satisfied with the outcome of the deliberations of the first session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme, held this year in Geneva. It still maintains the position that the application of technology should be adapted to the realities of the developing countries especially in the field of agriculture and the solution of other environmental problems. During the discussions it became more than evident that whereas the developed countries have been concerned with pollution caused by affluence, the developing countries are groaning under pollution engendered by poverty.\n178.\tMoreover, whereas the developed nations have envisaged the problems of the human environment in terms of scientific and industrial progress, the poorer nations explain them in terms of economic and social inadequacies like unemployment, malnutrition, poor sanitation and shanty towns.\n179.\tLet me end as I began, by reaffirming Sierra Leone's faith in the United Nations. The past contribution of the United Nations to the peace and security of the world has been inestimable. Unique is its future role in evolving a true community of nations, in harmonizing the interests of all, in utilizing the world's limited resources for the benefit of all, and in settling disputes by peaceful means. Sierra Leone pledges to do all in its power to assist the United Nations to achieve its full potential. To do this we are convinced that the situation where one nation can by the exercise \u2014 arbitrary or otherwise \u2014 of a veto frustrate the wishes and often the collective wisdom of the rest of the entire international community is totally unacceptable. It is also our position that now is an appropriate time for a review of the entire question of the permanent membership of the Security Council.\n180.\tWe shall, within and outside this forum, along with any and all other peace-loving nations dedicated to the betterment of the lot of all mankind \u2014 especially the underfed, the under-privileged and the oppressed \u2014 search for the solutions to our many problems, always conscious that we are our brother's keeper. Sierra Leone undertakes to heed the Secretary-General's reminder in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l] that Governments tend to pursue their strict national aims in the United Nations with regard to the Organization as such and we shall seek to take corrective action.\n181.\tThe Secretary-General has also pointed out that this body will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support not backed by inner conviction and he left us, in his closing words, to consider just what kind of world organization we need and are prepared in reality to accept. It is the view of the Sierra Leone Government that the kind of world organization we need is one growing rapidly and steadily from an ineffective world debating forum to an embryonic world parliament with all necessary ancillary legal and physical powers. To this end we stand ready and willing to surrender as much or as little of our national sovereignty to such a world body as is necessary to give the latter reality and meaning.\n182.\tThose are the views of my Government that I have been privileged to present. We state again that one of the fundamental tenets of Sierra Leone's foreign policy has always been support for this Organization. We will continue to follow that tenet, particularly in accordance with the above-mentioned principles."

        "file_text": "\ufeff140.  It is my pleasant duty to extend to Mr. Benites my warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. These congratulations are all the more warm since Lebanon maintains with Ecuador, as indeed it does with all Latin American countries in general, particularly cordial relations.\n141.\tI also take pleasure in paying a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, who assumed with competence the presidency of the last session of the General Assembly.\n142.\tIt is also my pleasure to express the appreciation of my delegation for the devotion of the Secretary-General of our Organization. Mr. Waldheim's attachment to the purposes of the United Nations and his tireless efforts in the service of peace resulted most recently in his visit to the countries of the Middle East. I should like to state here that his visit to Lebanon was very highly appreciated and very useful. My Government is a convinced supporter of the action of the Secretary-General and would express the wish that his efforts be crowned with success.\n143.\tThese wishes are not just a matter of form. Lebanon, a founding Member of the United Nations, has always had great confidence in our Organization and has always shown a sincere and constant attachment to it. It has participated in its activities and supported its actions in so far as it has been able. At a time when the United Nations is preparing to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, permit me to mention as an example the contribution made by Lebanon to that historic event. I should also like to remind you that in the Middle East, of which it is a part, Lebanon has always tried to promote United Nations action and to make available to our Organization and the specialized agencies all of the facilities it has been in a position to offer. Thus 10 organs of the United Nations are today represented in my country. The Lebanese Government has decided to establish, in co-operation with our Organization, a United Nations Centre in Beirut. The Economic Commission for Western Asia, the establishment of which in Lebanon has just been approved by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1818 (LV) and will undoubtedly also be approved by this session of the Assembly, strengthens even further the ties which exist between the United Nations and Lebanon.\n144.\tThe United Nations, for its part, has always shown a great deal of understanding towards my country and has lavished upon it all the support it has been in a position to give. During the course of the suffering which has afflicted the Arab countries since 1967, it is worth while reminding you that Lebanon has had frequent recourse to the Security Council to denounce the acts of aggression directed against it by an irascible neighbour. Eight times the Security Council has condemned Israel and supported the Lebanese Government.\n145.\tLebanon, therefore, a small country devoted to peace and a resolute partisan of international co-operation, would like to express its most fervent hope that the Organization will be strengthened, its prestige enhanced and its means of action increased. Unfortunately, however, when one takes a look at the agenda of this session and compares the results achieved by our Organization with the responsibilities which it would normally be expected to assume, one cannot help feeling some disillusion. How many major problems still remain unsettled. All our debates in the past, the many resolutions we have adopted, and all our efforts have not succeeded in settling them. The Middle East crisis remains in a state of deadlock; the question of Korea has not-yet been settled; colonialism in Africa is not slackening its grip, and racial discrimination continues to exist there. The disarmament discussions are still in their embryonic stage; the difficulties encountered by the developing countries are becoming ever more serious; and the gap between the poor and the rich countries is growing constantly wider.\n146.\tNevertheless, the agenda does, of course, reflect positive aspects and the progress achieved in certain areas, Although we are far from final solutions, we note with satisfaction that the United Nations is approaching constructively the economic and social problems which arise in the international sphere, particularly those of the environment, population, trade, the sea-bed and so on. Considerable progress has been achieved, too, towards universality. We therefore are gratified at the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the great family of the United Nations. May we be permitted to express the hope that in the near future the United Nations will become synonymous with the international community as a whole?\n147.\tWe note with equal satisfaction the progress achieved in the past year towards the relaxation of international tension. Although bilateral diplomacy has played a decisive role in achieving this progress, there is no doubt, that the United Nations has contributed, and continues to contribute, to an improvement of the international atmosphere by promoting better understanding and by creating broad possibilities for dialogue. The rapprochement between the great Powers, the agreements on South-East Asia, the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the talks between the two Koreas, the bilateral negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons and the agreements on the problems of the Indian subcontinent are all positive results which reflect the new international spirit and encourage optimism.\n148.\tOf all the political questions which will be considered at this session, the one which causes the most concern to us is obviously that of the Middle East. I should like to express here and now the deep conviction of my delegation that this question, and indeed all those which involve the fate of human communities, whatever their size, can be settled satisfactorily and lastingly only if such a settlement is based first and foremost on a spirit of equity and justice. Political manoeuvres, considerations based on the balance of forces and interests should in no way be allowed to stifle the voice of right and justice.\n149.\tLet us take care not to stifle that voice any longer. History teaches us that every time the voice of right and justice has not been heeded, the result has inevitably been an explosion, leading to the collapse of structures which had been established to maintain the peace,\n150.\tThe fundamental facts of the Middle East problem are very familiar to this Assembly. They have been so amply set forth, commented upon and debated that I have no intention of repeating what has so often been said in the past, nor do I intend to anticipate what other speakers may say at this session. I shall confine myself simply to recalling here certain basic truths and to setting forth succinctly the views of my Government.\n151.\tThe first truth is that Israel, a Member of the United Nations, to which it owes its very existence, continues to occupy by force territories belonging to sovereign States which are also Members of this Organization. That occupation constitutes a flagrant violation of international-law and a defiance of the United Nations, which, by several resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council, has condemned the acquisition of territory by force. Israel no longer troubles to conceal its ambitions with regard to the fate of these territories. Through the words of its most authoritative leaders and by the military, economic and settlement policy which it has been pursuing for six years, it is systematically applying a policy of conquest and annexation. Of course, the Arab countries will do everything in their power to resist that colonial policy, and they will offer that resistance as long as is necessary. But the problem transcends the context of the Arab countries and involves the international community as a whole. The question is whether we live in a policed world or must resign ourselves indefinitely to the law of the jungle. Lebanon has appealed to the United Nations whenever the occasion has arisen and exhorted it to contemplate concrete and effective measures to ensure the rule of law and right. From this rostrum I firmly and solemnly repeat the same exhortation.\n152.\tThe second truth is that Israel has driven a whole people from its motherland, gained possession of its property and trampled underfoot its most elementary and sacred rights. Israel has inflicted and continues to inflict upon it and upon all those who have granted it their hospitality most brutal violence: violations of air space, bombardments, abduction of soldiers and civilians, punitive expeditions, occupation of strategic points, hijacking and destruction of civilian aircraft. At the beginning, Israel pointed to the activities of the fedayeen in an attempt to justify its aggression. As we know, those activities were committed sporadically, I would say, by uncontrollable elements. But today Israel no longer takes the trouble to find justifications. It claims the right to take preventive measures against Palestinians whom it has driven from their homes or who have fled the ostracism of the invader.\n153.\tThe fate of the Palestinian people constitutes the heart of the problem in the Middle East. Even if other aspects of this problem were settled to the satisfaction of all the States concerned, even if the territories were liberated, the Holy Places restored to their universal function and questions of shipping resolved, as long as the fate of the people of Palestine was not settled in accordance with equity in a way satisfactory to their legitimate aspirations to freedom and human dignity, nothing would really have been solved. That people must be consulted on its future. It is entitled to respect, understanding and consideration.\n154.\tEveryone knows that Lebanon took no part in the military operations of June 1967. It was not, therefore, directly involved in that conflict. But that conflict has had a profound effect upon it, not only because it is a member of the League of Arab States and considers itself bound by ties of solidarity with those States but also because Israel has certain designs on its territory and its waters, and because more than 300,000 Palestinians live on its territory.\n155.\tLebanon will, in so far as it is able, participate in the search for a just and lasting solution. But Lebanon has no territorial problem to discuss with anyone, either directly or even indirectly. The only international document which defines its position on Israel is the Lebanese-Israel Armistice Agreement of 1949. That Agreement put an end to hostilities and established the supervision and control organs with the co-operation of the United Nations and under its chairmanship. Whatever allegations to the contrary may be put forward by Israel, that document is still in force. The Security Council itself has repeatedly decided so, most recently by its resolution 337 (1973), adopted unanimously on 15 August 1973.\n156.\tLebanon considers that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) primarily concerns those countries which took part in the 1967 conflict. It does not, therefore, have either to accept it on its own account or to reject it. But it does support it, because it sees in it a basis upon which the over-all solution should be built. That resolution contains, among others, a provision calling for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from occupied territories and stating the need to settle the Palestinian problem equitably.\n157.\tIt is no longer possible in our day to apply the old adage, \\\"Politics first\\\". Economic matters have assumed such an importance that they are now inseparable from politics.\n158.\tFor 25 years Lebanon, like other Arab States, has constantly suffered the disastrous economic consequences of an unresolved political conflict. Only the establishment of peace can permit the peoples of the region to devote their resources and energies to constructive purposes, And this peace cannot be beneficial only to the peoples of the region themselves. It will also serve the interests of the human community as a whole and will strengthen international stability and security.\n159.\tThe subject of economic and social development, which has been given -prominence for many years now, has unfortunately not yet produced sufficient concrete results. The evaluation of the Second United Nations Development Decade, in the light of the discussions in the Economic and Social Council and the Food and Agriculture Organization particularly, is not very encouraging. The rich countries do not seem sufficiently aware that in the world of today, in which everything is interdependent, it is in their interests to increase substantially the effort asked of them. For their part, the developing countries seem to be confining themselves more and more to a demanding attitude unlikely to facilitate a dialogue.\n160.\tThe problem of disarmament is no less distressing than that of poverty. Everything has already been said on this subject. I would simply like to suggest that, if a decision is taken to reduce armaments, the possibility be studied of creating within the framework of the United\nNations a special fund designed to give rapid assistance to countries afflicted by natural disasters, a fund financed by a portion of the financial resources at present devoted to the production of means of destruction.\n161.\tThe United Nations quite rightly is displaying growing interest in the problems of the environment. Man, the marvellous creator, has suddenly discovered that he is also a ruthless destroyer. He knows that nature is threatened by death. That realization has already led to abundant research and study, which has not, however, yet been translated into action by a rescue programme. I should like to mention that my country has made a special effort in the area of the protection of nature. A Mediterranean conference was held in Beirut last May to study ways and means of fighting pollution in the Mediterranean basin. It adopted a programme which it called the Beirut Charter and established a standing conservation committee which will be staffed by the National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon.\n162.\tAnother problem which is worthy of our attention is that of the sea-bed. In its resolution 3029 (XVII), the Assembly entrusted the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction with the task of preparing a draft convention to be submitted to a plenipotentiary conference in Santiago next April. Unfortunately, the draft convention is not yet ready. In the course of the many meetings which have been held, Member States have not shown a sufficient degree of co-operation. The Assembly proclaimed, amidst general enthusiasm, that the resources of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction constituted the common heritage of mankind as a whole [see resolution 2749 (XXV)]. An international organization was to be set up to exploit these resources for the benefit of all nations. These fine promises seem to have been forgotten very quickly. The conflict of national interests has overshadowed respect for the interests of the international community, and almost diverted the Committee from its initial task, which was to work for the development of international law of the sea and not to try to stifle it.\n153. The United Nations was created to promote the ideal of peace and justice in the world. In spite of all the setbacks and the difficulties which have been encountered, I should like to proclaim the faith of my country in our Organization and our attachment to it. Of course, as I have already pointed out, its possibilities of action are small compared with the considerable responsibilities it bears. Many of the extremely sc IUS and urgent problems unfortunately are still unresolved principal among which we find the distressing problem of the Middle East. But I am convinced that it is in the spirit of the Charter, and preferably within the framework of the United Nations, without excluding all other possibilities, that these problems should be examined and debated. It is upon the United Nations that all good will should converge in order to strengthen the possibilities of action and to lay down the principles of right and justice on solid foundations. We believe that it is not so much a matter of defining principles, outlining objectives and adopting new resolutions which are indistinguishable from each other, but rather a matter of tackling seriously the question of practical measures which should and must be taken in order to ensure the total and effective application of these resolutions. However that may be, Lebanon, for its part, however humble may be its contribution, will always work in this spirit and towards this objective."

        "file_text": "\ufeff183.\t Mr. President, the delegation of the Khmer Republic is doubly gratified by your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of our Organization. Firstly, you are the representative of a friendly nation with which my country enjoys the most cordial diplomatic relations. Also, you combine in your person the distinguished qualities of a diplomat and valuable experience in United Nations affairs, experience acquired over the many years during which you have brilliantly represented your beautiful country. We have no doubt that under your leadership the discussions at this session will be conducted with the tranquillity and success which we all expect.\n184.\tMy delegation associates itself with previous speakers in conveying to you, Mr. President, our warmest congratulations.\n185.\tIt is also an agreeable duty for me to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, President of the twenty-seventh session, who directed the proceedings last year with remarkable mastery.\n186.\tI cannot let this occasion pass without repeating once again to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our warm admiration for his tireless efforts to see to it that justice and peace reign in this world, which unfortunately, is still troubled in spite of a clear-cut trend towards detente.\n187.\tSubscribing unreservedly as we do to the principles of the universality of the United Nations, we should like to extend our sincere congratulations, best wishes and welcome to the representatives of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with which the Khmer Republic enjoys the best relations.\n188.\tFor three years representatives of the Khmer Republic have had occasion to draw the attention of this Assembly from this rostrum to the crimes and the destruction being committed by foreign aggression. In their passion to destroy everything that is specifically Khmer, the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong are victimizing our civilian population and everything which may be regarded as a resource of our country, whether it be humanitarian, cultural or economic.\n189.\tThe temples of Angkor, which are one of the most important heritages of the civilization of the world, have been militarily occupied since June 1970, in spite of the efforts of our Government, with the support of our\nSecretary-General and that of almost all the members of UNESCO, to place them under the special protection provided for by The Hague Convention of 1954.  It is very sad to note that these monuments of inestimable artistic and cultural value have, in this way, become the objects of vandalism and have been exposed to the elements because of a lack of proper maintenance.\n190.\tIndeed, since January 1972 these occupiers have prohibited access by the curators of Angkor, who work under the aegis of the French School of the Far East, an apolitical organization well known in the archaeological world.\n191.\tFor our part we are refraining from recovering these temples by force for fear of damaging them irremediably, even though the enemy might use them for military purposes.\n192.\tFurthermore, our concern is the greater because art treasures which were stolen from Angkor have been placed on sale, according to press reports, in certain world tourist centres.\n193.\tElementary school, high school and university buildings of the Khmer Republic are also subject to the destructive fury of the aggressors. It is the secondary schools particularly which are the most affected because they are scattered throughout the countryside, in large measure in the actual battlefields. Just to mention the primary school buildings: 3,154 of them have been destroyed. Hence, of a student body numbering 1.1 million in 1969-1970, only 720,000 of our school children were able to go to school this year.\n194.\tIn the realm of the health infrastructure 12 hospitals, 24 health centres and 160 infirmaries have been either demolished or damaged. What is more, our doctors and nurses have been massacred, in defiance of all humanitarian rules.\n195.\tMany religious buildings have had the same fate meted out to them, while several hundred Buddhist monks have been murdered or captured. Many of them have been forcibly defrocked and enrolled in the ranks of the aggressors, something which the Khmer people, who are more than 90 per cent Buddhist, consider as the worst kind of sacrilege.\n196.\tThe damage done to our roads, railways, dams,* factories, airports, and so on, amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. Unable to win a military victory, the\n, enemy devotes himself to the destruction of our economic infrastructure and does not even respect the work sponsored by the United Nations. The Prek Thnot dam, under construction, was twice attacked \u2014 in September 1971 and August 1973-and yet this international project, which, according to the very words of the Resident Representative of the United Nations in Phnom Penh, \\\"has really peaceful and humanitarian objectives\\\", is financed by the following countries: the Federal Republic of Germany, Australia,\nCanada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.\n197.\tBut the saddest spectacle of all in this aggression is the sight of people fleeing their villages or fields to take refuge in security zones. They have lost everything: their families, their houses, their harvests and their cattle. To date there are more than 2 million refugees in the capital and in the provinces-2 million human beings to feed and shelter for a country having a population of only 7 million. That tells you something of the tragedy of my country.\n198.\tInstead of giving way to despair, our Government, with the scanty resources available to it, has taken measures to deal with the highest priorities. However, in spite of the humanitarian assistance of friendly countries and international charitable institutions, the problem is far from solved.\n199.\tParallel to our national resistance efforts, and in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the Khmer people, a new Constitution was prepared and submitted to a national referendum. The First President of the Republic was elected by universal and direct suffrage on 4 June 1972. The legislative elections gave the country a Parliament, and this was followed by the establishment of other democratic institutions.\n200.\tWe should particularly like to stress here the social achievements of the Khmer people since the founding of the Republic. For the first time, a labour code has been promulgated.\n201.\tAs far as our outside obligations are concerned, we have not been neglecting the obligations incumbent upon us as a Member of the United Nations and other international organizations. Within the framework of our modest resources, we shall continue to take an active part in international co-operation.\n202.\tSteeped as they are in Buddhist teachings, the Khmer people reject all forms of racial discrimination between human beings, whatever the colour of their skin, their ethnic group or their religion.\n203.\tSince we, the Khmers, have known similar experiences in the past, we firmly support the authentic movements of fraternal peoples still under foreign domination. But with the same determination we resist expansionist aggression and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\n204.\tIn this connexion we should like to pay a tribute to distinguished previous speakers for having recognized the right of the Khmer people to settle as it wishes its own internal affairs without interference from outside.\n205.\tSince some representatives have been cynical enough to cast doubt on the legality of our Government from this very rostrum, I feel constrained to draw their attention to certain historical truths which may perhaps have escaped their notice.\n206.\tWe are well aware that every State is free to recognize any given Government, including a government in exile as is the case with the so-called Government of Norodom Sihanouk, who has chosen to reside in Peking. But to manoeuvre to impose such a government on the Khmer people constitutes inadmissible intervention in the internal affairs of that people, and we vigorously protest against such an act. As I asked here last year,\n\\\"In what treatise or manual of international law ... can\none find such criteria whereby a government-in-exile can\nbe considered the legal government of a land? \\\" \n207.\tCambodia was a monarchy until 9 October 1970, the date on which the Republic was proclaimed. Prince Norodom Sihanouk was in power for 30 years \u2014 from 1941 to 1955 as King, from 1955 to 1960 as Prime Minister or head of the party and from 1960 to 1970 as constitutional Head of State. In 1955 he abdicated in favour of his father. In 1960, on the death of his father, he had the Constitution amended to enable him to become Head of State once again without being King. In 1960 then, the two Houses of Parliament met and appointed him Head of State pending the appointment of a King. But that temporary situation lasted 10 years.\n208.\tOn 18 March 1970-that is, 10 years later-the same two Houses of die Khmer Parliament met and, after a long historic debate, withdrew from him their confidence and by a unanimous vote divested him of his functions as Head of State. Our Members of Parliament unanimously accused Prince Sihanouk of having authorized North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong troops to occupy Khmer territory illegally during the second half of the 1960s and to install there veritable military bases in flagrant violation of Khmer neutrality enshrined in the Geneva Agreements of 1954. That was also a blow against our independence, our sovereignty and our territorial integrity.\n209.\tThe vote in the Khmer Parliament was preceded by many popular demonstrations in the provinces and then in the capital against this foreign invasion.\n210.\tDissatisfied with this unanimous decision of the representatives of the Khmer people, Sihanouk asked for the aid of the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong so that he could be restored to power by force.\n211.\tOn 29 May 1970, the date on which these foreign troops began their first open and deliberate attacks against our defence forces and our civilian population, we identified the following North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong units, which were spread out here and there throughout our territory:\n(a)\tFirst North Viet-Namese Division, 101-D Regiment: 2,000 men stationed at Angkor Borey in Takeo;\n(b)\tFifth North Viet-Namese Division, 174-05 and 275 Regiments: 5,000 men stationed at Snuol in Kratie;\n(c)\tSeventh North Viet-Namese Division, 141-165 and 209 Regiments: 6,200 men stationed at Memot in Kompong Cham;\n(d)\tNinth North Viet-Namese Division, 95-C, 271 and 272 Regiments: 6,000 men stationed at Chup in Kompong Cham;\n(e)\tthe B-3 Front, Regiments 24-28-66-95-0: 10,800 men stationed at Ratanakiri in Bokeo;\n(f)\tmoreover, there were the command posts and the headquarters: 12,000 men;\n(g)\tand logistical services: 23,000 men. That makes a total of more than 65,000 men.\n212.\tMany North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong prisoners whom we hold at present in Phnom Penh, and the many documents that we seized in those attacks, constitute proof which no one here or anywhere else can refute.\n213.\tIt was in these circumstances that Sihanouk founded his Government in exile in Peking, as he put it, \\\"to liberate\\\" the country. But do we really need to stress that at that time, and even now, there were no American troops or military bases on Khmer territory? The only foreign troops that were to be found and that are to be found today in my country are exclusively those of North Viet-Nam and the Viet-Cong.\n214.\tAt the time when Sihanouk was stripped of his powers Marshal Lon Nol was already Prime Minister and he continued to direct the same Government until 1972, before being elected President of the Republic. It is quite clear that our Republican regime and its institutions, founded upon democratic and popular bases, were legally established.\n215.\tOn 30 April 1972 the Khmer people by means of a referendum organized throughout the country, in which more than 80 per cent of the electors participated, voted overwhelmingly for the Republican Constitution.\n216.\tOn 4 June 1972, under the new Constitution, Marshal Lon Nol was elected by universal and direct suffrage the first President of the Khmer Republic for a term of five years.\n217.\tOn 3 and 17 September 1972, the first National Assembly and the first Senate of the Khmer Republic were also elected by universal suffrage. The other institutions of the Republic \u2014 the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the High Court of Justice, and so forth \u2014 were successively and subsequently established.\n218.\tIt is infinitely regrettable that by means of flagrant lies our adversaries have succeeded in misleading part of public opinion with regard to the territory and population controlled by them.\n219.\tIndeed, to be honest we must make the following distinction: territory administered by us, about 20 provinces; the zones temporarily occupied by our adversaries, that is to say, the four Eastern provinces, whose density of population varies from three to five inhabitants per square kilometre, and the rest of the territory which constitutes combat zones.\n220.\tIn the circumstances, it is less than honest of them to claim to control 90 per cent of the territory.\n221.\tWith regard to the population, the lie is even more flagrant, because in Phnom Penh alone the population is already more than 2 million, and to this figure should be added the 4 million inhabitants residing in the provinces of Kandal, Battambang, Kompong Cham, Kampot, Kirirom, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Som, Kompong Speu, Kompong Thom, Oudong Meanchey, Oudor Meanchey, Pailin Phnom Del, Prey Veng, Pursat, Siem Reap, Svay Rieng, Takeo and Vihear Suor.\n222.\tMembers can see that in confirming that we control more than 6 million inhabitants of a population of 7 million we are not at all exaggerating.\n223.\tWe are not seeking to discomfit our adversaries, but it is our duty to provide the necessary clarification so that international public opinion is not misled, and particularly so that the judgement of the representatives present here can be based not upon falsehood but upon realities which are, incidentally, easily verifiable.\n224.\tDuring his years of power Sihanouk made himself into the all-powerful master of the country and its inhabitants. From 1967 to 1968, in particular, he began his witch hunt, which took the lives of 1,500 Red Khmers, as he himself confessed at Kompong Thom on 19 August 1968 over the national broadcasting network. Is there any need to recall the few democratic principles so often affirmed and so often forgotten, namely, that in Cambodia, as in other countries, sovereign power belongs to the people and no foreign State can claim the right to usurp that sovereignty for the benefit of anyone else, still less when that beneficiary is outside national territory. The Khmer political solution can only be found within the Khmer community resident on Khmer territory.\n225.\tThe Khmer Republic last year held its first presidential and legislative elections. However, my Government does not exclude the possibility of new elections once peace is restored and foreign troops have been withdrawn entirely from our territory.\n226.\tThe so-called neutrality of Norodom Sihanouk was in fact nothing but acquiescence in the use of Khmer territory for the benefit of aggressors from a neighbouring country.\n227.\tAs members are all aware, when foreign armed forces occupy and use a country to attack another country, the population inevitably suffers and the territory of the accomplice State inevitably becomes the scene of warfare.\n228.\tThe Khmer Republic, whose third anniversary we shall soon be celebrating, ostracizes no one. All Khmer citizens, whoever they are, may participate in public affairs without any consideration other than that of their talents. The last presidential elections demonstrated this fact. Indeed, my country is perhaps the only one in the world where two candidates for the presidency of the Republic who campaigned against each other during the electoral campaign joined forces after the elections to set up a common executive. Furthermore, political detainees and even the supporters and relatives of the former Chief of State, Norodom Sihanouk, were all freed and if they wish, they may even leave Cambodia. It is rare for a country which has known a change of regime to adopt such a liberal attitude. Countries which have undergone revolutions normally deny political rights to the members of the ruling family for a period which may last several decades or even longer. The Khmer Republic, which is only three years old, did not think that it needed to engage in such discrimination. All its citizens, without any distinction, have the same rights and duties with respect to the Republic.\n229.\tIf since 15 August-the date of the end of American air support \u2014 the Khmer Republic has remained on its feet, it is indeed because all Khmers preserve faith in the Republic. East is convinced that, whatever his origins and political allegiances, he will find in the Republic a social and political framework enabling him to realize his aspirations.\n230.\tI have no doubt that outside the Khmer Republic some people are attempting to destroy the structure born of an effort at national reconciliation, to replace it by a regime based upon the will of a single man, a regime with which we Khmers were only too familiar up to 18 March 1970. There have been efforts to refuse the Khmer Republic any possibility of existence in international life. Governments which do not have deep knowledge of the realities of Cambodia have been misled and have directed overt hostility towards the Khmer Republic. In some cases these efforts have been successful, but in most cases they have failed. If genuinely socialist States continue to maintain normal relations with the Khmer Republic, it is certainly because they consider that the republican regime is the only one open to all and likely to bring about reconciliation. On the other hand, the former regime, which was based upon the will of a single man, cannot serve as a basis for national reconciliation. The strength of the Khmer Republic, even when it can rely only on itself, lies precisely in its capacity to rally the people around its flag and not around a single man, a prey to all kinds of excess and to all moods. Union based on law and freedom of the people cannot give way to the will of a single man.\n231.\tDespite all their denials, the foreign forces of aggression continue to be stationed and to operate in our territory. In the 60 days which followed the signing of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam they introduced into our country fresh troops estimated at more than 10,000 fighting men, thus bringing their strength up to about 45,000. We have identified, among others, the First North Viet-Namese Division, the Viet Cong C-40 Division, the frontline B-3 Division, the 207th Regiment of the Fifth North Viet-Namese Division, the 277th Regiment of the Ninth North Viet-Namese Division, the Engineer Regiment No. 377 and the North Viet-Namese Heavy Division No. 69.\n232.\tIn order to mislead international public opinion our aggressors are attempting in the present phase of the war to camouflage their presence behind the formations of Red Khmers christened \\\"liberation forces\\\" for the occasion. However, with the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam, our profound desire to live in peace and understanding with all countries, in particular with our neighbours, whatever their political or ideological allegiance, is stronger than ever today.\n233.\tIndeed article 20 of that Agreement provides that all foreign troops operating in our territory should leave our country without delay: To demonstrate our goodwill, the President of the Khmer Republic has ordered the unilateral suspension of all offensive operations so as to facilitate the withdrawal of foreign troops. We were even ready to begin negotiations with the North Viet-Namese Government.\n234.\tIn spite of the absence of a positive response from our opposite numbers, my Government, on 6 July 1973, made another concrete peace proposal containing the following points: first, strict and immediate application, by all parties, of article 20 of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973; second, immediate withdrawal from Khmer territory of all foreign troops, their arms and munitions, to enable the Khmer people to settle its own problems without foreign interference and free from any outside pressure; third, reactivation of the International Commission for Supervision and Control set up under the Geneva agreements of 1954 to supervise the strict application of article 20 of the Paris Agreement; fourth, an immediate cease-fire between the troops of all parties; fifth, talks among Khmers with a view to bringing about a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation.\n235.\tWe have notified the signatories of the Final Act of Paris12 of this proposal and have appealed to all countries which love peace and justice and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to help make this proposal a reality and to obtain from all parties concerned the strict application of article 20 of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973.\n236.\tWe are encouraged to see that this proposal has met with a favourable response from all countries which have a real knowledge of the actual situation in the Khmer Republic.\n237.\tIt has, however, not been understood by those who hope to put an end to the war by a military solution and annexation.\n238.\tRecent developments in military operations show that peace in Cambodia can be brought about only under circumstances of national reconciliation, which, in turn, cannot be achieved without the total withdrawal of foreign troops.\n239.\tIt is in order to spare our people further suffering and misery that my Government, four days ago, repeated its peace offer which it made on 6 July last\n240.\tPeace is something to which we aspire with all our hearts and we have done everything within our power to obtain it. We are very much encouraged by having heard speakers here support us in this aim by calling for detente and international co-operation.\n241.\tThe world has welcomed with relief the conclusion of the cease-fire agreements in Viet-Nam and Laos. As an immediate neighbour, the Khmer Republic can only be gratified at such a development. However, we are firmly convinced that no true peace can be brought about in the region as a whole until a similar peace is established also in our country.\n242.\tIn conclusion, I should like on behalf of the Khmer people to make an appeal to all Members of the international community to help us, in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter, to restore peace, the peace which we have lost because of foreign aggression to satisfy the megalomania of one man."

        "file_text": "\ufeff83.\tMr. President and representatives, I bring to you the greetings and good wishes for the success of our deliberations from His Excellency President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta of the Republic of Kenya. That veteran fighter for freedom, liberty and independence for the oppressed people of the world now stands ready to fight for peace, liberty and justice for all nations, particularly individuals and minority groups who face oppression from any State.\n84.\tMy delegation extends its felicitations to the newly- elected President of the General Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador. His exceptional ability, breadth of vision and wide experience in the affairs of the United Nations should ensure the successful conclusion of the present session.\n85.\tTo the outgoing President, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland, we express our deep gratitude for conducting the last session with dispatch, skill and success.\n86.\tMy delegation deems it appropriate to welcome into our fold the new Members \u2014 namely, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. It is our conviction that their membership will strengthen the United Nations and promote effectively its fundamental objectives of peace, justice and co-operation. We hope that the stand of the United Nations for the promotion of justice and equality in the Territories under colonial domination or in the minority racist regimes in Africa will receive their unequivocal, sympathetic, and action-oriented support.\n87.\tTurning now to the seemingly intractable problem of the Middle East, I wish to express the deep concern of my country over the grave situation in the Middle East. In less than 25 years, this is the fourth full-scale war which has engulfed the people of the Middle East in untold suffering and destruction. Unless checked soon, it could easily develop into a global conflagration.\n88.\tWe African countries are not big Powers; we do not possess arsenals of sophisticated weapons. But we are intensely interested in peace, justice, progress and good- neighbourliness. Our own economies can develop only in conditions of peace and harmony. Therefore, we must play an active and sustained role in bringing about an honourable, just and expeditious settlement to the Middle East crisis under a durable structure of peace. In our view, what is called for is a fresh initiative by the African countries, alongside the other nations, to bring about the desired peace. This would be complementary to any efforts of the Security Council to find a meaningful and just solution through purposeful initiatives.\n89.\tThe current eruption of warfare should be terminated by cessation of hostilities, the immediate withdrawal of troops, and application of the following principles: first, the acquisition of territory by force of arms is inadmissible; secondly, all States in the region have a right to existence in conditions of peace and security; thirdly, the rights of the displaced Palestinians should under no circumstances be abused, overlooked, sacrificed or minimized; fourthly, the super-Powers should desist from accelerating an arms race in the whole region, because it eventually acts as a catalyst to warfare; and fifthly, an international system for guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area, including measures of demilitarization and the establishment of zones of peace, if necessary, should be seriously considered.\n90.\tKenya sincerely hopes that unnecessary loss of life and property on all sides will be averted through a cease-fire. It is high time that a permanent solution, which has long proved elusive in the halls and corridors of our Organization, was found \u2014 for the benefit of the peoples of that region and for world peace at large. The immediate national interests of foreign States should not be permitted to override the supreme necessity of restoring a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n91.\tOur yearly congregation in New York for the General Assembly session should not be merely an exercise in passing resolutions and declarations or exchanging impressive rhetoric and bitter polemics for consignment to the mushrooming archives of the United Nations. Urgent political issues of decolonization and restoration of peace require our urgent attention. Loud rumbles of economic discontent call for concerted action. Threats to peace need to be totally eliminated. Super-Power interests and covert collaboration should not be permitted to diminish the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping and in the processes of peace- building. The liberation of over 30 million Africans held in servitude in southern Africa should be accelerated by determined action on the part of the international community. The rapidly opening horizons in science and technology need to be applied to development for the eradication of poverty, disease, illiteracy and squalor.\n92.\tIn short, the challenges to be faced are numerous and multidimensional. Our responsibilities, therefore, are all the greater. To meet them realistically, we must not remain locked in sterile debate, inordinate delay or ideological confrontation. That is the path to abdication of responsibility, chaos and eventual ruination.\n93.\tIt is only proper that we should welcome the recent international detente, even if it does not mean a solution to most of the outstanding problems of this day and age. The dialogue of peace and co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union should be seen as a hopeful development. Similarly, the meeting together of two big Powers, which are also permanent members of the Security Council \u2014 one from the East and the other from the West \u2014  is a step in the right direction.\n94.\tThe cessation of hostilities in, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from, Viet-Nam should help the cause of peace and rehabilitation in that war-ravaged part of the world.\n95.\tThe process of reconciliation and normality between India and Pakistan should prove useful for building a durable structure of peace, progress and co-operation on the Indian subcontinent, encompassing as it does the great States of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n96.\tTangible results from the difficult negotiations at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are expected to strengthen peaceful relations amongst States, which should cut across the military pacts conceived in the context of cold-war politics. The enlarged European Economic Community should act as an effective counterpoise to the unbridled ambitions of the super-Powers. Other regional groupings of newly-emergent nations have a similar role to play.\n97.\tThe Assembly will readily understand Kenya's concern for the dire fate of millions of Africans who are condemned to slavery by Portuguese colonialism in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, by the repression and terror of the apartheid regime in South Africa and Namibia and by the illegal rebel regime in Rhodesia.\n98.\tBefore I dwell in some depth on the situation in southern Africa, I should like to hail the Declaration of Independence by the valiant freedom fighters of Guinea-Bissau. After decades of the slaughter of innocent men, women and children; after incalculable loss of property; after indescribable sufferings and deprivation, the gallant people of Guinea-Bissau have finally achieved their independence by armed struggle.\n99.\tJust as the Mau Maus of Kenya tore to shreds British colonial occupation in our forests, just as the Algerians defeated ,the French in the vast desert expanses of the Sahara, the people of Guinea-Bissau have now smashed the Portuguese colonialist presence in Guinea-Bissau by a relentless fight in the forests, plains and valleys of Guinea. That is an object lesson for the oppressed peoples of South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia to take to the velds and karoos of southern Africa to win their independence if all peaceful methods fail to give them their inalienable birthright to freedom and sovereignty.\n100.\tKenya pledges unreserved support to the people of Guinea-Bissau in consolidating their independence. Recognizing the new State is not sufficient in itself; we must ensure that it receives every form of moral and material support, particularly from the African and non-aligned countries that consistently supported the liberation struggle, in Guinea-Bissau. Kenya not only recognizes the new State of Guinea-Bissau, but is ready to offer any help that the new State may need.\n101.\tAfrica holds no brief for violence. Africa wants a peaceful solution to problems of race and inequality in Territories under alien domination and minority racist regimes. If, however, all these methods fail, then no one should blame the Africans for raising the standard of rebellion and violence against the oppression, terror and bloodshed which is inflicted on them by unrepresentative and imposed orders. If it should prove necessary, Africa is ready to water the tree of liberty with blood. Responsibility for any ensuing racial conflagration must then be placed squarely at the door of the racists and the colonialists. Let that be very clearly understood both by the racists and by the world community.\n102.\tThe conscience of the world has been outraged by the atrocities committed by the trigger-happy Portuguese soldiers in Mozambique. Defenceless, unarmed and innocent men, women and children have been butchered in the villages of Mozambique. These brutalities were exposed by reputable missionaries and by international journalists with impeccable credentials. It is probable that such massacres take place in great secrecy with calculated regularity in areas under Portuguese domination. This body must act to stop this wave of destruction, rape and plunder against the African population. The United Nations has a decisive role to play in this regard.\n103.\tThe Portuguese should learn from their allies of 600 years, the British, who once held sway over a global empire over which the sun was supposed never to set. The winds of change swept away that myth and Britain realistically granted independence to almost all its colonies and Territories. Today the representatives of the liberated countries sit with Britain in the councils of the United Nations. In cordiality, and without bitterness over the past, they even have a club called the \\\"Commonwealth\\\".\n104.\tPortugal should also learn from France, another imperial Power that was forced to grant independence to numerous colonies in Africa and elsewhere.\n105.\tPortugal, in this day and age, lives in the dead dreams of the yesteryear of Vasco da Gama, when it thought that its writ spread from Europe across Africa to the Far East. That is amply demonstrated by the fact that even today two members sit in the Portuguese legislature who are supposed to represent Goa. That is indeed the height of absurdity. The impoverished, impostor Government of Caetano should now realise that the boundaries of Portugal do not extend beyond Europe. Unless Portugal wakes up from this Rip van Winkle sleep, it is in for rude shocks.\n106.\tWe call upon the Church in Portugal and the enlightened opinion of the young and the intellectuals to join hands with us. Let us expose the fictitious nature and bankruptcy of the policies of the Portuguese regime which have spelled misery, bloodshed and ruin for millions of enslaved and helpless Africans.\n107.\tThe non-aligned countries which held a summit meeting last month in Algiers adopted a resolution which urged all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to expel or suspend Portugal from NATO unless it terminates its colonial wars in Africa, stops the massacre of Africans, withdraws its troops from African\nsoil and grants independence to its colonies [see A/9330 and Corr. 1, pp. 36-38]. The reasons for that move are very clear. NATO arms intended for Europe release weapons in Portuguese possession for prosecuting Portuguese colonial wars in Africa. Portuguese officers trained under NATO programmes are known to be transferred later to the African theatre of war. They are therefore used, not for the purpose originally intended, but for maintaining the colonialization of Africans. These arms are not used for the avowed aim of protecting the freedom and liberty of Europeans, but rather to promote the suppression of human rights, democracy and freedom in Africa.\n108.\tIn the face of Portuguese brutalities in Africa, no member of NATO can support the use of herbicides, defoliants and exceedingly potent chemical weapons for the mass destruction of people and crops. Many members of NATO themselves suffered from Hitlerite oppression which they eventually defeated through enormous sacrifices in life, limb and property. Our struggle against the alien regimes that are essentially Hitlerite in character and content is similar. Therefore, members of NATO should stand behind us in our legitimate struggle; for what is good for freedom- loving Europeans is equally good for the oppressed Africans. It is clear for them to see that Portugal is committed to a cause that is futile and a war it can never win. Let NATO members therefore play a rightful role in this shameful episode of Portuguese colonization of African Territories.\n109.\tKenya is gratified that progressive countries like Norway and Denmark are now openly questioning in the NATO Councils the wisdom of the Portuguese colonial war effort in Africa. Other countries, like Sweden, the Netherlands and those in the socialist camp, have stepped up their moral and material assistance to the liberation movements in Africa. To all these countries we express our deepest gratitude. To the others that do not yet support us, we address an appeal to emulate the worthy example of the countries sympathetic to our cause.\n110.\tWe also welcome the support that organizations like the World Council of Churches, the Anti-Apartheid Movement and many other private and public institutions are giving to the cause of freedom and independence in our continent of Africa.\n111.\tHere I should like directly to address France, a country which is associated with the noble sentiments of liberty,\nequality and fraternity of mankind. Has France forgotten or neglected these ideals, which contributed to its greatness? If not, it should come out in the open with a clean conscience and bring pressure to bear upon Portugal to terminate the massacre of the black people in Africa and to grant them their inalienable right to freedom and independence.\n112.\tI ask Britain, which is credited with democratic traditions, rule of law and humanitarianism, not to disown its time-honoured values. The United Kingdom should not be seen to be associating with countries like Portugal, which systematically practise genocide and slavery in Africa.\n113.\tThe great country of the United States, whose modern democracy was laid down by men like Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, should not disgrace the glorious principles which were laid down by these men. It should not be associating with a puny Power like Portugal, which has spread terror and rained death and destruction on our continent.\n114.\tAll these great and self-confessed Christian nations should not fold their hands and sit back oblivious to the decimation of the black people in Africa by the brutal and dehumanizing policies of Portugal. Kenya urges all of them to suspend or expel Portugal from membership in NATO unless it complies with the principles and purposes for which the Organization was established.\n115.\tThe Decolonization Mission of the Organization of African Unity [OA U], on which Kenya had the privilege of serving, highlighted the plight of subjugated Africa during its sojourn to numerous world capitals. World attention is now focused on the sufferings of Africans under colonial regimes. The United Nations-sponsored International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa, which was held earlier this year in Oslo, was indeed successful. More such conferences should be held throughout the world to keep this issue alive and under constant review by world leaders.\n116.\tThe Cabora Bassa hydroelectric project in the Tete province of Mozambique is conceived as a master-plan to settle millions of poor whites from Portugal so that they can enrich themselves through the toil, tears and sweat of the Africans. This will enable the whites to carry on indefinitely the oppression of the blacks and, through the exploitation of the vast mineral resources of this Territory, to fill the coffers of metropolitan treasuries in Europe.\n117.\tAlthough technically it would be a good project for a free, democratic Mozambique, at this juncture it is wrong to support it because it will strengthen Portuguese colonialism in Africa. It was for that reason that the OAU Decolonization Mission requested Western Governments, institutions, bankers and investors to desist from taking part in this project. We are grateful to the Governments which heeded our appeal; I must single out for special mention many Swedish and Italian firms which withdrew their participation from the Cabora Bassa project. We request those who did not do so to examine their conscience and help Africa's cause. We are merely asking for the postponement of their collaboration, not for their permanent exclusion from the project. When Mozambique attains independence, it can proceed to completion. At that time we shall appreciate it.\n118.\tKenya also urges the isolation of and a comprehensive boycott against Portugal. The Security Council should act decisively to repel threats to international peace and security posed by Portuguese colonialism in Africa. An arms embargo against Portugal is called for. Brutalities and excesses of the Portuguese troops in Africa should continue to be exposed in the hope that the outraged world conscience will be galvanized into effective action against the colonialists in Africa. Concrete and meaningful steps are necessary to break the growing alliance between Portugal, South Africa and Rhodesian whites.\n119.\tIn South Africa a most explosive and dangerous situation obtains. As if the massacre of Africans in 1960 at Sharpeville was not enough, the South Africans indiscriminately slaughtered workers at Carletonville last month when they were protesting against unjust employment conditions in South African mines. This demonstrates that the bloodthirsty minority regimes of southern Africa have an insatiable appetite for death and destruction of the Africans.\n120.\tSouth Africa has created certain \\\"Bantustans\\\" as homelands for the black people of South Africa. This is an entirely erroneous description because all the land in South Africa belongs to the Africans. We are told that the \\\"Bantustans\\\" are independent entities designed to ensure equal and separate development. But this is deception at its highest and arrant nonsense aimed at hoodwinking the world. In actual fact, the \\\"Bantustans\\\" are reservoirs of black majority population strategically located in arid regions on which the whites can swoop down at will and forcibly take away African labour to mines, factories, homes of the whites and other such places. They are festering sores of unemployment, discontent and squalor where no development in any form or shape has taken place. They are like cattle-pens from which the desired number of animals are taken for slaughter to make vast profits for sustaining the apparatus of apartheid.\n121.\tVorster hopes to control the \\\"Bantustans\\\" by creating divisions amongst them and the liberation movements. His designs are to play one against the other and to see blacks fight against black brethren while the whites prosper and look at black men killing black men.\n122.\tThe concept of \\\"Bantustans\\\" is the most pernicious evil conceived by the human mind. The world body must reject it outright.\n123.\tWith regard to Rhodesia, the Kenya Government recommends the convening of a round-table conference of all the interested parties to work out a constitutional arrangement for the granting of independence to the African majority under an equitable electoral system. The Africans, whose political destiny is at stake, must participate fully and freely in such negotiations. Those incarcerated in Smith's prisons ought to be released. Restrictions on African political movement and organization must be lifted. All discriminatory laws should be repealed in recognition of the right of the Africans to freedom and independence. South African military and police contingents have no business in Rhodesia. Those are fundamental conditions for an equitable and a lasting settlement to the Rhodesian problem.\n124.\tOn Namibia, we shall support fully all the efforts of the United Nations to maintain a physical foot-hold for the purpose of promoting African majority rule and independence. Eviction of illegal South African presence from that Territory is imperative. It is our feeling that direct negotiations with South Africa as to the future of Namibia have proved fruitless. They should therefore be discontinued and other concrete alternatives tried.\n125.\tI may be asked, quite legitimately, why the African countries have now seen fit to maintain a militant stance towards the colonial and minority racist regimes in Africa. Our answer is that all peaceful methods have been tried without success, and the patience of the oppressed peoples is mounting to a breaking-point.\n\n126.\tFree Africa's call, in the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa,  was rejected by Vorster. This was an appeal for a peaceful solution on the basis of freedom, equality and democratization of the rigid apartheid system within South Africa. The United Nations, the non-aligned world and OAU made several appeals for peaceful accommodation which were rejected outright by South Africa. Free Africa was ready to discuss ways and means of democratizing the internal situation in South Africa in a peaceful manner for the amelioration of the conditions of the black people.\n127.\tThis meant discussions on the system of apartheid and its eventual abolition. It, too, was of no avail. Vorster's reaction was to rain insults and aggression on free African countries to the north. The territorial integrity of Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire was violated by joint action of the South African, Rhodesian and Portuguese militarists. In the face of this intransigence, does Africa really have a choice other than that of an armed struggle?\n128.\tPermit me now to say a few words about our steadfast commitment to the non-aligned movement. We are convinced that this movement has been a dynamic force for promoting peace, justice and understanding in contemporary international affairs. It is a solid front against colonialism, racism, exploitation and inequality. It has a definite role to play for the economic and social welfare of the non-aligned States.\n129.\tI should also reiterate Kenya's unswerving support for OAU. It is our ultimate hope for the liberation and economic advancement of our continent of Africa. It is our instrument for forging continental African unity in every field. Under its banner, we shall continue to fight for intensification of inter-African trade, investments and cooperation at all levels, and for a united front in international organizations to achieve equality, justice and development in the whole continent in general.\n130.\tIn the larger sphere, Africa is determined unitedly to press for its relationship with the European Economic Community in accordance with the political and economic interests of our peoples. We shall not allow ourselves to be dictated to by the rich and powerful nations to suit their policies and objectives at our expense. Our resources and potentialities are plentiful and our scope for economic cooperation unlimited. Therefore, we need not entertain any feelings of despondency or helplessness in this regard.\n131.\tThat was our stand at the recent historic joint annual meeting of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund and its affiliates in Nairobi from 24 to 28 September this year. I call that conference historic because a meeting of this magnitude and size was held for the first time on African soil. The official opinion was that this huge conference was successfully organized. We are naturally gratified by this impartial evaluation. We can assure the international community that we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of future meetings in Nairobi. It is indicative of our belief that major conferences need not be confined to established centres, like New York, Geneva and Vienna and others in the Western world. Other capitals which can offer the necessary facilities should also be given the chance to play host to important meetings. This is a reflection of the universal nature of our Organization.\n132.\tIn that spirit Kenya is privileged to play host to the United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] in Nairobi. The Kenya Government has made available ample facilities for accommodation, communications and services for the successful establishment of UNEP, which was formally opened last week in Nairobi by His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, President of the Republic of Kenya.\n133.\tMay I take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the Kenya Government and people to all the countries that supported our offer of Nairobi, Kenya, as the site for UNEP.\n134. I wish to express our deepest sympathy to the victims of the Sudano-Sahelian famine which has now assumed catastrophic proportions in Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Upper Volta. The Kenya Government is currently considering on a basis of urgency what aid it can give to the victims of this unprecedented drought. They can rest assured of our support to the best of our capability. We urge the United Nations, OAU, and all other interested organizations to join hands in combating the consequences of this natural disaster. It is a grim reminder that the international community should set up a long-range, permanent arrangement to meet such catastrophes in the future in any region of the world.\n135.\tBefore I conclude, I deem it important to appeal to all countries to respect human rights without any reservations. Any change of government, or accession to power by any political party in any State should not be used as a licence to wipe out opponents or to unleash terror and bloodshed. Each national of every State, irrespective of colour, religion, sex or political persuasion, has a God- given right to life and protection under the due process of law. We cannot acquiesce in any political murder, massacre or repression in any part of the world. After all, shorn of all the technicalities and diplomatic jargon, this is the central message of our Charter and of the many conventions that have been adopted by the General Assembly.\n136.\tFinally, Kenya would like to see the United Nations remain in outlook and action a positive, active and dynamic force for justice, fair play and humanity. That must remain our guiding philosophy as the United Nations triumphantly marches from strength to strength in the face of many odds ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\t On behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras, I begin my statement by addressing to each of the representatives and those nations they worthily represent a cordial and fraternal greeting. Linked with it is our hope that true success and positive achievements will result from the deliberations of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n2.\tHonduras is deeply gratified that a Latin American possessing the competence and ability of Leopoldo Benites has been elected to preside over this world assembly. The great honour conferred on the sister Republic of Ecuador is shared by us, and we promise him the constant co-operation of the delegation of Honduras in his delicate tasks and the heavy duties entrusted to him by the Assembly. We are also glad to express our appreciation to all the representatives of the Governments of the world and in particular of the Latin American group of States for having elected Honduras to one of the vice-presidencies of the General Assembly. This again bespeaks our solidarity with the President of the Assembly in our fraternal commitment to the ideals of the Charter.\n3.\tThe formal work of the General Assembly began under the best of auspices. The simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, decided upon at our opening meeting, was an event whose true importance is to enrich and enhance the faith placed in the Organization by all its Members and to nurture the hope of those that are not yet Members that it will perpetuate and increase human welfare and development with universal representation.\n4.\tWe are also happy to greet warmly the admission of the independent State of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n5.\tMay we take this opportunity to stress our good will and our desire that other countries still absent from our midst be admitted soon, and our hope that we shall also very soon see here legitimate representatives of both Koreas, in keeping with their own decisions, as well as of Bangladesh, of the peoples that are fighting in a just struggle for self-determination and recognition as nations and of those that are living the tragedy of domestic division which stands in the way of their occupying the places that Honduras would like to see them occupy. Over and above any ideological differences, we should like to see them here defending their points of view and their ideas as to how we can make the world a better and safer place to live in.\n6.\tMy delegation congratulates the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, on the constant dedication and effectiveness with which he has devoted himself to carrying out the heavy responsibilities of his post, as clearly reflected in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1].\n7.\tWe are grateful that much progress has been made in the political field through the efforts of the Secretary- General and particularly in the search for peace in areas of conflict. We also take note of the significant progress achieved in the field of human welfare, where a balanced economic development of peoples is sought to serve as an adequate basis for world peace with justice.\n8.\tThe United Nations Development Programme has been a most effective instrument of co-operation in our development and planning. Honduras has achieved much thanks to its help, and we place our faith in the future of its action to the benefit of our people. \n9.\tWe owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the developed countries which, having become great economic Powers, generously contribute to speeding up the basic programmes that have a bearing on the domestic development of our countries. Our appreciation is all the greater for those countries which, despite their own domestic needs, sacrifice part of their capital to help the peoples which are fighting for their own development. However, we believe that more effective work could be done if the assistance given to achieve the targets were more significant.\n10.\tWe in the developing countries depend to a large extent on international co-operation. Yet, our own administration is struggling hard, through effort and sacrifice, to ensure that this circumstance is only temporary.\n11.\tIt is no less true that we, the developing countries, are markets that consume large amounts of the industrial output of the developed countries, and at the same time we offer our natural resources as our contribution to their high standard of living.\n12.\tAcceptance of this interdependence, both on the part of the wealthy and on the part of the needy countries, can lead to a just and reasonable understanding that should govern our efforts to achieve an equality that will culminate in the full development of mankind.\n13.\tAs far as my nation is concerned, our permanent and dedicated aspiration is to live in peace. We have placed our faith in the constant rule of law and in the action of the international organs of which we are members, primarily the United Nations. And we have done so in the hope that deliberations at the conference tables will increasingly replace confrontations on the battlefield.\n14.\tHowever, we should recall that in many cases and places the pacifying action of the United Nations, which\nis the basic mission of the institution, is limited by factors ranging from the lack of legal instruments of action in the hands of the Organization to simple stubbornness of the parties.\n15.\tBecause of these problems, we believe it extremely important to seek the means whereby to strengthen the Organization, to give it more material possibilities of ensuring implementation of its resolutions, to adapt it to the reality of a changing world so that it will continue to be, as it has thus far been, the main beacon of hope of mankind. We believe that this calls imperatively for a revision of the Charter. We understand that such a revision cannot be removed from the realities of the world, and the great Powers should keep their privileges, their actions being so important for mankind in the preservation of peace. However, it is not possible for the Organization to be effective, as we would wish it, unless it is endowed with the powers and instruments to ensure respect for and compliance with its resolutions. We believe this capacity to be extremely important when resolutions are decided by an almost unanimous vote and seek only to ensure the implementation of the principles of the Charter, to which we have all freely subscribed as a norm governing our international conduct, and which at times are hindered by the unilateral decision of a country which breaks its promises. For those reasons, Honduras would support any initiative tending to strengthen the capacity of action of the Organization through a revision of the Charter or through any other adequate machinery.\n16.\tMay I inform this Assembly of our views regarding the matter which is uppermost in the minds of our people and Government at this historic moment. I refer to the dispute that since 1969 has existed between Honduras and El Salvador. My delegation is extremely gratified to be able to say that the record of the session held by the Special Commission of the Thirteenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Latin America, on 20 and 21 August, contained an agreement concerning the procedure for the conclusion of a general peace, friendship and boundary treaty which, taking into account the seven specific resolutions adopted by the Organ of Consultation of the Organization of American States [OAS], will put an end to all disputes between the two countries.\n17.\tMy delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the enlightened Government of Mexico and to our sister Republics of Central America for the continued and devoted attention they have given this problem and for their permanent collaboration in the search for adequate solutions.\n18.\tMy delegation reiterates its faith that the negotiations at present taking place in Mexico City will, through the channels of law and justice, be successful and thus return the Central American area to normalcy.\n19.\tFrom the very beginning of our independent life, our laws have recognized the equality of men irrespective of differences in race, colour or religion. Hence, Honduras offers its support and co-operation to all those who endeavour to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, particularly those who are dedicated to the eradication of the vile system of apartheid.\n20.\tFrom the beginning of our independent life, Honduras has also been found among the leaders in the anti-colonialist struggle. It therefore offers its co-operation and support to those peoples which are struggling for their right to govern themselves and to shake off the colonial yoke.\n21.\tMy delegation would like very specially to refer to the problem of Gibraltar, a British colony, located on Spanish soil, over which Spain's full sovereignty must be recognized. Honduras entirely shares the arguments adduced by the Minister for External Affairs of Spain, don Laureano Lopez Rodo, when he spoke to this Assembly on the subject [2133rdmeeting], and we declare our readiness to co-operate in restoring Gibraltar fully to Spanish sovereignty and authority.\n22.\tOf the subjects on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, there are a number which, because of their special importance and the significance which Honduras attaches to them, we feel impelled to mention specifically and make known our views upon them.\n23.\tMankind is confronted by the fear of extinction if the political forces were, with the instruments of mass destruction available to them, to unleash a new worldwide conflagration. But to this fear is added the fact that we are all victims of the harmful effects of nuclear weapons tests. Therefore, we must add our voice to those of the many countries which have urged the nuclear Powers to find bilateral or multinational understandings likely to end this threat once and for all. With its voice and vote, Honduras will support any initiative to that end. For similar reasons, we shall do likewise with regard to all those initiatives designed to do away with inhuman chemical and bacteriological weapons or to achieve a treaty on general and complete disarmament.\n24.\tAs so often before, the General Assembly will continue its examination of the many and complex aspects of the conflict in the Middle East, particularly at this moment when it has become even more acute because of the fresh resort to the use of weapons against man in that region. We believe that this delicate question calls for a clear statement from us to the effect that we are friends of Israel and friends of the Arab countries and that nothing would please us better than to be able to contribute to putting an end to the prolonged conflict. We believe that it is indispensable to strengthen with new instruments the Secretariat so that it can continue its peace-making efforts, and we would be extremely happy if the Security Council itself would hand down an authentic interpretation of the conflicting provisions of its resolution 242 (1967) and thus give new means of action to the Jarring mission.\n25.\tWe must clearly and simply state that the policies of Honduras in these matters, both inside and outside the Central American area, are based on principles that we consider inalienable and that we believe should be stressed. Honduras cannot agree to, nor will it ever accept, the acquisition of territory by force or threat. Honduras considers that the dignity of the human person must always be respected, even in cases of belligerency or war. Honduras considers that it is the right of all nations to live in peace, within secure and legally determined borders which accurately mark the limits of it national sovereignty.\n26.\tIn this connexion I think I ought to recall that, at the present stage of history, security does not come from mere tactical positions; it might have done so when conventional war defined frontiers, but not when it is the law that must prevail. The security of a frontier, we believe, can flow only from a juridical determination of it and the obligation that all parties respect the existence of such borders.\n27.\tWith regard to international terrorism, the entire world is expecting some concrete results from our deliberations. We noted with regret how little was done during the twenty-seventh session on this matter, despite the very obvious concern shown by world public opinion. We understand that it is difficult to reach agreement since there are complex factors hindering a general understanding. To the assessments and definitions of the political terrorism of individuals a counterpart is sought in assessments of the actions of States. But we believe that, while that procedure of analysis is resorted to, little progress can be made. But there are specific aspects on which the views of all Governments are almost unanimous. Cases such as the hijacking of planes, diplomatic security, the unlawful use of the mail and other examples could be tackled outside the context of the general problem and could be the subject of agreement and even lead to treaties that would be a true achievement and a definitive step towards satisfying world aspirations for something to be done by this Organization on these problems that affect us all. The delegation of Honduras would co-operate in the taking of such steps by the Assembly.\n28.\tFinally, my delegation expresses the hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly during the twenty- eighth session, which has begun so successfully under your wise guidance, will, in this delicate historical moment for humanity, lead to concrete steps and resolutions that will stress the lofty principles and postulates of international ethics contained in the Charter, thus giving mankind renewed hopes that man, imbued with the spirit of coexistence and understanding that must always prevail in this hall, will through constant international effort, succeed in making the world a more just and worthy place in which to live."

        "file_text": "\ufeff 1. First of all, may I, on my own behalf and that of my delegation, extend our felicitations to our President on his unanimous election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Undoubtedly, it was his deep knowledge of the ways of nations and his wide experience of procedures derived from his close association with our Organization that commended his election to his high office.\n2.\tI would also like to join other speakers in paying a tribute to his predecessor, the distinguished Deputy Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of Poland, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, for the skill, and understanding with which he directed this Assembly.\n3.\tA frequent but very pleasant task is the welcoming of new Members. It is a salutary reminder that prognostications about the growing irrelevancy of the United Nations are not all that widely shared and that, for all its many shortcomings, most nations believe that international relations would be fraught with even graver perils without it.\n4.\tThis year we have admitted three new Members. The first, the Bahamas, enters our ranks by virtue of having gained its independence, and I would like to congratulate the Bahamas and its people on their new status.\n5.\tThe admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic marks the happy resolution of what had for over two decades been a delicate and intractable European problem. For the first time in centuries peace is now more assured than ever before at any time in Europe's strife-torn history. Conflicts and profound disagreements there certainly will be, but their resolution by recourse to arms is a fear that appears to have receded into the realm of the implausible. For all practical purposes\n Europeans believe they have at last outlawed war among themselves.\n6.\tI wish I could be assured of as happy a prospect for the third world. The killing, the dying and the destruction have yet to come to an end in the less-developed world as they have in Europe. Since 1945 much of the third world has been plagued by violent conflicts. It has been estimated that 95 per cent of the major and minor wars since 1945 have been in the under-developed countries. They have ranged from anti-colonial wars and wars of intervention to insurgencies, civil wars, wars of liberation and disputes between third-world countries. These, far from diminishing, have tended to increase during the past decade and have been and are being fought largely with increasingly expensive weapons supplied by, or bought from, the developed world.\n7.\tSome of the crucial items on our agenda, which' have repeatedly come before us, year after year, relate to disputes involving violence in the third world. The most serious of these is the Arab-Israeli conflict. The detente between the big Powers, though it has enhanced immeasurably the prospects of global peace and eased cold-war pressures on weaker nations, has however not in any way enhanced hopes for peace in the Middle East.\n8.\tI have on previous occasions reiterated my Government's position on the Middle East conflict. I do so again, but with a growing feeling that reiteration of one's position will not materially affect the steadfast positions of the parties directly involved in the conflict. Since the detente of the big Powers precludes the Arab-Israeli dispute from ever becoming, or being allowed to become, a casus belli between the great Powers, they are not under the same pressure as they were in years past to take any major initiative in regard to this protracted conflict.\n9.\tThe initiative must therefore come, as it has in the case of the two German Republics, in the case of Viet-Nam and in the case of big-Power conflicts and rivalries, primarily from the parties to the conflict. What these new Middle East initiatives should be only the parties concerned can determine, and all that we, conscious of our limitations, can do is to ensure by our demeanour that we do not exacerbate this protracted and tragic conflict.\n10.\tHowever, before such initiatives can be seriously taken, two barriers need to be cleared. The first is psychological. As long as the parties to the conflict believe. - that war and not negotiations will ultimately resolve their problem, peace will remain as elusive as ever. The second relates to basic principles. Before there can be any serious negotiation there must be a clear assurance that settlement would be in accordance with principles basic to our\n \n\nOrganization. The territorial integrity of the States concerned and their security cannot be qualified as the price of a settlement. Any negotiations postulated on the basis of victors and defeated is doomed to failure.\n11.\tIn the case of South Africa, Namibia, Rhodesia and Portuguese possessions in Africa, the other unresolved items on our agenda, the white minorities have yet to be convinced that the alternative to coming to terms with the dispossessed black peoples is eventually a Viet-Cong type of involution. Until that alternative becomes credible, persuasion and resolutions by this Assembly, though they may make the transgressor cautious, will not convince the dominant white minority that accommodation of the aspirations of the black peoples is the only rational solution.\n12.\tThose, then, are some of the perennial issues plaguing the third world, issues which accord between the great Powers has, for the most part, left unresolved and is unlikely to solve. While we welcome the accord as a positive contribution to world peace and a rational ordering of international life, we should not forget that it is what it says it is-merely a detente between the big Powers to ensure that their conflicts do not escalate into mutually annihilating confrontations, and that their global interests and the delicate balancing of forces are not upset by the problems and disputes of smaller nations. That beady-eyed approach is a necessary corrective to the euphoria that the big-Power accord appears to have generated in some of us. The accord is not concerned, except perhaps incidentally, with sorting out the difficulties and problems of small nations.\n13.\tTrue, the accord decreases the cold-war pressures to which many small nations were subjected during the past two decades, pressures which they unwillingly succumbed to or which they evaded by necessary, though not always commendable, deviousness. In that sense the accord gives the third world countries a respite from cold war pressures and greater freedom to find their own remedies for their accumulating problems.\n14.\tOur problems, namely the problems of the third world, are multiplying to near unmanageable proportions and many of them overshadow in importance and significance many other problems that have occasioned as much inspired rhetoric in the past. Today, for example, the spectre of famine haunts many parts of the third world. The rising hopes that the \\\"green revolution\\\" would assuage hunger in the developing world appear to be receding. Something like half of the world's population today is said to be hungry at a time when possibly another billion will join the human race during the next 10 years. Most of the increase in population and hunger is in the third world and it is there too that population increase, made possible through economic, social and health improvements, has also multiplied the sum of human misery. Despite creditable growth rates, unemployment is many steps ahead of economic growth-as much as 20 per cent in many countries. Despite an impressive performance in the spread of literacy, there are today 100 million more illiterates in the third world than there were 20 years ago. The third world's rural crisis is aggravated by a spreading urban crisis. The advanced countries, too, have their urban crisis but it is\nof a different order from that confronting third world cities. The third world cities are becoming refugee camps for the rural poor whom the land can no longer sustain and for ambitious rural youths who bitterly discover, too late, that cities provide only limited opportunities for people with general rural skills. The cities demand specialized urban skills and those that lack these skills turn to crime and violence as possible alternatives. The third world cities are what might be called accidental cities. They have size without a corresponding economic function. Politically and socially the cities of the third world are political time- bombs.\n15.\tAll these problems derive principally from uncontrolled population growth which, paradoxically, is aggravated by unplanned but progressive social and economic measures, by increased food supply, and by modernization of institutions without modernization of minds. In a free contest the dismal fact is that population can always outstrip economic growth and so, unless the third world drastically restrains population growth, economic growth and humanitarian measures could well result not in greater happiness but in increasing misery.\n16.\tThe reprieve we have from cold-war pressures could give us an opportunity to consider more single-mindedly than we have in the past those fundamental problems without the resolution of which all other problems remain intractable. Admittedly there is less drama involved in considerations of economic and population problems. Such problems do not lend themselves readily to mind-arresting rhetoric, but for the hungry billions today speculating where their next meal is to come from, and for the other billion waiting in the wings to greet the thirty-eighth session of this Assembly, our rhetoric may be no more than food for despair and fuel for sweeping anger.\n17.\tBut the fact remains that our population is increasing catastrophically and that could be the genesis for a new cold war as intense and possibly more dangerous than the ideological cold war which we have tried to cope with in the past three decades and which we have now left behind us. The increase in population and the insatiable needs of developed countries have raised the spectre of near exhaustion of natural resources. There is a wringing of hands over the so-called energy crisis, over a water crisis, and over possible shortages of meat, fish and grain and of a number of strategic raw materials. It is, of course, open to dispute whether we have already reached or will reach such a crisis.\n It is sufficient that many nations believe that with rising populations they are entering an era of scarce natural resources, and so long as that belief persists it will be real and that will affect their political behaviour.\n18.\tSince the conquest of other peoples' land to acquire and control resources, as in the past, is no longer practical or, in the long run, economical, the sea, covering more than 70 per cent of the earth's surface, is increasingly seen as the new El Dorado. Some claim that there is more wealth in the sea than on the land. This, though unsubstantiated by facts, is indicative of the sort of fever the scramble for the wealth of the sea could generate. Today, mankind gets from the sea about 25 per cent of its protein, about 17 to 19 per cent of its oil and 6 per cent of its gas. Though minerals now extracted from the sea-bed account for only 2 per cent\nof the ore produced on land, there are mind-spinning estimates of many trillions of tons of ooze and nodules containing manganese, iron, copper and nickel.\n19.\tUndoubtedly the sea may be tomorrow's economic frontier and a possible source for as many bloody conflicts as the carve-up of the earth's surface has generated throughout mankind's history. Hitherto, the ocean has for the most part remained no-man's-land, and therefore all-men's land, simply because mankind had not the means effectively to seize and occupy the sea. Today, many nations have the means, or think they have the means.\n20.\tSo it is this contention that mankind, whose ancestors abandoned the sea millions and millions of years ago, is turning towards the sea again, possibly to reproduce all the foolishness and madness entailed in the carving up of the land. Not many people are aware that the first skirmishes have already begun in the battle for the sea. Gunboats have steamed off the shores of Asia, Africa and the Americas to assert or contest claims of possession. Far more serious disputes have occurred off the Icelandic coasts. There are also disputes pertaining to over-fishing and the possible annihilation of certain species of marine life-in particular, whales. The International Court of Justice was recently called upon to adjudicate on France's right to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific. Pollution of the sea by shipping, the discharge of industrial waste and the burial of nuclear waste-in fact, the growing tendency to treat the sea as humanity's garbage can-are potential sources of conflict.\n21.\tThese are in addition to the importance traditionally attached to the sea for communication, trade and war. The trade routes that link nations are still primarily sea routes. Marine transportation accounts for 78 per cent of the physical volume of foreign trade freight and 68 per cent of freight in terms of cost. Sea transport is still the cheapest form of transport and is likely to remain so with the development of super-tankers and containerization.\n22.\tIt is also noticeable that in recent years the great Powers are once again emphasizing sea-power as a more effective way of manifesting strength and exercising influence in times of peace. Since the sea is for the most part unencumbered by national frontiers, this is one arm of power which can circumscribe the globe in relative freedom. This includes nuclear-powered submarines, equipped with long-range multiple-warhead missiles and fortified by silos and military installations buried in the sea-bed and directed by sensitive electronic devices.\n23.\tSo I believe we have already entered the era of ocean politics and ocean economics. The stakes are enormous, and the conflicts arising from ocean politics may be the more important issues that in future will harass the United Nations. The law in regard to the sea has not developed beyond the vague simplicity of the decalogue. There is practically no law for exploration and exploitation of its resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The law in regard to the extent of such national jurisdiction is founded on nothing more convincing than arbitrary proclamations and new papal bulls.\n24.\tAt the same time it is recognized that the simple concept of the freedom of the seas as enunciated by eminent jurists and scholars in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, like that of Hugo Grotius, requires reinterpretation and elaboration in the light of present-day reality.\n25.\tOcean politics and economics are essentially new manifestations of power which we have to learn to cope with. They are untrodden territory, where paths can lead to dead ends and dangerous precipices as well as to reassuring pastures and woodlands. There is a Chinese saying that every journey begins with the first step and that the first step determines the destination. So if the first step we take at the forthcoming Third United Nations conference on the Law of the Sea, scheduled to start this year, thrusts us into the jungles of sterile contention and even open conflicts, then, as with the dividing up of the land, the carving up of the seas may well be history written in blood. If the trendy thing is for each coastal State to grab what it can on the basis of the principle of \\\"finders, keepers\\\", then the sea must eventually become the possession of a handful of rich and powerful nations having the technological capabilities and the requisite armoury successfully to assert the dismal proposition that \\\"might is right\\\".\n26.\tThe other approach is to treat the oceans as the common property of mankind-of coastal States and land-locked States, of poor nations and rich nations and of the most developed and the least developed. I realize that the translation of this same ideal \u2014 in the long run, a practical ideal \u2014 into detailed policies tailored to suit the different and special interests of so many nations will not be all that simple. But it will be in the real and long-term interests of smaller and weaker nations not to lose sight of the fact that if the wealth of the sea is not made available fairly to all, then in the nature of things it must go unfairly to the few who are rich, strong and technologically equipped to enclose the seas as private property or to those who claim special rights and privileges over the riches of the oceans merely through the accident of geographical location. The rational approach to the problems of the sea is not without risks and difficulties, but they are far easier to cope with than those arising in a free-for-all scramble to carve up the seas.\n\n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff52.\t Mr. President, those of us who know you well take a special pride in your elevation to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session. The people of Ecuador share the honour which your personal qualities have justly earned.\n53.\tThe international climate is charged with confidence and hope. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to bean organic part of our generation's life are now giving way to patient dialogue. The Viet-Nam cease-fire, the American-Chinese encounter, the summit meetings at Moscow and Washington, the German agreements and the European treaties have been succeeded by a cease-fire in Laos, by talks between North and South Korea, and by contacts between the three States of the Indian subcontinent. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is at work, bringing a tragic era of confrontation to its end.\n54.\tLet us leave the historians to define the precise point at which the international journey took a new direction \u2014 and the causes which inspired the change. In the meantime the results are tangible and impressive, although not yet universal. In some discussions \u2014 but not in all \u2014 the old vocabularies of abuse are being softened by a welcome air of civility. It is generally understood that coexistence must be based on a separation between viewpoints and relationships. Even when Governments differ in their ideas, their viewpoints and their policies, in their social structures and in their international orientations, they can, nevertheless, foster good relations even across the gulf of their divergences. It was the cold-war philosophy that insisted on ideological agreement or political harmony as the condition of good relations between States. The detente accepts and admits no such condition. It respects and transcends diversities of interest and outlook. Indeed, the logical conclusion of the detente is the universality of international relations. Fidelity to detente requires all States to cultivate normal relations with each other, irrespective of differences and even of conflicts in their interests or policies. At a time when States which have real conflicts of ideology, policy and interest are establishing relations with each other, it would be a grotesque paradox if States which have never had any reason to quarrel about anything were induced to weaken or to sunder their mutual ties.\n55.\tBut we shall not do service to the spirit of detente if we carry our satisfaction beyond the point of reason and truth. Free dialogue and compromise have prevailed in many disputes, but they are still rejected in others, and the victories of international conciliation in the past few years have all been won outside the United Nations structure. This indicates that the growth of world community is painfully slow, Indeed, our Secretary-General, with admirable realism, has found it necessary, in the introduction to his annual\nreport o n the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1], to warn us of some of the shortcomings in the work of the United Nations so far. The truth is that, while quiet, bilateral diplomacy has recorded many triumphs, strident, polemical, public debate has not brought any good result on any issue at any time. The lesson is plain. The central role of this Organization should be to promote agreements between parties to a conflict irrespective of their voting strength, and not to try to adjudicate between conflicting views on the mere basis of numerical weight. The United Nations, in short, should have a diplomatic and not a parliamentary vocation. This point was stated with great precision by the Foreign Minister of Canada. I quote his words:\n\\\"... we must try to avoid barren and abrasive confrontations, which are frequently the result of formal voting processes. Consensus is another and often surer route \u2014  Consensus does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on a reluctant minority which feels its vital interests are at issue; it means the shared recognition of what should and can be done.\\\" [2126th meeting, para. 60.1\n56.\tNow here, in a few words, is a basic evaluation of what may be wrong with United Nations techniques. The result is not only that successes have come outside these walls; failures have abounded within them. The discussions on international terrorism by our Ad Hoc Committee ended in fiasco, as had the debate in the General Assembly after the Munich outrage last year. In Rome the International Civil Aviation Organization sat for many weeks without being allowed to agree on any amendments to the Hague or Montreal Conventions. All Members of the United Nations are united in their ability to discuss each other's imperfections. There are majorities to be had for selective political judgements against those who do not belong to a large voting bloc. But majorities cannot always be found for objective, temperate statements free of denunciation and invective.\n57.\tThe Secretary-General's introduction to the annual report reminds us that the efforts of the United Nations in political conciliation are, in his words, \\\"complementary\\\" to \\\"the normal bilateral dealings of Governments\\\" [A/9001/ Add. 1, p. 5]. That is true. I also think that it is true that an attempt by all the Arab Governments to escape from the duty of engaging in \\\"the normal bilateral dealings of Governments\\\" to a constant reliance on public debate is one of the sources of the continuing deadlock in the Middle East. Indeed, every procedure and attitude that has proved its efficacy in other disputes has so far been ignored or rejected in our region.\n58.\tWould we not do well then to listen to the counsel of two statesmen whose names are pre-eminent in the history of the recent detente. Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany has told this Assembly that\n\\\".. . it is primarily direct peace talks between the Arab countries concerned and Israel that will best secure a balance of the elementary interests of both sides.\\\" [2128th meeting, para. 63.]\nAnd Mr, Kissinger, Secretary of State of the United States, has reminded us that not even the strongest of great Powers can \\\"substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved\\\" [2124th meeting, para. 56],\n59.\tThe absence of negotiation in the Middle East is the gravest obstacle to the termination of regional tension. But it is not the parent cause of the tension. The root of the conflict lies deeper; the root of the conflict lies in the refusal of Arab Governments to come to terms with Israel as a sovereign nation rising from the depths of Middle Eastern history to resume its place in the universal community. Not one of the Arab Governments whose representatives have spoken from this rostrum about withdrawal from territories held since 1967 has said that in order to achieve their territorial claims the Arab States would recognize Israel's rightful place amongst the free nations of the area and establish permanent peace, friendship, commerce and normal relations with Israel similar, for example, to the relations which exist between the States of Western Europe, which only a short time ago were locked in hostility and war. Many Arab spokesmen say the opposite. The Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. El Zayyat, has stated in the Security Council and elsewhere that beyond the 1967 armistice lines lie the frontiers proposed in a United Nations recommendation of 1947 [resolution 181 (II)], which Egypt and other Arab Governments destroyed, as they had promised, \\\"by blood and fire\\\", and these in his learned view are the only legal frontiers. Nor would this be the end of Israel's dismantlement. An article in the official Cairo newspaper Al Gum-huriya only several days ago tells us that\n\\\"The withdrawal of Israel from all the conquered Arab territories is an initial demand of the Arab States presented as a part of the comprehensive programme aimed at putting an end to the Zionist settlement in Palestine.\\\"\n60.\tFrom such statements it is not hard to deduce the meaning of the phrase about the \\\"legitimate aspirations of the Palestine Arab people\\\" when employed by those in whose eyes the sole representatives of that people are the organizations which carry out murder and banditry all over the world but usually at a discreet distance from the Middle East,\n61.\tThe plain fact is that the present Arab leadership is not satisfied with the verdict of history which has led to the constitution of 18 Arab States in an area of II million square kilometres with a population of 100 million. Arab leadership seems to be in an excited imperialist mood. It demands the elimination of Israel, a non-Arab nation, older in its roots within the Middle East than any other, more venerable than any other in the lineage of spirit and tongue that ties it to that soil, unexampled in the persistence of its national identity.\n62.\tIsrael is the very heart and core of Middle Eastern history; but Israel is a Jewish and not an Arab entity. Therefore, there are Arab leaders who cannot sustain its sovereign presence: it must be either physically eliminated or swallowed up in something else so that its \\\"Israel hood\\\" would vanish under some Arab combination or domination. In its philosophy national freedom in the Middle East is an exclusive Arab right \u2014 to be monopolized, and not to be shared. There are other expressions of this hegemonistic and exclusive spirit \u2014  in Arab policy in the Persian Gulf and in the posturing of Colonel Qaddafi as he flaunts his opulent purse across the world. But it is in the Israeli context that the tendency to see sovereignty in the Middle East as an Arab monopoly has had its most ominous effects.\n63.\tNow, what I have said is admittedly a stringent view of what Arab Governments seek to achieve. But unfortunately it is sustained by a great array of official statements. It is confirmed by the implacable warfare to which Israel, alone amongst all the States of the world, has been subjected since its birth. It is nourished by outrages such as the shooting in the head of the 11 Israeli athletes, tied hand and foot, on the floor of a helicopter in Munich one year ago. Such acts are possible only if the victims are regarded by the assassins as lying outside and beyond any human context. And, indeed, the Arab hostility towards Israel today joins hands with another and deadlier hatred to which it is akin. For where else, Members of the United Nations, other than in Cairo, can you imagine the publication by writers close to the seat of power of an article which I hold in my hand and from which I read the concluding extract:\n\\\"In the whole world people have ended by understanding that Hitler was right, for the Jews are vampires which suck the blood of humanity. They wish to destroy the world, but the world vomits them. They have been chased from land to land; they were burned in the ovens of Hitler \u2014 1 million, 2 million, 6 million. Would that he had accomplished it fully!\\\"\nThat is what Al Akhbar wrote on 19 August this year.\n64.\t\\\"Would that [Hitler] had accomplished it fully!\\\" This particular extract is only one example of hundreds of Nazi publications that have made Cairo a world centre of anti-Semitic ideology. As we listen to these obscenities on Cairo Radio, as we bury our dead after Munich or Lod, as we recall wars, assaults, boycotts and threats over these 25 years, as we read of the Covenant of the so-called \\\"Palestine Liberation Organization\\\", which asserts that only Arabs have sovereign rights in the Middle East, can we be reproached if we see ourselves as the target of a particularly virulent hatred, at variance with all humane values and vastly removed from anything that can be called detente?\n65.\tIn short, one of the components of Israel's policy \u2014  and I say this in great frankness \u2014  is a profound scepticism about the basic intention of Arab States to respect Israel's sovereignty, its national identity, its cultural legacy, its place in the Middle East and the world. There is one thing, and one thing alone, that could undermine that scepticism: negotiation.\n66.\tFor recent international experience teaches us that negotiation is not simply a procedural method: it is a principle of coexistence. Negotiation does not merely photograph established positions; it leads them towards mutual accommodation. It puts hopes and suspicions to their only viable test. At the negotiating table the discourse between the parties ceases to be rhetorical, abrasive and polemical. It becomes pragmatic, concrete, empirical. A unique kind of solidarity asserts itself between the negotiators, who become subject to the mystique of potential success and put forth their maximal effort to avoid a final break. Precisely because negotiation has such far-reaching effects, the Arab refusal to negotiate without prior conditions arouses far-reaching suspicions.\n67.\tWe have long been convinced of the need to undertake a detailed negotiation ranging freely across all the problems at issue. If this aim has not been fulfilled, we share the\nuniversal regret \u2014 but we disclaim culpability. We have accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which calls for the establishment of permanent peace by agreement between Member States in the Middle East, including withdrawal of forces from territories occupied since 1967 to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the peace agreement. We proposed detailed agendas for discussion with Egypt and Jordan, We accepted Ambassador Jarring's proposal, rejected by Egypt in March 1968, for convening Israeli and Egyptian representatives in conferences under his auspices to discuss a peace settlement. When four eminent Heads of African States visited our region in 1971, they submitted six proposals in writing, to which my Prime Minister made written and appropriate response on 28 November 1971.5 The African Presidents reported that this reply, together with that of Egypt, constituted a sufficient basis to justify negotiation. We stand by those replies today. In particular, we responded to the suggestion of the African Presidents which reads as follows:\n\\\"Acceptance by the two parties that 'secure and recognized boundaries' be determined in the peace agreement\\\".\n68.\tIn 1971, when it was pointed out that direct contact might not yet be easily acceptable to Arab Governments, we agreed to the United States procedure for proximity talks. When it was then suggested that it might be difficult to conceive a sudden transition from total deadlock to total peace, we accepted the idea of a Suez agreement involving the opening of the Canal under Egyptian administration, with a limited, agreed withdrawal of Israeli forces, even ahead of a peace settlement. We stipulated that this would not be the final withdrawal, but a phase leading to further negotiations in which the permanent and final line would be agreed upon between the parties.\n69.\tThroughout all this period we abstained \u2014 as we still do \u2014 from changing the political and juridical status of the administered territories, and have not closed any options for a negotiated peace. We opened the river crossings and cease-fire lines to a free movement of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from areas outside Israeli jurisdiction \u2014 and indeed from all over the Arab world. We placed the Holy Places of Christendom and Islam under the administration of Christian and Moslem authorities and proposed that this principle be given appropriate statutory expression in a peace agreement. In October 1972 I suggested a meeting with Foreign Minister Riad in New York \\\"in order to break out of old deadlocks into a new vision and a new hope\\\". We utilized the good offices of foreign statesmen and other visitors to convey to Cairo and other Middle Eastern capitals our proposals for contact and dialogue in any form and at any level agreeable to the other side. We welcomed the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his visit to Member States in the Middle East, and appreciated his testimony to the will for peace that, in his words, he found in his contacts with the Government of Israel.\n70.\tThat is not an exhaustive list of all the soundings and gestures that we have made in an effort to generate a process of negotiation. Nor have we decided to despair of the\nprospect. But can anyone seriously believe that all these initiatives, all these responses \u2014 none of which was put in ultimative form \u2014 offered no opening whatever through which Arab Governments genuinely desiring peace could seek or accept a dialogue with us?\n71. The Arab reactions to these and other initiatives have always included refusals to negotiate; or refusals to acknowledge Israel's statehood at all; or an insistence that Arab positions be accepted in advance by Israel as a condition of negotiation; or a demand that the situation which preceded and in large measure provoked the war of 1967 be meticulously restored.\n72.\tNow, there is one important thing to be noted about those positions. If all or any of them had been adopted by Governments in America, Europe and East Asia in the past few years, there would be no agreements for the General Assembly to welcome and no detente for anybody anywhere lo celebrate.\n73.\tI turn from the past to the future. It is natural for the Israeli Government to use this opportunity of making a precise definition of the principles which move its policy. That policy is frequently and grossly misrepresented, especially at conferences from which we are excluded while our adversaries command the scene. Our policy is to seek peace and security. If the Israeli mind is intensely preoccupied with the problem of security, it is because of the particular memories that converge upon us. On one level of recollection we come face to face with a recent experience that no other family of the human race has ever undergone. The fires are out in the gas chambers, and the ashes are silent in European fields. But the memory of our 6 million kinsmen, brutally wiped off the slate of life, and the terrible agony of the million Jewish children butchered in the year of martyrdom abide with us, vivid, stark, unforgotten. And on the other level of memory there is the experience of 25 years in which our nation's progress has been secured only at a heavy price of suffering and death,\n74.\tA people that has undergone such affliction and borne such loss is bound by historic duty lo insist on a very precise craftsmanship in the construction of peace. It will not do simply to reproduce the vulnerable and explosive situation which threatened world peace six years ago. Israel's statehood, its Jewish vocation, its name and flag and tongue are a part of the international reality now and for all time. They are axiomatic, and it is our business to maintain them in growing security.\n75.\tWe are asked whether we seek peace. The answer is, Yes, that is our central aim, the destination of all our policies and hopes. Peace does not only involve a documentary acknowledgement of rights. It signifies the permanent end of conflict, and the proof of its authenticity must be sought in human terms. Peace means open frontiers across which peoples can seek commerce and contact with each other in mutual accessibility and thus give depth and meaning to formal governmental engagements.\n76.\tShould we not look hard and long at the European example? The aim should be a community of sovereign States in the Middle East, as in Benelux and the European communities. With our eastern neighbour, once the boundary is determined, we should seek a system of relations based on separate sovereignties but with a high measure of social and economic integration. The remarkable ease and cordiality of access between Israelis and the mass of Palestinian Arabs today should be preserved and consolidated in a peace settlement. The squalid conspiracies of Arafat and Habash, with their grenades, daggers, bombs and guns, do not represent the views or interests of the million non-Israeli Arabs west of the Jordan living in peaceful interaction with Israelis today. That is why terrorist violence has no expression there.\n77.\tWe are asked if we accept negotiation. The answer is, Yes, by any procedure mutually agreed upon. The negotiation is between the sovereign States of the area. We must be concerned to insulate our region from the rivalries and competitions of the Powers. The Middle East, after generations of servitude, is now free. It should not seek new. hegemonies and new servitudes at the expense of its newly won independence.\n78.\tWhat about Security Council resolution 242 (1967)? The answer is, Yes, we accept it as the basis for negotiation with Egypt and Jordan, and our memorandum of 4 August 1970 remains in force. It is vital to understand what the resolution says and what it does not say. The resolution rules out withdrawal except in the context of a \\\"just and lasting peace\\\". It does not require any unconditional Israeli action without balancing actions on the Arab side. And it specifically makes provision for the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries by agreement between Member States. When Arab Governments persuade international conferences to say that resolution 242(1967) requires immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all the territories, they commit a triple forgery within a single sentence and put our documentary consensus in jeopardy. But as it stands and as it is written it is a documentary basis for negotiation,\n79.\tDo we accept the principle of withdrawal? Yes. In the context of a permanent peace Israeli forces would withdraw to the positions and boundaries determined mutually by the peace agreements. Our policy is not unilateral annexation but the negotiation of agreements on the final boundary. That position is in full accord with the intentions of those who drafted and sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967). One of them, Assistant Secretary Sisco, said publicly in 1970:\n\\\"That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre-June 5 line, The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final, secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.\\\"\n80.\tWe are asked about the Palestinian Arabs. If the idea is Palestine instead of Israel, our answer, of course, is, No. There is nothing \\\"instead\\\" of Israel either in universal history or in modern political reality. The question whether the Arabs have 18 or 19 States does not stand on an equal plane with Israel's solitary domain of nationhood and existence. But if the issue is Palestine side by side with Israel, the answer is that in peace negotiations with Jordan Israel's permanent boundary would be determined. It is not our governmental consensus to seek such boundary changes as would bring all or most of the Arabs of the West Bank and\ntheir populated territories under Israeli sovereignty or citizenship. The majority of Jordan's population are Palestinians, and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. Thus an Israel-Jordan peace settlement would enable most of the Palestine Arabs east and west of the Jordan to affirm their identity and citizenship within an Arab framework. It is for Arabs and not Israelis to determine the precise constitutional structure of our eastern neighbour. In a peace settlement the area of the former Palestine Mandate on both sides of the Jordan between the desert and the sea would have two States \u2014 Israel and an Arab State which would be a Palestinian Arab State in its composition whatever its name or constitutional structure. It would be normal for Palestinian Arabs to be included in the Jordanian delegation that would negotiate peace with Israel.\n81.\tThe principles I have outlined today would, of course, have to be submitted to negotiation with the other side. Here I seek only to emphasize that our positions are legitimate, normal and conducive to a wide range of peaceful solutions. Indeed, they are identical with the principles adopted by many States which have been praised here for their contribution to the new detente. It is possible to agree with those positions or to differ from them. But we see a moral and intellectual affront in any tendency to portray them as eccentric, as immoderate and, more grotesquely, as intransigent, when they are quite clearly nothing of the kind.\n82.\tLeast of all is there any justification for making them the basis for abusive or punitive formulations in obedience to the pressures of Arab States which decline negotiation, refuse peace, encourage international terrorism and seek to impose their own hostilities on other States in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and dignity of newly emerging nations.\n83.\tWhatever has divided them in the past, the Israeli and Arab nations cannot escape their common destiny. History and geography ensure their proximity. Experience teaches us that there are no irreconcilable conflicts. If the Arab Governments will take example and inspiration from the prevailing spirit of detente, they will find in Israel a willing partner for regional development and co-operation. There would be more benefit and, above all, more honour and dignity for them and for us in the exploration of a peaceful future than in the pursuit of an ineffective and sterile rancour, which has achieved and will achieve none of its objectives but which degrades our region's name and obstructs its better visions.\n84.\tWe shall respond affirmatively to any efforts, such as those indicated by the United States, to assist in the search for just solutions and to generate a spirit of accommodation.\n85.\tIsrael's relations with the European community will enter a new phase with the conclusion this year of an agreement constituting a free trade area within the Mediterranean context. If the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe succeeds in its task, the Mediterranean and Middle East will benefit from the resultant growth of continental harmony. We welcome the decision of the Conference to invite Israel to present its views on matters inscribed on the Conference agenda,\n86.\tA central theme of the dialogue on detente in Europe, in the European Security Conference and elsewhere is liberty of movement and freedom of intellectual expression. Unless some success is registered here, there will be scepticism about the authenticity and depth of the change in the international climate. Our concern for detente should not lead us to ignore the desperate bid for freedom by men such as Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Levich and other scientists and thinkers who fall under governmental harassment and oppression.\n87.\tThe saga of Soviet Jewry belongs to this theme,\n88.\tDuring his visit to the United States this summer, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, Mr. Leonid Brezhnev, made a number of declarations implying that there are almost no rejections of requests by Soviet Jews to be permitted to leave for Israel. To our regret, we cannot confirm such statements at a time when so many Jews in the Soviet Union are held against their will and call out to us daily in despair. They face powerful authorities in a struggle to exercise the right, granted fortunately to many thousands of others, to join their people and their families in Israel. Applicants for emigration have in some instances been dismissed from work and left without any means of livelihood. Media of information have incited against them. Administrative molestation has made their life unbearable. Dozens of Jews, amongst them a young woman, have been condemned to long years of suffering behind barbed wire. The penalties inflicted on these people are especially surprising in view of the fact that the right to leave for Israel has been recognized in principle and that other Jews have exercised it. It is difficult to understand or condone a policy granting exit permits to some Jews while at the same time creating cruel obstacles for many others.\n89.\tNor can we pass in silence over the anti-Jewish incitement conducted openly or under the cover of propaganda directed against religion or against Zionism. This campaign is still carried on through governmental media of information and by means of propaganda publications and pseudo-scientific literature. In this manner anti-Semitic ideas are disseminated and injected into the masses of the Soviet Union's population.\n90.\tOn 26 March this year a tribunal in the French capital determined that information material distributed by the Soviet Embassy contained slanders on the Jewish faith and incitement to racial discrimination, and found those responsible guilty. But the Soviet authorities have not applied the Soviet law against the disseminators of anti-Semitic propaganda,\n91.\tAt the same time, the Jews of Syria and the remnant still left in Iraq are living in constant torment. Israel again appeals to world opinion which has already alleviated the plight of these helpless small minorities whose only salvation lies in emigration and the pursuit of a new life.\n92.\tThis season of the year was darkened for us in 1972 by the fearful affliction and murder of our sportsmen who went to Munich in the shelter of the Olympic flag. This year the horizon is clouded again. The kidnapping of Jewish refugees by terrorists in Austria is a reproach to international institutions whose sterile discussion of International terrorism must have given more encouragement to terrorists than they would have derived even from the absence of discussion. The decision to close the camp at Schoenau defied our belief. I recall an unforgettable day there a few months ago. In a world convulsed by nihilism and violence, it was moving to see this oasis of humane values, dedicated to the impulses of compassion and solidarity which have so often become submerged in the torrent of twentieth-century life. The very name Schoenau was recited with pride by every Austrian whom I was privileged to encounter. Those who have passed through its gates have known great suffering and torment in the tempests which have shaken Europe in this generation. To abandon such an enterprise in deference to a pair of brutal gangsters has a terrifying meaning, It raises the question where the final human victory belongs. Can law and civility triumph if they are not strongly defended? Can a decent and rational public order take root in the world if indulgence beyond their own expectation is shown to those who put a pistol to the head of unarmed wayfarers? What will be the effect of the constant suspension of European legal systems in favour of early release and impunity for those who come to kill and maim and leave their trail of innocent blood behind?\n93.\tThe issue is not only how the safe transit of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel will be arranged, once the emigration has been authorized and the immigration approved. This is an acutely grave question, but it arises in an even graver context. What is the future of a world in which two pirates and criminals can bring a, proud nation, can bring sovereign governments to the acceptance of their terms? What are the implications of transactions and engagements between civilized governments and violent extortionists? Who is going to rule our world, governments or gunmen?\n94.\tThe Council of Europe in its resolution entitled \\\"Report on the responsibility of the Member States of the Council of Europe regarding the free movement of people in Europe\\\", adopted on 1 October 1973, rightly expressed the hope that no government will regard itself as bound by a promise secured by extortion to terminate facilities for the transit of emigrants from the Soviet Union. All these human predicaments emerge from the developments in Vienna this week. When the civilized world stands with bowed head, along comes President El-Sadat to celebrate joyfully the triumph of the young gunmen over a few aging, weary Jews and over the sovereignty and law of an enlightened European State.\n95.\tOnce it was an international offence to aid pirates. They were defined as humani generis hostis, enemies of the human race. Are we approaching a time when it will be an offence to resist them?\n96.\tChancellor Brandt called from this platform for an effective convention against terrorism. But experience shows that if in this matter we aim at universality we shall not have the necessary parliamentary success. There is \u2014 let us face it \u2014 no effective anti-terrorist majority in the United Nations. That is an ominous truth, but nothing is gained by ignoring it.\n97.\tI ask myself therefore whether it would be more effective to follow the general traditions of international law by\nconvening like-minded interested States to discuss and formulate a convention against terrorism. The law of the seas and other instruments of international law and international co-operation evolved from the common action of a few States to which others came to adhere. Most of the historic international conventions were constructed in this way. Formulated by the few, they became the consensus of the many. The 43 States whose votes indicated their dissatisfaction with the results of last year's debate on terrorism might well consider meeting for common action, which would in the first place engage themselves and later attract a gradual but broad consensus.\n98.\tFor it becomes more evident each day that the United Nations, frustrated in its activity in regional disputes, should concentrate more of its efforts on matters of planetary concern which require a unitary framework. Mankind has a long past and an uncertain future. Revolutions in science, in technology, in the use of energy, in industrial productivity, in demographic growth have moved forward at a rhythm too quick for the mind to absorb. Man is not at ease with his environment. The intellectual and spiritual consequences are deep. Our culture is dominated by a sense of fragmentation and instability. It expresses the special pathos of the twentieth century condition \u2014 the confidence of power and yet the sharp premonition of vulnerability both living within us, together, side by side.\n99.\tThe United Nations may recapture some of its lost prestige and resonance if it gives first priority to those issues which have a planetary dimension. The law of the air and of the seas, the defence of air and water against pollution, the stimulation of economic growth in developing countries, the conservation of resources, the fight against famine, the establishment of a reserve of cereals in years of abundance for use in years of scarcity (following may I say, the thrifty example of our Israeli ancestor Joseph in ancient Egypt), the response to the call of hunger south of the Sahara, the response to the important initiative of President Echeverria of Mexico calling for a charter of economic rights and duties of States \u2014 those are some problems which can only be discussed and solved on a global scale. Too much of the time of the United Nations may have been spent on the regional disputes in which individual Governments have the last say \u2014 for the simple reason that they have the ultimate responsibility. In the meantime, problems have collected which because they belong equally to all nations, end up by belonging to none. Each of our national societies has its custodians and spokesmen. The question is who except the United Nations can speak for the City of Man? Who speaks in responsible tutelage of the atmosphere, the soil, the oceans, the unique life-supporting Earth?\n100.\tPerhaps mankind's dilemma is the United Nations opportunity. Let us, therefore, tread this ground firmly but with precision for this is the only planet that we have."

        "file_text": "\ufeff177.\t Mr. President, I am extremely happy to congratulate you on your election to preside over the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This is, doubtless, just recognition of your long and fruitful activities in our Organization. It is superfluous to add that the Cuban delegation will offer you whatever co-operation you require in discharging your task.\n178.\tBarely a year ago, in this same hall, we heard true, energetic and hopeful words from a man who has just given his life for the sake of the democratic will of his people, the cause of socialism and human decorum, a man whose proud, enlightening and moving voice still resounds, and doubly so after having been silenced in a titanic struggle. As everyone knows, I am speaking of Salvador Allende, the constitutional President of Chile. That man and that name, now gathered into an immortality which he shares with the greatest heroes and martyrs of our America, cannot be overlooked in this Assembly. For what they symbolize in human decency, in loyalty to principles, in nobility of purpose, in service to country and faith in mankind, that man and that name lay claim on us for a tribute of silence, a bowing of our spirits to the greatness of his, which at the supreme moment rose to immeasurable heights.\n179.\tI would not wish to proceed without first expressing Cuba's great satisfaction at the admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. That event is of great significance. On the one hand it is proof of the growing universality of the United Nations and on the other hand it is a sign of the changes that are taking place in the world today. We in the Cuban delegation are very happy to offer our fraternal welcome to the representatives of the German Democratic Republic, a socialist country, a peace-loving nation, which has succeeded in overcoming all the harassments, aggressions and intrigues of imperialism until it achieved recognition of its international personality.\n180.\tWith the warmth and friendship of neighbours we welcome the achievement of independence by the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and its admission to the United Nations.\n181.\tWith our flags flying, Cuba greets the establishment of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. That historic event irreversibly speeds up the triumph of the anti-colonialist struggle being carried on by the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde and further weakens the position of colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism in Africa. The people and the Government of revolutionary Cuba, who have already given full diplomatic recognition to the new State, rejoice at the victorious process of liberation of the people of Guinea-Bissau as though it were our own. The Cuban delegation pays a heartfelt tribute to Amilcar Cabral, the inspirer and guide of that memorable undertaking, vilely murdered by henchmen of imperialism a short while ago.\n182.\tCuba fully and militantly identifies itself with the legitimate liberating struggle being carried on with unshakeable determination by the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic for the reconquest of their land usurped by Israel and for the recognition of the national rights of the intrepid and suffering Palestinian people. The cause of the Arab peoples is our own cause. In the Sinai peninsula and in the Golan Heights today a battle is also being waged for the liberation of the subjected peoples, the exploited peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Egypt and Syria are in the vanguard of the so-called third world. If necessary, let us give them everything, even our own blood.\n183.\tThis dramatic situation, imposed on us by Zionism wedded to imperialism and reaction,, fraught with risks for\ninternational peace and security, is attracting the attention of the whole world and, therefore, of this Assembly.\n184.\tThe indiscriminate bombing of Damascus, where the buildings of a number of embassies have been wiped out and a number of diplomatic officials have been killed, testifies to the hatred and savagery inherent in the Zionist policy. The non-aligned nations have made a statement this afternoon in which they reaffirmed their total and active solidarity with the Arab countries suffering aggression, and offering all their co-operation and support.\n185.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Cuba has made a statement on this matter which I shall refer to later.\n186.\tAn over-all glance at the international panorama allows us to see that, although the prospects for the struggle for peace seem clearer and more promising, as well as those for security, progress and social and economic development, there is still a long way to go.\n187.\tAlthough the process that is now beginning is subject to the inherent fluctuations of the class struggle and ideological contradictions between the capitalist and socialist systems, and to the very aggressive and bellicose nature of imperialism, Cuba is proud of that constructive progress and the concrete manifestations of international detente.\n188.\tFor many centuries Europe was the cockpit of history, but the face that the old continent is now turning to us is very different from the one it showed a few years ago. And this is a point we must bring out: the transformation of the climate of tension and hostilities that prevailed in Europe from the end of the Second World War was the result of the dedicated efforts and the policy of principle of the Soviet Union, the main force behind the struggle for peace.\n189.\tBut this is no miracle. The Soviet Union was able to plough the furrow of peace, security and co-operation among nations possessing different social regimes by means of the convergence of certain changes and new conditioning factors at the very heart of European society and in the world, which in turn led to the creation of conditions conducive to peaceful coexistence in that part of our planet.\n190.\tThe clearing of the atmosphere in Europe, which was the result of that interreaction of factors reflected in the presence in the United Nations of two German States, the agreements signed between those States and between the, Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and the opening of the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, will be enhanced by the documents signed during the conversations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The genuine vocation for peace of the Soviet Union obtained agreements and compromises that laid the objective basis for avoiding a nuclear conflict and saving us from the catastrophic risk of a new war of world-wide proportions. This significant victory is the culmination of a tenacious struggle for peace that began with the establishment of the first State of workers and peasants. It is not the result of\na policy of positions of strength but of the strength of positions. The stifling stench of Watergate has sapped even _ further the already diminished right of North American imperialism to dictate its policy in global terms.\n191.\tIt is obvious that the process of detente, timed and circumscribed by the facts and documents I have mentioned, is beset by shoals and dangers.\n192.\tAs long as imperialism survives, the frontiers of detente, peace, security, and co-operation will be precarious. But it is no less obvious that the concrete conditions created by that process favour the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America for their liberation, social progress and economic development and increase their influence on the evolution of the international situation. It is for these reasons that the countries still belonging to the under-developed world must, if they wish to take part in history and in the forging of the new scientific and technical revolution and the conquest of outer space, join their efforts with those of the socialist countries to widen, strengthen and assure the roads of peace and to choose the most suitable ways and means to overthrow colonial and neo- colonial domination. It is in that direction that the horizon of lasting peace is brightening.\n193.\tThe contribution of the indomitable and dedicated people of Viet-Nam to the achievement of that objective has been decisive. Never has a people, confronted by an enemy a thousand times more powerful and cruel beyond conception, done so much for peace, for liberation and for the dignity of man. That people preferred to die rather than bow, and it won. The Paris agreements set forth the ignominious defeat of North American imperialism, but from that day to the present time the puppet regime of Saigon has violated those agreements with unparalleled cynicism. Kissinger initialled the agreements, but Thieu ignores them with the complacency and blessing of Kissinger. And from that day to this, also violating them, the North American Government has constantly sent arms and resources of all sorts to Thieu.\n194.\tOn the occasion of his recent visit to the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, where he was received by that heroic people and its admirable leaders with overwhelming expressions of fraternal friendship, the Premier of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, Commander Fidel Castro, at the invitation of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, visited the zones that had been liberated by the Viet-Namese people. On that historic visit \u2014 the first made-by a head of Government to that part of that territory artificially divided from the glorious country of Ho Chi Minh \u2014 he spoke the following words in the town of Dong Hon:\n\\\"It is impossible to carry out a visit to Viet-Nam without including a tour of the south and through this province of Quang Binh, which is the vanguard of the North and the rearguard of the South.\\\"\n195.\tHe continued saying that very soon the Cuban engineers and architects would start work on the reconstruction of the region and planning of a new capital for the province, which had been so ruthlessly devastated, and added:\nAs far as we are concerned, co-operating with VietNam is a great honour. It is not you who should thank us; it is we who owe you thanks \u2014 you, the people of Viet-Nam.\\\"\n196.\tThe position of Cuba regarding the struggle for international peace and security is crystal-clear. From experience, my country knows the direct onslaughts and the whole arsenal of the ruses of imperialism, and we are always therefore on the alert. We have never yielded one iota of our sovereignty, our self-determination or our dignity. We have been isolated. We have been attacked. We have been blockaded, illegally and criminally, for the sole reason that we shook off the imperialist yoke and we chose the socialist road to development. We were even on the verge of being blasted by a North American nuclear attack. From experience also, Cuba knows what it means to have the cooperation and the assistance of the Soviet Union- and the socialist countries and the solidarity of peoples behind us.\n197.\tBecause of a community of destiny and in accordance with our international duty, Cuba has supported and will continue to support all the movements of national liberation in Africa, Asia and Latin America, just as we have supported and will support all the peoples and Governments that fight to defend or regain their full independence and their sovereign right to enjoy their natural resources. It is for that reason precisely that Cuba has advocated and continues to support all acts of this Organization tending to strengthen international peace and security. Peace and security wrested from the imperialists objectively become a reduction of their overweening power.\n198.\tCuba therefore fully supports the initiatives of the Soviet Union for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and of the use of force in international relations, as well as the convening of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States. The Revolutionary Government of Cuba, because of its socialist nature and foreign policy of principle, is in agreement with measures that will alleviate international tensions. For the same reasons, we shall continue our struggles against colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism in all their forms and manifestations as antagonistic to international peace and security. Those activities complement one another. They flow from the different structures and ends of the socialist and capitalist societies and from the real division of the greater part of the world into oppressed and oppressor countries. The complex dynamics of international life and its shocking contrasts call for a new approach and consistent action.\n199.\tOne of the most acute problems confronting mankind today is the arms race, with its enormous risks and overwhelming economic burden on the peoples. It is known that in the course of the last few years some steps have been taken towards reducing methods of mass destruction. The use of bacteriological weapons has even been prohibited and they have been abolished.\n200.\tBut this problem has given rise to many deliberations, proposals and agreements in the United Nations. However, the difficulties are great, and it is logical to doubt that the matter can be settled by one stroke of the pen. There is therefore no alternative other than to continue the constant struggle and guarantee the holding of a world disarmament conference. It is imperative to stress that among the main items of its agenda should be included that of the dismantling of the military bases scattered by imperialism over almost all continents, which in themselves constitute spearheads of a policy of expansion, subversion, domination and aggression. Suffice it, as examples in Latin America, to mention the bases established in Panama and Puerto Rico and the Guatanamo naval base in Cuba.\n201.\tAmong the international events of the period that I have tried to analyse, an outstanding position is occupied by the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973. More than half the members of the international community participated, and they represent the majority of the population of the globe \u2014 and many of their heads of State and Government. As observers or as guests a number of other countries, movements and organizations participated. The clamour of the hungry, oppressed, subjected or outlawed people of Africa, Asia and Latin America shook our deliberations. These deliberations concentrated on the great political, economic, social and cultural problems of the under-developed nations within the context of the international situation and of the joint process of the currents of national and social emancipation that in one way or another are upsetting the archaic structures that engender dependency, backwardness, poverty, servitude, deprivation, exploitation and racism.\n202.\tIn its review of the international situation, the Conference agreed that the process of detente in Europe was a plausible event but, at the same time, it found that the confrontation of peoples with colonialism, racial discrimination, apartheid, domination and foreign occupation, as well as neo-colonialism, imperialism and Zionism, continued to be unchallengeable realities of our day, and today we are proving it in the Middle East. I have already referred to this duality and I have stressed its causes. There can be no doubt or argument that peace and security are far from prevailing in the Indo-Chinese peninsula and elsewhere in the world. The under-developed nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America are still under the gunsight of the enemies of peace and security.\n203.\tThe most outstanding features of the Algiers Conference were its anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist and anti-neo- colonialist stand; its vigorous condemnation of Israel; its open support for the struggle of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America to reaffirm their sovereignty, to recover their natural resources and to make the necessary structural changes to foster and guarantee their liberation and development; its severe criticism of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade; and its request that the monetary crisis, which has now become more acute as a result of the new devaluation of the dollar, should be discussed at the international level; its denunciation of the seditious role of the multinational corporations and its readiness to co-operate with the socialist side. It is these features which shape the results and the prospects which are open for all to see.\n204.\tAt that Conference, the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba and the Chairman of the Cuban delegation, Commander Fidel Castro, expressed views that should be repeated here. He said:\n\\\"Any attempt to confront the non-aligned countries with the socialist countries is completely counterrevolutionary and benefits only the interests of the imperialists. To alienate the friendship of the socialist countries is to weaken us and leave us at the mercy of the still powerful imperialist forces. It would be clumsy strategy and colossal political short-sightedness. The success and future of the non-aligned movement must lie in the course of not allowing ourselves to be infiltrated, confused or deceived by imperialist ideology. Only the closest alliance of the progressive forces of the world will give us the necessary strength to overcome the still powerful imperialists, colonialists, neo-colonialists and racists and struggle to achieve the aspirations for justice and peace of the peoples of the world.\\\"\n\n\n205.\tWith respect to the main problems raised at the Algiers Conference \u2014 almost all of which were submitted to our consideration this year as last year \u2014 the Cuban delegation expressed its views on the struggle for international peace and security and related questions, including the significance and the present stage of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam.\n\n206.\tSuffice it to add now that, with respect to Viet-Nam, Cuba calls for strict compliance with those agreements by the Government of the United States and the puppet regime of Saigon. But that would not be sufficient for peace to be restored in the Indo-China peninsula. It is also imperative for North American intrigue in Laos and aggression in Cambodia to end \u2014 the latter being carried out through Thieu. The promise of peace in Laos and the immediate implementation of the Vientiane Agreement must depend on the establishment of a government of national coalition. The only true Government of Cambodia is the Royal Government of National Union, recognized by the majority of the countries represented here. The restoration of its usurped seat in the United Nations can brook no further delay. The puppets occupying that seat at the moment must be expelled.\n\n207.\tThe arbitrary division of Korea continues to be a great source of tension in the Far East. We agree with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that conditions should be made favourable for the peaceful reunification, and independence of the Korean people. Cuba reiterates its demand to the Assembly that there be an immediate withdrawal of all North American troops from South Korea, that the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea be immediately dissolved and that an end be put to any interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean peninsula.\n208.\tThe prolonged and explosive crisis in the Middle East has now broken out. We must not forget that imperialist greed to take over the rich oil reserves in the Arab countries is one of the underlying factors of the aggressive, expansionist, annexationist and predatory policy of Israel. It is not by chance that the Sixth Fleet is in the area.\n\n209.\tI shall now read out the Declaration of our Government:\n\\\"The Revolutionary Government of Cuba repudiates the policy of aggression of the Government of Israel, which has once again led to a situation of war in the Middle East.\n\\\"It is a known fact that the Government of Israel has rejected all forms of settlement of the situation in the Middle East created by its own illegitimate occupation of Arab territories and by its brutal denial of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\\\"Instead of bowing to the universal clamour for a return of the occupied territories, the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people and the political discussion of the problems of the area, the Israeli Government has maintained an aggressive position against the Arab States.\n\\\"In recent days the concentration of Israeli armed forces on the armistice lines with Syria and the Arab Republic of Egypt and the mobilization of reserves clearly showed the intentions of the Israeli Government, which ultimately unleashed in the area the military situation which today constitutes a grave concern for the peoples of the region and is a serious threat to peace beyond the territories involved.\n\\\"The Revolutionary Government of Cuba expresses its support for the just positions of the Arab Republic of Egypt and of Syria, its solidarity in the face of the Israeli attacks, and joins in the universal condemnation of the actions of the Government of Israel.\\\"\n\n\n210.\tDespite the stubborn resistance and the obtuse approach of the colonialists and neo-colonialists, the national liberation movements in Africa continue to deliver destructive body blows at them. The emancipation of the people of Guinea-Bissau clears the road for the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde. The peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa valiantly rebel against colonial fascism and its repugnant methods, among which apartheid has a zoological physiognomy. Simultaneously, the manoeuvres, threats and conspiracies of the imperialists have increased against the People's Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and the Republic of Guinea, to the point where aggression was committed against them by international mercenary bands organized and supplied by Portugal and NATO. Cuba actively supported the complaint by the Republic of Guinea in the Security Council on this question. \n\n211.\tIn the struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa, we are now entering a decisive stage. If the United Nations is unable to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) and to break the resistance of the reactionary forces of imperialism and racism that oppose such implementation, it will assume responsibilities that will gravely weaken its authority and prestige.\n\n212.\tThe deteriorated and shattered alliances and self-styled Truman and Eisenhower doctrines have been shattered because they are useless. Formerly, they contended that they would play the role of the international gendarme of reaction, and now they turn to the expedient of encouraging Fascist coups d'etat and economically support and supply with more effective and numerous weapons puppet Governments and praetorian armies and assign to them the foul task of enslaving and brutally repressing their own peoples in order to permit more profitable and safer exploitation. Through their new alliances, you may find their present strategy and tactics in the following areas: South Korea, Saigon, Thailand and Lon Nol in Asia; Portugal, South Africa and Rhodesia in Africa; Israel and Iran in the Middle East; Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay and now the Fascist junta of Chile in Latin America. \n  \n\n213.\tTheir frantic despair at the mess in which they find themselves is obvious, but so too is their contumacy in trying to maintain and extend their tottering domination. That duality to which they were pushed by their growing decomposition, the rebellion of the peoples and the resistance of many Governments prove their perfidious plans and have exposed their two-facedness. An obvious example of that is the Pharisaic torrent of rhetoric poured out on us by the grey eminence of the waning system.\n214.\tAt these moments Latin America is confronting a crucial situation. The rising progressive and anti-imperialist movement in our continent has been a fundamental element in the decline of the capacity of the Government of the United States to continue a global imperialist policy. It was precisely in the Caribbean that at the beginning of the now-dying century it started its neo-colonial politics, and it was in that region too that the process of defeat of that policy started. The Cuban revolution, the radiant apex of the radiant undertakings that today celebrate their one hundred and fifth anniversary, started the victorious march of the second independence called for by Jose Marti.\n215.\tIn the year that followed we were clearly able to see the antagonisms and the differences between Yankee imperialism and the Latin American peoples, which were growing and becoming more obvious. If at the beginning of 1960 efforts were made to propagate the fraud of representative democracy and to gild the lie of the Alliance for Progress confronting a socialist Cuba, at the beginning of the present decade there were already some Governments that had taken positions to defend their independence, their sovereignty and their natural resources.\n216.\tIn Peru the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces strengthened its nationalist positions. The Government of Popular Unity of Chile was trying to carry out, despite the Fascist escalation of reaction and imperialism, its singular purpose of strengthening the bases of the socialist road to development within constitutional machinery created by the dominating classes to safeguard their own interests. In Panama the people and the Government joined to call for full recognition of their sovereignty, jurisdiction and rights over the Canal and the Zone, strengthened by the almost unanimous support of the Security Council.\n217.\tWith their revolutionary acts and their votes the people of Argentina overthrew the dictatorship. The countries of the Andean Pact adopted restrictive measures on foreign investment. The challenge to the illegal diplomatic blockade of Cuba grew. The injections of camphor oil and plastic surgery were empty resources to revive the moribund and rotten OAS. At the fifteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America [ECLA], held in Quito in March, the United States stood alone. It saw the aggressive pact of Rio de Janeiro buffeted by criticism and the incompatibility of socialism with the Latin American continent was suddenly challenged. Puerto Rico more and more took up the cudgels for its shattered national rights assumed by North American imperialism in 1898 and its inalienable sovereignty and right to independence and self-determination were recognized by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in the United Nations.\n218.\tThe imperialists' strategy of isolating Argentina, Chile and Peru or subjecting them to their policy through the conversion of Brazil into a dependent imperialist State and their strengthening of reaction in Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia, satellites of colonial fascism, seemed to face almost insuperable obstacles. The course of the development of this growing polarization of the progressive and anti-imperialist forces, which irremediably undermined their dire domination of the years of the past, led North American imperialism to concentrate its efforts on the overthrow of the Government of Popular Unity, inciting the armed forces to treason and giving all their help to the dominating classes, to the reactionary parties and the Fascist groups of Chile.\n219.\tI shall now, if you will allow me, cast a somewhat brutal light of truth on what occurred in Chile and what is still taking place. It is a duty that I am fulfilling as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba, as a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary, as a comrade of Salvador Allende and as a simple human being. I stress this last, because I wish radically to differentiate myself from those who here represent the bestiary and the forest.\n220.\tThe henchmen of colonial fascism and of imperialist propaganda have tried to cast a curtain of pretences, fallacies, calumnies, scurrility, adulterations and vile accusations to disguise their machinations, their felonies, their knavery, their infamy, their crimes and their responsibility. That was also the clumsy intention behind the ridiculous, lying, petulant, cowardly and low so-called \\\"I accuse\\\" of the ex-Minister of the Government of Popular Unity and rented Vice-Admiral, who dishonours this Assembly, bearing the stigma of traitor on his brow and his bloody garments after the murder of thousands of Chileans. The hired hand of Enrique Bernstein, ex-Director of International Relations of the Government of President Allende and confessed Christian Democrat, is not unscathed in that filthy, low, primitive and repulsive libel.\n221.\tBut it is the facts that will seat the presumptuous accuser in the dock of the accused.\n222.\tSalvador Allende assumed the presidency of the Republic of Chile by will of the people expressed in elections on 4 November 1970. Between the elections in which he triumphed and that act were many plots hatched by the United States Embassy as well as by transnational corporations like the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation [777], which tried to stop him from acceding to the presidency through an explosion of blind, exasperated and savage violence. The Fascist escalation of reaction and imperialism culminated with his heroic fall on II September. The unleashing of the most unbridled terror began the day after the elections. The murder of the head of the Army, General Rene Schneider, because of his true and consistent position was the tragic signal that triggered the\nFascist war against the Government, the Popular Unity Party, the leftist movements, the working classes and the progressive levels of the population \u2014 something similar to the burning of the Reichstag by the Nazis, which unleashed a manhunt for Communists, socialists, anti-Fascists, Jews and foreigners that today is being exceeded in its unbelievable ferocity by the junta.\n223.\tThis criminal madness of the desperate, as President Allende called them, was clear proof of the appearance of fascism in Chile, although they still hypocritically mouthed democratic slogans. Their main centres were the brutal National Party and the Lombrosian group \\\"Patria y Libertad\\\", seconded, with their own aims and ambitions in view, by the rightist leaders of the so-called Christian Democratic Party and above all by their main leader, ex-President Eduardo Frei, who, as Machiavelli might have said, combines the cunning of the fox, the treachery of the panther and the appetite of the hyena. Sometimes disguised, sometimes openly barefaced, we see the manifestations of that disgraceful plotting, the North Americans pulling the strings. The armed forces, under the then leadership of a man who was true to his constitutional obligations, apparently remained in their barracks and their highest officers never missed an opportunity of showing their loyalty, professionalism and non-political stand. And among the most obsequious and garrulous was the head of the junta, General Augusto Pinochet, a convicted Nazi and gloating murderer of the workers, for example during the Government of Frei.\n224.\tIn that adverse situation, President Allende began his democratic renewing of socialist efforts, sincerely convinced that he would be able to fulfil his programme ancl lay the groundwork for a more just and humane society in Chile, as he stressed in his first statement to the people after assuming the presidency.\n225.\tThe election of a Marxist leader to preside over a bourgeois Republic in a country which was dependent and under-developed was an exceptional event in history, and at the same time fraught with unknown quantities. President Allende was also aware of the other dimension of the process that he was leading. He knew this at all times. But, until the Fascist uprising took place, he constantly resorted to all constitutional and legal ways and means to travel the road that he had drawn for himself. To all lights, it was an extraordinarily important experiment he was carrying out. to benefit all people; and it was for this reason that from the very outset that undertaking earned the sympathy and support of all the progressive anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces of the world.\n226.\tThe heritage handed to President Allende was a gigantic hurdle that he had to surmount in order to fulfil his programme: a poor country; high unemployment; a society plagued by inequalities; the dominating classes safe behind their privileges; unbridled inflation; a bankrupt economy; and a State indebted to the level of $4,000 million, the heavy burden of the ostentatious policies of Frei, with his subservience to foreign interests. There was also a parliament whose voting power lay with the dominating classes; a judiciary which owed its existence to the interests of the status quo; a bureaucracy undermined by reaction, and armed forces which called themselves constitutional. This series of realities and facts, furthermore, coincided with a reduction of the price paid for copper, the main export of Chile, from 75 cents a pound to 40 cents.\n227.\tIt was as urgent as it was necessary to meet the burning needs of the people and therefore to undertake the structural transformations that could contribute to that end. But he had hardly effectively put into implementation agrarian reform when the monopolizing of goods and the sabotage of agricultural production took place. Hardly had the nationalization of the great copper industry, then in the hands of North American enterprises, been approved, when the United States Government froze all the international credits that the Chilean Government had a right to call on, and organized a large-scale operation designed to ruin the economy and provoke a coup d'etat. The bourgeois parties and the Fascist groups would co-ordinate their activities to the same end and the mass communications media, in the hands of magnates and foreigners, started the most slanderous, violent and cowardly campaign that can be recalled. One would have to have been in Chile justly to assess the abject magnitude of this convergence of interests, closely yoked.\n228.\tFrom propaganda they went quickly to action, both within and outside parliament \u2014 through the reactionary laws, seditious strikes on the part of the management, attacks against the leaders of the Popular Unity Party, street demonstrations in the aristocratic neighbourhoods, calls to the armed forces to overthrow the constitutional Government, and conspiracies in which, under the leadership of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], the high leaders of the Christian Democratic Party participated, as well as the National Party, the Group \\\"Patria y Libertad\\\", and the big bosses of the dominating classes, the high-salaried professionals, the newspaper El Mercurio, and the officers advocating a coup d'etat, particularly in the navy and air force.\n229.\tIn those complex and hostile circumstances, the Government of Popular Unity struggled for three desperate years to fulfil its programme. They did what they could \u2014  and even more \u2014 to help the Chilean people. But, as the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba said in the statement he made at the enormous tribute paid in our country to President Salvador Allende, and as a gesture of solidarity to the Chilean people:\n\\\"At least in these three years he and his workers and peasants understood that in the presidency of the Republic there was not a representative of the oligarchs, of the landowners and the bourgeois, but a representative of the humble, of the workers, a true representative of the people, who worked for the people despite the enormous difficulties confronting him. President Allende fully understood the difficulties and understood the dangers, but he saw fascism being reborn; he saw the conspiracies falling one upon the heels of the other. And, confronted by that combination of forces fed by imperialism, he had only one decision to make, and that was to defend the process even at the cost of his own life.\\\"\n230.\tLet us listen to what he said in Santiago on 4 December 1971. It was a statement of farewell to the Prime\nMinister, Commander Fidel Castro, and it was a statement that his generous blood consecrated a few days ago:\n\\\"I tell you quite calmly, with complete serenity, I am not made to be an apostle, nor to be a Messiah. I do not possess the qualities for martyrdom. I u a social fighter who is fulfilling a task, a task that was entrusted to me by the people. But let those who try to turn back history and ignore the majority will of the people of Chile understand that, without being a martyr, I shall not go back. Let them know that I shall leave the palace of La Moneda when I have fulfilled the mandate entrusted to me by the people. Let them know. Let them hear. Let them understand it deeply. I shall defend the Chilean revolution and I shall defend the Government because this is the mandate entrusted to me by the people. I have no other alternative. Only by riddling me with bullets will they end my will to fulfil the programme of the people.\\\"\nAnd it was those self-same words that he repeated to others, and even to me, when he was speaking in the presence of his ex-rival for the presidency, Radomiro Tomic, and our Ambassador to Chile, Mario Garcia Inchaustegui.\n231.\tThe President of Chile fell fighting. He did not stop shooting his rifle until bullets cut off his life. The last hours of this brave fighter are known because of the unchallengeable eyewitness report of his daughter, Beatriz, who was with him until she was ordered to leave, with other heroic women who were with him, because their lives were thought to be precious for the future struggle, and the testimony of some survivors, recently mentioned by the Prime Minister of Cuba. While they tried to hide it, the Fascist henchmen know full well that President Allende fell fighting against the uniformed pack of common criminals.\n232.\tBut before rapidly going over those shattering and shattered hours, I feel it necessary, even briefly, to refer to the background preceding 11 September.\n233.\tLies are knowingly spoken when it is said \u2014 and you heard it yesterday \u2014 in a shameful effort to justify the overthrow of the constitutional regime and the nightmare of slaughter, murder, torture, destruction, raids and persecutions being lived through by Chile, that the Government of Popular Unity was preparing to exterminate the officers of the armed forces. What was being plotted was precisely the opposite: the Dantesque spectacle that has shaken the world.\n234.\tThe armed forces were never given much attention as regards their institutional development before the Government which was overthrown; nor were they ever called, as President Allende called them, to join in the national efforts at development and to share the responsibilities of government. Three high-ranking officers of the armed forces were in the Council of Ministers from October 1972 to May 1973. Even when Salvador Allende visited the United Nations he designated as Vice-President of the Republic the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General Carlos Prats. This trust and co-operation between the Government of Popular Unity and the armed forces rested on the understanding between the Government and the constitutionalist faction of the army and, significantly, occurred simultaneously with the efforts to overthrow the Government by the Fascist sectors of the army, the navy and the air force.\n235.\tThat sector, openly or clandestinely, conspired since Allende took over the presidency. But it did not do so alone; it conspired with the reactionary parties and North American imperialism, the true leader and ideologist of the Fascist coup. It organized \u2014 and I want to stress this \u2014 eight special operations of intelligence, subversion and counter-intelligence, under the direction of the Pentagon, the State Department, the CIA and the transnational corporations acting together with, among other Chilean capitalists, ' Matte, Alessandri, Bulnes and Edward, and with the reactionary parties and the Fascist groups. We have irrefutable proof of what I am saying and of the fact that the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party nominated a representative to these anti-national activities, a man called Felipe Amunategui, as well as Andres Donoso. To prove this I shall give the code names of three of those seditious operations: Centauro, Yellow Star and Marty.\n236.\tThe military institutes, moreover, maintained excellent relations with the Pentagon. While the Government of Popular Unity found its international credit frozen, the institutes received from the Government of the United States millions of dollars and military equipment.\n237.\tAccording to reliable testimony, the aims of the CIA in overthrowing Allende were the following: to restore the economic and political domination of the United States in Chile; to liquidate the relations of friendship and cooperation with Cuba and the socialist countries; to provoke the economic and financial collapse of the country in order to create conditions conducive to a Fascist coup; to jeopardize the participation of the armed forces; to ensure the overthrow of President Allende before 13 November; and to establish a dependent Government which would adopt the imperialist economic philosophy and serve the economic objectives of the United States in that country.\n238.\tThe abortive military coups of March and September 1972 showed the internal struggle in the armed forces between the sector that wanted the coup and those who respected the law, led by General Prats, General Pickering and General Sepulveda. But it was clearly seen that the strength of the armed forces was deteriorating when an armoured unit made an unsuccessful attack against the Moneda Palace on 27 June 1973. The Generals mentioned, leading their troops, put down that coup. As of that moment, it became obvious to the constitutionalist sector of the armed forces that its capacity to maintain internal unity and to contain the Fascist officers was being seriously challenged.\n239.\tWhat came after was a multipronged political, military and popular action by President Allende to preserve the constitutional regime and avoid an armed confrontation, although he was ready to fight. Surrounded by increasing rumours of imminent army uprisings, in August there occurred \u2014 financed, organized and directed by American imperialism \u2014 the insurrectional strike of the truck-drivers which started in 1972 as an essay, to be joined by the professionals and an increasing number of tradesmen. The desire for the coup grew and became more forceful. The reactionary parties, with the Christian Democrats in the vanguard, broke off the dialogue proposed by President Allende and the Chamber of Deputies, by a mechanical vote of the majority, urged the Fascist military group to\nestablish a coup with a statement to the effect that the Government of Popular Unity had shattered constitutional order.\n240. The terrorist attacks on persons and public services continued. Buildings in Santiago \u2014 and I have seen this with my own eyes \u2014 were covered with this sinister slogan: \\\"Djakarta is near.\\\" But the armed forces, those same armed forces that yesterday slaughtered the unarmed population of Lima, that later massacred the workers and today, in the name of law and order, commit crimes and tortures, did nothing then to stop the seditious escalation.\n241. President Allende called the Popular Unity leaders and the leaders of the Central Unica de Trabajadores (Labour Union) and told them that, in the light of the serious military situation, he had decided, in accordance with the will of the army leaders, to retire the Generals implicated in the projected Fascist coup. Among others, President Allende spoke with General Pinochet, who was at that moment interim Chief of the Army, and prepared an anti-insurrectionist plan.\n242.\tMore than half the high-ranking officers refused to condemn the ill-treatment of General Prats. Suddenly, among the Generals who supported the Minister of Defence was found Pinochet.\n243.\tGeneral Prats presented his irrevocable resignation to the President and Pinochet, like a witch in Macbeth, advised the President to agree to the resignation to appease the high-ranking officers of the navy and the air force, then committed himself to assume leadership of the army and to retire the other conspirators. But the only retirements he signed were those of Prats, Pickering and Sepulveda \u2014 all loyal to the troops and to the Government.\n244.\tOn 24 August the main officers of the navy met at Valparaiso and when their Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Montero, a true man of honour, arrived he was confronted with a request for his resignation. He replied that he could do so only to the President of the Republic, President Allende. While the Vice-Admiral who represents dishonour, crime and fascism is here with impunity, demonstrating his foolishness with his bloodstained hands, on that same 11 September Admiral Montero was arrested and replaced by a raging gorilla, a member of the Fascist group. Officers and other ranks opposed to the coup were detained or murdered. Generals Guillermo Pickering, German Sepulveda, Alberto Bachelet and Jose Maria Sepulveda, the leaders of the carabineros up to 11 September, were arrested also.\n245.\tThe American Ambassador, Nathaniel P. Davis, in charge of Soviet affairs during the cold-war years and closely linked to Howard Hunt \u2014 who is involved in the filth of Watergate \u2014 travelled to Washington a week before the coup and returned on the eve of the coup. The State Department will later admit without blushing or without scruples that it knew of the planned date.\n246.\tThese facts are clear. They may be twisted or they may be denied, but the facts still stand.\n247.\tAt dawn on 11 September, the navy rebelled in Valparaiso. Their ships had sailed the night before, allegedly to\nparticipate in the so-called \\\"UNITAS\\\" operation, but they came back, they crawled back into port like foreigners, escorted by North American ships on combat alert. President Allende, as soon as he knew of it, went to his office after providing for the protection of his home where his wife was. The Palace also heard that Pinochet was false, a disgrace and a traitor. The army and the air force had joined the Fascist coup. The moment of armed confrontation had struck.\n248.\tBut President Allende, with a small number of ministers, collaborators and comrades and friends decided to resist. That man, who did not tire of advocating tolerance, respect for the law and peaceful settlement as well as the respect for the Constitution, grew until he achieved the stature of a hero. He replied to bullets with bullets. He held at bay the aggressors for a number of hours. He put a tank out of commission with a bazooka shot. He courageously resisted the fire of artillery, the attacks of the tanks, the bombing by planes and danger from fire. A number of times he was urged to surrender. He was offered a plane to take him to any other country with his family and those he might choose. His answer was unshaken: \\\"The traitorous generals do not know what a man of honour is.\\\" He remained calm, determined, courageous, at his battle-station and he would say later with lapidary sobriety: \\\"This is the way we write the first page of this story. My people and America will write the rest.\\\" He saw many of his comrades fall before his very eyes, and among them his very close friend, the news correspondent Augusto Olivares, who stood out in those epic hours. While this was taking place, his private residence, his home, was being attacked by the armed forces with the brutality common to the bloodthirsty cowards. His home was destroyed, sacked, gutted. His wife's life was saved by chance.\n249.\tAnd so the Fascists took over the ground floor of the Palace and, after a hard fight, occupied part of the upper floor. In the red room, surrounded by a handful of courageous men, the President was waiting for them with a smoking rifle. He advanced resolutely on the Fascists, and a shot tore open his stomach, but he continued to fire on the murderers, leaning against a piece of furniture, until a second shot shattered his chest and sent him to the floor. Falling, his bloody body was riddled with bullets.\n250.\tThose who survived this almost legendary scene regrouped, counter-attacked and threw out the Fascists\n, from the upper floors. Members of his personal guard carried the corpse of Salvador Allende to his office. They sat him in the presidential seat, they placed across his chest his presidential sash, and they shrouded him in the Chilean flag.\n251.\tAs Prime Minister Commander Fidel Castro has said:\n\\\"Seldom in history was a similar page of heroism written. Never in this continent has any president played such a dramatic role. Salvador Allende showed more dignity, more honour, more courage and more heroism than all those Fascist officers together. His gesture of - incomparable greatness sank forever in ignominy Pinochet and his accomplices. His exemplary conduct morally destroyed fascism in Chile. Very often the unarmed thought has been overcome by brute force, but now we\ncan say that never has brute force met such resistance carried out in the military field by a man of ideas whose weapons were always the word and the pen.\\\"\n252.\tFor more than 24 hours, the Fascists were silent and did not make known the death of President Allende. He was buried in secret. Neither his wife nor his sister, who accompanied his pine coffin in a plane of the armed forces among stolid and insensible officers, was allowed to see his body.\n253.\tBut his last words will continue to vibrate in the air as an unchallengeable mandate:\n\\\"Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men may overcome this bitter and grey moment, when treason is trying to impose itself. But you must know that, much sooner than later, the great road will open through which the free man can go in his effort to build a better society. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words, being sure that the sacrifice will not be in vain. I am convinced\\\" \u2014 listen carefully \u2014 \\\"that there will be at least a moral sanction that will punish crime, cowardice and treason.\\\"\n254.\tThe Fascists also attacked our embassy, flouting the Vienna Convention, international law and the Charter of the United Nations. They wounded our Ambassador, who is present here, and an official of the embassy. But to their bravado and threats we always answered, \\\"We shall defend the embassy, which is Cuban territory, until the last man falls.\\\" The complaint of Cuba on the matter is still before the Security Council. \n255.\tFurthermore, the Fascists did not stop at harassing diplomats and technicians of socialist countries and diplomatic officials of capitalist countries. In a word, they gave proof of their barbarous contempt for civilization.\n256.\tThe first act of the Fascist foreign ministry was to break off diplomatic relations with Cuba, and we are proud: it is comforting and strengthening to us; with murderers, torturers and anthropoids we want no ties of any sort.\n257.\tWhen the Cuban diplomatic personnel left the country, the Government of Sweden took over the representation of our interests. The Swedish Ambassador, Harald Edelstam, has in these dark and dangerous days behaved with a zeal and a solicitude which do honour to Swedish diplomacy and the Swedish Government.\n258.\tFour of the very few Cubans who were still in Chile were able to get into Argentina after they had been abandoned in the Andes without adequate food or clothing in a temperature of 20 degrees below zero. An Argentine patrol found them and took them to their barracks, giving them help and food, as was to be expected. We do not know what happened to the other two, who were arrested. Anything could have happened to them.\n259.\tA Cuban merchant vessel, the Playa Larga, was also treacherously shelled and bombed in international waters. The captain decided to leave Valparaiso since he lacked\nsafeguards for his ship and its crew. One of the crew members had been arrested and ill-treated on land by the mutinous Fascists. The Playa Larga was followed and shelled by the destroyer, the Blanco Encalada, and bombed by planes and helicopters. It was so seriously damaged that it was about to sink. Called upon a number of times to surrender and return to Valparaiso, the answer of the captain and the crew was that they preferred to scuttle the ship rather than hand themselves over to the Fascist authorities. I The Playa Larga was finally able to escape the criminal persecution and set sail for El Callao, where it arrived escorted by the Cuban merchant vessel Marble Island, which, for the same reasons, did not continue its trip to Chile. This gross violation of freedom of navigation and international law is already also before the Security Council. \n260.\tThe unscrupulous support of North American imperialism to the Fascist junta is brought out even more by its cynical complicity in the harassment and provocations against Cuban merchant vessels beyond Chilean frontiers. When preparing to cross the Panama Canal on its way to Havana, the merchant vessel Marble Island, flying under the Somali flag but under charter to the Mambisa Steamship Company, presented a request to pass through the Canal. The captain and crew were Cubans and they were told that the official in charge of the Canal had been told to arrest the ship because of an action in rem by a Chilean sugar company which demanded a payment of $4,235,298. This conspiracy on the part of the North American authorities of the Canal and the Chilean enterprise are political reprisals that violate the rights of free navigation through that international waterway. The captain and the crew of the Marble Island rejected the order of arrest, refused to land, raised anchor and left for the Pacific Ocean.\n261.\tA few days ago the Cuban merchant vessel Imias coming from Japan to our country was also arrested in the Canal, in the Gatun Lake area, and is virtually isolated by the North American authorities in connivance with the Fascist junta of Chile.\n262.\tThe arresting of a ship owned by the Cuban State is an illegal act which has grave implications, even for third parties. Violations of the norms of international law which recognize and safeguard the sovereign immunity of ships belonging to States constitute a serious threat to those using the Panama Canal, subject as they are to the same decisions by those who, according to the international regime agreed to, are required to guarantee freedom of navigation, security and neutrality of their waters. The captain and crew of the Imias are ready, in keeping with the heroic traditions of our merchant marine, to resist any attempt to confiscate the ship by force.\n263.\tThe statement by the Panamanian Foreign Office on this situation fraught with serious risks for international peace and security describes the matter very clearly and very precisely.\n264.\tWe denounce before the General Assembly this new act of piracy on the part of North American imperialism and we warn the Assembly that, if the Imias is not freed by\nthose who have seized it, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba will take the necessary measures and steps to do so, both within and outside the United Nations. \n265.\tThe insatiable and bloodthirsty repression unleashed by the Fascist junta can only be compared to that of the Nazis in the occupied countries: summary executions, organized massacres, destruction of settlements, bombing of universities, horrifying tortures, concentration camps, the handing over of Latin American exiles to hangmen, night raids, burning of books, outlawing of political parties, banning of trade unions, the closing down of Parliament, aggression against embassies, attacks on merchant vessels, persecution of foreigners, violations of international law, and a state of siege. In one word: the resurrection of the dark and dreary spirit of the Middle Ages in the middle of the twentieth century.\n266.\tThis interminable escalation of terror sets the conscience of mankind on edge. From all parts of the world, without distinction for political, social or religious ideologies, voices have been raised in horror at this orgy of blood and calling for an end to repression. \\\"Slaughterhouse in Santiago\\\" is the title of an article in Newsweek magazine. But these hardened murderers continue their ghastly tasks, blind and deaf to all human appeals. That was and is fascism.\n267.\tWorld public opinion must be galvanized to call for respect for the life of the political leaders and the men and women of the country held in improvised gaols or confined in inhospitable islands, their heads against the very edge of the bayonets or their chins resting on a gun barrel. Luis Corvaian, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chile, is gaoled and subject to court-martial, accused of alleged crimes of treason against the country, a shameless invention of those who have dishonoured their country, those who have opened their country to all sorts of attacks because of their real treason, crimes and thefts. They have not as yet shot him but they can do so at any moment. Have there not been more than 10,000 shot and massacred there,\n* including the aged, women and children? According to the Washington Post, the CIA \u2014 which participates in this blood-bath \u2014 has assessed at 3,000 the number of those killed in the first days following the coup.\n268.\tThe Chilean people will now have to embark on the long and arduous armed struggle against colonial fascism, but they will find echo and support in the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers who remain loyal to the Chilean people and to their constitutional promises \\\"and pledges. By their own experience the peoples of Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia know what the cost is, as did the countries that were earlier overrun by the Nazis. The Fascists will receive credits, weapons, and advisers from imperialism and its Latin American satellites. I should correct that statement and change the tense and say that they are already receiving them. Considerable North American credit for the purchase of wheat, and the arrival in Santiago of numberless specialists in counter-insurgency, are nothing but the prelude. The CIA with all its resources is, and will be, the centre of repression. But we are convinced that the Chilean people will wage that war until the last consequences are faced. And, at the end, their revolutionary act will bury fascism in its own filth.\n269.\tIn this new epic struggle, the Chilean people will not be fighting alone. They will have the solidarity and support of Cuba and the socialist countries, of the non-aligned nations \u2014 in accordance with the resolution adopted at the Algiers Conference \u2014 and the support of all the revolutionary people and progressive Governments in the world. That solidarity and that support will not fail them.\n270.\tBut, over and above all, the Chilean people can count in that decisive battle, as the Prime Minister of Cuba said, on \\\"the banner, and the immortal person of President Allende. President Allende has given his people the highest example of heroism that can be offered. President Allende has embodied the best of patriotism, of valour, of honour and the combative spirit of the Chilean people\\\".\n271.\tThe Cuban delegation renews its deep faith in the destinies of Chile and for the records of this Assembly we reiterate the last words of the revolutionary panegyric uttered by Comrade Fidel Castro:\n\\\"Eternal glory for Salvador Allende, together with Che, together with Marti, Bolivar, Sucre, San Martin, O'Higgins, Morelos, Hidalgo, Juarez and all the great men who gave their lives for the freedom of our continent. The Chilean people will squash fascism.\\\"\nCountry or death! We shall win!"

        "file_text": "\ufeff145.\tMr. President, I have the honour of beginning this statement by conveying to you the warmest congratulations of my Government and my delegation on the unanimous agreement reached by the General Assembly in electing you to preside over its twenty-eighth session. Your presence at the head of this Assembly as a distinguished citizen of Ecuador and, in addition, a representative of true Latin Americanism, is a full guarantee of the efficient and harmonious development of its work, since we all recognize that you are a person who possesses in the highest degree the qualities of intellect, experience and broad-mindedness that we need. We should also, in order to be fair, associate ourselves with previous speakers who have recognized the meritorious work of Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, in so ably guiding the work of this General Assembly at the last session.\n146.\tI take pleasure in extending an exceedingly warm welcome to the new Member States of the United Nations, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. One of the sponsors of the draft resolution for their admission [A/L.698/Rev.l], as this Assembly knows, was El Salvador, in deference to the spirit of universality which should prevail in this Organization and as a gesture of recognition of the efforts of both Governments to overcome their differences by means of an honourable understanding. Their example is worthy of emulation. My country will always be prepared to support such initiatives which tend to overcome existing problems.\ne\n147.\tWe also wish to extend a welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, with which we shall maintain close relations.\n148.\tThis year some aspects of overriding importance command our attention. Some pertain to the structural nature of the Organization itself and others deal with the problems of exceedingly topical importance because of their impact on the foundations of peaceful coexistence among nations, and we shall try to deal with some of those aspects, emphasizing the views which my Government, as a result of continuing detailed consideration, has formulated on these problems.\n149.\tIn 1972 the minorities succeeded in blocking the intentions of the significant majorities, thus demonstrating that sometimes, more than numbers, the determination with which causes that are being defended are advanced is more important. The proposal for the revision of the United Nations Charter received an honourable burial in resolution 2968 (XXVII), which held over to the twenty- ninth session the consideration of the report that the Secretary-General was to prepare on the communications of Governments that had been received before 1 July 1974 concerning the \\\"desirability\\\" of a revision of the Charter. The productive section of this resolution is the request to the Secretary-General to bring up to date the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs.\n150.\tThe procedure adopted with respect to the revision of the Charter is obviously a dilatory tactic and in harmony with the interests and intentions of those who, because they find themselves very comfortable, do not wish to change one iota of what has been established which, of course, is frankly contrary to the dynamic nature of modern-day realities.\n151.\tNone the less, at the outset of this stage of general statements we have heard raised in this hall the voice of an eminent representative of an influential country authorized to fight for a position which unequivocally implies a modification of the United Nations Charter, in claiming- and we believe that this is intended for the not-too-distant future  \u2014  a change in the composition of the Security Council. While El Salvador, basing itself on the political logic on which this attitude is founded, shares this approach, I should like, following this same logic out to the very end, that the modification should not be limited to a single aspect, the importance of which is self-evident but which of course does not exhaust the series of problems of the Security Council and much less those inherent in the Charter. In accordance with this approach we could offset the spirit of those who consider that it is possible to anticipate that by 1974 new dilatory tactics will be witnessed and that if, finally, the General Assembly takes the appropriate decision, which would be the creation of a special committee with an adequate mandate to consider the revision of the Charter, there will be no dearth of countries that will hesitate to become members of that committee, following the precedent that was set down by the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference. The way marked out can be followed again by other figures in order to avoid any activity which might be a source of irritation. The revision of the Charter would then, as of today, if this prevailing natural pessimism is not overcome, seem to be doomed to failure.\n152.\tIf we postpone the analysis, the alternative would be to examine the establishment of the global action strategy of the United Nations. That involves the spelling out of specific objectives and intermediate goals by stages of achievement of the lofty aims which were adopted in the Charter with their corresponding pace and means of realization. This is to say that it will be appropriate to substitute for the annual improvisation an annual application of stages and goals set down for a certain number of years, and exert every possible effort to ensure that the measures called for in the economic, civic, administrative, social and juridical fields are converted into plans.\n153.\tThis exercise would not be theoretical but practical; it would not be a laborious exposition of ideas but a reasoned and reasonable forecast of possible goals in terms of means and foreseeable time-periods. In this era of projections, the United Nations should, at least over the medium range, set up its own system of forecasts. It is paradoxical that what we hope that the United Nations will do in the next five years cannot be forecast with certainty except by guesswork and premonition, while the United Nations, through its specialized agencies and its own bodies, emphasizes the advantages of planning.\n154.\tTo the question, \\\"What do we expect of the United Nations and what can the United Nations offer with regard to political crises? \\\" it is logical to answer that such matters would not be involved in this exercise because these crises derive from forces, the control of which is beyond the international organizations; but for these contingencies the United Nations should prepare means of action. Thus it is well known that this highest world Organization is lagging in the important area of peace-keeping operations. In respect of many other activities it is possible-and, more than possible, necessary-to bring to bear the experience and the techniques of organization, planning, forecasting and evaluation that the United Nations possesses. And if we follow this course of action which we are recommending, we are sure that it will have its beneficial effects in the similar treatment of the most critical problems that can come before the United Nations for decision when we least expect them to crop up.\n155.\tMoreover, the United Nations must put in order and centralize its human rights activities which at present are widely scattered, and it needs to consider the creation of a council on human rights which would take charge of these matters since, owing to their exceptional importance, they require unified treatment. As the work of the Trusteeship Council diminishes for lack of subject matter, the council on human rights should take its place.\n156.\tWe also consider that the Economic and Social Council should have more well-defined powers so that it can carry out its function of co-ordinating activities of specialized agencies by means of consultation.\n157.\tTurning to another activity, the United Nations relief operations, we have noted that these tend to grow and therefore should have their own structure. Just as we have given thought to an organization for the preservation of the human environment, which is limited in many aspects, particularly in regard to the number of staff members and employees, we should think of a relief unit which would organize international assistance in case of natural disasters. To this end, unfortunately, the historical frequency of natural disasters makes it advisable to establish an organism along the lines that I have sketched out which would have a broader organizational structure than that inherent in the function of mere co-ordinator. Accordingly, within the existing Charter we could, in administrative terms, readjust certain activities as a means of working out the global strategy to which I have already referred.\n158.\tThe United Nations has maintained a consistent policy against discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or nationality. Its work in this respect can be described as positive, because it has helped to strengthen world opinion and to influence national legislation and State policies in order to ensure that every possible vestige of arbitrary discrimination is eliminated. The commissions and committees of the United Nations which are working in this area have shown great energy, which, however, has never been sufficient, inasmuch as discrimination often appears in subtly concealed and stylized forms.\n159.\tDiscrimination, which has deep roots in history, is somewhat similar to the legendary hydra of Lerna, because when you cut off one of its seven heads another one grows. The attitude of vigilance and denunciation is necessary in order to keep this disturbing force in the international and internal social order on the defensive.\n160.\tThe twenty-fifth anniversary of the International Law Commission marks a milestone in the gradual legal organization of the international community. The book entitled The Work of the International Law Commission sums up the activities of this important Commission over its 25 years of existence. My country, through me, wishes to express its deep appreciation of the Commission and its work.\n161.\tIn addition, El Salvador is particularly satisfied because this year one of its most outstanding jurists, Mr. Alfredo Martinez Moreno, was elected a member of the International Law Commission. We wish to offer our thanks to the members of the Commission and their Governments, and on this occasion we should like to restate our intention to contribute in a thoughtful, calm and continuing way to the analysis of the great subjects under discussion in legal circles today. It is relevant to point out here that, among these items, the item on aggression, first discussed by the General Assembly at its fifth session in 1950, was referred to the International Law Commission.\n162.\tThis problem, which is indeed a difficult one, last year gave some indication that it was closer to meeting with the proper treatment than had been the case previously, and we should welcome these remote and uncertain signs of light which will break the monotony of years of repetitive meetings and arguments. But we cannot conceal the concern we feel at the fact that the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression has concentrated its efforts on the definition of direct aggression-which is precisely the type of aggression that tends, relatively, to be less frequent-and has side-stepped the true problem of our times, which is indirect aggression. The United Nations would be rendering very little service to this cause if it were to succeed in defining direct aggression. We can assume as of today that if we could agree on defining direct aggression, we would leave indirect aggression completely untouched, because the great Powers probably would have no interest in a solution to that issue.\n163.\tWith respect to aggression, the direct and indirect elements are interconnected in real political life. The fragmentary treatment of the problem, apart from the fact that it would complicate the finding of solutions, creates ambiguous and mistaken values in the development of international life. In any event, what the small countries fear from the great Powers at this time relates more to indirect aggression than to direct aggression.\n164.\tThe proclamation of a charter of economic rights and duties of States would undoubtedly be a very important step by the United Nations. Among its first concerns the United Nations wished to finalize a document on the rights and duties of States, drafted within the framework of the legal thinking which was then in vogue. In 1947 the General Assembly entrusted this declaration to the International Law Commission, but in 1951 the Assembly decided to postpone the question indefinitely because, purely and simply, the phraseology of resolution 596 (VI) of 7 December 1951 boils down to this and little more.\n165.\tToday the item has cropped up again, but within a more clearly defined scope, in the sense that it deals with economic rights and duties, and this connotation defines the crucial facet of the problem as it occurs at present in international relations. El Salvador wishes to express its deep interest in this item and its desire that a rational agreement which would be fair to all countries should gradually emerge.\n166.\tGATT and UNCTAD are seeking new models and instruments for international trade. The Bretton Woods monetary system is going through an obvious crisis. The gap between the developed and the developing countries is growing; and if the present state of affairs continues, the historical trend will be perpetuated. The monetary devaluations are accentuating the imbalance in the terms of trade. The integration schemes have encountered great barriers   \u2014   many of them mental   \u2014   and we have learnt with shock and disappointment that what works on paper has great operational drawbacks. The division of labour on a world scale encounters indifference on the part of the developed countries which are powerful competitors in all fields of production. The world development panorama continues to be one that is experimental and in the testing stage, and offers scanty results. But we cannot give up the struggle, and one way and then another must be tried, and renewed inventive efforts will have to be made. In our favour we have the fact that the vital characteristic of mankind is struggle, a course on which the contemporary world is embarked, following the magnet of the guiding principles of justice, freedom and respect, combining these in international relations with the principles of co-operation and solidarity.\n167.\tPolitical security, although questionable in respect of its efficiency, has a system, namely, economic security, which the Economic and Social Council began to discuss this year but which is still in the planning stage. International justice is barely an idea which is beginning timidly to make its way in international forums. But it has time in its favour. The future international community will have to be governed by international justice, and the great items of the day, such as security and development, will flow from that great fundamental regulating principle.\n168.\tThe feeling of the interdependence of the economies of all the countries of the world, in the light of the facts, is totally inadequate and must be supplemented by a definite policy which will reverse the dominant trend of such interdependence, according to which the poles of development and the poles of poverty are becoming more concentrated while moving farther away from each other.\n169.\tIt is true that we hear talk about collective economic security, but at the same time we indefinitely postpone the\n^definition of indirect aggression, one of whose clearest manifestations is economic aggression. Collective economic security must, among its fundamental elements, have the principle which prohibits economic aggression, and to this end we will have to know what economic aggression is, either in general terms or through the enumeration of historically documented cases.\n170.\tCollective economic security entails complicated conditions and elements, such as that concerning the sudden dumping of massive quantities of surplus stockpiles of goods; and this depresses prices.\n171.\tAnother vital element of this scheme of security could be the regulation of the exploitation of. the mineral wealth of the sea in order to avoid unfair competition and the economic deterioration of those countries which are producers of minerals on land.\n172.\tThe report of the Secretary-General entitled \\\"Collective economic security: preliminary consideration of the concept, its scope and potential practical implications\\\"13 may serve as a policy of departure for the United Nations to undertake an examination of the important question of collective economic security. To this end, the functions spelled out in the document, such as evaluation of conditions, emergency cases, principles of impartiality and justice, and operational rules, constitute a framework of simple indices for the treatment of this promising field.\n173.\tIn a very short time multinational companies have come to the forefront of the world's attention. Their political adventures have led to a rending of the thick veil which covered their quiet, discreet and efficient economic operations, and at present Governments and international organizations find that almost inadvertently these economic giants of multifaceted political loyalty have grown up in their midst. These multinational companies are a reality of modern life. Their structure and operations, and particularly their administration and decision-making centres, differ from those international businesses through which, for example, the Suez Canal was built. First of all, we should get to know them and dispel the relative mystery that surrounds them, and in due course they could be subject to regulations through laws and conventions in order to reduce their role as competitive giants against States and convert them into genuine tools of international economic co-operation and a means to balance the level of development of those States. Thus, the study of these businesses being made by various United Nations bodies is very important. We trust that the study will offer practical guidelines for Governments, both for their domestic legislation and for international conventions. This is an item the consideration of which should be carried out regardless of the time required and the efforts and resources involved. El Salvador is particularly interested in the information that will result from these studies since, because of its high population density and limited natural resources, it sees in the rationalization of the international division of labour a good prospect of development, and in the multinational companies which respect the rules of the game a vehicle for bringing about that rationalization.\n174.\tWe also have to give thought to the question how the developing countries could use the pattern of multinational companies by creating their own. For example, it would be worth-while exploring multinational coffee-exporting companies. In other words, we would have to sketch out a two-way street with respect to multinational companies. To this end, as a basic element, nothing can replace the importance of a proper knowledge of these companies. The United Nations, which has produced objective, detailed and thorough technical studies, has here another field in which to show its objectivity and its abilities.\n175.\tEl Salvador has supported speedy and effective action by the United Nations in respect to terrorism. Nevertheless, last year we abstained in the vote on the relevant resolution [resolution 3034 (XXVII)] because at that very late hour of the twenty-seventh session, on 18 December 1972, the failure of the resolution would have led to an absolute vacuum and, therefore, resulted in inaction for a year. At least the matter was kept alive and a committee was created  whose mandate is to present recommendations. Those recommendations will serve as the point of departure for the General Assembly to take up this problem with the, calm and determination which are inherent in its high status.\n176.\tAt this session the Assembly is not studying item 94 on terrorism as a means of antagonizing anyone in particular, nor as a concealed recourse to support this or the other party in any particular dispute, nor to detract from anti-colonialist struggles. The Assembly is studying its international aspects, its aspects which concern relations between States, to the extent that it can swell the rampant forces of hate, vengeance, and merciless conflict and, therefore, contribute to a mental climate of tension and even crazy actions and reactions. The Assembly must consider this problem at the political level, but in addition it must judge it also from the moral and humanitarian standpoint. Indeed, this Assembly, although eminently political, cannot and should not remove itself from the basic principles of international morality and humanitarianism.\n177.\tThe Secretary-General proposed the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session  in response to a general clamour. The objectivity which the treatment of this delicate question demands begins with its sponsorship by the Secretary-General. For indeed, the Secretary-General, who is a political functionary, must renounce, in order correctly to discharge his duties, a comfortable passivity and a cold observation of the facts. He is compelled to analyse world problems and to submit relevant proposals to the competent bodies. In this instance his initiative was timely. The Secretary-General, deeply involved in the most burning problems, but in the interest of the defence of general interests, makes proposals and recommendations which deserve respect because of the high post that he holds, the confidence which he enjoys on the part of Governments, and in particular because of the intrinsic merit of such proposals and recommendations.\n178.\tWith regard to terrorism we must distinguish between matters relating to the internal affairs of States and matters of an international character. The United Nations is being asked to promote and organize co-operation against the scourge of terrorism in respect of matters within its competence, or, that is to say, in the aspects, projections and effects that this phenomenon has with respect to international relations. A study of the causes of this social phenomenon is very important, but we cannot wait until that study of the causes is concluded in order to organize preventive and defensive international co-operation. The dispute continues about the causes of crime, but meanwhile there are penal codes. The psychological motivations of aircraft hijackers are being studied, yet nevertheless we have enacted conventions protecting passengers and crews, which have been ratified by many States Members of the United Nations. A study of causes-however important-if transformed into a prerequisite for international action, would put off the treatment of the problem to the Greek Calends. If converted into political logic, this very respectable academic logic would function as a dilatory tactic.\n179.\tWe must point out that the General Assembly, in the aforementioned resolution, did not take any measures to study the causes of terrorism, perhaps because it understood that this is a job that is more appropriate for the specialized agencies, or because it considers such a complicated matter lies beyond its possibilities.\n180.\tA year has passed and the question of the causes, which is still included in the item, has not been touched upon. This must be taken into consideration in dealing with the matter during the current session.\n181.\tTerrorism destroys innocent lives, causes damage which exceeds that which normally belligerents are exposed to, disturbs the normal means of communication, sows distrust and uncertainty and creates an atmosphere of threat and fear which generates a chain of actions and reactions which can explode into a real holocaust because there is no force like fear in inciting men to commit so many irrational acts. The Preamble of the United Nations Charter recalls the essential values which are being trampled under foot by terrorism-namely, fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.\n182.\tIn order to discharge its responsibility in this area, the United Nations must set itself seriously to the preparation of a draft convention on international co-operation to combat terrorism. During the preparation of this draft there will be an opportunity to hear and take duly into consideration the positions of those who, with reason, wish to avoid having this item used as an instrument to infringe, limit or distort certain principles on which the general policy of the United Nations is based. But we must also point out that proper consideration of these principles should not be transformed in an opportunity to expose or distort fundamental human rights such as the right to life, or the dignity and the intrinsic worth of the human person.\n183.\tThe United Nations Charter establishes as the principal purpose of the United Nations the maintenance of international peace and security, and to that end, the taking of effective measures to prevent and eliminate threats to the peace and acts of aggression. In compliance with this very noble objective, the United Nations, on various occasions, has found itself compelled to adopt truly effective collective measures, such as the use of armed force.\n184.\tThe United Nations forces, in raising the noble standard of war for the restoration of peace, have had to act on the plains of Korea, in the deserts of Palestine, and in the fields of the Congo. Without having any contractual obligations on this point, these forces have endeavoured to adhere to the rules of civilized behaviour in time of war.\n185.\tEl Salvador considers that the United Nations  \u2014  not only in order properly to discharge its mission of peace within the framework of juridical principles which are of permanent value, but also to set an example to Member countries that still have not done so-should in its capacity as an unquestioned subject of international law sign the conventions of The Hague and Geneva, in so far as is appropriate, because we cannot conceive how the Organization could exert force in order to preserve peace and halt aggression, have a Military Staff Committee and be able legitimately to use armed force, without at the same time having its armed force, formally and in a binding manner, made subject to this body of legal principles based on humanitarian concepts.\n186.\tAt the present time, war is prohibited under the law. None the less, it is a fact that there continue to be warlike disputes in the world. Hence, there is justification for principles which would make such conflicts less inhumane. The United Nations cannot remain outside the framework of principles which have acquired at the present time a basis which is largely humanitarian in nature.\n187.\tWith the creation and development of international organizations as a means for maintaining peaceful international coexistence and improving in all aspects the conditions of the life of man, it is no longer possible to maintain that only States are the subject of international law; rather, doctrine and custom have come to recognize the entitlement of international organizations to be subject to such law. The diplomatic privileges and immunities of international organizations, the power which some of them, or their subordinate bodies, have to request advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice, their international responsibilities and their capacity  \u2014  which is inherent in their very existence  \u2014  to sign treaties between themselves or with States all bear me out in what I say.\n188.\tOn this basis, El Salvador proposes to the General Assembly that it should study the most appropriate manner of ensuring that, as soon as possible, the United Nations should become a party to the international conventions which seek fair treatment for persons shipwrecked and injured in war, respect for war prisoners, the outlawing of unnecessarily destructive weapons, the safeguarding of the cultural and historical patrimony of a country in times of armed conflict, and the protection of civilians in time of war: in sum, this admirable group of conventions which constitutes the so-called humanitarian law of war.\n189.\tIt is high time that the United Nations should take a position in the vanguard of the observance of such noble principles, and in a short time it should, therefore, offer its unlimited adhesion to, and formal support of, the aforesaid conventions.\n190.\tThe date of the beginning of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is approaching, and we therefore have an opportunity to test the hopes and fear, the agreements and disagreements, the points of concord and conflict with respect to the seas, the last frontier for natural resources. Apart from the sea there remain no resources on a scale available for exploitation, at least in the present state of technology and the foreseeable state of this technology for a number of centuries to come. As the earth's non-renewable resources diminish, because of the increasing consumption day by day, the importance of the sea grows.\n191.\tHow the sea will be exploited in the next few decades and what will be the participation of each Government are questions which have to be answered by the Third Conference. A system of reasonable exploitation, of equitable co-participation, of judicious preservation of the marine environment and of international co-operation must be the subject of a great deal of thought, of wise negotiation and a sense of understanding and co-operation.\nAll of the parties concerned can easily agree on general guidelines, that the discrepancies will prove to be very deep as soon as we consider the ways of putting into effect these broad general guidelines in dealing with specific and concrete subjects. The task of the Third Conference is, to say the least, impressive by the complexity of the subject matter, because of the divergence of interests which will have to be reconciled, and because of the very different economic and geographical circumstances of the participants in the negotiations.\n192.\tThe difficult problems that will have to be solved by the Third Conference do derive not from any particular will of any State, but rather from the coexistence of differing circumstances which give rise to opposing interests. The multifaceted issues which are potentially subject to regulation reflect the interests of more than 130 States which can nevertheless, broadly speaking, be reduced to a few groups: for example, coastal States and land-locked States; States located on the shores of seas whose limits exceed any of the rules under consideration now and States which are so close to each other that the application of these and other rules which have been considered give rise to problems of confrontation and conflict; States with broad continental shelves and States without a continental shelf; States with islands remote from their continental shores and States that are nothing but islands; States whose territorial waters span international straits and States interested in the use of such straits.\n193.\tLand frontiers were established after centuries of fluctuations in which empires rose and fell. The desire for self-determination finds itself hampered by the will to hegemony. The distribution of land, therefore, has evoked a history of rivalries, discord and war, of maps that have been changed hundreds of times. But the distribution of the seas must be accomplished  \u2014  considering the States to be arbitrators - by means of negotiations and conventions, that is to say, within a legal order in the structure of which all States will join freely and voluntarily. And this distribution, furthermore, must be made taking into account the general interest, as well as the special interests represented by States. States will be the principal subjects, but they will not be absolutes or absolutists; rather they will be subjects limited by the presence of other States of equal stature and also by the existence of interests which are those of all inhabitants of the earth. The distribution of the seas should not repeat the distribution of the land according to absolutist concepts of sovereignty; it must rather be based on the decentralized distribution of rights, obligations and responsibilities.\n194.\tSome developing countries have defined their positions in the sense that an equitable distribution of real opportunities in respect of the sea must contain, inter alia, the recognition of a broad zone, not greater than 200 miles, in which the coastal States will have sufficient competence to use these resources as a supplement to their land resources. This national zone is consistent with local and regional arrangements-for example, with integrated maritime zones when geography makes this necessary-and with recognition of the equal rights and interests of the land-locked States, This national zone, which primarily would be economic in content, would have to correspond to reasonable requirements relating to the preservation of\nthe marine environment and the ecological balance, and would be legally and politically compatible with the requirements of international navigation. Moreover, and inasmuch as we never legislate for all eternity, the arrangements to be worked out would be understood to be contingent upon the existence of the present circumstances obtaining in the international community. And, of course, to the extent that the economic and technological gaps between the developed and the under-developed countries would diminish-although this might still be a distant prospect  \u2014  it would become necessary to revise the rules adopted, and, possibly to devise another regime of the seas.\n195.\tMy Government is and has been particularly concerned by the periodic carrying out of nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean-both by the fact in itself and by the effects of such tearing on the natural environment. El Salvador joins with those States which have raised a loud protest at the repetition of these tests, and trusts that they will not be repeated in future.\n196.\tTo conclude, I should like to refer to a matter which is in the forefront of the concerns of our people and Government, and that is the progress of direct negotiations between El Salvador and Honduras.\n197.\tOn such an important question I can state that the present status of these negotiations is highly promising; since 15 September the negotiators of both countries have been meeting in Mexico, a country which generously, and doing honour to its traditions as a Pan-American nation, has been offering its good offices for a peaceful settlement ever since the inception of the conflict.\n198.\tMoreover, the concern and the interest which have been expressed consistently on this question by other\n19\nbrother countries of Central America have undoubtedly been decidedly favourable factors in the attainment of the present state of the negotiations. As the culminating factor I should like to point to the recent meeting of the Presidents of Honduras and El Salvador fostered by the gesture made in the truest Central American spirit by the President of Guatemala, General Carlos Arana Osorio.\n199.\tThe present conversations are being carried out in an atmosphere of great cordiality and with a sense of practical consideration, which leads us to trust that the results will be good.\n200.\tEl Salvador, at this time when a just and fair settlement of the dispute with the Republic of Honduras looms on the horizon, reaffirms in this highest world forum its spirit of true Central Americanism, based on human rapprochement and the collective will to rebuild our common nationality.\n201.\tThe problems of Central America are not of course only a question of improving a market or defining a frontier. On the contrary, to magnify this matter which is conducive to division would detract energy from the effort at a true and deeper integration. We cannot and must not avoid the concrete realities which circumstances impose on us, but it is counter-productive to convert them into essential factors for the historic future of the region.\n202.\tMy Government wishes to repeat that it will exert all of its goodwill and determination to find a final, realistic and worthy solution of this dispute which goes to the very roots of the development of Central American life."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.\n5.\tIt is indeed a pleasure and privilege to express to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of Saudi Arabia, my whole-hearted congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As you hail from Latin America, I cannot but refer with pride to the kinship between the Arabs and the people of Latin America on account of the common culture that flourished in Andalusia prior to the discovery of the new world.\n6.\tIt is fitting that I should recall the efficiency and dignity with which your predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski, presided over the last session of the General Assembly.\n7.\tIt also behoves me to pay a tribute to our Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, not only for his dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter, but also for his unremitting efforts to establish direct contacts with many leaders of the States Members of this Organization.\n8.\tNotwithstanding the apparent detente which continues to prevail amongst the super-Powers, the established spheres of influence amongst them in many regions of the world still hamper serious endeavours to find just solutions for major problems besetting this Organization.\n9.\tHis Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz has repeatedly declared since 1947, when the partition of Palestine was wantonly effected at Lake Success, that no peace without justice could be secured in the Middle East.\n10.\tYear after year we have, with other Arab and Moslem leaders throughout the world, made abundantly clear our position that so long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not restored and so long as the Holy Places in Jerusalem, sacred to Moslems and Christians alike, are usurped by the Zionists, turmoil in our region may inadvertently trigger a world conflict.\n11.\tZionism has insidiously permeated the socio-political systems of all the countries where it has been allowed to thrive. Furthermore, Zionism has brought pressure to bear on certain Powers to open the gates of immigration for the ingathering of as many Jews as it has been able to indoctrinate by deluding them into believing that Palestine was their ancient homeland. All this is happening to the detriment of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people and renders this problem more insoluble than ever. It is a well-known fact that the Zionists control and manipulate the mass media of information in many countries of the world.\n12.\tIt seems that the establishment of Israel in the heart of the Arab world was for the purpose of serving the interests of the major Powers, regardless of the fact that those Powers, by establishing that State, flouted the principle of self-determination which is enshrined in the Charter. We would like to ask the major Powers which claim to have vital interests in our region whether they are so afraid of subversive Zionists in their respective countries that they do not dare to influence the leaders of that artificial State they created to come to reason and recognize that they are playing with fire which may set the whole world aflame. Do not the major Powers which claim to have multifarious interests in the Middle East understand that the people of the whole Arab world are in political ferment, the cumulative effect of which may one day push them to the point of no return, where common interests might be swept away by the winds of regrettable hatred and a desire to revenge the tragedy that has been perpetrated on them at large? Or is it that the leaders of major and smaller States have learned hardly anything from the mistakes of the past, such as those that were committed at the Versailles Conference after the First World War?\n13.\tIt is high time that wisdom should prevail, lest dangerous situations in various parts of the world, and especially in the Middle East, further deteriorate, beyond repair. Therefore, we should not be carried away by what might be called the euphoria of detente among the major Powers so long as those Powers continue to play their antiquated game with the destiny of oppressed peoples, whether they are to be found in Asia, Africa or other parts of the world.\n14.\tWe decry racial discrimination no less than we do the colonial oppression of peoples.\n15.\tDeveloping countries cannot thrive so long as the spectre of fear forces them to spend huge sums on armaments and thereby enrich the merchants of death who manufacture their lethal wares in the highly industrialized countries. Even the industrialized countries themselves are becoming insolvent by squandering a large portion of their revenues on the instruments of war. How paradoxical it is that these highly industrialized countries claim that they are the world leaders of civilization and the promoters of a better way of life while their leaders spend the substance of the taxpayer on lethal weapons that could, by miscalculation, bring an end to the human species on this planet.\n16. Hence, it becomes understandable why rampant inflation has spread like an epidemic in most parts of the world. These major Powers, and those who ape them, are spending astronomical sums, well beyond their means, on diabolical weapons in the name of self-defence, which quite often is a camouflage for waging wars to serve spurious national interests.\n17.\tWe are indeed at the cross-ways of either opting for the establishment of justice as defined in our Charter or' surrendering to despair which, inevitably, will push all of us into the chasm of destruction.\n18.\tLast but not least, I would be remiss were I to keep silent about the policy of my Government regarding the question of energy, especially since much of what has been disseminated about this question in the international press and other mass media of information has quite often distorted the truth. In spite of the fact that the question of energy is within the scope of our domestic jurisdiction, nevertheless it would be appropriate to state that His Majesty King Faisal has defined the guidelines which shape the policy of Saudi Arabia concerning oil production. His Majesty's last declaration on this subject is self-evident and constitutes our policy. I hardly need repeat what His Majesty made clear pertaining to the question of oil, as all he actually said has already been quoted by the various mass media of information.\n19.\tFinally, I pray God to inspire all of us to do what is just so that true peace may prevail in this troubled world."

        "file_text": "\ufeff42.\t On behalf of my Government I have the great pleasure to extend to the President my sincere congratulations on his election to the office of the President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I welcome him as an eminent representative of  Latin America. I am confident that under his leadership the Assembly will fulfil its task efficiently.\n43.\tFor a long time it has been evident that the situation in the Middle East has been serious and explosive. Once again arms have been resorted to as a means for achieving a solution. The situation in that part of the world is now acute and very dangerous. The outbreak of hostilities may constitute a threat to the international political situation as a whole. I must voice the profound and sincere hope of the Finnish Government that resort to force will be terminated forthwith. It is now the responsibility primarily of the parties concerned and the great Powers to bring about, through peaceful means, a solution based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). In this search for a peaceful solution my Government gives its full support to the efforts and good offices of the United Nations, the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. We believe that this is the only way to secure lasting peace in the area. It is also the way to secure and consolidate the general trend of international detente.\n44.\tFor some years we have in fact witnessed a positive trend, a detente in the international situation. My Government sees detente not as an end in itself but as a means further to improve relations between independent and sovereign States Members of this Organization. A positive development in the relations between the major Powers is a necessary pre-condition for the improvement of the over-all international situation. But genuine detente, in our view, is possible only if the interests of the medium and small size countries, which form the majority of the voice of the United Nations, are also duly taken into account. This Organization is a forum where the interests of the great, medium and small Powers alike can be harmonized. By giving their full support to the United Nations Member States serve not only the interests of the world Organization but ultimately also those of their own.\n45.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l], the Secretary-General has stated that Member States should make a realistic judgement of the Organization's potential and decide on contemporary and imaginative ways in which it can be used to meet the problems it faces. The time is, indeed, ripe to try to translate detente into concrete action in the political as well as in the economic^ and social activities of the United Nations. As a small country pursuing a neutral foreign policy and fully committed to the Charter, Finland supports this approach. In our view the membership should now undertake concerted self-searching to further improve the capacity of this Organization to fulfil its primary functions.\n46.\tThis year we welcome here three new Members, among them both German States. Finland has consistently advocated the application of the principle of universality. The accession of both German States to the United Nations is of vital importance in this respect. In pursuing reconciliation with each other and in committing themselves to the principles of the Charter the two German States have given fresh impetus to our work for peace and security.\n47.\tThe accession of the German States to the United Nations became possible thanks to detente and its impact on developments in Europe. We must guide these developments further towards decreasing political tensions and fear. We must work towards increasing co-operation and mutual confidence on the basis of equality and the right to self-determination. Thus we must also show willingness and make determined efforts towards compromise and conciliation.\n48.\tThe Finnish Government is happy to note that its initiatives, especially the multilateral preparatory talks in Helsinki for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, have helped to set in motion extensive negotiations covering many sectors. The multiplicity of fields and the working methods applied* which underline the equal rights of all participants, give the Conference depth and strength. They will ensure that detente will not only affect the actions of Governments but will also enrich the lives of individuals. At the same time co-operation in the economic and humanitarian fields will reduce causes for political tension.\n49.\tThe serious commitment of the parties concerned show the existence of a political will to achieve concrete results. Finland expects that the Conference as a part \u2014 as an important part \u2014 of international and European cooperation will lead to a situation where agreed principles guiding international co-operation and their equal application can be made more effective. We consider the idea of elaborating a method for the peaceful settlement of disputes to be of great importance. We support measures to strengthen confidence and to increase stability. The bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament in Europe \u2014 the objectives of which are close to those of the Conference on Security and Co-operation \u2014 constitute essential elements in the broader process towards peace and stability on the continent. It is natural, therefore, that these negotiations are also followed with great interest by countries not directly connected with them.\n50.\tThe Finnish Government holds the view that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations must also be the main guide-line in the efforts to achieve the objectives of the European Conference. The Conference is not directed against any non-participating State or continent. Europe may now see the beginning of a new era of security and co-operation, but we in Europe cannot afford isolation \u2014 to withdraw into a citadel of peace and plenty \u2014  while the greater part of mankind still suffers from underdevelopment and over-population.\n51.\tMy Government had hoped that the prevailing international situation would have created favourable conditions for new measures in the field of disarmament. We welcome the recent accord between the Soviet Union and the United States to conclude an early agreement on further limitations of strategic weapons,  including qualitative restrictions. But, to our regret, there has been no real progress in completing the treaties on a prohibition of chemical weapons or a comprehensive test ban. I sincerely hope that the remaining difficulties can be surpassed so that these treaties can be finalized in the near future. A World Disarmament Conference, if well prepared and if all nuclear Powers participate, would permit a universalization of the discussion on the subject. From such a Conference new impetus and new ideas could emerge to the benefit of us all.\n52.\tMy Government has been encouraged by the fact that the method of dialogue and negotiation has successfully been employed in several areas of unrest and tension. We have welcomed the peace agreement on Viet-Nam and hope that an early political settlement can be reached in the whole area of Indo-China. We also welcome the agreement on humanitarian problems concluded between India and Pakistan at Delhi on 28 August 1973. It is our hope that the positive development in the Korean peninsula can continue and that the dialogue between the Korean States can advance.\n53.\tThe Government and the people of Finland have been deeply shocked over the recent developments in Chile. In addition to profound disappointment and sorrow caused by the violent elimination of a legally elected President, we in Finland are seriously concerned at the future of peaceful democratic progress not only in that country but also in a wider context. My Government joins in the appeals of world public opinion addressed to the present regime in Chile that violence should cease. The Government of Finland hopes that a democratic system will be restored in Chile as soon as possible.\n54.\tSome of our most serious problems are in southern Africa. Finland has consistently advocated that the African peoples should be given the right to self-determination in accordance with the Charter. We reject and condemn the policy of apartheid practised by the Government in South Africa. As the sanctions against the illegal Rhodesian regime have not been successful, we support the efforts of the sanctions committee of the Security Council  to work out realistic measures through which the sanctions could be made fully effective. We firmly urge Portugal to abandon her colonial policy so that the peoples in the territories concerned may be granted their inalienable right to self- determination.\n55.\tOn the question of the law of the sea, we consider it important that the international area of the sea-bed should be exploited for the common good. Furthermore, it is our opinion that in the field of fisheries certain privileges should be given to those coastal States, such as Iceland, whose economy is overwhelmingly dependent on fishing.\n56.\tInternational co-operation in the economic, social and human rights fields has reached a scale and intensity unforeseen when our Organization was established. Over the years new problems have emerged, bringing with them the necessity to create corresponding institutions. This development has not always taken place under a systematic or co-ordinated plan. As a result we have today a very complex network of organizations and institutions, without a clearly defined division of responsibilities and work. This does indeed necessitate a reassessment by the membership of how the capacity and potential of the Organization can best be used to meet present and future needs. My delegation believes that the invitation of the Secretary-General for such a reassessment is timely.\n57.\tThis becomes all the more urgent today as the world community is embarking on new ventures of global importance. The new round of multilateral trade negotiations, the reform of the international monetary system, our determination to fight against the threats to our environment, the necessity to achieve a minimum of world food security and the World Population Year prove that the United Nations system is well aware of the challenge and of its own responsibilities. But these problems must be dealt with comprehensively and in an integrated manner.\n58.\tOur ultimate objective under the International Development Strategy of the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] must be to improve the condition of man, of the individual. The implementation of the Strategy is at present under review. One cannot but agree that there is cause for frustration and criticism; but there is still time for determined efforts to bring the Decade to a successful conclusion. The responsibility for mobilizing, guiding and co-ordinating action towards that end rests, inside the United Nations system, with the Economic and Social Council. The Council has recently shown an increasing awareness of this responsibility. My Government will continue to give the Council its full support in that task.\n59.\tThe responsibility for achieving the goals and objectives of the Strategy lies, however, ultimately with the Member States themselves, developing and developed alike. Although the impact of the contribution of a relatively small country cannot be decisive, Finland also has its share of this global challenge. Thus my Government in submitting its budget proposals for next year, has included appropriations for international development assistance which represent an increase of 36 per cent as compared to 1973. In this connexion I can announce that my Government is ready to participate with an increasing share in the replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association decided upon only a few days ago at the Joint Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Nairobi.\n60.\tA prerequisite for the attainment of the basic goal of the Strategy \u2014 the improvement of the conditions of man \u2014  is that no one should be excluded from the benefits of the development process on any discriminatory grounds, be they of race or of religion, or on any other grounds. It is therefore deplorable that today, 25 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one still has to reaffirm from this rostrum the necessity of eliminating racism and racial discrimination. The Continued existence of systematically exercised racial discrimination in southern Africa and other tragic events in that part of the continent unfortunately prove that we are still far away from the goals of the Charter. My delegation will therefore fully support the launching at this session of the international Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination."

        "file_text": "\ufeff78.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and the people of Peru, may I express my cordial congratulations to you on the fitting choice this great Assembly has made in electing you to preside over its twenty-eighth session. This election is a well-earned recognition of your outstanding qualifications as a diplomat and your brilliant career as a jurist and an internationalist. For Ecuador, a country with which we are very closely linked by fraternal ties of friendship, it is a just tribute with which all Latin America can identify. We are sure that with your abilities you will preside over this session of the Assembly with the necessary skill, capacity and firmness and that this will be a further success in your triumphant diplomatic career.\n79.\tMay I also express my friendly greetings to Mr. Stanistaw Trepczyriski, whose efficient handling of the last session confirmed the qualities that we all recognized in him and whom my Government had the pleasure of receiving in Peru.\n80.\tI should also like to offer my sincere appreciation to our illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his effective and devoted efforts to bring about a full application of the principles and tenets of the Charter to the relations among our countries.\n81.\t1 should also like to express our greetings to the new States Members of the United Nations \u2014 the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Bahamas. The participation of these new Members will certainly be a valuable contribution to our endeavours to achieve fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter and a manifest expression of the universality of the Organization.\n82.\tThe process of relaxation of tension encouraged by the great Powers has proceeded apace, reducing the risk of a nuclear confrontation. There are signs of improvement in the world situation. The Viet-Nam agreements, the International Conference on Viet Nam, held in Paris, the initial approaches between the two Koreas concerning reunification, the agreements between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the admission to membership in the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic are so many proofs.\n83.\tThe East-West rapprochement taking place at present stands as a solution to the problems inherited from the Second World War, although basically limited to the developed areas of the world and the result of strategies of nuclear deterrence between the two greatest rival Powers.\n84.\tHowever, the security and peace yearned for by two thirds of mankind \u2014 that is, the countries of the third world \u2014 is not included in the blueprint for detente, for aggression and intervention are still sources of permanent danger that thwart the liberation of peoples struggling for their freedom.\n85.\tThe Paris agreements are not being fully complied with in the countries of the Indo-Chinese peninsula, for foreign interference still continues and self-determination of the peoples is ignored. There is no reason to be encouraged about a solution to the Middle East question. The impasse persists without withdrawal from the occupied territories, respect for the existence and sovereignty of all the States of the region or recognition of the rights of the Palestine people. In sum, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is not being carried out, nor is there determined support for the important efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n86.\tThe rivalry among the great Powers in the Mediterranean continues, and this aggravates the already existing situation in the Middle East. Tensions flowing from power politics create insecurity in the Persian Gulf.\n87.\tTension in the Caribbean countries continues; the persistence in keeping Cuba semi-isolated shows that. In the same region an anachronistic neo-colonial mentality stands in the way of the effective exercise by Panama of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entirety of its territory.\n88.\tIn Africa, cruel and retrograde colonial wars and repressive policies of racial discrimination and apartheid continue to cause suffering to the peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.\n89.\tIn the South Pacific, the pronouncements of international public opinion and justice are overlooked and atmospheric thermonuclear tests continue.\n90.\tOne of the principal tasks of the Organization should be to strive to extend the present detente to all regions of the world, thus eliminating the sources of stress that I have listed. Regions like the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf must be constantly kept under surveillance by the United Nations so as to ensure in them respect for national independence, the renunciation of the use of force, the dismantling of military bases, the prohibition of nuclear tests and the development of peaceful co-operation in general. It will thus be possible to establish international security that will encompass all areas of the world and be equally applicable to all countries, both of the prosperous zones and of the third world.\n91.\tThe impoverishment of the populations of the regions outside the main centres of world power is increasing at an accelerating rate, and with it there emerge new forms of domination and dependency in economic, political and technological fields.\n92.\tBut within this general scene the absence of a nuclear conflict between the great Powers does not spell security for the third world. In the underdeveloped areas uncertainty and social unrest are rife, appearing in new shapes and forms. Security for the third world lies in an over-all and self- sustaining development, the basic liberating instrument for peace. It is for that reason that both here and elsewhere we have stressed the concept that security must be completed in a new and significant dimension that will define the reality of the developing countries. I refer to what I have already mentioned, that is, that in our revolutionary experience security and development have been shown to be aspects of the same reality, and for that reason security cannot be described only as the absence of warlike conflict.\n93.\tBy the same token, it is appropriate to recall that of the 55 conflicts that have broken out since the founding of the United Nations and of the 255 subversive movements that have shaken world peace, 95 per cent have had their roots in the third world, as the lamentable result of the imperialist policies and neo-colonial pressures on our countries. For this reason, any peace that overlooks that majority of mankind, any peace that ignores the liberation of the people of the third world, any peace that is merely the absence of hostilities among the great Powers is a precarious, unreal, unjust peace. It does not spell security or stability for us, much less justice for our development. It is peace in opulence \u2014 which is not that of the third world.\n94.\tSecurity among the States Members of the United Nations must also include the concept of an economic security that will guarantee the right of the majority of mankind to a comprehensive development and prevent threats of economic coercion or pressures of any sort.\n95.\tCollective economic security in international relations would imply the renunciation of the use of economic force and unilateral power politics and assure respect for the overall development of States. Collective economic security would also imply a commitment to take \\\"collective action\\\" to repel measures of economic force tending to oppress the sovereignty of States, and also united action to help meet emergency situations that cannot be resolved by the internal effort of a developing country, in order to provide the necessary assistance.\n96.\tThe Security Council meeting in Panama in March this year was proof of a qualitative change of approach regarding the use of force in international relations. The Security Council considered that in Latin America there did exist threats to international peace and security, not only due to armed aggression but also to structural situations of dependency, domination and colonialism. Resolution 330 (1973), adopted by the Council at that meeting, is a significant step in the repudiation of the use of force.\n97.\tWe believe that resolution is a great contribution by the developing countries to the strengthening of the United Nations as a mechanism for safeguarding the development of the countries of the third world. Without doubt it will also serve as the foundation for the system of collective economic security under study that must urgently be set up, and for this reason it is imperative to accelerate the studies being done by the United Nations.\n98.\tAware of the changes taking place in the world today and of the situations arising from the constant emergence of new States, Peru joins those who contend that the Security Council, as constituted at present, is not representative of the aspirations of peoples. The present composition of the Security Council, in which a small minority of Powers wields the veto, is a situation that must be altered, since within the organ itself it allows the play of power politics by the great Powers.\n99.\tThe right of veto was intended to meet a political reality arising from the Second World War. For this reason we should weigh the need to devise a formula to avoid the paralysis of the Council in the exercise of its high functions due to an abuse of powers which in themselves violate the political and juridical equality of States and gainsay the true democratization of international relations. A first step might be to apply the provisions of the Charter itself which provide that the States parties to a dispute shall not vote. Likewise, as some have stated, the General. Assembly should be empowered to reject a veto cast by a single State against the votes of all the other members of the Security Council, who do in fact represent the international community.\n100.\tPeru considers that a further indispensable step for strengthening international peace and security is the convening by the United Nations of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States.\n101.\tThe objective of such a conference would be first to achieve a qualitative disarmament, that is, the suspension of all nuclear tests in all environments to forestall any improvement in such weapons. Secondly, the conference would go on to quantitative disarmament through the elimination of existing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.\n102.\tDespite the pronouncements of the General Assembly, of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment,  of the International Court of Justice and of the coastal States of the South Pacific, atmospheric tests on the atoll of Mururoa continue.\n103.\tThe Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru is aware of its moral authority to oppose such tests and considers that the United Nations should take up the request of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held this month at Algiers, that an end be put to the atmospheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific.\n104.\tWe also consider it imperative that the United Nations strengthen the effectiveness of the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, so that it may be able to complete its work with the assistance of, and benefiting from the experience of, all peace-loving countries and provide information, as objective as possible, requested by the countries affected by nuclear explosions. The Committee can no longer continue to depend on information supplied by nuclear States, when it is very often unable to detect the explosions and the magnitude of the radiation.\n105.\tTrue to the principles and purposes of the Charter, and in keeping with the evolution of the international situation, Peru considers it its duty to reinforce and universalize peace and security through effective and realistic inter-American co-operation reflecting the process of detente among the great Powers.\n106.\tIn the American region, the Organization of American States [OAS] has supplied the purely formal framework for political, ideological, economic and cultural institutions of intracontinental co-operation and solidarity. Although its charter  prescribes the principles and norms for international conduct in the hemisphere, we cannot overlook the fact that behind these stand countries possessing differing economic and social structures and at different stages of development. On the one hand, there is a world super-Power with its opulent and expanding market economy, and on the other, developing countries with disjointed, economically dependent societies.\n107.\tFrom the very outset the basic standards of inter- American relations were warped because of the hegemony of the United States over the countries of Latin America. The creation of inter-American organs and institutions, such as the Interamerican Development Bank, though they are apparently multilateral, in no way changed this structural flaw in our relations. Thus, a lopsided and imperfect system has grown up based on domestic and foreign domination and within the context of the defence of spheres of influence of the cold war.\n108.\tRecent developments in Latin America attest to the emergence of growing community awareness, the result of common and parallel histories, of shared conditioning from the outside and a common destiny which we now begin to see clearly. The restructuring of the inter-American system now taking place is a clear proof of the degree of awareness and compromise that our countries have achieved along these lines. It also anticipates the new profile we seek for our continent. The Revolutionary Government of Peru, together with other nations, called for the convening of a special commission for the restructuring of the inter- American system; that was an act which we believe clearly shows our dedication to a true America and for the effective application of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in our region.\n109.\tThe work being done by that special commission in Lima and Washington should lead to the outlining of a restructuring that we trust will permit a true adaptation to the new inter-American reality. It could then become a regional system that would effectively serve the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\n110.\tIn one word, we want an end in Latin America to all forms of imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. We want a Latin America united on the strength of a genuine development with justice for its peoples, and, finally, the promotion of Latin America to the forefront of the international dialogue as full-fledged spokesmen and free actors in our own destiny.\n111.\tThe contribution of the third world to world peace is an objective reality primarily confirmed throught the non- aligned movement. The evolution of international relations has only gone to prove the certainty and permanence of the objectives of the policy of non-alignment.\n112.\tThe growth of the progressive forces of peace, independence and the progress of mankind is proved by the fact that more than half of the States members of the international community were represented at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Algiers. Once again non- alignment showed its dynamism and pluralist vitality with the presence of Latin American countries in an evolving world, thus reaffirming their stand against all types of imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism.\n113.\tFor the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru, its foreign policy of non-alignment is a correlative of the profound commitment of the Peruvian revolution to insuring the participation of our people in both the process and the benefits of development through a society in keeping with our national realities. Thus, we have devised a coherent ideo-politica! formulation that impresses its independent and autonomous personality on our revolution. The goal of our revolution is to transform the economic, social and political system of our country. To do so our revolution draws its inspiration from the richest currents of humanism and socialism, which by nature are imbued with the concept of liberty and therefore imply a clear stand on dogmatism and totalitarianism. In practical terms our objective is to establish in Peru a pluralistic economy with full participation for all.\n114.\tI should like to recall a paragraph from the message by the President of Peru, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, on the one hundred fifty-second anniversary of national independence:\n\\\"The achievement of the great ideal of full participation, the very essence of the revolutionary humanism which we advocate, presupposes the gradual but definitive abandonment of manipulative behaviour and intermediary machinery that in the past deprived our citizens of the right to share in and decide upon all aspects of social life. It also calls for the equally gradual but also definitive break with paternalistic and authoritarian conduct that illegally presupposes a position of inferiority for those who are humble and poor. All this is in order to safeguard and defend the basic concept of dignity and the pre-eminence of man as a specific social being and as the forger of history and life.\\\"\n115.\tWe are witnessing a qualitative shift in history; the contradictions of the opulent societies of the industrialized States have become obvious. The enormous concentration of capital, the disorderly use of technology, the greed for power and endless wealth are all producing dire situations which are manifested in the energy crisis, raw materials and the dehumanizing conditions of life. At the same time we are witnessing a growing inflation in the developed economies.\n116.\tThe countries of the third world are confronting immensely important political possibilities. It is within our grasp to achieve our total liberation and it is up to our political will to turn weakness into strength with our unity. Replacement of the strategy of claims by one of uniting for negotiation is a legitimate way to defend our national resources.\n117.\tThe non-aligned nations, and Peru among them, consider recovery and full exercise of permanent sovereignty over natural resources and control of the basic economic activities of those resources to be some of the immediate steps to be taken. The right of the developing nations to nationalize their natural wealth and to adapt the payment of compensation for them to their own domestic systems has been supported by the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries meeting in Algiers.\n118.\tFurthermore, exploitation and direct merchandising, as well as support for and creation of associations of raw material-producing countries, are very effective meats for strengthening our negotiating power and obtaining mutually advantageous international trade both for the producers and for the consumers. That will also strengthen our development. In this respect, the non-aligned nations have agreed to the convening in the near future of a conference of developing nations to co-ordinate a global strategy on raw materials in the light of the critical situation that could activate irrational exploitation of our resources and unjust price policies.\n119.\tTwo agreements which are examples of the increasing solidarity among the non-aligned nations and which allow of a certain optimism regarding the future of our countries are to favour the creation of a fund for development and solidarity among the non-aligned nations, to promote financial and technical co-operation among them; and the establishment of a system of consultations and emergency measures within the group for mutual assistance in cases of aggression in economic relations, such as pressures, coercion, economic blockade, the freezing of credit and any direct or indirect measures aimed at limiting the sovereignty of States and curtailing the right of all countries to their own autonomous development.\n120.\tThe controversy over the law of the sea has finally been understood as one of the basic chapters of the struggle against underdevelopment and against the hegemony of certain Powers that would confine the sovereignty and jurisdiction of other States to narrow limits while remaining free themselves to exploit the natural resources of distant seas.\n121.\tThe Algiers Conference saw more than 60 Heads of State or Government support the 200-mile limit without prejudice to the freedom of navigation or to the regime of the continental shelf. They also supported the notion of regional solutions, the elimination of threats to the security and sovereignty of States and the establishment of an international authority empowered to undertake the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction as the common heritage of mankind.\n122.\tFor 26 years Peru has defended its maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction over the 200-mile limit, and therefore we are gratified by this support, which reaffirms the reasons and validity of a cause once deemed unrealistic and rash, and allows us to foresee, as set forth at Algiers, \\\"the establishment of a new regime governing ocean space which is based on the principles of justice, security, peaceful coexistence, development and well-being for all peoples.\\\"1\\\"\n123.\tWe trust that this new order will be established and that there will be an end to the obstinacy and shortsightedness of those who would extend to the sea the very imperialism we are fighting. Be that as it may, Peru will maintain its resolve to preserve its maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction with the unshakable and unyielding will of one who knows that he defends his own independence and destiny as a nation.\n124.\tCo-ordination, co-operation and solidarity among the developing countries are characteristics of the present international situation, but together with this laudable effort on the part of the countries of the third world external conditions must also be created propitious to self-sustaining and independent development.\n125.\tI cannot fail to mention the concern of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru over the steadily deteriorating economic conditions of the developing countries caused by policies foreign to their own efforts. Interference in the sovereignty of States multiplies;\nneo-colonialism in the developing countries and the unfettered activities of transnational corporations continue; trade and monetary agreements among the developed countries tend to diminish the participation of the third world in world trade and to flout the principles of international cooperation.\n126.\tIt therefore becomes imperative for the developed countries to realize that international co-operation for development is one of the basic components of a permanent, universal peace that will permit full security for all States.\n127.\tAccording to United Nations surveys, everything seems to indicate that by 1975 \u2014 that is, just half-way through the Second Development Decade \u2014 the trade and financial deficit of all the developing countries will amount to at least $17 billion. Half this amount, or perhaps more, will be to cover the flow of capital to pay for utilities from foreign private investment and invisible services and the other half to cover the trade deficit caused by the deterioration in terms of trade. We must therefore abandon our role as exporters of capital and importers of inflation.\n128.\tThis circle of domination that characterizes the structure of the economic relations between the third world and the industrialized countries makes it impossible to fulfil the modest objectives of the International Development Strategy. The countries of the third world, with 70 per cent of the world population, subsist on a meagre 30 per cent of world income, and by the end of this decade the average per capita income will be $3,600 for the developed countries and a paltry $265 for the developing countries. Surely we must all agree that the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade is failing thus far. International action is required, as called for by the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in the Action Programme for Economic Cooperation adopted in Algiers in order to convene \\\"a special session of the General Assembly at a high political level devoted exclusively to the problems of development,\\\" including the achievement of the objectives of the International Development Strategy and the revitalization of the organizations of the United Nations system devoted to international co-operation.\n129.\tAmong the efforts of the developing countries to make international co-operation more dynamic, Peru supports the holding of the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in 1975, and we reiterate our offer of the city of Lima as the venue for the Conference.\n130.\tThe present international situation is characterized by the coexistence and convergence of the great Powers and by the multipolarity of the world. But this is the result not only of the bold diplomacy of the powerful nations but of the long historical struggle of new forces and social values emerging in the world of today. These new social forces have challenged the established order and set forth an undeniable need for world coexistence as a basis for ideological pluralism. The development of these progressive forces is manifested mainly in the regions of the third world and is embodied in the unshakable struggle of the peoples of those areas for more just living conditions and for their own autonomous solutions for freeing themselves from domestic and foreign domination. Because of the increase in world poverty and the just struggle against it, the centre of gravity of international relations and conflicts is shifting to the third world, thus giving our people considerable revolutionary weight which is making them new protagonists in contemporary history.\n131.\tThe new historic moment in which we find ourselves calls for a new approach on the part of the developed countries, an approach that must understand that the interrelation between development and underdevelopment required co-operation and solidarity.\n132.\tOnce again Peru reaffirms its faith in the world Organization as the forum most apt to know the problems affecting international peace, security and co-operation and as the appropriate institutional framework for just solutions to disputes occurring among States.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff111.\tThis is the first opportunity that the present Government of Chile has had to state from the highest world rostrum the background and the facts that led the armed forces and police to take control and establish a regime of national restoration and dignity. I shall deal at some length with this subject, although I am aware that one of the fundamental principles of the Charter is that the United Nations shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States. That principle, which also governs bilateral relations among members of the international community is one to which I will refer more especially later.\n112.\tHowever, because of the events that have taken place in Chile, a campaign that is so false, so malevolent, so vicious, so well orchestrated has been launched, with the intention of distorting the facts and the intentions, that I felt it both fitting and proper to refer to those events, even though I firmly contend that no State, and no international organization, has the right to meddle in or judge what has taken place in my homeland.\n113.\tI understand that the events in Chile have not left world public opinion indifferent. Although many countries, in the most varied regions of the world, year after year for different reasons undergo changes in their political and social life, the case of Chile is a very special one, for two reasons.\n114.\tThe first reason is that my country, after more than a century and a half of independence, has stood as an example of civic life and has never tolerated dictatorships, racism or totalitarism and that our eminently apolitical and professional armed forces have been an example to the world. We who wear the uniform are proud of that tradition.\n115.\tThe second is that Chile, having agreed to the establishment by democratic means of a Government imbued with foreign doctrines, loyally collaborated in the search for a socialist direction compatible with our own national reality and our traditions of freedom, justice and dignity; so much so that, at the beginning of the socialist experiment, the political parties unanimously supported the Government, as in the nationalization of the copper industry, and likewise the armed forces, when called upon in moments of grave crisis, accepted upon their shoulders the burden of heavy responsibilities.\n116.\tBut these generous, democratic and selfless attitudes proved futile, since they were able only briefly to contain, and not to stop, the disastrous course along which the Unidad Popular, in its eagerness to consolidate a tyrannical power, was forcing the country. Chile, alone, without the help or inspiration of any, its patience exhausted and drawing on the courage, drive and inner resources that are a feature of our people, was able to react and put an end to a totalitarian system that has subjugated so many countries of the world, before it was too late.\n117.\tI shall refer to what happened in my country three years ago. In September 1970 Chile was confronted with a procedure that was normal in our history of democracy: a presidential election was to be held. On 4 September the candidate representing the Unitad Popular won 36.2 per cent of the popular vote in a free, democratic election, precisely in keeping with the historic traditions of Chile.\n118.\tThis triumph was a surprise and upset to the majority of the people, since the ideology professed by the winning candidate made many of my countrymen fear that the country might adopt a course very contrary to the tradition and history of Chile.\n119.\tUnder the political Constitution of the State, the election had to be ratified by the National Congress, since none of the candidates had obtained an absolute majority of the popular vote. The political parties that had supported the Marxist candidate were a minority in the Chilean Congress; consequently, interpreting the national feeling, the majority political parties made the confirmation of the candidate who had obtained a relative majority conditional on solemn respect for the provisions of the Constitution, supplemented by a special Statute of Guarantees.\n120.\tFrom the very dawn of our independent life, Chile has been careful to preserve, both in reality and in our fundamental Constitution, the basic human rights of the individual and respect for the common good. In the case of the Unidad Popular candidate, the majority parties insisted that these guarantees must be more precisely confirmed, even in specific matters, through the supplementary Statute to which I referred earlier. As a result of this requirement on the part of the parliamentary majority, the National Congress unanimously, and with the favourable vote of the candidate himself, approved constitutional reforms intended primarily to reaffirm the independence of the armed forces and respect for their professional function. This stood in the way of the creation of military groups outside the Constitution and the law. The reforms would also reaffirm the freedom of the information media, the political rights of citizens and the gains achieved by the workers in organized labour and\nensure the participation of professionals, technicians, employees and workers in the process of economic development.\n121.\tIt was only after the approval of this Statute of Constitutional Guarantees that the congressional majority, which, I repeat, had opposed the posture of the Unidad Popular candidate, agreed to confer upon him the presidency of Chile.\n122.\tThe Chilean political system is based upon the absolute independence of the public authorities and upon their unlimited mutual respect. The President of the Republic, the National Congress and the courts of justice have rights and powers specifically defined in the political Constitution of the State, which also defines the way in which they shall relate to one another.\n123.\tFurthermore, there must be added the fundamental role played in the Chilean legal system by the Comptroller-General of the Republic, since his decisions and rulings determine the administrative process of the nation.\ne\n124.\tIn other words, when the legitimately elected President took over the highest office in Chile, he swore to respect the independence and authority of the other organs of the State. He committed himself to respect the legality of the Chilean State, the heritage of the people, which over the years has been moulded to reflect the basic consensus enabling them to live together. Any assault on legality is, therefore, not only a destruction of the cultural and moral heritage of the nation, but also a denial of any practical possibility of democratic life.\n125.\tIn a veiled and surreptitious way at first, but quite openly later, the Government entirely ignored the basic principles that I have enunciated here and, what was even more serious, repeatedly violated the constitutional provisions that the National Congress had demanded as a guarantee after the elections of September 1970. The cynicism with which the Government was acting was amply demonstrated when the head of State later made known in a press interview that he had accepted the Statute of Constitutional Guarantees as a tactical necessity to assume power, and that what was most important at that moment was to take over the Government.\n126.\tUnder the tolerant eyes of the Government, the. media of the free press were harassed and, instead of. implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law drawn up by the previous administration, a system of illegal takeovers were established. Authorities arbitrarily took over small, medium-sized and large industries; politicians, villagers, students and representatives of law and order were murdered with impunity. Labour leaders and union representatives who did not support the Government were persecuted and imprisoned, and an attempt was made to impose a totalitarian educational system on all Chilean children.\n127.\tI think a separate mention must be made of the Government's attitude towards armed groups of civilians. It not only permitted them, but openly encouraged them and thus illegally allowed the entry into the country\nof foreign agitators and weapons. By 11 September this year, more than 13,000 known foreigners, most of them extremists, were known to be in the country in an illegal manner. Their sole mission was to set up a parallel army to oppose the regular armed forces. Representatives in the Assembly can well understand what that number of persons could mean to a country with 10 million inhabitants. But the conduct of those foreigners went even further. They took over management positions in the public administration, in illegally sequestered factories and in the direction of the national economy. We saw, with shame, how foreigners became part of Chilean delegations entrusted with the task of negotiating international agreements.\n128.\tTo all this must be added the inability of the Government to draw up an economic plan that would meet our real national needs, and this failure led to a catastrophe from which Chile will not recover for many years. The economic experience of Marxism in our country, because of the damage it has done, will be difficult for my countrymen to forget.\n129.\tLet me cite a few figures to support what I am saying.\n130.\tAccording to the latest official statistics of the Government of the Unidad Popular, agricultural production dropped by 20 per cent last year, industrial production by 9 per cent, and mineral exports, the fundamental mainstay of our economy, by 28 per cent.\n131.\tIn 1970, the total currency in circulation in Chile was 12,114 million escudos. At the end of this year, according to projections, the currency in circulation will be at least 23 times greater.\n132.\tIn 1970, Chile's external debt was $2,630 million. By 31 December 1973, that debt will have reached $3,450 million. And, to make things worse, this increase in foreign indebtedness was due primarily to the import not of capital goods destined to increase production, but of food and other perishables which the Marxist economy had been unable to produce inside the country.\n133.\tIn 1970, Chile's trade balance showed a surplus of $78 million. Thus far this year, it shows a deficit of $438 million; and to this must be added the fact that, under the management of the Unidad Popular Government, the country lost its entire reserves of foreign exchange, which in 1970 had reached $448 million.\n134.\tIn 1972, the deficit in fiscal expenditure amounted to 40 per cent of the total budget. For this year, it is estimated that the deficit will surpass 50 'per cent of total public expenditure.\n135.\tAll these economic facts caused the country to sustain the highest inflation rate in the world: 323 percent over the last 12 months.\n136.\tIn March of this year, under the control of the armed forces, as required by law, normal parliamentary elections took place, although it was later discovered that the registers of voters had been very cleverly altered and tampered with.\n137.\tNevertheless, those elections clearly and precisely confirmed the fact that the Government of the Unidad Popular could count on the support of only a minority in the country. The opposition parties obtained a large majority in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies.\n138.\tEven so, the Government refused to alter its line of conduct and, ignoring the will of the people, formed a bellicose Cabinet that intensified its assaults on the lawful structure of the State. This forced the other public institutions to assume a daily more energetic defence of institutionality in the country.\n139.\tThe Government was careful to demonstrate apparent respect for the judicial branch for the benefit of the outside world. It is true that it took pains not to interfere visibly with the structure itself; but it drew upon all sorts of resources in order to undermine the hard-won prestige of the judiciary as the guardian of civic rights. It had no compunction about carrying out defamatory campaigns; its officers indulged in all sorts of disrespectful acts, and judgements were deprived of all meaning, being disregarded whenever it suited the partisan interests of the Government of the Unidad Popular. Moreover, the authority to grant pardons was abused in the most inconceivable manner and the courts were denied the use of police power to enforce their decisions.\n140.\tTime and again, the Supreme Court entered its protests, but the Government, far from changing its mistaken plan of action, pushed harder and harder, until the Court ultimately, in communication with the President of the Republic, felt obliged to denounce these events as conducive to \\\"a crisis in the legal system about which this Court cannot keep silent\\\". The abuse of the law became worse and worse until, last May, in a note to the head of State, the Supreme Court stated publicly something that was even more serious: namely, that the country was faced with \\\"a peremptory and imminent breakdown of the legal system\\\".\n141.\tAnd yet, the Government continued with its policies, and the head of State even tried to justify them by instigating a public polemic with the Supreme Court, which only succeeded in reinforcing the Court's original position.\n142.\tBut the judiciary was not the only institution that had to try to defend the public interest and to point to the serious misdirection of the Government: the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic was also the object of increasingly inflammatory attacks and repeated slights. The Government abused the instrument of \\\"mandatory decrees\\\", thus implementing a ruling system bypassing Congress; and the President of the Republic even went so far as to ignore the opinion of the Comptroller-General when it came to the promulgation of a constitutional reform approved by the parliament, which the Executive proposed to enact only partially.\n143.\tAfter fighting hard to find a political way to protect the national interest, the parliament itself finally assumed a position comparable to that of the judicial branch and of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. Even the possibility of submitting the Government to a plebiscite had been rejected by the Unidad Popular, thus proving its lack of democratic support even more openly.\n144.\tOn 22 August last, the Chamber of Deputies, which is the controlling branch of Congress, clearly and energetically denounced the Government's headlong path to destruction. By 81 votes to 47, the Chamber adopted a very important resolution, the main points of which I should like to quote.\n145.\tTo begin with, the resolution pointed out that sovereignty is vested essentially in the nation, that the authorities can only exercise powers delegated by the nation, and that a Government, by assuming rights not conferred by the people, is liable to charges of sedition. The resolution went on to declare:\n\\\"It is a fact that the present Government of the Republic, since its inception, has been engaged in the conquest of total power with the obvious intention of subjecting all persons to the strictest State economic and political control in order thus to achieve the installation of a totalitarian system absolutely opposed to the representative democratic system established by the Constitution.\\\"\nAnd, it added:\n\\\"To accomplish this objective, the Government has not violated the law and the Constitution in isolated instances; rather, these violations have become permanent policy, to the extreme of systematically ignoring and encroaching on the power of the other branches of government, continually violating the guarantees that the Constitution assures to every inhabitant of the Republic, and allowing and sheltering the creation of illegitimate parallel powers that constitute a grave danger for the nation, all of which has led to destruction of the basic elements of our institutions and of our government of law.\\\"\n146.\tThe Chamber of Deputies also indicated that the Government had committed inter alia the following violations and abuses:\n\\\"It has usurped the principal function of Congress \u2014  that is, to legislate \u2014 by adopting a series of highly important measures for the economic and social life of the nation, which are indubitably a matter of law, by mandatory decrees abusively issued or by simple administrative rulings based on legal loop-holes. It must be stressed that all this has been done with the deliberate and acknowledged purpose of changing the nation's structures, recognized by the law in force, by the sole will of the executive, with absolute disregard for the will of the legislative branch.\n\\\"It has continually mocked the functions of control of the National Congress by depriving of all real effect the congressional power to dismiss from office cabinet ministers who violate the Constitution or the law or who commit other crimes or abuses specified in the Constitution. And, what is most serious of all, it has done away with the high function of the Congress as the constituent power by refusing to promulgate the constitutional reform covering the three areas of the economy which was approved in strict accord with the rules established by the Constitution.\\\"\n147.\tThe resolution of the Chamber of Deputies did not stop there. It went on to enumerate the Government's principal abuses of the fundamental guarantees and rights afforded by the Constitution and, furthermore, added:\n\\\"In this breakdown of the rule of law, the formation and development of armed groups under government protection is especially serious since, apart from being a danger to the security of individuals and their rights and to the internal peace of the nation, such groups are intended to confront the regular armed forces. It is also especially serious that the police force is kept from performing its most important functions in the face of criminal attacks perpetrated by violent groups supporting the Government. Because of their grave importance, notorious and public attempts to use the armed forces and the police force for partisan purposes cannot be passed over in silence; neither can attempts to break down their institutional hierarchy and politically infiltrate their ranks.\\\"\n148.\tFor the benefit of the Executive, the Chamber of Deputies' resolution closed with a description of the serious breakdown of constitutional and legal order that confronted the Republic and the need immediately to rectify precisely defined situations and facts, the urgency of channelling the actions of the Government in a lawful direction and the need to ensure constitutional order in Chile.\n149.\tAs I have already pointed out, there was a long and patient wait by the citizenry and the other branches of government, which were always ready to facilitate solutions to the situation. As I have mentioned, the armed forces also loyally and professionally collaborated with the Government. Their mission was stretched beyond the limits of their vocation, since a number of times they were required to assume responsibilities with serious political consequences. Thus, in October 1972, confronted by a tenacious civil strike and in order to calm public opinion and guarantee parliamentary elections scheduled for six months later, representatives of the Chilean army, navy and air force assumed cabinet posts. I myself acted as Minister of State at that time and bent every effort loyally and efficiently to fulfil the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic.\n150.\tWe ministers who were members of the armed forces repeatedly tried to convince the head of State of the need to adopt measures that might change the course of the nation. We did achieve some revisions, but everything was erased once our mission of ensuring fair and honest elections had been accomplished and we left our cabinet posts.\n151.\tAfter the elections of March of this year, and in order to comply with our sacred duty to preserve the democratic system, we repeatedly tried to convince those in charge of the country of the extremely dangerous path they were following. We were answered with promises that were always broken and with assurances that bore absolutely no relation to reality. While astute campaigns were organized to prevent a possible civil war. surreptitiously professional agitators, weapons and other highly destructive elements continued to enter the country with the specific purpose of preparing for the bloody coup de grace to our democratic system. I shall not tax the patience of the Assembly by describing the entire background that proves this. The caches of weapons and explosives; clandestine hospitals and blood banks; plans for violence, assassination, sabotage; the division of the armed forces and the organizing of mercenaries and guerrillas \u2014 all showed us that the abyss towards which our country was heading was even deeper than we had discovered when we adopted the historic resolution of 11 September.\n152.\tIt was not only the knowledge of those threatening plans that moved the armed forces and the police force in Chile to take the decision imposed upon them by their oath to protect the homeland.\n153.\tWith the public demoralized by so much abuse and so many threats upon their lives, humiliated by so much illegal and discriminatory rationing, and ruined by a black market directed and organized by government supporters, a strike erupted in one of the great copper mines. It lasted 74 days, and was followed by a civilian uprising of vast proportions. The truckers' union, the professional associations, retailers, large groups of craftsmen, workers and labourers, still not intimidated by foreign slogans, joined to protest with the only weapon they still possessed: the paralysing of the country. And in that historic uprising of the civilian masses, noble and true to their traditions, the long-suffering Chilean women and large groups of young students were in the vanguard.\n154.\tThe situation was becoming extremely dangerous and the Government, incapable of solving any problem and basically oriented towards the seizing of total power through violence, once again resorted to the patriotism of the armed forces and the police force of Chile. Once again those of us in uniform gave generous assistance by assuming cabinet posts. From the vantage-point of our high offices, we were very soon able to confirm the speed with which the country was heading towards total chaos. We noted the deep deterioration of national security. The irritating injustice of a regime that called itself \\\"popular\\\" while its leaders lived in ostentatious luxury, outraging the people who had to form long queues for food, was brought home to us. We could prove, too, the extremely dangerous level of foreign intervention in our affairs, as well as the way in which bands of actual criminals were preparing to administer the final blow to all those who were not already unconditionally enslaved.\n155.\tCrime increased from day to day. One high naval officer, aide-de-camp to the President, was the fatal victim of a nefarious attack; a young army officer was assassinated by a foreign extremist; military intelligence services uncovered criminal acts of subversion within the ranks of the Navy, instigated by important members of the regime, including the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, to which the President himself belonged.\n156.\tOur final effort to participate in the Cabinet of the deposed Government did not successfully prevent the avalanche of events. Civic protest did not cease; the danger of a confrontation between the majority of the unarmed citizens and the strong paramilitary cells organized by Unidad Popular, which had drawn up a plan to assassinate civilian and military authorities and thus assume power completely, made it imperative for the armed forces and the police force to carry out their fundamental obligation and save the integrity of our nation.\n157., On 11 September we acted, guided only by the oath we took many years ago, to defend our country and combine our efforts to preserve Chile as a sovereign nation, prosperous and free. We acted in concord with the immense majority of our countrymen, who, in fear and desperation, saw how an ideology alien to our history was cleverly taking advantage of our legal structure in order to impose upon us a totalitarian regime. We acted as institutions, without the influence of any leader. The Government junta that currently presides over Chile, with the support of the nation, is made up of men who do not seek power and who lack personal ambition. They are one body, patriotically united, that has taken on the immense but inevitable responsibility of restoring our homeland.\n158.\tI must draw the attention of representatives to the resolution adopted by the full Supreme Court of Justice two days later, on 13 September, whereby the highest court of the Republic, recognizing the intention of the new Government to respect and implement the decisions of the judiciary without prior administrative review of their legality, ordered the nation's courts to continue their work, certain that the administrative authority would guarantee the normal discharge of its obligations.\n159.\tThe present Government has sought and immediately received the patriotic co-operation of professional people, technicians, workers, employees, businessmen and craftsmen. The Government has emphasized that its basic purpose will be the implementation of effective social justice, which will never be achieved through deceit, easy promises, bribery or the criminal division of our people. Rather, it will be done through honest work, a common dedication and community of interest. The present Government is not the return to a recent or remote past. The workers have fought far too long and far too hard defending their legitimate rights for that. The armed forces are a part of this noble people and we shall never betray those who, like ourselves, have dedicated their efforts to returning Chile to the place history has reserved for it.\n160.\tWe maintain our traditional respect for and hospitality to foreigners; but we shall be very careful to avoid a repetition of the reprehensible acts of foreign intervention that have caused the country so much suffering. With the assistance of everyone, we shall rebuild Chile.\n161.\tThe armed forces and the police force have assumed the task of redirecting the country along the path of liberty and law. Once we have achieved our goal, we shall not hesitate to withdraw to our barracks and to our ships. The time it takes to return to normality will be as brief as possible and will depend to a large extent upon the efforts of all Chileans dedicated to that noble end.\n162.\tNow I should like to refer to the fundamental principles of the foreign policy of my Government.\n163.\tAs I reaffirm Chile's total commitment to its legally contracted international obligations and respect for its treaty obligations, which are the basis of world order, peace and security, I wish to state also that my country's foreign policy will be based upon its loyalty to the purposes and goals of the United Nations and to each of the provisions of the Charter. We signed the Charter in San FranciscO and we have always co-operated not only with this institution itself but also with all the organizations directly or indirectly connected with it. You may rest assured that that traditional policy of Chile will not be altered in any way. In fact we shall emphasize, loyally and without excesses, our co-operation in the work undertaken by the United Nations. This Organization is the most effective instrument for the achievement of international peace and security, for the growth of friendly relations and for respect for the fundamental rights of States. We must all dedicate our political will to these endeavours and comply fully with the resolutions of the principal organs of the United Nations. We must act in good faith and recognize that progress in the organized international community is achieved mainly through compliance with the basic resolutions of the Organization, such as the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the Declaration on the Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and the conclusions and recommendations of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We reiterate our commitment to the principle of the universality of the United Nations and to the need to guarantee equal participation for all its Member States. The Organization should not be isolated from the mainstream of world events and, as the Secretary-General has said in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, it must be recognized that bilateral diplomacy and multilateral diplomacy are mutually complementary and that, therefore, it is necessary to explore all the paths that might possibly lead to peace.\n164.\tI take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, on his strong leadership of the Organization. I should like to express our thanks for his constant concern for the problems of Chile and for the effective co-operation of the United Nations in our development plans. We have confidence in his ability to lead the Organization in new directions that will strengthen it as the main instrument for the achievement of international co-operation. We extend our best wishes for the success of his efforts towards peace in different parts of the world.\n165.\tAnother guiding principle of our foreign policy will be, as always, the principle of non-intervention in the domestic or external affairs of other States. But as we solemnly promise to respect national sovereignty, and therefore its obvious corollary, the self-determination of peoples, so must I categorically declare that we shall never allow foreign intrusions in our internal affairs or in the conduct of our international policy.\n166.\tTo comply with this fundamental principle, one of our first acts was to sever diplomatic and consular relations with the present Government of Cuba. We have been able to prove that over the last three years there has been constant interference by Cuban agents, some official and some unofficial, in our internal politics and even in our foreign policy. When the break came, 42 Cuban diplomatic officials were accredited to Chile \u2014 as opposed to six Chileans in Havana \u2014 of whom only two belonged to the foreign service. Last September, 987 Castro Cubans were discovered to be illegally in my country. In the course of the present year, from 1 January to 31 July, 633 people came to Chile from Havana on diplomatic or official business. They intervened in every political, economic and functional organ of the State and, above all, in the presidency of the Republic. Instructors and top leaders of the paramilitary groups were either Cuban or had been trained by Cubans.\n167.\tIt has been fully proved that gun-running was systematically protected by the Government. For example, in March of last year, 13 cases were known to have arrived in Chile, flown in on a regular Cuban airline flight and intended for the purposes of the presidency of the Republic. Those cases did not go through customs, but were received directly by the Chief of the Chilean Political Police. When the Chamber of Deputies duly protested, the then authorities maintained that the cases contained \\\"works of art sent as gifts by Prime Minister Fidel Castro\\\". Now we have learned what those \\\"works of art\\\" were: 13 cases containing 472 side-arms and machine-guns, two sub-machine-guns and 40,000 cartridges.\n168.\tThe weapons and ammunition thus far found in the hands of the misnamed \\\"people's militia\\\" are not the type used by the Chilean armed forces, and their numbers are really surprising. They included not only side-arms and sub-machine-guns, but also heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, anti-tank guns, 106 mm. cannons, as well as large amounts of explosives. This arsenal, brought into Chile principally from Cuba through the surreptitious procedures I have described, was mainly manufactured in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. What has been thus far discovered is enough to equip an army of 20,000 men.\n169.\tI do not wish to go into details of this Cuban infiltration in Chilean internal affairs. But I should like to read out a hand-written letter from Prime Minister Fidel Castro to the President of Chile, dated 29 July 1973. In order better to understand its terms, I must recall that a short time before, in circumstances that are still mysterious, the aide-de-camp to the head of State, Commander Araya, had been assassinated. The reaction to that new political crime was so great in Chile that the head of State instituted a dialogue with the chief opposition party, the Christian Democrats. That dialogue turned out to be hopeless because the President's desire was obviously to gain time and not arrive at any concrete solution. At that moment, Cuban Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and the Chief of the Secret Police, Manuel Pineiro, arrived in\nSantiago, ostensibly to discuss the Algiers Conference of non-aligned countries. They carried with them the handwritten letter from Prime Minister Castro. I have a photostat of it in my hand and any representative who may wish to read it can ask for a copy from the Chilean delegation. I shall read out the contents of the letter; it is extremely important because of its implications. It reads as follows:\n\\\"Havana, 29 July 1973.\n\\\"Dear Salvador:\n\\\"Under the pretext of discussing with you questions concerning the meeting of non-aligned countries, Carlos and Pineiro are coming to see you. The real purpose is to discuss with you your situation and, as always, to offer you our willingness to co-operate in the face of the difficulties and dangers which hinder and threaten the process. Their stay will be very short, since they have many pending obligations here, and it is not without sacrifice to their work that we decided that the trip should be made.\n\\\"I see that you are now taken up in the delicate question of the dialogue with the Christian Democrats in a serious atmosphere created by the brutal assassination of your naval aide-de-camp and the new truck- owners' strike. I can therefore quite well imagine the great tension that exists and your desire to gain time, to improve the relationship of forces in case a battle breaks out and, if possible, to find a way to allow the revolutionary process to continue without civil strife, while protecting your historical responsibility for what might occur. These are laudable goals. But if the other side, whose real intentions we are not in a position to evaluate from here, should insist upon a treacherous and irresponsible policy that would exact an impossible price from Unidad Popular and the revolution, which is in itself quite likely, do not for one minute forget the formidable strength of the Chilean working classes and the strong support they have always offered you in your difficult moments. If you should call upon them because the revolution is in danger, they can paralyse those that threaten to overthrow the Government, preserve the loyalty of those who hesitate, impose their conditions and decide once for all, if necessary, the future of Chile. The enemy should know the working class is forewarned and ready for action. Their force and combativeness can tip the balance in the capital in your favour, even though other circumstances might be unfavourable.\n\\\"Your determination to defend the process strongly and honourably, even if it means risking your own life, will draw to your side all the forces able to fight and all the decent men and women in Chile. Your courage, your serenity and your daring in this historic moment for your country, and above all your strong resolve and heroic leadership, are the key to the situation.\n\\\"Let Carlos and Manuel know how your loyal Cuban friends can help you.\n\\\"Once again I send you the affection and unlimited confidence of the Cuban people.\n\\\"Fraternally, \\\"Fidel CASTRO.\\\"\n170.\tNow I wonder \u2014 do we need any more barefaced proof of intervention in Chilean political life? Can there be any doubt regarding the origin of the political directives and the support for illegality?\n171.\tI do not need to take up any more time of the representatives here by describing the recent and absurd Cuban attempt to accuse Chile in the Security Council. It can only be explained as a futile and desperate attempt to cover up the seriousness of their intervention in the internal affairs of my country.\n172.\tChile, in line with the tradition that it has always followed, reserves the right to turn to the appropriate international organizations if and when necessary.\n173.\tOn the basis of the fact that we can maintain normal relations only with those countries which respect us, we also severed relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \u2014 after we were able to prove that there had been intervention in our internal affairs and an involvement of that country's diplomatic representatives in the training of guerrillas.\n174.\tOn the other hand, we wish to maintain diplomatic relations with all countries of the world, irrespective of their ideology or their political, social or economic systems. We believe that the diversity of governments has nothing whatever to do with relations among States. Ideological pluralism is and will be another element of our foreign policy. For these reasons we regret that certain Governments to which we had expressed Chile's desire to maintain relations on a normal basis have nevertheless decided to break off such relations with a curious uniformity and under the most varied and false pretences. We ask ourselves, what has happened to the principle of ideological pluralism, so often exalted by those Governments? In the future they will have to take the initiative of resuming diplomatic relations with Chile, since they have, again with surprising uniformity, stressed the fact that those ties are merely suspended. They will find no opposition on our part \u2014 so long as our future relations can be based upon mutual respect and non-intervention in internal and external affairs.\n175.\tWe are particularly interested in strengthening our ties with the Latin American countries. United as we are by a common origin, we face a common destiny, and to achieve it we must work together.\n176.\tI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election. My country feels deep affection and respect for yours, and our history has always been closely linked to that of Ecuador. For many years we have learned to appreciate your intelligent, active work in international affairs. Today these qualifications and this experience guarantee the success of your difficult task as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n177.\tImbued by that Latin American spirit, we shall fully support all the regional and subregional integration procedures that involve Chile, such as the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement. We also support and endorse the\nSpecial Committee on Latin American Co-ordination as a basically Latin American Forum where our countries can analyse and adopt unified positions on matters of particular interest and concern to them.\n178.\tThe Chilean Government wishes emphatically to repeat its support of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources of the earth, the sea, the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof for the economic development and welfare of the peoples of the world.'\n179.\tWe also press most firmly for the right of nations freely and independently to dispose of their own natural resources. We unreservedly support all the principles, agreements and resolutions adopted within the framework of the United Nations and within the sphere of the regional and subregional Latin American organizations on this important subject.\n180.\tWe thoroughly support the efforts of the developing countries to gain approval for a charter of economic rights and duties of States that, once implemented, would establish the basic economic and social principles to govern the international community in these matters. This initiative of the President of Mexico has our wholehearted support.\n181.\tWithin the dynamics that govern international economic relations, foreign investments must be in harmony with the goals and programmes established by the host Government and must also reflect the welfare of that Government and that country. Just as we do not accept imperialism, so with the same emphasis do we reject economic imperialism, whether it comes from States or from great transnational corporations.\n182.\tIn the United Nations, Chile will fight against any form of colonialism or neo-colonialism. That policy was not, as some may have believed, an innovation by the Government of the Unidad Popular. It has been the traditional policy of my country for many years. It is the result of a deeply rooted feeling in our country's traditions.\n183.\tThe economic independence of developing countries has been, is and always will be one of the fundamental goals of Chilean foreign policy.\n184.\tI wish to reiterate to representatives my Government's commitment to non-alignment, a position that reflects the aspirations of all countries which like Chile are fighting to obtain for their peoples true economic and political independence.\n185.\tWithin the strange tangle of falsehoods that have been spread abroad as a result of the events of 11 September, reports have been circulated that Chile would return foreign refugees from political, racial or religious persecution to their countries of origin. From the very outset I assured the Secretary-General of the United Nations \u2014 and I do so again from this rostrum \u2014 that such refugees who are in Chile legally and have not been implicated in any crime are fully protected, and that any others who are expelled will not be returned to their countries of origin but will be allowed to choose their destination. After very pleasant discussions with the Regional Representative for Latin America of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees we have reached a general and entirely satisfactory agreement. We stated that we will accept his help when it comes to practical solutions that might affect refugees who have decided to seek Chilean hospitality.\n186.\tThe international negotiations regarding the law of the sea have proceeded to their decisive phase. The current session of the General Assembly will have to decide on a date for the already planned second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n187.\tChile was and continues to be a supporter of this international negotiation, to which we attach the greatest importance. The future of the seas and oceans that cover more than two thirds of the earth's surface is extremely important economically, politically and even militarily. New legal provisions are being established and progressively developed; internationally accepted rules are being updated to conform with the economic, technological and political realities of today.\ne\n188.\tThis new law should clearly cover economic development. It should set up an international regime for the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction that would give adequate expression to the fact that they are the common heritage of mankind. In treaty form it will have to express the natural right of the coastal States to dispose of the resources of their adjacent seas, specifically of the 200-mile zones which have an essentially economic meaning \u2014 a theory which is being supported by a large majority of nations today.\n189.\tThe statement of the representative of Chile has been lengthy and I must apologize for that. But I felt in duty bound to give a broad outline of the foreign policy of my Government and also to go into some detail regarding the events that took place in my country last month.\n190.\tI understand the interest that these events have aroused in the world, even in countries distant from my own, countries which are relatively unfamiliar with our idiosyncrasies, our traditions, and the vigour of our people. There is no doubt that the so-called \\\"Chilean experiment\\\" of setting a course towards socialism aroused the curiosity and even the sympathy of many who saw in the example of the so-called Unidad Popular, a path worthy of imitation or at least of assimilation. But it is one thing to assess a foreign experience from afar, seated in comfortable armchairs or in discussion around a well- served table, and it is quite another thing to experience it.\n191.\tContrary to what the Chilean people themselves believed at first, it was not evolution or social progress that was taking place in Chile. There was simply a power machine being set up by which, through the use of legal loop-holes at first, and later through open and outright illegality, the country was being led to tyranny and consolidated totalitarianism.\n192.\tThe Chilean people did not deserve to pay such a high \\\"cost of revolution\\\", as some came to call the loss of lives, suffering, discrimination, hunger and sectarianism brought about by the Unidad Popular. Worse still, my country, on the verge of financial and economic bankruptcy, plagued by misery and divided into irreconcilable camps, was on the point of falling into chaos and into actual dissolution of the nation. In a supreme effort, and after having exhausted every legal possibility, my country has been able to avoid the most cruel and brutal of civil wars and set its feet on the road to national reconstruction.\n193.\tNone of this could escape the uncommitted foreigners who live in Chile, much less the diplomatic representatives of friendly nations who looked on impartially, but with anguish, while the country disintegrated. Politicians and ideologists outside the country may of course have another view. I remind them of the words of Bossuet: \\\"The worst aberration of the mind consists of seeing things as one would like them to be and not as they are\\\".\n194.\tChile has now taken a different road. The new Government will not retreat one step from the victories won by the workers, or from its policy of absolute national independence. We will whole-heartedly defend the interests of Chile in the face of any kind of imperialism.\n195.\tBut it is not easy to rebuild out of so much rubble and debris. Nevertheless, we trust fully in the aid of divine providence and we know that, thanks to the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism of every good Chilean, there will be no difficulty that cannot be overcome.\n196.\tThe costly and painful experience we have suffered has left us something positive. We now know the lurking poison behind deceiving mirages. Suffering has brought the Chileans together, overcoming the selfishness of the powerful and the hate which the weakest had been led to feel. The country will not forget the lesson that has allowed it to recover self-confidence. Once again it has been proved that in the spirit of Chile there still flames the fire of those who created a free and independent nation, embodying in its history what Ercilla sang of our strong indigenous race: a nation never \\\"mastered by foreign yoke\\\"."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, let me begin by congratulating you most warmly on your election to this internationally very important post.\n\n3.\tI speak to you as a German and a European. To be more exact, my people live in two States, but they have not ceased to regard themselves as one nation. At the same time our part of Europe is as yet not much more than an economic community, but before the end of this decade it will grow into a European union.\n4.\tWe-the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany-are no strangers here. We have long participated in the work of the specialized agencies. We maintain good relations with nearly all Member States. Here, at United Nations Headquarters in New York, we have been shown much understanding in past years.\n5.\tI wish to take this opportunity to thank our friends who have spoken up for us in this forum when we were not in a position to speak for ourselves. We shall not forget on whom we were able to rely.\n6.\tBut I would add immediately that we have not come here to use the United Nations as a wailing-wall for the German problems or to make claims we know cannot be met here in any case. Rather have we come to assume our\nshare in the responsibility for world affairs on the basis of our convictions and within the framework of our possibilities.\n7.\tThe foundation of the United Nations and the most incisive break in German history were events which coincided in a dismal, though at the same time encouraging, manner. The recent history of my people is truly closely linked with the genesis of this world Organization.\n8.\tSince 1945, my people and the two German States have put a considerable distance behind them. And yet our gratification over the fact that we have been given a friendly welcome here is mitigated by the division of Europe, which is glaringly manifest in Germany and which, almost three decades after the end of the war, still claims its victims.\n9.\tCertainly, starting from that part of Europe which has been the source of so many tensions, we have initiated and developed a policy of understanding which was, and still is, to fill in the rifts left behind by the cold war.\n10.\tWe have, I feel, seen in the meantime that not only tensions but also detente can be contagious.\n11.\tAs the Federal Republic of Germany we shall-as our Foreign Minister emphasized here last week in internationally binding terms [2119th meeting] -seek to create a state of peace in Europe in which the German people also can regain their unity in free self-determination. I say this knowing very well-with all respect \u2014 that the United Nations cannot really help us in this matter.\n12.\tThe two German States, belonging as they do to different political groupings and facing the problems resulting there from, have learned that their interrelationship is today of greater importance than what is known as the \\\"national question\\\". This applies to Europe in general.\n13.\tIn spite of their different social and political systems, bound by treaty and conviction to different alliances, the two German States have resolved to embark on a policy of peaceful neighbourliness, coexistence and, we hope, cooperation. We shall therefore try to spell out peaceful coexistence German-style. But in view of the thoroughness which is said to be a German characteristic, I cannot promise that this will always be easy.\n14.\tMore importantly, the consistent renunciation of force as a means of achieving aims, of furthering one's interests, and of settling differences, was the decisive factor needed to sow the seed of detente in the heart of Europe. The\nTreaties of Moscow  and Warsaw,  the Treaty on the basis of our relations with the German Democratic Republic, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin' of 3 September 1971, and soon, I hope, the treaty with Czechoslovakia, which has already been negotiated, are based on the renunciation of force.\n15.\tBerlin, in particular, displays constructive opportunities. It no longer needs to be a source of tension in the heart of Europe. West Berlin can bank on its interests being looked after by the Federal Republic of Germany and on its protection being ensured by the three Powers that, being the supreme authority, remain directly responsible for the city's security and status. If there is anyone to appreciate what this change means, it is most certainly the one who carried responsibility as Governing Mayor of Berlin during a critical phase of its history.\n16.\tRenunciation of force was one element of our peace policy; acceptance of the realities the other. Accepting things as they are has been a bitter pill f6r some, but it was necessary for the sake of peace. For the renunciation of force and the right attitude to reality are the two basic elements of concrete efforts to safeguard peace.\n17.\tThis prepared the way for the next step. A new foundation is to be laid for security and co-operation in Europe.\n18.\tThe bilateral renunciation of force encourages us to enter a second, multilateral phase of European diplomacy, the purpose of which will be to produce a real change in the relationship between the European States on the basis of what has come about. It will do so through growing security from military threat, through intensive economic and technological exchanges, through human contacts, through better knowledge of each other-in other words, through a state of everyday peace.\n19.\tIt would indeed be a good thing if the work done in Helsinki and now being continued in Geneva could soon end with a conference convened at a level that is commensurate with the results achieved.\n20.\tWhat I am talking about here will one day be understood as a significant experiment: how States can learn to master conflicts and eliminate the use of force.\n21.\tAnd if we even succeed, by means of confidence- building measures, in reducing the tremendous wastage that has been the outcome of mistrust between antagonistic systems, we should then have set a historic example.\n22.\tSecurity cannot ensue from trust alone. This, too, is a reality. The reverse is also true. Confidence ensues from security.\n23.\tA distinguished American spoke in this city of the-as he called it-impending \\\"nuclear death-dance\\\". Well, the two super-Powers, which have in their hands by far the most powerful means of destruction, recently signed an agreement which some are still trying to fathom but which is quite certainly intended to obviate the death-dance. That agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is oriented to the principle of renunciation of force and the recognition of realities. It is, as I understand it<a piece of active coexistence and surely also a response to the demands made by the non-nuclear-weapon States at the Conference of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States, held at Geneva in 1968. On that occasion, five years ago, the nuclear- weapon States were called upon to assume concrete obligations of their own. I still hold the view today that those who have power, particularly nuclear power, do not on that account have morality, or wisdom, on their side. Big dangers to mankind emanate from the big Powers, not from the small.\n24.\tA code of responsibilities should be defined to which the nuclear Powers should subject themselves.\n25.\tBut if the two super-Powers do not guarantee peace, who could do so in their place? The responsibility of neither of the two I have mentioned can today be assumed by anyone else, and neither of them can relinquish that responsibility.\n26.\tThus our world today finds its balance. But it cannot achieve that delicate balance without the specific weight of the People's Republic of China, of Japan and of the European Community. In such a system the specific role of Latin America, of the African countries, of the Asian subcontinent and the other partners in Asia becomes effective.\n27.\tPower, I feel, cannot be quantified at will. There is a limit to its expansion-a limit where power becomes transformed into impotence. But detente is not synonymous with disengagement, and it must by no means turn into disinterest if fresh tensions are not to be created.\n28.\tAt the end of the cold war there can, in my view, be neither conquerors nor conquered. Truly, peace, if it is to be secured, must not call for victory of the one and defeat of the other, but only for the one victory of reason and moderation.\n29.\tIncidentally, the use or threat of force should be renounced by all States-regardless of whether they possess nuclear weapons or not. If we have the determination, and the luck, this can be achieved by means of an appropriate system of international agreements.\n30.\tThe only legitimate exception would remain the right to individual and collective self-defence as embodied in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\n31.\tMy Government is willing -- and I wish to state this clearly \u2014 to help bring about an agreement which is being prepared in the Atlantic Alliance in order to make possible a balanced reduction of forces and weapons systems. This will not be possible overnight, but we must get down to the job seriously and consistently.\n32.\tIt is not only a question of giving Europe an opportunity. It is a question of giving the world an opportunity to create conditions which will permit us to turn our attention, and to devote our national energies, to the massive problems of tomorrow. If I may pose the question, If the world does not succeed in quelling force and violence and effectively proscribing it, how will it then be capable of resolving the problems of peace which \u2014 free and remote from force \u2014 will demand the employment of all our energies?\n33.\tIn a world in which we are all increasingly dependent on each other, a policy for peace must not stop on our own doorstep. Small steps can, as experience has shown, take us quite a long way.\n34.\tTo mediation and conciliation in disputes we attach special importance. The strengthening of international jurisdiction, the consolidation and further development of international law, require, in our opinion, the active attention of this Assembly.\n35.\tOur world is going through a process of rapid change. Many of its explosive problems and conflicts spread like epidemics, owing to the increasing proximity of States and continents. Conflicts can, as shown by the terrorism of the present time which either does not want to use or is incapable of using political means, have unforeseeable consequences owing to the vulnerability of highly developed societies.\n36.\tThe catch phrase \\\"preventive conflict research\\\", the prerequisite to \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\" as it is called, is born of the realization that it is no longer sufficient to investigate the so-called classical motives of disputes \u2014 and here I mean motives such as territorial claims, ideological domination, nationalistic ambitions, the temptations of imperialist dominance, the flaws in security systems, disturbances of the balance of power.\n37.\tI am not preaching an existence free from conflict and free from tension. That would be an anaemic illusion. What I have in mind is the fruitless and negative conflicts which confirm to us every day that man, afraid of man, is capable of destroying himself. This opens up new and deeper areas of responsibility for conflict research.\n38.\tI wish to state with all due clarity that human distress is conflict. Where hunger prevails, there can be no peace in the long run. Where bitter poverty prevails, there can be no justice. Where a man's very existence is threatened for want of basic daily needs, it is not permissible to speak of security. There must not be resignation in the face of destitution.\n39.\t\\\"Non-violence\\\" is a concept we owe to the man who awakened a great Member country in this Assembly; the force of that doctrine has not diminished. But the realities of today require it to be complemented by an opposite statement of fact, namely, that there is violence through tolerance, intimidation through indolence, threat through passiveness, manslaughter through immobility. We must not stop on this threshold, for it may be the threshold between survival and decline.\n40.\tI did not make the personal acquaintance of that President of a Latin American country who lost his life through the recent coup. But I wish to emphasize most strongly that this type of solution is not the answer. Or, if you like, unfortunately it can be. But then one day it will be said that reform could only come from revolution because changes were not otherwise accepted.\n41.\tWe are becoming more and more conscious of the limits of the globe. We must not ruthlessly exhaust its resources lest we condemn ourselves to slow suicide. We must not allow the globe's biological cycles to be poisoned any further.\n42.\tIt is surely no coincidence that man today, having seen his planet from out of the depths of space, is becoming conscious of the material and biological dependence of the inhabitants of this so very small spaceship, Earth. Not only within individual countries but also on a world basis we shall \u2014 if we want to live in freedom and security-in future have to go without some things which, though economically profitable, are of questionable social value. And some of the things which appear to be economically unprofitable have become indispensable to the existence of a modern society.\n43.\tI know that there is a tendency in some developing countries to regard the dearth of raw materials as a special kind of political opportunity, for it may here and there swing the pendulum in highly industrialized countries from surplus to shortage. But I say this: this is no ground for satisfaction. These are problems which concern us all, and not just those who come after us.\n44.\tWe must soberly appreciate that the resources of this world will suffice to give posterity an existence worthy of the modern concept of the quality of life only if we keep population growth within responsible limits and only if we achieve a larger measure of social justice in the world.\n45.\tThe depressing food situation in many parts of the world requires us to draft a world food plan so that, if in any way possible, catastrophes can be prevented by means of an integrating strategy for the production of food and its distribution.\n46.\tLet me emphasize that we must not only establish, and very quickly, what food is needed to keep large sections of mankind from hunger, but also whether States are prepared to accept the rules required to that end.\n47.\tOn the other hand, and at the same time, we must establish what raw materials we need in order to guarantee the quality of our civilization and to improve it where possible.\n48.\tLet me say quite frankly that, morally, it makes no difference whether a man is killed in war or is condemned to starve to death by the indifference of others. I repeat: it makes no difference morally. We shall have to decide to break with the ritualistic traditions; who proscribes war also has to proscribe hunger.\n49.\tThe United Nations, built in response to the challenge of an almost total world war, is the mirror of an age-old dream of mankind. That dream closely matches the hopes of eternal peace cherished by the nations.\n50.\tBut the Members having some 30 years of United Nations training here know at least as well as we newcomers that 1945 did not see the start of the millennium. Unfortunately, the United Nations has not-at least not yet-crystallized into the nucleus of a world government.\n51.\tAnd yet mankind has brought into this Assembly of nations not only its goodwill but also many of its problems. There is not a single Member nation that left its history at home when it came here, indeed did not find its identity confirmed to some extent in this unwieldy design for a republic of nations.\n52.\tI perceive here a convergence of the perspectives of all continents. To comprehend and to respect the diversity of life and its systems, to enable it to present itself freely, to set up standards to that end which are binding for all \u2014 this seems to me to be the mandate of the United Nations for civilization, also in future. That is our hope, at any rate.\n53.\tIt is this very diversity which gives us the right to speak of a world society. This diversity is bound up in the tension between equal sovereignty and mutual dependence in this one, troubled world.\n54.\tSome of the criticism directed at the United Nations sounds bitter and cynical, is filled with an almost jubilant pessimism, as if it stemmed from a secret hope that the weaknesses of the Organization would refute the idea of it and its purpose. But setbacks in pursuit of an ideal do not necessarily prove that that ideal is wrong, but often merely that the road to it could be better.\n55.\tIn this respect many of the goals which the Organization has set itself have not been achieved \u2014 the goals set in the Second World War and in 1945.1 want to say that in all frankness. But we also know that this Organization has been able to prevent a great deal of misery, misfortune and death.\n56.\tHere in this institution arguments of reason and morality have time and again and untiringly been proclaimed, arguments which have prohibited this step into the abyss. The United Nations is not a clinic where our peoples can be cured of their neuroses by patient world doctors. Yet it can help to create more solidarity among nations.\n57.\tThat solidarity is the fundamental requirement of a world society, and it is the prerequisite to its survival. That is my deep conviction. I am not speaking of the Utopian realm of the equality of all nations and of all men. But anyone who has never dreamt this dream of equality knows little of the will for justice which, beyond all barriers of continents, race and religion, is perhaps the true binding power among us human beings.\n58.\tThere is solidarity, but not enough of it. I ask for more sympathy for the victims of armed conflicts that threaten to break out anew in this or that corner of the world. But neither should we forget the victims of non-war which sometimes can be just as brutal. On the road to world citizenship we must practice solidarity. We shall not be able to speak of a humane world order until the principle of justice is universally understood.\n59.\tPermit me to say on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany that we shall support United Nations resolutions aimed at liquidating the anachronistic remnants of colonialism. This applies not least to our neighbouring continent of Africa. Without any addition and without any reservation I declare that we condemn racism as inhuman and as the cause of the most terrible crimes. Our own history has been a bitter experience on that score.\n60.\tMoreover, those who take their place in this Assembly must also adopt a position on the moral aspects of international coexistence even when their own national interests are not directly affected. In this process they come face to face with two recognized principles both of which serve the cause of peace: the first is the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others; the other is the principle of the universality of human rights. Not only States but also individual citizens can invoke the fundamental rights embodied in the United Nations Charter. It is peace that benefits if people and information can move as freely as possible across boundaries.\n61.\tI would add that if we speak our mind on violations of individual human rights, on the suppression of the freedom to express critical opinions, on artificial barriers at national frontiers to the exchange of people and information, the decisive criterion for that attitude will not be whether the offender is an ally or one with whom we have friendly contractual ties, or whether it is a less friendly Power. What matters is that we do not remain indifferent on these questions \u2014 even if some details should at first sight or in general be hard to assess,\n62.\tA policy of peace, solidarity and renunciation of force is indivisible. The conflict in South-East Asia has not yet burnt itself out and the smouldering conflict in the Middle East has not yet been defused. In both cases the main thing is that those concerned should talk, not shoot.\n63.\tI wish to stress our interest in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. That is the interest of the Federal Republic of Germany. My Government shares the hope that the international community will not relinquish the possibilities of mediation. My Government also feels that it is primarily direct peace talks between the Arab countries concerned and Israel that v will  best secure a balance of the elementary interests of both sides.\n64.\tThe struggle for peace and the fight against misery require us to recognize that in the one world we live in our fate is, after all, indivisible. Here, too, mankind is therefore under the compulsion to establish solidarity. Where else than in this United Nations should we be able to discuss freely new forms of vital co-operation?\n65.\tNo nation should live at the expense of another. Anyone who refuses to accept this principle may be the instrument of our having to pay dearly for. it. National egoism is no shield. On the contrary, it is an obstacle to that very solidarity which, in the last report, is the best guardian of natural and legitimate national interests as well.\n66.\tWe should not speak of \\\"young\\\" and \\\"old\\\" nations. It is more realistic to distinguish between young and old nationalisms. Ours, in Europe, are old, although a century or two are only a couple of short breaths in history. But believe me, the wild dream that the destiny of a nation can be fulfilled only in unbridled nationalism has in our case completely faded away. We learned from painful experience that there have to be more rational, more reliable forms for the lives* of nations-and that such forms actually exist, namely, good neighbourliness.\n67.\tThe countries of Western Europe have resolved to establish the first regional community that is more than a classical alliance and at the same time does not imply that its members subject themselves to a ideological rules. Our aim is to achieve if possible in this decade the union of our economies, our currencies, our social systems and our foreign policies, and - as dictated to us by the signs of our time -- our security.\n68.\tThe membership of the Federal Republic which I represent, also strengthens the presence of Europe in the United Nations. We are sure it will also be of benefit to others.\n69.\tThe European Community, we hope, can become an example of economic achievement and social balance. It establishes itself as a power without imperial pretensions. The European union will be a power of peace and will be outward-looking.\n70.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany has declared in its Constitution its willingness to transfer sovereign rights to supranational organizations and it has placed international law above national law and made it directly applicable. This expresses the realization that the sovereignty of the individual and of nations can be secured only in larger communities, that the meaning and fulfilment of history can no longer be attributed to the nation-State.\n71.\tThus I end my speech with a plea: let us all together be on our guard against making sacred a concept which I regard as perhaps the most dubious legacy of European history: nationalism, which has claimed millions and millions of human lives and under whose banner fertile country has been devastated, thriving cities destroyed, peoples exterminated, and a whole civilization \u2014 our own- nearly swept away.\n72.\tEurope has ceased to pretend that it is the measure of things for the rest of the world. But it has occasion to warn the nations of the world about the great error which almost brought about its destruction: negative nationalism. And I believe we have to a large extent shaken off that hypnosis.\n73.\tThe nation no longer finds its security in isolated sovereignty. In actual fact, isolation creates dependencies which have ceased to have anything to do with enlightened sovereignty. We need the larger community which gives us peace, security and, hence, freedom.\n74.\tThere is, perhaps, not yet \\\"the world free from war\\\" nor \\\"the world-wide rule of reason\\\" enunciated by the President of the United States on 26 June 1945 after the proclamation of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco's opera house. But mankind must not allow itself to become paralysed in the face of gigantic, seemingly insoluble problems. What we need now is a programme of new confidence in man's abilities.\n75.\tTherefore, I make this plea.\n76.\tLet us courageously and jointly venture forth on a new road to the great goals of eliminating conflicts, bringing armaments under control, making peace safer.\n77.\tLet us courageously and jointly fight for universal recognition of the renunciation of force as a principle for the solution of political problems.\n78.\tLet us courageously and jointly-and I hope we will be many-work untiringly to ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected and may be exercised all over the world.\n79.\tLet us courageously and jointly-and I hope we will be many-fight to defend the right of nations freely to decide their own destiny and to ensure that the remnants of colonialism are removed and that all forms of racism are banned.\n80.\tLet us courageously and jointly promote the further development of international law, in particular by an effective convention against terrorism.\n81.\tLet us courageously and jointly do what is necessary to sustain the viability of the world we live in by protecting the natural environment and-partly by intensifying and widening scientific exchanges \u2014 securing for mankind conditions of a quality that will make life worth living.\n82.\tAnd let us courageously and jointly, in addition to our endeavours to foster the further development of world trade, make fresh efforts to intensify economic cooperation and development; and, above all, let us in this way combine all our energies and declare war irrevocably on hunger around the world.\n83.\tMan's ability to apply his faculty of reason has made the United Nations possible. Man's propensity for being irrational makes it necessary. Reason will have won the field if one day all States and regions come to live and work together as world neighbours in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.\n84.\tThat will not happen in my lifetime, but I want to do what I can to make it possible. And I exhort us all to give every assistance we can, progressing step by step, to ease the task of future generations."

        "file_text": "\ufeff121.\tOn behalf of my delegation, I should like to greet the Secretary-General of the United Nations,' Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who this year made an extremely important and fruitful visit to Latin America when the Security Council held its meetings in Panama. His words on that memorable occasion  were heard with immense satisfaction since they bespoke the intention of the United Nations to deal with the political and economic problems of the developing countries. During his stay in the capital of my own country, we expressed our thanks to him personally.\n122.\tWith the very deepest feelings of sincere friendship, I should like to congratulate the President of this session of the General Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who has for so many years outstandingly and effectively represented in this Organization a nation friendly to Colombia. We are truly gratified by this well-earned election, which honours a Latin American personality and a country with an admirable international tradition. Our President, who knows the United Nations well, will at all times be the impartial leader of our debates.\n123.\tIn this introduction to my statement, may I refer to a great Colombian who died this morning, Eduardo Zuleta Angel, an eminent jurist who, in 1946, presided over the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations. He played an important part in the drafting of the Charter in San Francisco. For my country and for the world Organization, this is an irreparable loss, which we mourn deeply.\n124.\tI must also speak with sadness of the death of two other important personalities, the President of Chile, Salvador Allende, and the poet of America, Pablo Neruda. Allende was a leader with whom we were linked by friendship, and Neruda was an intellectual of great international standing.\n125.\tHistory is a constant process of correction and innovation, and no one today will challenge the fact that we stand on the threshold of a new era in international relations which bears the sign of a spiritual, political and economic convergence of continents.\n126.\tThanks to the extraordinary means of social communication provided by scientific and technical progress, countries feel more closely united precisely because they are more directly connected. Intercontinental distances have been shrunk by supersonic planes, and images are projected from one end of the world to the other in fractions of a second. This same inner inspection of the earth and its latent wealth is being pressed forward from a space laboratory with a meticulous precision undreamed of by scientists 20 years ago.\nj 27. Globalism - that trend towards universal convergence-leaves far behind the stances and the alliances of the period following the Second World War, when we saw taking root the bipolar system of power distribution of the world, with its sequel of grim and intense rivalries between the great Powers that headed the two confronting camps, the United States and the Soviet Union. In fact, occasions were not lacking when that very confrontation spelled a dangerous approach to the edge where an atomic holocaust could take place, and there were times when the United Nations itself was felt to be unreal.\n128.\tArmageddon in the twentieth century would be brought about by the two opposing blocs resorting to their respective atomic arsenals. But, fortunately, for mankind, that terrifying apocalyptic spectre has been dissipated by the emergence of a new period, one of an interrelationship among differing political and ideological systems, an interweaving of the great Powers, and an arrival at joint agreements for their mutual benefit in the economic field and in trade.\n129.\tBeyond the policy of confrontation and the bipolar system lies a period of globalism, a system truly planetary in its dimensions and political, economic and social scope. But without being carried away by optimism we can assert that this new era of world co-operation is characterized by the following features: first, wide international co-operation among all countries; secondly, peace-as the target of international policy and action--more deeply felt and more arduously won; thirdly, the end of colonialism and the repudiation of racial discriminations as outmoded institutions not in keeping with the dignity of the subjected peoples; fourthly, international law as the equally global concept of international relations and the reflection of a gamut of concerns going from the good behaviour of States to the problems of outer space, the sea-bed and the ecology of continents and fifthly, economic and social justice as the necessary premise for the new ordering of international trade, the international distribution of labour and the monetary system.\n130.\tThus the assumption of membership in the United Nations by so many new States of Africa and Asia that have achieved their independence is a clear index of that universality that imbues our debates. Gradually a multipolar system has been developing that allows for the distribution of international competences among a larger number of sovereign States and replaces the erstwhile division of the international order among confronting blocs. And the symptoms of globalism multiply. The problems of the sea-bed, the ocean floor and outer space are discussed. Ecology has made its debut among the list of contemporary issues. Over 130 nations now participate in our work and technological and industrial progress is not confined to a single continent but has moved to the Far East-to Japan, whose rebirth is so gratifying to us.\n131.\tThe presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has revitalized our Organization by the addition of a nation that is among the most densely populated in the world, while the admission to our midst of the two Germanys and of a newly-created American State, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas-which we welcome with such pleasure-puts an effective end to a history of rivalries and animosities and is a decisive step towards international rapprochement.\n132.\tWithout denying that these positive results have been obtained by dint of a direct understanding among the great Powers-primarily the United States, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China-we wonder whether we are not at present witnessing a return to the formulas of the balance of power that were so typical of European international politics of the nineteenth century and the days of Prince Metternich.\n133.\tOur concern lies not in the existence of a system of balances and counterbalances among the great Powers-or in the fact that such a system ushers in an era of useful trade and financial exchanges; for we cannot deny the meaning of history based on what we have called \\\"ideological pluralism\\\", namely, the coexistence of different systems within the framework of international co-operation and mutual respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of peoples.\n134.\tWe merely point out that that very balance of power is achieved by agreements concluded on the fringe of the United Nations and is creating a special system of relations among a privileged group of States-a group that is governed by principles and goals that differ from those of the United Nations. The division of the world into great power blocs on the one hand and the rest of the nations on the other is a fact of contemporary life but it nevertheless shatters international solidarity.\n135.\tThis might well be the appropriate moment to state that never before has the need-and perhaps the urgency - been more clearly seen of setting in effective motion the machinery and the processes of the United Nations.\n136.\tThe United Nations is the immense arena for the convergence of all peoples of the earth. The Charter of the world Organization not only possesses specific juridical values embodied in a series of commitments on the part of all its Members to abide by certain obligations and enjoy certain rights; it not only represents the duty of resorting to juridical processes in the settlement of international disputes. but it also carries an effective political value.\n137.\tThe Charter of the United Nations must always be interpreted juridically and politically. It contains as much of law as it does of politics. It is far from being a mere collection of guiding principles and procedures; it also contains a variety of compromise formulas for the adoption of new attitudes in keeping with the circumstances of history that is passing through what one Latin American author has termed \\\"the commonplace of revolution\\\".\n138.\tThe Charter of the United Nations and its principal organs- the Security Council and the General Assembly- must be resorted to constantly in the shaping of the framework for international relations. The very play of balances among the great Powers must have the purpose of ensuring the improved functioning of the United Nations.\n139.\tGlobalism, internationalism. United Nations: surely these are synonyms. Exclusivism, political separatism, the forgetting of the developing countries: surely these are contradictions of the history we are now living. Prince Metternich ought not to be revived; he should be surpassed.\n140.\tIn fact, our day calls for the closest association among all continents, among ail peoples, among all races.\n141.\tThe primary condition for the new order of peace to become a reality lies in the overriding need for the non-proliferation of nuclear arms. Along these lines, Latin America pointed the way with the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in the hemisphere, as did the United Nations in 1968, when the General Assembly adopted the important measure of recommending to States the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That Treaty and the Moscow Treaty of 1963 which prohibits all nuclear tests in the atmosphere or in any environment that might cause radioactive contamination were the first steps taken along the road to general and complete disarmament precisely for the purpose of strengthening the new world order. The so-called test-ban Treaty-though it be limited in scope- is nevertheless the indispensable prelude to the creation of what U Thant referred to in 1963 as a better awareness of the need at least to limit the manufacture of devices for mass destruction.\n142.\tIt is for those reasons that this year Colombia repeated its protests against the atomic tests carried out in the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. We did so standing together with the members of the Andean Pact, namely, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. We did so because, apart from the knowledge of the dangerous effects on the ecology of the seas and oceans of such tests, there was the matter of principle dictating that we take up the international work of disarmament without delay..\n143.\tThe 1967 report of a group of consultant experts, in response to General Assembly resolution 2162 A (XXI) of 5 December 1966 on the effects of the possible use of nuclear weapons and on the implications for States of the acquisition and further development of these weapons, set forth among other conclusions that an atmospheric explosion of a device at a height of less than 100,000 feet produces an energy discharge of 50 per cent-heat radiation of 35 per cent, and radioactive discharge of 15 per cent. One third of these radiations is produced within the first minute of the explosion, and the radioactive effects are carried by the atmosphere over great distances.\n144.\tIn the case at issue there was also a formal judgement handed down by the International Court of Justice at the request of Australia and New Zealand, and our deepest hope is to see the highest court of the United Nations fully respected by the Member States when it intervenes in matters of peace. There can be no other way of establishing an order of law in the world but by seeking the non- proliferation of atomic arms.\n145.\tWe are deeply convinced of the primacy of international law and of the fundamental role of the International Court of Justice as the authorized interpreter of the commitments assumed by States Member's of the United Nations.\n146.\tThe report of the Group of Consultant Experts on the Economic and Social Consequences of the Arms Race and Military Expenditure nominated by the Secretary- General pursuant to resolution 2667 (XXV) of the 1970 session of the General Assembly, contains statistics of the problem that are truly alarming.\n147.\tBy the end of the decade of the 1970s the level of total arms expenditure rose beyond S200,000 million a year, and, as the experts point out, those military expenditures were two and a half times greater than the entire amount allocated by Governments to health programmes, one and a half times greater than the amount devoted to education, and 30 times greater than the total of the official economic assistance given by the developed countries to the developing nations. \n148.\tMankind must think carefully whether this colossal squandering of wealth is justified or not. The large-scale manufacture of multiple independent re-entry vehicles has been perfected. These can be launched against a number of targets simultaneously and can, in one launching, wipe out antiballistic missiles. So, therefore, we ask ourselves, how far will this frenzied race of man towards his own destruction take us? For the developing countries a modern supersonic fighter-plane represents 10 times the cost of the machine 10 years ago and requires a far more highly sophisticated and complex control system than that used until 1945.\n149.\tThe same can be safely said of the other modern weaponry. It is true that part of that expenditure is laid out for scientific research, but it is no less obvious that a greater transfer of resources for the improvement of the health, education and nutritional possibilities of mankind would help to dispel the demographic problems that seem insoluble today. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that the Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade called for a 6 per cent rate of growth and an increase in domestic savings to reach the 20 per cent level by 1980. Yet how can these levels be reached if the arms race continues in the world.\n150.\tTherefore, the Second United Nations Development Decade hinges on disarmament. In resolution 2930 (XXVII) the General Assembly invited the Governments of all States to continue efforts to create conditions conducive to the holding of a world disarmament conference and to that end created a Special Committee to prepare for that conference, and included Colombia in its membership.\n151.\tWe have always held the opinion that disarmament should be achieved not only within the concept of universality that underlies our Organization, but also bearing in mind regional circumstances and what we might term the \\\"defence balance\\\" of each of our continents. Conditions in Latin America are not identical with those in Europe, or Africa, or Asia. Each of those regions is beset by needs that are well known to the experts in arms types and face logistic conditions on which the concept of continental defence must rest.\n152.\tWe would therefore presume that, just as a Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe would inevitably tend to create a balance of forces between those countries that have adhered to the system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the States signatories of the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Assistance, signed at Warsaw in 1955 -the Warsaw Pact - so, too, the States of other regions-in particular those of Latin America and Africa -which have their own regional organizations could also establish in the United Nations specific plans governing the defence and arms balance in their respective areas. We advocate a regional approach to disarmament.\n153.\tThus we would see the regional groups playing a decisive role in the preparation of the forthcoming world disarmament conference. Otherwise, that conference might suffer the same unfortunate and uncertain fate of so many earlier efforts-made without a regional approach - to solve the problems that may effect over 130 States possessing different economic and political systems, and lying in different latitudes.\n154.\tIn the inter-American regional organization, Colombia has put forth these same ideas in order to avoid unnecessary military expenditures in Latin America and help to accelerate economic and social development.\n155.\tWe are happy to agree with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the fact that the necessity for international co-operation has never been so urgent, but we ask ourselves what are the main functions that this Organization should therefore be called upon to perform.\n156.\tStarting from the assumption that world-wide confrontations have been set aside thanks to the solid progress achieved in rapprochement by the great Powers, there are still in existence the \\\"peripheral conflicts\\\", or, if you prefer, local wars. The Viet-Namese experience must be studied in order to avoid the failure of the peace-keeping mission of this international Organization if it stands immutable, with the rigidity of a statue, when, in some part of the world, wide-scale military operations are taking place or when mass destruction of towns and human beings is taking place, simply because such a war has not legally been declared.\n157.\tThe fiction that conflicts do not exist if they have not been formally declared or if the outmoded diplomatic niceties of the announcement of the outbreak of hostilities have not been fulfilled seems to overlook the shocking fact of the existence of the victims of the sophisticated weapons that arc used in combat in a well-known demographic area. We must agree that the United Nations should play a pacifying role in undeclared wars as well as in those legally recognized as existing.\n158.\tThere is. furthermore, the fact that wars of today inevitably end at the negotiating table, given the inability of the combatants to destroy one another. War, therefore, merely postpones the solution to problems instead of settling them.\n159.\tThe procedures for international conciliation in the United Nations must therefore be made more supple and the part played by the Security Council or the General Assembly more persevering.\n160.\tThe new global concept of international affairs-was very obviously demonstrated by the special meetings of the Security Council held in Panama at the beginning of this \\\"year. It was a most heartening experience for us to see such a high political organ of the United Nations dwelling more directly on the problems of the Western Hemisphere and hearing the opinions of the Latin American nations at first-hand.\n161.\tSpeaking for my own country, I was able to draw attention to some problems occurring specifically in our continent, problems which condition the maintenance of peace there. The persistence of under-development and the existence of large masses of the population outside the main current of development cannot be corrected except by vast plans for industrial development and for improving the economic and social infrastructure. This calls for an increase in our capacity to export and to generate a potential wealth that can be distributed among the less fortunate in the form of salaries and educational, health and housing assistance.\n162.\tThe major problem besetting Latin America is under-development. The population of our countries literally flocks to the cities in search of better living and working opportunities, and there is no chance of grappling with What has been termed the \\\"revolution of rising expectations\\\" of the third world, unless there is a new international division of trade and unless more favourable access is opened up to the exports from those countries. At the same time, it is imperative to admit that the developing countries have the right to regain the resources previously granted to others in colonial contracts, as one way of exercising their sovereignty.\n163.\tPeace, therefore, is not the outcome of certain diplomatic protocols, but rather the result of a better economic balance between continents, and of a meeting of the aspirations for social justice that move our countries. Political peace itself is a precarious tool at best, unless it is accompanied by economic and social peace. In other words, international security must be assessed in economic and social terms.\n164.\tBut peace also depends on the solution that may be found to other problems that affect a region. So Colombia very sincerely endorsed the plea of other Latin American republics for a solution to the question of Panamanian sovereignty in the Panama Canal Zone. Nothing could be more just than that that country be allowed to put an end to a system that bisects its territory into two separate areas divided by a belt of water and land governed by another nation.\n165.\tThe Republic of Panama brought its problem directly to the United Nations because, procedurally, it was hamstrung in the inter-American regional organization, and the Security Council showed itself capable of entertaining the concern of peoples within the new global concept of international affairs.\n166.\tBecause of the trend towards globalism, we are witnessing a crisis in the regional organizations and in the way in which they were conceived after the Second World War as a means of dealing with the problems of the cold war and the conflicts arising out of the Power-bloc confrontations.\n167.\tSecurity treaties, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of 1949 and the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Assistance among the socialist countries-the Warsaw Pact of 1955 \u2014 were designed as defensive alliances to cope with problems arising out of the cold war; but they have been left standing as isolated bodies, and now call for readjustments in the light of new situations flowing from European co-operation-not to mention the Middle-Eastern and Far-Eastern security alliances that have been dissolved by circumstances. In our own inter-American system, the inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance  includes far wider aspects, but aside from that instrument the economic problems that, we face cannot be solved by our regional organization.\n168.\tThe future of such organs-and particularly that of the inter-American organization-will depend on the way they decide to or can adapt to the new circumstances of a world in evolution, in which wide political agreements are sought outside ideologies and where it is nonsense for the cold war to have ended between the great Powers but to continue in Latin America, where the vestiges of the period of confrontation are carefully nurtured.\n169.\tIn some aspects Latin America has entered the twentieth century and in others it has remained in the nineteenth. We now require a new continental policy for our Hemisphere, one based on United Nations principles for co-operation and relations among States that will permit each people to seek its own development and greater social justice, without interference of any sort.\n170.\tFirst of all, each State must be entitled to establish relations with any other. International law, as practised in the world today, recognizes that freedom as inherent in sovereignty and as part of the concept of mutual and full respect for the independent personality of each State. Sooner or later this principle will have to prevail in the Western Hemisphere if we wish to restore friendship among the peoples of the region and be consistent with the notion of ideological plurality.\n171.\tSecondly, in the future we will have to avoid a recurrence of certain interferences that have taken place in recent years and that have been in the nature of reprisals on the part of large corporations against certain countries. The credit of international agencies cannot be made to depend on restrictions derived from claims by private interests against a country, but must be open to the developing countries according to their capacity and ability. Intervention, in any of its forms and manifestations, is contrary to the very spirit of the day.\n172.\tFinally, Colombia is concerned over the basic aspect-the fate of human rights in the Hemisphere and in the world and the guarantees that must surround the dignity of the human person. We witness with sorrow the existence of certain situations in which the principles that we felt to be deeply embedded in contemporary civilization are entirely eradicated.\n173.\tColombia is proud of its democratic lineage and reiterates its faith in the rule of law and of public liberties as a permanent system of coexistence based on equality and respect for all ideologies within the framework of the republican order.\n174.\tIt is easy, therefore, for us to advocate the doctrine of ideological pluralism which Colombia has championed successfully in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. That rule of law which we apply to the individual citizen we have endeavoured to extend to every nation, so long as the latter, in turn, is willing to comply with, and accept, law and justice as norms governing the conduct of States.\n175.\tWe are defenders of this doctrine in so far as we believe in universality for international relations and the application of the principles of the self-determination of peoples and of non-intervention. But pluralism to us does not mean yielding our own national way of life, or forgetting our own democratic tradition, or even disregarding human rights elsewhere in the world. To us, it means mutual tolerance for the diversity of ideological systems and political regimes.\n176.\tThis pluralism, resting four-square on international coexistence, and based on clear legal principles, is professed by Colombia as a theory derived from our own national history. It also takes into account the image of a world governed by criteria of tolerance and respect among nations. Territorial sovereignty and the political independence of States are the foundations of ideological pluralism.\n177.\tU is a doctrine that looks to the future, and not to the hatreds of the past.\n178.\tThe general economic situation is not satisfactory. The world is afflicted with a supply crisis. Furthermore, there is the grave uncertainty felt by the developing countries over the growing imbalance in the terms of trade. However, development plans presuppose the knowledge of the future pattern of world trade and of the monetary system.\n179.\tThe forthcoming trade and currency negotiations, to take place over the next few months, will be crucial to peace. We find ourselves at a point where the development gap has widened between the wealthy and the poor countries and is aggravated by the technological gap between the same groups. To a certain extent, the agreements among the great Powers tend to create a circle of privileged nations that act outside the confines of international conferences.\n180.\tThe creation of economic blocs has been a very different approach to world economy and one that was not dreamed of in 1944, when the ground was prepared for the monetary system, or even two years later, when world trade was organized. Freedom of trade has disappeared, as also has the concept of set parity, two principles that were then voiced as guidelines for economics, and we are daily moving deeper into a world bisected into the group of industrialized nations and that of the poverty zones of the third world.\n181.\tLatin America has drawn a lesson from these events in order to strengthen its co-operation and encourage its dynamic and important efforts such as the Andean Agreement for Subregional Integration.\n182.\tA very eager desire is expressed among the developing countries to be able to participate effectively in the resources of the sea adjacent to their coasts. Thus, new principles of the law of the sea are being elaborated such as that of the \\\"patrimonial sea\\\", which Colombia, together with other countries of Latin America, has defended. We are gratified to see that that initiative has won the support of other important countries, since it allows the establishment of the rights of the coastal State over an economic zone located beyond the 12-mile territorial sea. while respecting the notion of freedom of navigation and overflight and freedom to lay cables or submarine pipelines or to carry out scientific investigation under the control of the coastal State.\n183.\tThe great Powers must grant this equitable distribution of the ichthyological resources so as to allow the needs of the coastal populations to be satisfied. We have no doubt that the law of the sea evolves subject to obvious economic needs, in the same way as it did when for years it reflected the imperialisms and colonialisms of eras we believe obsolete. But the economic zone of the coastal State must then be the great and new principle of a truly universal law of the sea, one that will be the outcome of the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea..\n184.\tI do not wish to overlook two burning issues of the present day. The unification of the two Republics of Korea will be a further contribution to the pacification of the Far East, and their admission to membership in the United Nations will doubtless help to extend the universality of our Organization.\n185.\tThe as yet uncertain atmosphere in the Middle East leads us to make an appeal for reconciliation and peace. Colombia has always believed that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the basis for a just and lasting peace, and any action by the United Nations leading to peace must be predicated upon it. However, we do feel that it would be helpful to enhance the powers of Mr. Gunnar Jarring of Sweden as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the Middle East, in order to encourage agreement among the States concerned in accordance with the terms of that resolution.\n186.\tOur participation in the United Nations and the remarks we have made on the problems that appear in other parts of the world reflect Colombia's intention to seek an international order governed by law and built on justice. International life must daily become more imbued with the rules of law that must themselves be the expression of the universal agreement of peoples. Contrary to the case of the last century, the world today is no longer an inchoate mass that can be shaped and commanded from a few influential capitals. The premises that allowed colonialism and the distribution of spheres of influence have today disappeared.\n187.\tYet at present international problems are even more complicated because to the old matters of conciliation and peaceful means of settling international disputes must now be added the new problems besetting the world community, which have to do with the fate of mankind, its right to life, the protection of economic security and the preservation of the environment. We might safely say that man and all men are the main subject for international organizations such as the United Nations-organizations that hope to influence conditions of peace and security in the world.\n188.\tPeace must thus depend on an over-all preservation of human life and a larger investment of the resources made available to the wealthy countries when no longer used for armaments. Peace is a single problem of anguished and. generally speaking, impoverished mankind, in that vast field the. United Nations has an agenda of infinite scope. The regional organizations are in a critical situation since they are unable to deal with the disquiet of a world knitted tighter together by means of communication, technology and science and by the solidarity that today exists among all nations.\n189.\tWe could not guarantee that those desires will all be fulfilled entirely without conflicts or suffering. But we can make an appeal to men of all races and say that it is the widest programme and the most urgent to which generations can aspire.\n190.\tFor the time being, the United Nations is the greatest political hope of mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff274.\tOn behalf of the people and the Government of Haiti, it is our privilege to express our sincere congratulations to Mr. Benites on his election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are gratified and extremely pleased at the choice by the members of this Assembly because he is not only a statesman who has devoted all the resources of his intelligence to the cause of peace and justice, but also one who is a worthy representative of a sister nation of South America to which the Republic of Haiti is linked by living historical ties dating back to the first quarter of the nineteenth century.\n275.\tWe refer to the decisive battle of Pichincha, fought in 1822, in which Haitian volunteers mixed their blood with the blood of the men of Gran Colombia to nourish the tree of liberty on American soil. It is thus a pact of unshakeable friendship and century-old esteem that joins the Haitian people to the people of Ecuador.\n276.\tIs it necessary to recall that it was in the homeland of Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo that the people of Haiti were rewarded for their contribution to the struggles for the emancipation of the American continent? At the time of the historic meeting between Simon Bolivar, the Liberator, and General Jose de San Martin in Guayaquil in 1822, these two heroes exalted the memory of the father of pan-Americanism, Haitian President Alexandre Petion, and awarded to him the title of Precursor of American Liberty.\n277.\tThese are all memories dear to the hearts of the Haitian people, who share in the honour paid to the people of Ecuador by your election, Mr. President, to the presidency of this highest international body. All this is a manifestation of the pleasure we feel in wishing you success in guiding the work of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly with the sureness of touch, skill, impartiality and great breadth of spirit that have always marked your actions in directing the foreign policy of your country.\n278.\tThe Haitian delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless devotion to the service of peace. We take this opportunity to repeat to him the trust and esteem of the people and Government of Haiti.\n279.\tMay we also welcome into the great family of the United Nations the peoples of the Bahamas and the two Germanys.\n280.\tRelations between Haiti and the Bahamas have always been marked indelibly with the most open friendship \u2014 a friendship born of an awareness of the common destiny of\nthe brother peoples of the Caribbean region. Thus the Haitian Government enthusiastically welcomed the unanimous decision of the Security Council to recommend to the General Assembly the admission of the Bahamas to the United Nations. The Haitian people pay a tribute to the people of the Bahamas, a people which, thanks to its maturity and lofty sense of its inalienable rights and duties, has succeeded in gaining its independence under the leadership of a man outstanding for his wisdom, his sound judgement and his courage. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas will be good enough to convey to the people and Government of his country renewed assurances of the' solidarity and fraternity of the people and Government of Haiti.\n281.\tHow can we fail with equal warmth and enthusiasm to greet the admission into this Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, as a symbol of the detente in Europe and throughout the world?\n282.\tThe Republic of Haiti is most gratified at the happy outcome of the negotiations conducted by the Federal Republic of Germany for the re-establishment in Central Europe of a system of relationships aimed at reducing antagonisms and opening the way to stability. We are especially pleased at the results obtained, for we ourselves have felt the anguish of a nation divided within itself, within its own borders, a nation at the same time aspiring, beyond all hope, to recover its unity and its place in the concert of nations.\n283.\tThe Republic of Haiti and the Federal Republic of Germany in recent years have shown each other an understanding and a mutual sympathy that have been recently reinforced by the signing of agreements on co-operation in technical, economic and financial matters. Thus, as the two States \u2014 the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic \u2014 make their entry into the United Nations with a desire to contribute to the Organization the experience of their long history, their science and their technology, the Haitian people is convinced that in a spirit of mutual respect there will be a further strengthening of the ties of friendship that bind us to the German people.\n284.\tNever in the history of the United Nations has a session of the General Assembly begun under more auspicious signs than this twenty-eighth session. The era of acute rivalry between the great Powers and of fierce ideological competition that characterized international relationships is being replaced, it would seem, by an era of progressive convergence of national interests. The discovery that conflict is irrational has been accompanied by a growing awareness of the similarity among productive forces in industrial societies, even those operating under different systems of law. A system of world equilibrium based on economic integration seems to be leading mankind towards the creation of a trans-ideological international community.\n285.\tThe trade agreements between Washington and Moscow the direct and frank dialogue between Washington and Peking, the end of the war in Viet-Nam, the establishment of relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China the harmonization of relations among States of Central Europe, new concepts in relations among the American republics together with a strengthening of their economic\nties \u2014 all these mark a decisive turning-point in international relations.\n286.\tWe are in fact witnessing a genuine historic change which seems to be bringing to a close a period fraught with human suffering, with crimes beyond measure, with unkept promises, a period in which ideological conflicts darkened the international horizon, spreading anguish and fear; we see a change announcing the gestation of a genuinely planetary policy, the establishment of a community of mankind based on the unity of science, technology and economy.\n287.\tBut looking down from this peak, we must not forget the millions of human beings still suffering impoverishment, discrimination and the impossibility of guiding their own destinies, those who are a prey to poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease.\n288.\tIt is our fervent hope that this international situation that favours a collaboration making it possible for every country to safeguard its judgement and its faith will extend its beneficial effects to the countries of the third world, which, though only yesterday ideological battlefields, will become the theatre for genuine economic and social development within the context of the unity dictated by the historical destiny of humanity that is finally aware of the solidarity of all men and of all peoples.\n289.\tIt is in this context that the Government of His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier, President for Life of the Republic of Haiti, is taking numerous initiatives on the international level and constantly enlarging its activities on the national front to break out of the state of underdevelopment and provide the best possible conditions for the people of Haiti to flourish.\n290.\tIn the course of a meeting of the Inter-American Committee of the Alliance for Progress, held in Port-au-Prince during the month of November 1972 and attended by representatives of a number of friendly nations and of international financial institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the United Nations Development Programme, the Inter-American Development Bank, and others, the national and international experts drew up a five-year plan estimated to cost $US 212 million, divided into annual investments of $US 42 million. The total amount of external financing would reach SUS 154 million, and the Haitian counterpart would be $US 58 million.\n291.\tIn accordance with expert forecasts, the Government of Haiti prepared, for the first year of the five-year plan, an investment budget of approximately $37 million. In the budget the Haitian counterpart, which originally was to have been of the order of $11 million, was brought up to $14 million, whereas the annual external financing, which was to have been approximately $30 million, is now only $23 million.\n292.\tAlthough the capital budget \u2014 which was to have been approximately $42 million per year for satisfactory economic development, taking into account demographic growth and the infrastructural work to be carried out, has not yet achieved the desired result, it none the less represents considerable progress in comparison with what was\nachieved in the previous year. In point of fact, for the financial year 1972-1973, the investment budget amounted to $29 million and for the present financial year it has gone up to $37 million, that is, a 30 percent increase. The share of external financing grew from $17 million to $23 million, which represents an increase of 34 per cent; and the national effort has increased by 23 per cent, from $11 million to $14 million.\n293.\tConsonant with the philosophy of the Haitian Government, strict austerity measures were promulgated and they have helped to strengthen the investment capacity of the public sector, because the prime objective is and remains to raise continuously the standard of living of the population. The efforts which have been carried out in the economic and financial fields have been accompanied by a number of steps designed to bring about a climate of trust and detente.\n294.\tIn order to support and to intensify economic and social development, the President for Life of the Republic has taken a number of judicious political steps. Decrees of clemency and amnesty have brought joy to a number of families and there is a growing climate which favours the return to the country of a number of Haitian experts who were giving their services throughout the world. Furthermore, the Republic of Haiti has once again adhered to the Inter-American Convention of Havana on the Right of Asylum, the Inter-American Convention of Montevideo on Political Asylum, the Inter-American Convention of Caracas on Territorial Asylum and the 1954 Inter-American Convention of Caracas on Diplomatic Asylum.\n295.\tThe Duvalier revolution has, we think, now reached a decidedly constructive stage. It calls for patriotism, devotion and intelligence on the part of all the sons of the fatherland to sow the seeds of the new life of Haitian soil, a new life for all, without any sort of distinction.\n296.\tThis national effort could not produce the desired results without the active understanding and sympathy of those peoples which have been traditional friends and also of international financial institutions. Hence, President Duvalier has set Haitian diplomacy on the path of dialogue to serve the purposes of an open foreign policy,\n297.\tTogether with fruitful contacts with the Governments of the Americas, Western Europe and the Middle East, a new impulse has been given to relations between Haiti and the African States. During May of this year a Haitian goodwill mission visited Senegal, Liberia, the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic and Chad, Last June, the Republic of Haiti had the privilege of welcoming President William Tolbert of Liberia on an official visit to Port-au-Prince. During those visits the foundation was laid for effective co-operation with those African peoples, to whom the people of Haiti are linked by ethnic and cultural ties and also by the identity of the problems they confront and a common desire for better living conditions.\n298.\tWithin the framework of this international policy, based on the ideals of friendship and mutual esteem, we should like particularly to refer to the new agreements which were recently concluded between the Haitian Government and the Government of France. Over and above traditional linguistic and cultural affinities which have taken the\nform of a language shared in common, the relationships between Haiti and France have taken the concrete form this year of signing two diplomatic instruments of extremely far-reaching consequences, one signed in Paris and the other in Port-au-Prince. Inspired by a feeling of mutual respect, both those instruments are designed to strengthen technical, economic, financial and cultural co-operation between the peoples of Haiti and France, motivated by the same desire for peace and understanding.\n299.\\\"\tUnder the general heading of Haitian-American cooperation, a number of infrastructure projects are now being carried out as a result of improved relations between the two oldest republics on the American continent. This co-operation, largely motivated by a policy of good-neighbourliness, is part and parcel of the main priorities of the national economic and social development plan and constitutes considerable support for internal efforts.\n300.\tOn the international political scene, a number of problems are still awaiting solutions and require that every member exert himself so that primacy is constantly given to the law and priority is always attached to the well-being of mankind as a whole.\n301.\tAt the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm the peoples, through their individual Governments, pledged themselves to carrying out constant supervision of the environment, in order to restrict and to limit any damage to the environment in which man's life goes on. The age-old life cycles of plants, these \\\"oxygen factories\\\", and of animals have been gravely disrupted by the development of science, technology and industry. The pollution of the air, the seas and the beaches has created problems which directly affect man's life and his future. The Republic of Haiti has resolved to contribute fully to the new environment body, whose headquarters will be in Nairobi; this shows the desire of the industrialized countries to heed the claims of the third world so that their differing viewpoints can be finally harmonized.\n302.\tThe whole world has welcomed the numerous steps taken by the great Powers to create a climate of detente in international relations. However, the slowness of disarmament negotiations still remains one of the major preoccupations of the developing peoples, because control of armaments and general disarmament would be the most telling display of the desire for peace by the Governments concerned and would make available sufficient wealth to guarantee a decent standard of living for all men on earth.\n303.\tAt a time when the destructive capacity of nuclear armaments means that any generalized war is tantamount to an act of collective suicide, it is inconceivable that military force can continue to be considered as a factor in foreign policy and that fabulous sums can still be devoted to it.\n304.\tThe Haitian Government would like once again to underline the dangers involved in this race for the production of death-dealing weapons and would appeal for common sense among leaders so that a climate of mutual confidence can help to expedite negotiations on disarmament.\n305.\tThe situation in Angola, Mozambique, Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa is an anachronism which could be described, to say the least, as repellent at this time in history when the forces of morality and scientific progress have overturned the age-old myths of racial superiority and exalted human dignity, opening the way to cooperation among all men in a spirit of mutual respect.\n306.\tIt is unthinkable that some minorities, swimming against the tide of history, should seek to resuscitate obsolete concepts in order to dominate and exploit others.\n307.\tThe Republic of Haiti, forged in the crucible of epic battles in order to proclaim the dignity of man and his inalienable and irrefutable right to liberty, would give a brotherly accolade to the African populations who are struggling for their independence and their dignity, It is our hope that all those oppressed peoples will be heartened and encouraged by the creation of the new independent State of Guinea-Bissau.\n308.\tWhile in the Middle East a precarious peace prevails which might well at any moment degenerate into armed conflict, despite the efforts and initiatives of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr, Gunnar Jarring, the problem of international terrorism remains one of the most thorny problems at present to be tackled by the General Assembly. The political aspects of the problem, the divergences and the ideological antagonisms make it difficult for a resolution to be adopted which would win the adherence of the vast majority of Member States, but the Government of Haiti considers that efforts should be redoubled. At the same time it should not be forgotten that international terrorism, which destroys innocent human life, is also the fruit of despair, frustration and violations of fundamental human freedoms of men to whom every horizon is closed. The delegation of Haiti is prepared to support any draft resolution covering all these aspects of international terrorism.\n309.\tOne of the most important resolutions passed by the twenty-seventh session was probably that by which the General Assembly decided that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea should be convened [resolution 3029 (XXVII)]. That Conference, which will be preceded by preparatory meetings at the end of this year in New York, will provide the countries of the third world with an opportunity to stress the urgent need for a major reformulation of the law of the sea, laying emphasis on the tremendous economic possibilities of the sea-bed. It will also be an opportunity for the littoral countries of the Caribbean to support the wise conclusions reached in the Declaration of Santo Domingo and to stress their rights, as well as the necessity to satisfy those needs which derive from a more fruitful exploitation of the resources of the sea.\n310.\tDuring the frank and open discussions which have been initiated by the Government of Haiti with other governments in the third world, a single thread can be seen running through the negotiations \u2014 that national development efforts can only yield satisfactory results provided that international social justice, effectively respected, gives its indispensable support, International social justice implies that all peoples and nations should be able to exercise\npermanent sovereignty over their wealth and their natural resources; that they are entitled to authorize, to restrict or to prohibit prospecting for, exploitation of and disposal of their resources; that they can produce sufficient quantities of the goods and services they need; and that international co-operation, in the form of either public or private investment, exchange of goods or services, of technical assistance or of scientific data should promote the independent national development of the countries of the third world.\n311.\tHowever, notwithstanding the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, UNCTAD and other agencies of the United Nations family, the peoples of the third world continue to have their aspirations to progress frustrated by the growing disparities between the prices for goods and services from the industrialized countries and the prices of natural resources and exports; by tariff barriers and other restrictive trade practices; by the incompatibility of private investment with the goals and priorities of national development plans; by the dangerous intervention of multinational corporations in the political affairs of host countries.\n312.\tYet the developing countries' claims to international social justice fit within the context of the rules, principles and objectives of the United Nations, to which all Member States have knowingly subscribed and which they have pledged to respect.\n313.\tIt would be vain to try to exclude from the main current of history three quarters of mankind so that the super-Powers of the world might conclude among themselves agreements and treaties to bring about international equilibrium in the style of bygone ages. Humanity has irreversibly entered an age when it is essential to take account of the countries of the third world. The economic co-operation now going on between countries with different social and political systems could lead to a satisfactory world order provided that all peoples recognize their humanity and respect fundamental human rights in order to promote the economic and social progress of all nations.\n314.\tErstwhile subject peoples who have won their independence at the cost of great sacrifice are fully aware that their efforts will only have genuine significance to the extent that their living conditions are improved, that illiteracy is eradicated and other major obstacles which stand in the way of the effective enjoyment of human rights are removed.\n315.\tAt the present, the fundamental instruments for development are well known and can be summarized as capital investment of an adequate volume administered by economic and social institutions which have high-quality experts working for them. As long as the United Nations and international financing organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund cannot make these means available to the nations of the third world, they have not yet accomplished their mission.\n316.\tAt both the national and the international level, individual successes involve tension and friction. In order that full benefit may be fully drawn from the thaw in international relations which seems to be ushering in a new cycle in history, it is essential, to quote the terms of resolution 2993 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly on 15 December 1972: that all armed conflicts involving third parties should be eliminated, along with the final vestiges of colonialism and racism; that all forms of pressure which prevent peoples from exercising their sovereign rights to the free utilization of their natural resources should cease; that there should be an end to all violations of the right of peoples to self-determination; and, finally, that the economic and social rights of nations should become effective.\n317.\tOnly under these conditions can international detente lead not to a fresh period of disillusionment, stress, frustration and friction \u2014 as it so often did in the past \u2014 but rather to an age of international social prosperity. Men will at last be able, in accordance with the spirit of the Charter, to live with one another as good neighbours and to look forward to the future with hope and confidence.\n318.\tThe Haitian national revolution, which was based on the ideals of social justice and which has brought the masses out of the age-old isolation to involve them in the affairs of State, has triumphantly stood the test of time. For 16 years, through a policy of austerity and national effort, it has throughout the country carried out important work on the infrastructure, which is so vital to economic growth, while at the same time its social policies have continuously improved the standard of living of the vast majority of the people. An open diplomacy is making it possible for our country daily to strengthen its links of friendship, esteem and co-operation with the peoples and the Governments of the world that, apart from all questions of ideology, share its aspirations to peace and understanding. Now that the question of a review of the Charter of the Organization has arisen, undoubtedly it would be advisable to adapt it better to the changes which have occurred in recent years in international politics, so that it can be more responsive to this deeply-felt aspiration of the peoples of the third world to participate fully in the conquests of science and technology.\n319.\tThe Haitian delegation would express the fervent hope that this session of the General Assembly will grasp the meaning of new trends in history in order to bring them into harmony with the requirements of the peoples of the third world and to channel them towards the establishment of true peace in a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among all peoples."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly opens at a moment when important events are occurring on the international stage. New centres of power and influence are appearing while detente and co-operation are replacing the traditional division of the world into two opposing blocs.\n2.\tWhile these deep-rooted transformations in the general relations of forces constitute an important stage towards the establishment of peace, the countries of the third world still remain confronted with colonialism, foreign occupation and economic exploitation.\n3.\tIt is therefore in a new context, where peoples are torn between anxiety and hope, that this twenty-eighth session is opening, and it devolves upon you, Mr. President, to guide the labours of this session. Your responsibilities are difficult indeed, but we trust in your qualities as a statesman and as an outstanding diplomat, and we congratulate you warmly on your election. The well-deserved respect which your country enjoys, your foresight and enlightened understanding mean that you are well qualified to assume this heavy and difficult task.\n4.\tYour predecessor also commands our gratitude for the tact and sense of equity with which he guided the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n5.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the very meritorious manner in which our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, is discharging his lofty and difficult task. We should like once again to express our support for him in his courageous and persevering efforts to enforce respect for the principles of the Charter, and thus to ensure the maintenance of peace and harmony among peoples.\n6.\tLastly, I should like to extend again to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic our wishes of welcome and our warm congratulations, which have already been conveyed to them by the Mauritanian delegation.\n7.\tHowever, I should like to add that my country experiences all the more satisfaction at these developments because its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany are long standing, and today are taking a vigorous upsurge reflecting the mutual respect between our two peoples. Our satisfaction is also justified by the peaceful work done in Europe in difficult conditions by the Federal Republic of Germany. We know how diverse these conditions are and we can therefore measure the true value of what has been accomplished and the immense task that has been carried out. These accomplishments do honour to the German people and should be a source of pride to its leaders. Such great objectives could never have been achieved without the determination of that people and the political courage and foresight of Chancellor Willy Brandt. We are convinced that the presence in the United Nations of such a highly qualified people and such far-sighted leaders will contribute to the search for justice, freedom and the equality of peoples, a search which our Organization has set itself as its objective.\n8.\tThe broad lines which guide the foreign policy of my country are naturally a reflection of its geographical position, its economic situation and its political options,\n9.\tAn under-developed country, a pivot between black Africa and Arab Africa, firmly devoted to its economic and political independence, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania intends to pursue its course in the community of efforts at the international level with firm determination to Tight to contribute to the advent of a world peace, justice and harmony.\n10.\tIt is on those fundamental factors that we have based our will to safeguard and consolidate our economic and political independence and our devotion to African unity, to non-alignment and to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n11.\tEver since the dawn of its accession to international sovereignty, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been aware that it must rely on itself before it can rely or others. It has been, above all, aware that the constant search for real political independence requires true cultural and economic independence.\n12.\tIt is this fundamental approach which has led my Government and my party to reject easy solutions and to take decisions which, if they have not been in our immediate interests, have been in accord with our principles and objectives. At the very time of our independence. \n\nMauritania refused to became part of the former Common Organization for the Regions of the Sahara and expressed its unhesitating support for Algeria in its struggle for national liberation, to cite only that case.\n13.\tIn 1963, in the course of the third congress of our party, we decided to give up the subsidy that had been granted to us by France for our operational budget, opting thus for a policy of austerity and financial stringency. This will to make sacrifices, accepted by our country at the national as well as the individual levels, has always been part of our continuing search for true independence.\n14.\tThe logical consequence of this difficult but continuing search was naturally the revision, early this year, of our agreements with France which had been concluded at the time of our accession to international sovereignty. Those agreements were certainly justified at the time and in a very sell-defined context, but they of necessity had to suffer from the passage of time and the counter-effect of the evolution of our country, both internally and internationally. They therefore had to take into account our own national and international requirements, as well as our legitimate desire to regain control over the instruments of our economic and cultural policy.\n15.\tIt was on that basis that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania created its own national currency, the ouguiya, on 29 June last and signed with France new agreements covering various areas, not including the monetary and the military. Those new agreements, although they open a broad field of action, are, by their general nature, similar to the agreements signed by Mauritania with other foreign States.\n16.\tHence our two countries have decided to co-operate on the basis of mutual interest and in a framework open towards the future. In so doing, they have been able to preserve the multiple ties of esteem and affection which a long common history has woven between our two peoples. Such was the last stage in a certain area of co-operation and the point of departure for new relations of an evolutionary nature based on the real interests of our two States. That departure was not easy-for from it. At the same time as international economic relations are disturbed by the monetary crisis and its nefarious effects and by a generalized recession in the economy, a natural disaster of exceptional dimensions has struck our country at this decisive stage of our history.\n17.\tThree successive years of drought have had dramatic consequences on the life of our people, on cattle and crops: 60 to 80 per cent of the livestock have died, depending on the region; there has been a severe food shortage, leading to epidemics among a portion, of the population, mass rural exodus, non-existent crops, and a lack of drinking water. Those are just some of the problems which require urgent solution.\n18.\tAn emergency plan was worked out on 18 November 1972 and put into effect on 1 January 1973. That plan included at the outset several approaches: a regrouping of the people concerned, organization of transport and the distribution of food-stuffs, protection of existing pasture land and the raising of reproductive livestock, the drilling of properly equipped wells, and the introduction of a market- gardening programme. By means of a rigorous limitation of expenses, my Government was able to participate to a large degree in the carrying out of this plan. While that participation has now risen to one sixth of our national operating budget, a 3 per cent national tax on salaries and a 1 per cent tax on the business earnings of companies operating in our country should reach the same amount. But if the forecasts for this initial plan have been largely exceeded, it is thanks principally to international solidarity, to which I should like to pay a warm tribute. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to address the sincere thanks of my Government and people of Mauritania to the United Nations, to the specialized agencies, and to the private organizations and many friendly countries that have granted us rapid, effective and multifaceted assistance. Thanks to that national effort and to that international solidarity, urgent problems have found a solution or are on the road to solution.\n19.\tWe have avoided the worst; the people have been saved from a catastrophe of famine which could have killed thousands of human beings in this twentieth century, which none the less is witness to opulent consumer societies. It thus remains for us to prevent, through appropriate short- and long-term programmes, a recurrence of such a situation. The broad, general lines of this programme, for the financing of which we are calling upon friendly countries and the international community, have been defined by the Heads of State of the Sahelian region in Ouagadougou and will be communicated to the General Assembly by Mr. Sangoule Lamizana, President of the Republic of Upper Volta, who has been entrusted by his peers to undertake this task.\n20.\tAs can therefore be seen, it is in a difficult situation that my country has committed itself to the path of mastery of its economy, an essential prerequisite for true independence. But our country-with a fairly parsimonious State, with a people that tends by nature to economy, with a largely surplus balance of trade and an adjusted balance of payments-counting on the support of many brother-States and friends, has every reason to be optimistic and confident in the future.\n21.\tOn the other hand, this policy of independence characteristic of our country does not in any way, in our opinion, exclude the possibility of consultation and fruitful co-operation. Such consultation and co-operation, in a climate of confidence, can lead to agreements respecting each of the parties involved or to the taking of a common position flowing from solidarity of interests or any other valid and legitimate motivation. Our choice of non-alignment derives its force from this spirit of co-operation; at the same time, it is the expression of our refusal to be at the service of any hegemony or to replace centuries-old forms of domination by other, equivalent manifestations. It is explained also by our devotion to freedom, to the equality of all peoples and to the safeguarding of their national independence. For that matter, those are the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to which my country has subscribed ever since its independence and to which it has sworn an oath to be faithful.\n22.\tAs far as our relations with Africa are concerned, they are a reflection of our faith in the need for African solidarity. If the unity of Africa finds in us a particular welcome it is because our country, as was said by the Head of State of Mauritania:\n\\\"... gives an example of harmonious cohabitation of people of different races and colours, who, with the same enthusiasm, are together building the Mauritanian nation. . . . These characteristic features of our country, as well as its geographic position, make it a link between Black Africa and Arab Africa, the cultures and races of which exist together there in order better to enrich it and to symbolize Africa united in its diversity.\\\"\n23.\tThat is certainly not a passing attitude. Those are our deep-rooted considerations of reality which we have translated into facts in our relations with other African countries, both north and south of the Sahara, and with the whole of the Arab world to which we belong.\n24.\tAt the same time as our links with our brothers from the south and from the north are growing stronger day by day, we intend to build together the Arab Maghreb, in keeping with the aspirations of our peoples and with their centuries-old ties.\n25.\tIt is therefore on the basis of these political factors-if we may use that term-that the delegation of my country intends to participate in this debate without any prejudice or partisan spirit.\n26.\tI said a few minutes ago that our peoples were divided between despair and hope. Indeed, if we look at the international situation we will note that it has been marked by decisions and negotiations which have brought us closer to peace. Among the great Powers a link of new relations founded on economic co-operation is being established above and beyond the differences of political regimes and ideological systems. This new spirit of co-operation and understanding derives from the realization that in the context of nuclear balance certain geographical or political frontiers could not be altered by force. It is also encouraged by the fact that people have become aware that two powerful industrial and commercial blocs can derive from each other tremendous advantage on this basis of economic co-operation.\n27.\tIn Europe, where for so long initiatives for peace and attempts at settlement by peaceful means of the problems inherited from the Second World War died at a wall of misunderstanding and mistrust, a new era of confidence and mutual respect is progressively being realized. That state of mind is in particular reflected by the admission to the United Nations of the two Germanys.\n28.\tConcerning Indo-China, the signing on 27 January 1973 in Paris of agreements on Viet-Nam, the cessation of the American bombardment of Cambodia and the Vientiane agreement' open up new prospects for the people of Indo-China, who have so long been scourged by war and foreign intervention.\n29.\tOn the subcontinent, the agreement concluded in New Delhi on 28 August between India and Pakistan settling various humanitarian problems encourages reconciliation and peace in the region.\n30.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, while actually covering the prosperous regions of the planet, is none the less an initiative for rapprochement, which provides a framework for reflection and dialogue between nations that were recently competitive in all fields.\n31.\tThese outstanding factors in international relations beyond any question constitute a sizable achievement for the forces of peace in the world. They are therefore a legitimate source of hope. We must, however, recognize that peace is far from being assured in all parts of the world. That explains our attitude, which is based on equally legitimate anxiety.\n32.\tJust so long as colonial wars rage, just so long as there is apartheid, occupation of territories of sovereign and independent States, the policy of force and economic exploitation of countries already poor, detente will remain an illusion or will be limited in scope. Peace and freedom are indeed indivisible, particularly at a time when the interdependence of countries and the solidarity of peoples become a vital and inevitable necessity. That is why the detente and rapprochement in Europe can have meaning only if they are not limited to a geographical zone and their effects can be extended to the rest of the world. Indeed, it happens, as though by a curious chance, that it is in the other parts of the world that one finds poverty and the sources of tension.\n33.\tIt will therefore be understood that detente can have no meaning for the oppressed peoples expelled from their homes, denied their legitimate aspirations to freedom, dignity and progress.\n34.\tIn the Middle East, Israel pursues its policy of aggression, following an unchanging scheme of colonization by force. The countries bordering on occupied Palestine have seen their territories reduced. Even their names have been changed. True violent change has been brought about-not by a normal and authentic development but by the application of a continued policy of expansion, occupation and resettlement.\n35.\tThe Palestinian people, whose lives and existence have through the centuries been intermingled with the geography and land of Palestine itself, have been expelled from their homeland, dispossessed of their goods, reduced to wandering and living on international charity. Such is the crisis in the Middle East which Israel, assured of impunity and the support of imperialism, launches as an arrogant challenge to the international community and to the United Nations itself.\n36.\tIn Southern Africa, the peoples of South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde islands continue to bend under the weight of colonialism, which becomes increasingly murderous and inhuman. The most recent massacres in Carletonville in South Africa and the criminal atrocities perpetrated in Mozambique by Portugal once again bring out the resurgence of this colonialism based on the oppression of the peoples of southern Africa by a minority of foreign settlers. These peoples are exploited and deprived of their fundamental rights, which flouts the most elementary values of the human person. This unholy alliance between Lisbon, Pretoria and Salisbury continues to strengthen its system of domination. It is encouraged by monopolies and economic and financial foreign interests and by the multifaceted aid it is granted by certain countries within the Atlantic alliance.\n37.\tThe people of the Sahara under Spanish domination continue to be deprived of the right to self-determination. My country reaffirms its devotion to that principle in conformity with the decisions of Nouadhibou and Agadir, and pertinent resolutions of the United Nations on this Territory. We should like to avail ourselves of this opportunity solemnly to call upon Spain without delay to apply to the people of the Sahara the principle to which Spain has in principle subscribed, as requested of it repeatedly by the United Nations. Any delay or hesitation could only worsen the situation in the Territory and compromise the many ancient and new ties of friendship and co-operation existing between Spain and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n38.\tThe situation in Indo-China continues to be a subject of lively concern for my country. Despite the signing of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam and the cessation of United States bombing in Cambodia and Laos, peace is far from established. And it cannot be established so long as foreign intervention is manifested in support of all kinds for the Lon Nol regime and so long as the Saigon administration and those who support it do not really commit themselves to respecting the Paris agreements.\n39.\tIn Korea, the division of the country constitutes a permanent threat to peace in that region and to security in the world. The United Nations flag continues to be used to camouflage the presence of foreign occupation troops in Korea. The Korean people cannot bring about its independence and peaceful reunification save through exercise of its right to self-determination in the absence of any foreign intervention.\n40.\tThe hotbeds of tension or selective confrontation I have just touched upon are not the only limitations to detente. There is another crucial problem of our times-that of the increasing gap between the developed countries of the north and the developing countries of the south. The international economic and monetary structures set up after the Second World War were conceived in terms of the interests of the developed countries alone.\n41.\tIf at the outset only the interests of the Western countries were involved, in our times we must recognize the fact that this system extends to the economic interests of the developed countries of the East. It is a system within the framework of which the dependence of the developing countries is an essential factor in the future growth of the wealthy advanced countries.\n42.\tTrue, praiseworthy efforts and progress have been made by international institutions such as the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund, but relations between the developed countries and the developing countries continue to be relations of dependence rather than interdependence. Bilateral or multilateral aid has not been sufficient to meet the needs of the developing countries and is far removed from the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade. With the price fluctuations in raw materials and the increase in the price of manufactured goods, the already scandalous gap widens steadily.\n43.\tSuch conditions testify to the lack of a real political will to take the measures necessary to bring about, in the interests of all Members, true international economic co-operation. The developed countries, in their long-term interest, are in duty bound to organize that co-operation on the basis of the equality of States and the participation of all in a task which is of necessity a common use. Otherwise, detente will remain limited in principle and in scope. It could even ultimately bring about the division of the world not into ideological and antagonistic blocs but rather into a group of developed countries, an international gendarme at a dual level-political and economic-and a majority of poor States, pawns of political confrontations and military hegemonies.\n44.\tThat is a real apprehension that emerged from the historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 8 September 1973, in which 76 countries representing a very large majority of the world's population met together. That concern, which was clearly felt in Algiers, would be further justified if the developed countries, and in particular the great Powers, failed to convert this detente into a real and committed effort for peace and progress for the benefit of all mankind.\n45.\tThe United Nations offers an appropriate framework for such international co-operation. The rivalry between the great Powers can be manifested in this task, not by acrimonious discourse, but by a sincere search for solutions of the many problems of mankind, particularly by the improvement of the fate of man and the application of his rights. It is at this price that our Organization, an instrument of peace and understanding among peoples, can see restored to it its role as a factor for political, economic and social progress. The United Nations indeed could not be satisfied to be only what the Member nations wish it to be, for among those countries the great Powers enjoy prerogatives so formidable that they could not be justified if they did not imply at the same time duties and respect vis-\u00e0-vis Member States and the resolutions of the Organization. It is in vain that we decry the inefficiency of the United Nations if those that bear the collective responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security are the first to flout its relevant resolutions.\n46.\tWe would express the sincere hope to see every Member State work for respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter and the application of the decisions taken by our Organization. Thus, for the greater good of mankind, we would see reborn the somewhat diminished confidence of peoples in this world Organization."

        "file_text": "\ufeff78.\tMr. President, it is for me a very great honour to speak for the first time from this rostrum, and it is especially gratifying to do so under your presidency at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I know, Mr. Benites, your intellectual qualifications, your tact and your warm friendliness, as well as your fame as a fighter for noble causes and your profound historical and legal knowledge that are always expressed with vigour and elegance. I see in you a distinguished representative of the brother nations of Spanish America, so dear to all Spaniards. To the recognition that your qualities as a person and your lofty position merit must be added my sincere thanks for the very kind words you used regarding Spain's ties with Spanish America when you took up your task as President of this General Assembly.\n79.\tThis twenty-eighth session of the Assembly has been enriched with the admission of the two States representing the great German nation as well as the Bahamas. To these new Member States Spain extends a very cordial welcome.\n80.\tThe words I wish to speak here are words of peace and justice. Words of peace. I say. because Spain's foreign policy is characterized by a constant and firm desire for peace among nations. This is not a rhetorical assertion. Facts bear this out. Neither the strategic value of our geographic position nor the strong pressures to which we were subjected during the two world wars were able ever to destroy our profound desire to maintain peace.\n81.\tWithin this tradition the Spanish delegation wishes now to analyse the present situation and the future prospects for peace in the world, a peace torn by conflicts and tensions which threaten the future of mankind.\n82.\tTo the bright face offered by ever increasing economic and social growth, by technological advances and the possibility of reaching ever higher levels of well-being and culture and breaking down the barriers separating the rich countries from the poor, there is the paradoxical reverse situation that we confront an ever increasing deterioration of the spiritual condition and the environment in which we live, together with the possible outbreak of social conflicts and wars with irreparable consequences for all.\n83.\tSince 1945 the world has been seeking an optimum balance other than the balance of terror. To replace this apocalyptic equilibrium by an innate equilibrium of peace stemming from the harmonic union of those values and power that culture and technology today place at the service of man is the highest humanistic goal of our age.\n84.\tToday, for the first time in history, social tensions are frequently world-wide in scope and, hence, conflicting national policies can no longer control events.\n85.\tFrom this fact there are those who have drawn the conclusion that the order of sovereign States is incapable of solving the problems of the human community. And yet it is one thing to admit realistically that many of the great problems of our time require the concerted action of the international community and quite another to think that such problems can be solved only through the disappearance of States as sovereign and independent entities. It is precisely the effective recognition of that sovereignty and independence of States which makes possible the very existence of an international order and with it the possibility of effectively tackling the problems of peace and formulating the great objectives of the community of nations.\n86.\tUndoubtedly, the great revolution in the communications media which has narrowed the gap between cultures and peoples, the supranational transmission of news to the public at large, the broadening of markets to world-wide dimensions, the international confrontation of ideologies, the tendency of conflicts to become global in character and the universal incidence of tension between developed and under-developed nations have created a political arena which is truly universal.\n87.\tBut there is a great danger to world peace, namely, that such possibilities of coexistence, communication and exchange on a world scale will be abused by being employed for politically narrow, economically egotistical and even strictly subversive objectives.\n88.\tIn the face of those ideas, more or less tainted with imperialism, each country has the right to find its own reply to the challenge of our times. A plurality of options must be allowed to exist; otherwise, there might well arise large-scale intervention and conflict, whose outcome would be a general world confrontation, after which no one would remain to tell the tale.\n89.\tReciprocal recognition of the sovereignty of each State demands maximum respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all nations. This respect is the essential postulate governing, without any discrimination whatsoever, the relations of Spain with other nations.\n90.\tPeace, die roots of which spring from justice, is guaranteed by security.\n91.\tIn today's world, security can no longer be built upon die counterpoise between opposing blocs. Spain believes that the rigid division of the world into hostile blocs must be replaced by the institutionalisation of large geographical areas of security. The Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe reflects this idea.\n92.\tHowever, political realism demands that we should not cling to strict geographical considerations. European security, for instance, cannot be divorced from Mediterranean security. It is for that reason that, together with other nations, Spain believes that if security of that sea is not guaranteed, European security will be not only Utopian but also highly dangerous and will reflect hegemonistic claims.\n93.\tThe structure of security that exists at present in the Mediterranean is based exclusively on the confrontation between great Powers, with the consequent loss of autonomy for the coastal States. Although the system is imperfect, we cannot today conceive of the possibility of demilitarizing or neutralizing the Mediterranean. It would, however, appear possible to combine the imperatives of a global strategy with an agreement between the Mediterranean countries which would enable them to participate in the shaping of their own security. In this connexion several non-European Mediterranean countries have expressed the wish to be heard at the Conference on European Security and Co-operation, and Spain has echoed that legitimate desire by advocating, in July in Helsinki and recently in Geneva, that those countries be heard.\n94.\tSpain also has a vital interest in the drafts for a new definition of the principles that are to govern security and co-operation in the North Atlantic region. My country is a part of that zone for geographic, historical, strategic and economic reasons. Spain, as part of Europe and as a sincere friend of the United States, is ready and determined to play its part in the Atlantic area in favour of peace and security.\n95.\tSpain's European side is one of its most important historical aspects; hence our Government wishes sincerely to contribute to the construction of Europe by contributing its cultural and human values as well as material resources, which in the last decade have developed in an unprecedented manner.\n96.\tSpain views with satisfaction the process of European integration, and understands that the political unity of Europe must be forged on the strength of the recognition of an enriching diversity and the contribution of original and autonomous solutions by the various nations constituting it.\n97.\tFor the elementary reason of human solidarity, Europe cannot entrench itself in its own economic well being, but rather must combine and redouble its efforts to help the developing countries. To the extent that this open and generous attitude gains ground, the judgement of history will determine the positive and constructive contribution that is being made to European co-operation.\n98.\tBut in this Europe that so ambitiously looks towards the future, there remains, incredible as it may seem, one last vestige of the colonial past \u2014 Gibraltar. The case of Gibraltar is a clear example of the fact that security, both in the global and regional sense, is shaken if one nation decides, against all reason, to base its own security on the insecurity of others.\n99.\tThe principle of security implies the duty of preventing risks from extending to third parties. Gibraltar, on more than one occasion, has exposed Spain to involvement under all kinds of dire pressures in the great wars of this century. It must therefore cease to constitute for my country such a catastrophic risk.\n100.\tGibraltar is an English colony maintained as a military base. It is a strategic point which places Spain's security in jeopardy vis-\u00e0-vis other Powers and prevents us from contributing more effectively to security in the Mediterranean, when in fact our desire is to convert a point of friction into an area of co-operation for the benefit of security in general.\n101.\tThe United Nations has been considering the question of Gibraltar for 10 years. As a European statesman recently said, it is a big problem on a small bit of land-less than five square kilometres of rock. The territory is out of all proportion to the United Kingdom's defiance of the United Nations and its affront to Spain by refusing to decolonize this small area of land.\n102.\tWhy will Great Britain not apply to Gibraltar the principle of decolonization which, after serious upheavals, violent repressions and countless victims, it has put into effect in more than 20 territories vital to its imperial strategy and economic hegemony? Great Britain has sequestered an integral part of Spanish soil of no economic or military value without Spain's co-operation, continually has recourse to intrusions into Spanish air and sea space to prolong an indefensible legal and physical situation, and abuses the often expressed desires for peace of my Government.\n103.\tEver since the eleventh session of the General Assembly, we have repeated our just claims to Gibraltar. Ever since the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples approved on 16 October 1964 the consensus on Gibraltar  up to resolution 2429 (XXIII) .of 18 December 1968, the General Assembly set the date, long past, of 1 October 1969 for decolonization, while at the same time the United Nations has established a doctrine on Gibraltar, the basic points of which are the following: (a) the question of Gibraltar is of a colonial nature; (b) an end should be put to it through negotiations between Spain and Great Britain; (c) resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization applies in this case, specifically its paragraph 6, which regards as essential the principles of national unity and territorial integrity; (d) the interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar must be protected on termination of the colonial status. That is the United Nations doctrine on Gibraltar.\n104.\tOn the basis of this doctrine, in May of 1966 the Spanish Government initiated negotiations which had .to be broken off in March 1968 due to the evident lack of willingness to negotiate on the part of Great Britain as demonstrated, among others, by the following facts.\n105.\tFirst, the United Kingdom declared on 12 July 1966 that the territory on which it had installed a military airport was also under British sovereignty. This area was between the wall arbitrarily put up by the English in 1909, despite Spanish protests, and the confines of the \\\"city and castle of Gibraltar, together with its port, defences and fortresses\\\", which is all that was ceded under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.\n106.\tThe second fact that shows the lack of desire on the part of the United Kingdom Government to negotiate is the following. On 5 January 1967 the British claimed the right to use Spanish air space in connexion with the operation of the military airport at Gibraltar.\n107.\tThirdly, although disapproved by the Special Committee, a referendum was held on 10 September 1967-10 days after the Committee's condemnation. The referendum was also repudiated three months later by the General Assembly in resolution 2353 (XXII) of 19 December 1967.\n108.\tDespite these serious unilateral British actions, and as a manifestation of goodwill and in order to facilitate a solution of the problem, the Spanish Government has, since November 1969, been attempting by every means to create an appropriate climate for dialogue and understanding with Great Britain. That has resulted in 10 meetings between the Foreign Ministers of both countries, at all of which the problem of Gibraltar has been dealt with at length.\n109.\tDuring the course of almost four years, therefore, Spain has attempted to open the way to negotiations with a view to achieving the decolonization of Gibraltar, at all tunes bearing in mind the interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar \u2014 some 20,000 people-while searching for an understanding with the United Kingdom likely to serve Spanish-British common interests of both nations which hold out such great prospects for friendly co-operation.\n110.\tUnfortunately, the only results of all those talks has been the proof that Great Britain continues to be unwilling to negotiate, inasmuch as it has rejected outright the generous Spanish proposals, alleging that they imply a transfer of sovereignty, a concept that is inadmissible to the British Government in spite of the fact that, in the case of Gibraltar, decolonization, according to United Nations doctrine, consists of ceding sovereignty over that colony or military base and reincorporating it into Spanish territory.\n111.\tTo conceal its stubborn attitude, the United Kingdom Government has attempted to use die people of Gibraltar as a screen and to disregard the fact that the 1967 referendum was, as I have said, was rejected by the United Nations in its resolution 2353 (XXII).\n112.\tThis is a key point that must be kept very much in mind because that referendum was ludicrous. How can a military base seek self-determination? But the farce is even more obvious if we remember that, when the British occupied the Gibraltar fortress, the original Spanish population was forced to leave. That vacuum was filled over the course of the years by people of different origins, arriving at various times. The United Kingdom never allowed my people to return to Gibraltar. Even those Spaniards whom it used as an effective labour force for many years were compelled to return every night to their homes in towns outside the confines of the fortress-colony.\n113.\tWith regard to Gibraltar, Great Britain has always tried to protect itself behind third parties, using them as a cover. Thus, it occupied the fortress militarily in the name of Archduke Charles of Austria, a pretender to the Spanish throne during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Archduke lost the war, but the British remained in Gibraltar. On taking it they invoked the specious argument that they were defending the cause of the Archduke. Now that the time has come for decolonization they use the inhabitants of Gibraltar.\n114.\tUnited Nations resolutions are addressed to the United Kingdom but it disregards them and in this forum claims and seeks to make us believe that if there is anyone that must abide by them it is the Gibraltarians and not the colonial Power. At other times it claims full competence in the matter. Thus, for example, we find the following in the British commentaries of 21 July 1966, in reply to the Spanish claim:\n\\\"The Spanish supposition that Her Majesty's Government believes the people of Gibraltar can dispose of the territory of Gibraltar according to their wishes is in error. It has stated on many occasions, specifically in White Paper 2632, that sovereignty over Gibraltar lies with the British Crown.\\\"\n115.\tAgain, the United Kingdom Government, through an Order-in-Council, inserted in the preamble to the so-called 1969 Constitution of Gibraltar certain clauses according to which, in the final analysis, it could not return sovereignty to Spain without the consent of the inhabitants, thus ignoring both the Treaty of Utrecht and United Nations resolutions.\n116.\tAll of this shows that the British attitude could not be more contradictory. In its way of dealing-or rather, of not dealing-with the Gibraltar problem, it is acting like the Sun King: \\\"1 am Gibraltar\\\". However, when urged to decolonize the fortress, it washes its hands of the affair, as if Gibraltar came under a sovereignty other than its own.\n117.\tThis manipulation of interests alien to its own ends is shown in the supposed defence of the inhabitants, for whom Spain has offered, and is willing to grant, every kind of legal and economic safeguard.\n118.\tThe British Government stubbornly asserts that the Gibraltarians are unanimous in rejecting the Spanish point of view on Gibraltar. That is not true. On many occasions eminent Gibraltarians have spoken out-in fact, even recently, before the British Governor of the fortress himself- calling for a negotiated solution with Spain.\n119.\tThe British Government, as the only valid interlocutor, has received from the Spanish Government extremely generous offers for the inhabitants of Gibraltar. But Great Britain has rejected our offers without letting the inhabitants of Gibraltar know of them, and has made no counter-offers or proposals. By adopting that negative and closed attitude, Great Britain is materially strangling the life of the inhabitants and crippling their future development, which would be enormous once they returned to the nation whose language they speak and of which they are geographically and economically a part in view of the enormous rate of growth of the Spanish economy which, according to the reports of international economic organizations, will continue in the coming years.\n120.\tWe consider the people of Gibraltar as our brothers. Spain pledges itself solemnly before this General Assembly to guarantee, once the era of colonization ends in Gibraltar, the preservation of the present political, administrative and judicial organization in Gibraltar with only the substitution of the British by the corresponding Spanish authorities, a substitution that is inherent in decolonization and the consequent transfer of sovereignty over the territory.\n121.\tThus the people of Gibraltar will enjoy a special status' of legislative, judicial, administrative and financial autonomy, which will respect their choice in matters of nationality, their present civic rights and freedoms, their local government and their status as a free port.\n122.\tSimilarly, Spain solemnly undertakes to ensure, as a minimum, the per capita income which the inhabitants may have achieved, and their annual growth rate, to maintain the level of income of its active population, social security benefits and other legitimate interests, all of which would be guaranteed by both Spain and the United Nations and not, as they are at present, subjected to a colonial status depending solely upon Great Britain.\n123.\tOur delegation in the debates in the Fourth Committee will elaborate on that offer.\n124.\tSpain reserves the right to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve the decolonization of Gibraltar and once again proclaims that it is sincerely ready to negotiate constructively if and when the British Government shows a true wish to negotiate. Our position cannot be clearer, firmer, nor more generous.\n125.\tI have dwelt on this question of Gibraltar at some length because, however unbelievable it may seem, neither British nor Gibraltarian public opinion knows the true Spanish position. The silence of the British press was thunderous when I addressed the meetings of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe on 4 July last on the question of Gibraltar. I cherish the hope that the words I have spoken before this General Assembly on the Gibraltar question, a matter that is so vital for relations between the two countries, will merit the attention of the British press, radio and television.\n126.\tSpain's position on the Middle East is one of co-operating in the re-establishment of a just and stable peace in that area.\n127.\tPrime determining factors of our policy are the sincere belief that the acquisition of territory by force is unlawful and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n128.\tThe friendship of Spain with the Arab world is a factor of peace in the Mediterranean area and one of the constant factors in our history. Spain believes that United Nations resolutions on this subject should be applied inasmuch as they offer a useful basis for a just solution to that conflict.\n129.\tTwo factors are of special interest to the Spanish Government in connexion with the peaceful settlement of the Middle East question: the situation of the Palestinian people and the future of Jerusalem. Spain will take a realistic stand vis-\u00e0-vis any proposals, whatever their origin, designed to guarantee the legitimate rights of that people and to safeguard the universality of the Holy City. For we believe that there can be no definitive solution to the Middle East question without a solution to those two problems.\n130.\tIt has been a commonplace to say that the countries of Spanish America have a great future. I would add that that future has already begun, perhaps with the upheavals that sometimes accompany a new birth.\n131.\tThe reasons for which Spain feels so closely and fraternally tied to the destinies of the peoples of Spanish America are many. They are the noble ties of a common culture, common traditions and common ancestry. It is for that reason that we have never permitted, and shall never permit, differences of ideology or political systems to interfere with the normal relations between our countries. One does not impose conditions on one's brother to love him.\n132.\tThe problems of Spanish America are the problems of the developing countries. We defend the right of nations to find the most appropriate solutions to their problems, in keeping with the temperament, the social conditions, the\n\nhistoric destiny of each people, without foreign interference and without the imposition of stereotyped solutions.\n133.\tSpain places at the disposal of those sister nations its own modest but valid experience, experience it has acquired in its own fight for development and its own search for a better quality of life. A network of cooperative agreements involving the furnishing of experts and capital goods and the acceptance of technicians and scholars has been extended across the Atlantic, and links in that network are becoming stronger as time passes.\n134.\tAn example of this close and effective co-operation is the Conference of Ministers for Planning and Development, which met in Madrid last May and which now, after its institutionalization, has become a forum for the periodic exchange of views and the adoption of mutual agreements. Spain carries out with pleasure its duty to co-operate in the development of the peoples of Spanish America, and this for elementary reasons of solidarity and profound feelings of brotherhood.\n135.\tIt is in that same spirit that I wish to reaffirm the ties that bind Spain to Portugal, a country with which we share the Iberian peninsula in a spirit of brotherly respect that dates back many centuries.\n136.\tThe image of that peace which humanity clamours for today requires the renunciation of aggression, even the kind that on the surface does not use force; but it also calls for the creation of minimal co-operative relations, excluding panic and the mistrust under which the younger generation have grown up. Many of them are deserting communal tasks when faced by a world that they regard as badly structured.\n137.\tThe principles of mutual respect, equilibrium and security, the idea of peaceful coexistence in its strictest sense of positive co-operation, are necessary but insufficient in themselves to contemporary man because of the many vast problems that beset us. I am referring to the paucity of means to meet the most elementary needs of many peoples when so much is absorbed by the well-labelled \\\"industry of death\\\". I am referring also to the energy crisis, to the ever-growing danger of an ecology imbalanced, to the chronic instability of our monetary system-to mention but some of the most important. Because of their intensity, their acceleration and their extensive repercussions, those problems go far beyond mere national interests and require a global strategy if the human race is to survive.\n138.\tUnless we react in time in the face of the hunger of many hundreds of millions of human beings and the slow erosion of the possibilities of life on our planet we expose ourselves to great conflicts, bringing in their wake irreparable damage.\n139.\tThe construction of an integrated peace demands today that we search far beyond mere formulas of self-security or peaceful coexistence. It demands the definition of a great policy of co-operation for the future good of the whole of mankind.\n140.\tIn short, only the firm and common will to overcome the multiple problems of peace at this universal cross-roads of this our only earth will be the most effective proof of the true unity of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeff83.\tMr. President, I am very pleased to be-able to add the congratulations of the Moroccan delegation to those that have already been addressed to you. The Assembly's choice this year with regard to its presidency is a manifestation of the general esteem and respect that you have acquired in the course of a long career, a goodly part of which has been in the service of this Organization. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil stated at the opening of this session on behalf of the whole of Latin America [2124th meeting, para. 2] it is the expression of a pride which we share with him and which he has voiced on behalf of us all with spontaneity and talent.\n84.\tSince the United Nations displays the truth of its universalise character and its enrichment through diversity every year, it must congratulate itself on being able to count three new Members with differing political heritages and political and cultural horizons. The Moroccan delegation welcomes with sincere satisfaction the delegations of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and hopes to develop and expand the most cordial and extensive cooperation with these delegations.\n85.\tBut if each admission of new Members is in itself a source of satisfaction for the United Nations, may I be permitted to say that there are cases where such an admission assumes the dimensions of an event that is rich in significance both historical and political. The admission of the two German States is one of them. The whole of the post-war period has been marked for Europe and for the world by the complexity of the German question, and Europe and the rest of the world have had to display much courage, political intelligence and patience in order to save  \u2014  on numerous occasions, and sometimes at the very edge of the precipice \u2014 the peace and international security which the confrontation between East and West, particularly in connexion with Germany, have been endangering at every moment. The long diplomatic path that has led to the present happy stage is a positive sign of the reality of a certain detente, first in Europe and also in other parts of the world. We are gratified at this turn of events for the German nation and the two States representing it, with which Morocco is maintaining relations of profound friendship and mutually advantageous co-operation. We are happy in this respect also for Europe, where Morocco has on two occasions lost many of its sons and thus cannot fail to be legitimately concerned for its destiny. We are gratified also at the peace, whose fragility we have felt so frequently both on the Rhine and on the Elbe, consolidation of which in Europe today should make it possible to hope for its extension to other regions of the world where it is still only a desire.\n86.\tIf the itinerary that has been followed in the efforts towards detente during the whole of this quarter-century has for some been limited to the brilliant encounters of Peking, Moscow, Paris and Washington, it is in fact a long process in which, for a long time and at serious risk, certain countries have participated \u2014 countries whose contributions for safeguarding peace were no less efficacious even though patient and discreet. The policy of coexistence and non-alignment \u2014 the only possible policy for all those for whom the confrontation of the two blocs ran the risk of affecting their sovereignty, compromising their independence or affecting their territorial integrity \u2014 was not only a defensive policy involving the preservation of their own interests, but a policy of intervention on the world scene every time that the great Powers were unable to emerge from a crisis save through a move that might lead them towards war. And if today it is necessary to say that the great Powers have rescued peace in Peking, Moscow, Paris and Washington, it must be recognized that others, too, have saved peace when it was indeed endangered in Indochina, Berlin, Suez and Cuba. .The detente is in fact the result of all these efforts, which since 1947 to this day have converged, despite different approaches, towards the primary importance of dialogue and of its prevalence over confrontation and conflict.\n87.\tIf the flowering of this atmosphere of detente is the result of the common efforts of all the forces favouring peace, its strengthening and its effective translation into new international realities must even more so be the common task of all. The tranquillity, however relative and fragile, which prevails today in international relations has engendered sufficient hope for the action of the leaders of the world to be the subject of vigilant attention and for their responsibility to be submitted to the most rigorous scrutiny and judgement.\n88.\tNo conscience, however lofty it may be, and however satisfied it may be over its action for peace, can today claim total tranquillity as long as this peace is limited essentially to arrangements which preserve only national interests, however respectable these may be, to the exclusion. even temporarily, of the imperatives of a generalized peace applied to all continents taken together. The most determined optimism over the relaxation of the world crisis still conflicts in reality with a picture of the international situation which is not entirely a rosy one.\n89.\tOf course, the improvement in relations among the great Powers engenders hope, inasmuch as their antagonisms have been an essential source of tension. It is also true that certain regions of the world, torn by conflicts which, directly or indirectly, engaged their interests as Powers, today are finding tranquillity and dialogue, which have now replaced war. It is also true that certain countries divided by considerations which are not of their own making are progressively finding certain objective conditions which are bringing their peoples towards this fundamental virtue of seeking their national unity in spite of all the vicissitudes. As we look back at recent history we must view this new situation as immense progress.\n90.\tBut is this sufficient reason for proclaiming everywhere, on all occasions, that peace has arrived, when numerous regions of the world continue to be denied even the first signs of it? Who can deny that the situation in the Middle East remains a major obstacle towards an improvement of the present atmosphere in international relations? Peace-building is certainly an enterprise that requires sustained effort and long patience, and progress towards a solution presupposes the progressive elimination of all obstacles of so-called secondary importance. But it is difficult to admit that there is a hierarchy of peace and that certain peoples deserve it on a priority basis, while others must resign themselves to a tragic destiny until better times arrive.\n. The political and diplomatic impasse in which the Middle East situation has bogged down and the attitude of semi-indifference on the part of the great Powers vis-4-vis this situation, may tend to substantiate the thesis that peace can be a tangible reality only because it remains at the level of the higher interests of the great Powers. The Middle East crisis seems to be held in abeyance and seems to serve as a test-tube in which experiments would be conducted concerning some sort of formula for detente or common harmony. But any crisis situation that does not improve only worsens, by the very nature of things.\n92. The persistence of Israel in its refusal to implement a single one of the United Nations decisions, the constant reinforcement of its military potential, and the measures of all kinds aimed at the permanent organization of life in the occupied Territories and the entrenchment of Zionist immigration into-Arab lands are factors not likely to facilitate the pursuit of a peaceful solution.\n93.\tSo in whose interest is it to allow this situation to deteriorate? If one were to analyse the various political and moral responsibilities within the international community, one would realize without any difficulty that our Organization has constantly condemned Israeli aggression, rejected the principle of the acquisition of territory by violence, and has called for the evacuation of such territories.\n94.\tThe efforts made by the representative of the Secretary- General, the Secretary-General himself, the Security Council and the General Assembly, are still treated with contempt by the Israeli authorities. Israel, whose propaganda is based essentially on the beguiling of international opinion, cannot today boast of having any favourable audience or of finding indulgence or understanding in world public opinion.\n95.\tThe OAU, basing itself on its experience in the struggle against colonialism and racism, has finally torn away this veil of lies that Israel had tried to spread over the African continent, where today it can rely only on South Africa and Rhodesia, which constitute with it the last alliance of the racist regimes. The OAU has memorably celebrated its tenth anniversary by its unanimous condemnation of Israel and support of the Arab cause.\n96.\tElsewhere, more than 70 States, gathered last month in Algiers and, representing all the peoples of the world, all systems of government and all ideologies, indicated, in a unanimous, unequivocal resolution, their support for the Arab cause because it is the cause of right, justice and peace.\n97.\tIf the whole of the conscience of the world, organized in various world-wide or regional institutions, is thus united in proclaiming the primacy of law and justice, where, then, is the force that is still blocking this profound desire for peace in the Middle East? What more is required before we consider that it is urgent to begin a serious pursuit of peace? Unfortunately, the same conditions are still present in that region and the slightest spark may ignite a war which, in any case, will not be like the one in 1967.\n98.\tAnd yet, are the great Powers, which either cannot or do not wish yet to impose peace on that region, likely to be able to prevent war for much longer; and, if so, for how long?\n99.\tThe Palestinian people has now crossed the threshold and has taken its destiny into its own hands. Its resolve to fight until final recognition of its legitimate rights is every day taking different forms, and neither Israel nor its allies are today unaware of the dimensions which the direct fight of the Palestinian people has brought into the complexity of the problem.\n100.\tIn the face of this situation, which they can only confront squarely, the Arab States and the Palestinian people have often proved that the constraints of war can still leave room, however modest it may be for the time being, for the sincere search for a peaceful solution that would be in keeping with justice and dignity.\n101.\tIn certain circles, people are still hoping that time is working for them; but if time belongs to those who know how to use it, the Arabs have also learned, although at their own expense, that time could be one of the other means still at their disposal.\n102.\tThe idea that a hotbed of war or tension does not remain indefinitely under control in a region at the level one wishes to maintain it is shared by the peoples of the Middle East, because they have lived this truth throughout the whole of their history, a history that has been highly active. The Middle East crisis, whether it remains latent or proceeds towards an escalation or a peaceful solution, brings about political change in other parts of the world adjacent to it.\n103.\tWould it be possible, for instance, to speak reasonably today of the strengthening of peace in Europe if the Mediterranean basin in the east as well as the west remains the centre of a conflict which is undermining a well- understood concept of European security and economic and cultural co-operation among all the coastal countries of that basin?\n104.\tIf the destiny of Europe has been historically influenced at Poitiers, in Pomerania, on the Rhine, on the Elbe or on the Moskva River, it has also been influenced, with equally important consequences, and sometimes even the most felicitous ones, around the Mediterranean.\n105.\tSimilarly, the destiny of the Arab world has been played out not entirely around the Tiber or the Euphrates, at Acre or at Fez, but also in Anatolia, in Sicily, on the plains of Spain or on the other flank of the Pyrenees.\n106.\tThe elements of the contemporary world around the Mediterranean, although they are different in some of their manifestations, have in no way altered in their profound realities the geopolitical or economic foundations of this historic interpenetration.\n107.\tThis analysis is the basis of the direct or global interest which Morocco has with its neighbours of this sea in Europe's efforts to try to strengthen its security and ensure fruitful co-operation between the States of the continent.\n108.\tWe are happy that the Committee of Co-ordination of the Helsinki Conference has agreed that non-European Mediterranean countries should be invited to express their interest in co-operation with Europe and to display their concern for the indivisible security of the whole of this region. France and Spain were good enough to submit Morocco's request with sympathy and support, since both these countries were aware with us that our historical intimacy, our cultural and economic ties and the imperatives of security on both sides of the western Mediterranean would meet legitimately the interest of Morocco in the security and development of good relations in the region.\n109.\tIt is highly desirable \u2014 and we continue to hope this with all our hearts \u2014 that all our relations with Spain be finally freed from any controversy, the removal of which is not an unrealizable ambition for two countries and peoples that are so close to each other.\n110.\tWe had hoped, and rightly, that at a time when, after the fashion of numerous countries of other parts of the world, we had extended authority over territorial waters where our interests had long suffered, Spain, a powerful and prosperous country, would understand the desire of a country which is trying to take stock of its resources and is mobilizing them all in the service of a people legitimately aspiring to its own development, first of all through the use of its own resources. Other countries, although opposing the legitimacy of such a decision, have accepted our offers of co-operation within a framework where our sovereignty prevails.\n111.\tThe attitude of the Spanish Government \u2014 and we profoundly regret this \u2014 creates a situation where all must exercise a vigilance that is constantly put to the test in order to avoid incidents within our territorial waters, where there is always a risk of confrontation between a modest navy which is protecting its national waters and a belligerent fleet which considers it has to protect, in its own way, fishing boats that are there without any legal basis. Both of us are aware of this danger, and I hope that we shall be able to avoid it if, given our will for certain co-operation, we shall first find respect for our national sovereignty.\n112.\tIn the presence of all the fundamental and real factors which contribute to the establishment of exemplary relations between Spain and ourselves, we are attempting on our side, with good faith and with considerable patience, to arrive at an identical or concordant comprehension concerning the style and the method for the decolonization of the Sahara.\n113.\tIt is a known fact that my country has solemnly proclaimed here, as well as in other international forums, that it was in favour of the principle of self-determination for the populations of that Territory. Spain has supported that principle and in 1969 voted in favour of the resolutions of this Organization which referred to this as the necessary way to decolonise that Territory.\n114.\tHowever, periodically the Spanish Government promulgates laws which modify the structures of the Territory and its status, while proclaiming that such measures are merely stages which advance the Territory towards the desired goal of self-determination. On 22 September last the Spanish Government again promulgated another series of measures in the same spirit.\n115.\tYet, if the Government of Spain were to adopt the same decisions with the co-operation of the United Nations, as called for in numerous resolutions, the prudence of our Organization would doubtless have guaranteed the finality of such measures and the genuine freedom of the expression of the will of the peoples. In admitting that these measures, in their formulation, might constitute progress, Spain's suspicion with regard to co-operation with the United Nations is legitimately upsetting the confidence that it called for from us and that we were prepared to grant it in good faith in a framework which excludes initiative on the part of the administering Power alone.\n116.\tIf my last words concern decolonization and if I expect to be brief on the subject, it is essentially out of deference to President Gowon of Nigeria, the acting President of OAU, who was good enough to agree to come himself and present before the United Nations the preoccupations of the African continent as a whole in regard to the persistence of colonialism and the increasingly clear trends of the strengthening of the racist regimes upon our continent.\n117.\tIn Africa now there is a fact that cannot escape either our Organization or international public opinion \u2014 even less the last adherents of colonialism and racist regimes. This is the existence of an open fight by all the peoples that are still dominated in Africa, who are taking their destiny into their own hands because they see they are obliged to follow the narrow road of a most arduous but most worthy fight for freedom.\n118.\tThis fight has brilliantly led to the demonstration of what can be achieved by the will of a people which at the beginning of this summer was still called as rebellious and which some 40 States have recognized in a few days as the first manifestation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\n119.\tThis twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which coincides with the tenth anniversary of OAU, could not have any better introduction than to remind it that peace cannot redound to the benefit of certain peoples and not confer the same benefit on other peoples whose courage entitles them to live, without delay, in dignity and freedom."

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tMr. President, I begin by expressing Canada's congratulations to you on your election to the presidency. As a representative of Ecuador you have played an active role in the affairs of Latin America and in many areas of world co-operation. We welcome your election and wish you well in carrying out the high duties of leadership of the twenty-eighth session.\n2.\tBy the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, the United Nations has taken another big step towards universality. Canada applauds the breadth of mind-the evolution from stalemate in Europe \u2014 that has made these States welcome within our Organization.\n3.\tCanada also warmly welcomes the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as a full Member. As a country that has long enjoyed close links with the Bahamas, we are confident that the influence of our newest Member will be directed to the highest interests of the United Nations.\n4.\tThe United Nations is becoming universal-is it becoming more effective as an instrument for the attainment of the hopes and aspirations of mankind?\n5.\tSince last we met here one of the architects of this Organization, the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson, died in Canada. In those bright, hopeful days when he and others were engaged in preparing for the birth of the United Nations, Mr. Pearson expressed his fear that when the unifying pressures of world war have subsided, \\\"nationalist pride and prejudice would become strong again-and the narrow concept of the national interest prevail\\\". This judgement on the future was all too quickly proven accurate. Yet as conscious of its imperfections as any man, Mr. Pearson remained convinced that the United Nations was indispensable for even the most slow and painful march away from mass violence and poverty.\n6.\tIt is true that in certain key areas of world security, the United Nations appears to have been bypassed. Improved relations between the great Powers have been achieved essentially through bilateral efforts. Significant steps have been taken towards greater European stability with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and talks of mutual balanced force reductions. The agreement reached bilaterally between India and Pakistan, restoring the conditions of peace and future co-operation in the subcontinent, has been warmly welcomed by the world community.\n7.\tAll of us are, in some degree, affected by these deliberations and decisions, and we recognize that it is the nature of our world's society that all of us do not have the opportunity to contribute to the decision-making as we would wish through this world forum. As the Secretary- General has said in the excellent introduction to his annual report:\n\\\"It is necessary to emphasize that there is no inevitable clash between bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. They are, or should be, mutually supporting, each having particular advantages in particular situations. There is no single road to peace- we have to try all roads.\nBut we should never fail to assert the interest and the primacy of this Organization where it has an indispensable role to play.\n8.\tSuch was Canada's view at the International Conference on Viet-Nam held early this year in Paris. At that Conference I attempted to have the United Nations and the United Nations Secretary-General firmly integrated into the peace observation machinery which was being established at that Conference. These efforts failed.\n9.\tAfter five months of efforts to play the role of an impartial international observer, we withdrew from the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Viet-Nam, frustrated, but by no means embittered.\n10.\tCanada remains prepared to play its part in peacekeeping and peace observation. But we have learned a lesson from our long and frustrating attempts to have these peace-keeping bodies operate objectively. The lesson is this: peace-keeping and peace observation operations stand the best chance of success if they are conducted under the authority of the United Nations Security Council.\n11.\tWe have long assumed that progress in technology, agriculture and communications would mean progress for the underprivileged-a ladder on which people could climb away from hunger, disease and degradation. Yet tragically the word \\\"progress\\\" has come to mock us. The gap between rich and poor is wider than ever. Material achievements are threatened by spiralling world inflation, increasing pollution, unforeseen commodity shortages and by the capricious movements of world finance.\n12.\tFor ill as well as for good, we are increasingly interdependent however jealously we guard our independence. No nation can solve inflation in isolation from the others. No nation can assure the cleanness of air or the purity of water that flow freely across political boundaries. Faced individually by each sovereign State, the challenges are insurmountable. For they are universal problems and they can only be met effectively by universal solutions. The United Nations and its agencies are the only bodies with the authority and with the breadth of representation to meet these challenges.\n13.\tEven collectively these challenges are intimidating. Our experience with the problem of international security - not least, the problem of the Middle East - has taught us that they will not be overcome by conferences alone, by resolutions or by formal votes. They require a profound and clear-headed appreciation of the dimensions of the problems matched by a common will to work co-operatively towards solutions.\n14.\tIn the opinion of the Canadian Government, we must try to avoid barren and abrasive confrontations, which are frequently the result of formal voting processes. Consensus is another and often surer route; it is the technique we are using increasingly at our Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. The results are not dramatic, but they are none the less real. Consensus does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on a reluctant minority which feels its vital interests arc at issue; it means the shared recognition of what should and can be done. I believe we attach far too much importance to the voting scores. Votes are little solace to the hungry.\n15.\tThere have been three successive years of drought in parts of Africa and the Asian subcontinent and of abnormally poor growing seasons in many other parts of the world. Until now only a few food-producing nations, including Canada, held surplus food stocks, and even these existing stocks fluctuated according to weather conditions and international demand. Over the years, efforts to create food banks have proved largely unsuccessful.\n16.\tNow a constructive proposal to ensure world food security has been introduced by the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO].  Its rate of success will be directly proportional to the effort made by each nation to adjust accordingly its food production and stocking policies. I urge every nation-not just those which are the traditional producers of surplus food-to support and co-operate with the FAO in this task. I am sure we have all noted with great interest the proposal made yesterday by the Secretary of State of the United States to convene a world food conference in 1974 [2174th meeting]. We in Canada look forward to discussing this proposal in detail, as it must be our aim to exorcize the dreadful spectre of starvation that menaces millions of human beings.\n17.\tCanada has supported the revitalization which, over the past few years, has been' transforming the Economic and Social Council. A very important change for Canada and for Canada's relations with Europe was our election by the Council to full membership on the Economic Commission for Europe. One of the Council's prime responsibilities is the successful implementation of the action programme adopted by this Assembly for the Second United Nations Development Decade-the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. That Strategy is neither perfect nor immutable. Our appraisal of it has already proven to be a difficult process. It is not, however, an impossible process, and it is one that I hope will become easier as we all become more attuned to its requirements.\n18.\tWe stand in the shadow of other terrifying and universal problems, which can be overcome only by international co-operation. Last Year I spoke out strongly about terrorism and I must do so again. Civilization cries out for effective action by the international community to protect innocent persons against premeditated acts of violence.\n19.\tSince last year international efforts to combat terrorism have gathered some momentum through various international organizations and instrumentalities. Over 86 States have, for example, signed the 1970 Hague Convention on aerial hijacking.  It is encouraging to note the growing list of ratifications of this Convention to combat acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation by States from all the geographical regions and of all political views.\nHowever, terrorism has not been eliminated; it remains a double-edged sword. In its indiscriminate sweep it cuts at the roots of international order, as well as at the hand that wields it. We shall look to all nations and to the General Assembly for action on further measures to combat acts of terrorism.\n20.\tAnd terror has another face: it is that of nuclear poison and the ultimate threat of nuclear holocaust. Although 10 years have elapsed since the partial test-ban Treaty  came into force, there has been no further progress towards achieving the cessation of all nuclear tests-which was the ultimate objective of the signatories of that Treaty. Despite improving prospects for international security resulting from strategic arms limitation agreements, there has, regrettably, been no sign that either of the superpowers is prepared to curtail underground nuclear testing or to enter into active negotiations towards the achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Nor have two great Powers brought to an end nuclear testing in the atmosphere, despite the overwhelming weight of world public opinion.\n21.\tThe global dimension is clear and striking in the use we make of the oceans. Coastal States must protect their economic and environmental interests. On the other hand, there must be certain traditional freedoms on the oceans to facilitate world-wide exchanges. We continue to believe that these elements of the law of the sea are not irreconcilable and that a proper balance can and must be achieved. Canada believes that these rights, which are essential to the well-being of developing and developed coastal States alike, can be exercised in a manner that will take into account the rights of other legitimate users of the sea \u2014 in other words, mankind as a whole. A new international order recognizing both the fundamental rights and the responsibilities of States in respect of the oceans can emerge, and we hope will emerge, from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, if the Governments here assembled have the will.\n22.\tSimilarly, outer space offers exciting prospects of benefit in meeting terrestrial needs in resource management, communications and education. These prospects can be realized for all our peoples only by searching for new and imaginative forms of international co-operation; and I believe that through the United Nations we are well embarked on this search.\n23.\tLast year the General Assembly accepted the Canadian offer to be host to a conference on the urgent and vital question of human settlements [resolution 3003 (XXVII)]: the United Nations Conference- Exposition on Human Settlements is now scheduled for Vancouver in 1976. We were delighted that the General Assembly responded so warmly to this offer and we are encouraged by the co-operation and enthusiasm which have been displayed during the initial planning stages for the conference.\n24.\tThis year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet in parts of southern Africa minority regimes, still deny man's basic rights through stubborn opposition to his Efforts to achieve equality. Canada recognizes the legitimacy of the struggle to win full human rights and self-determination in southern Africa and is studying ways to broaden its humanitarian support for those engaged in these efforts. The most effective way to mark this twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration will be for each nation to redouble its concern to extend human rights to all its people. But concern must be expressed through achievement.\n25.\tMankind's occupation of this planet has been neither wise or far-sighted. Because of our greed, our indifference and our ignorance, we are speeding on a fatal collision course with our environment. The exploitation of our natural resources has been incessant, uncaring and exhaustive. Our air and our waters are becoming foul and poisonous. We seem to be incapable of feeding and clothing adequately our growing millions. So far, we have been unable to live peacefully together or to share our bounty so that all may live a life of dignity.\n26.\tAlthough there is no doubt that in some circumstances the agencies of the United Nations can and do move swiftly, on the whole no one can accuse this Organization of approaching its problems with unseemly haste. Too many items have taken up permanent annual residence on the agenda. Still, some progress is being made. The increasing universality of the United Nations, as I remarked at the beginning of this statement, is an outstanding example.\n27.\tBut it seems to me that there is lacking a sense of urgency-a collective sense of urgency about the towering problems confronting mankind and this Organization. In our race with poverty and starvation, terrorism and armaments, pollution and bigotry, we are too apt to forget that time is not on our side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff35.\tI should like to add my congratulations to those so well expressed by the Minister for External Relations of Brazil to our new President, Ambassador Benites of Ecuador, whose long experience at the United Nations and his many contributions to international law and to the inter-American system all ensure that this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly will have outstanding leadership.\n36.\tI come before you today  \u2014  confirmed in office but two days ago  \u2014  as probably the world's most junior Foreign Minister. That President Nixon should ask me as my first official act to speak here for the United States reaffirms the importance that my country attaches to the values and the ideals of the United Nations.\n37.\tIt would be idle to deny that the American people, like many others, have sometimes been disappointed because this Organization has not been more successful in translating its architects' hopes for universal peace into concrete accomplishments.\n38.\tBut, despite our disappointments, my country remains committed to the goal of a world community. We will continue to work in this Parliament of Man to make it a reality.\n39.\tTwo centuries ago, the philosopher Kant predicted that perpetual peace would come eventually \u2014 either as the creation of man's moral aspirations or as the consequence of physical necessity. What seemed Utopian then looms as tomorrow's reality; soon there will be no alternative. Our only choice is whether the world envisaged in the Charter will come about as the result of our vision or of a catastrophe invited by our short-sightedness.\n40.\tThe United States has made its choice. My country seeks true peace, not simply an armistice. We strive for a world in which the rule of law governs and fundamental human rights are the birthright of all. Beyond the bilateral diplomacy, the pragmatic agreements and dramatic steps of recent years, we envisage a comprehensive, institutionalized peace encompassing all nations, large and small, a peace which this Organization is uniquely situated to foster and to anchor in the hearts of men. This will be the spirit of American foreign policy. This attitude will guide our work in this Organization.\n41.\tWe start from a bedrock of solid progress. Many of the crises that haunted past sessions of the General Assembly have been put behind us. Agreement has been reached on Berlin; there is a cease-fire in the Middle East; the VietNam war has been ended. The rigid confrontation that has dominated international life and weakened this Organization for a quarter of a century has been softened.\n42.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union have perceived a commonality of interests in avoiding nuclear holocaust and in establishing a broad web of constructive relationships. Talks on stretegic arms limitation have already produced historic accords aimed at slowing the arms race and ensuring strategic stability; we have today resumed negotiations on this subject. The positive results we hope for will enhance the security of all mankind.\n43.\tTwo decades of estrangement between the United States and the People's Republic of China have given way to constructive dialogue and productive exchanges. President Nixon has met with the leaders of that great nation; we have agreed to a historic communique  that honestly sets forth both our differences and our common principles; and we have each opened a liaison office in the capital of the other.\n44.\tMany other countries have seized the initiative and contributed, in substance and spirit, to the relaxation of tensions. The nations of Europe and North America are engaged in a conference to further security and cooperation. The two German States have taken their place in this Assembly. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have begun to move towards a welcome reconciliation. North and South Korea are at last engaged in a dialogue which, we hope, will lead to a new era of peace and security between them.\n45.\tYet these achievements, solid as they are, have only made less precarious the dangers and divisions inherited from the post-war era. We have ended many of the confrontations of the cold war; yet, even in this room, the vocabulary of suspicion persists. Relaxation of tensions is justified by some as merely a practical interlude before renewed struggle. Others suspect the emergence of a two- Power condominium. And as tension between the two original blocs has eased, a third grouping increasingly assumes the characteristics of a bloc of its own \u2014 the alignment of the non-aligned.\n46.\tSo the world is uneasily suspended between old slogans and new realities, between a view of peace as but a pause in an unending struggle and a vision of peace as a promise of global co-operation.\n47.\tIn 1946 James Byrnes, the first Secretary of State to address this Assembly, spoke of how the United Nations could \\\"help to break down habits of thinking in national isolation and go far to bring about understanding and tolerance.\\\" \n48.\tThe United States will never be satisfied with a world of uneasy truces, of offsetting blocs, of accommodations of convenience. We know that power can enforce a resigned passivity, but only a sense of justice can enlist consensus. We strive for a peace whose stability rests not merely on a balance of forces, but on shared aspirations. We are convinced that a structure which ignores humane values will prove cold and empty and unfulfilling to most of mankind.\n49.\tThe United States deeply believes that justice cannot be confined by national frontiers; that truth is universal, and not the peculiar possession of a single people or group or ideology; that compassion and humanity must ennoble all our endeavours.\n50.\tIn this spirit we ask this Assembly to move with us from detente among the big Powers to co-operation among all nations, from coexistence to community.\n51.\tOur journey must begin with the world as it is and with the issues now before us. The United States will spare no effort to ease tensions further and to move towards greater stability. We shall continue, in the spirit of the Shanghai communique, our search for a new relationship with the People's Republic of China. We shall work to promote positive trends elsewhere in Asia. The uncertain peace in Indo-China must be strenghened; the world community cannot afford, or permit, a relapse into war in that region. We shall continue to pursue vigorously the building of constructive relationships with the Soviet Union. We shall strive to promote conciliation in Europe. In the negotiations beginning next month we shall seek a reduction of the military forces that have faced each other for so long across that divided continent. We shall give new vigour to our policy of partnership in the Western hemisphere. We shall honour our pledge to promote self- determination, economic development and human dignity across the continent of Africa. We shall press on with strategic arms limitations talks. We consider them crucial for security and stability in this period. We shall search for solutions to the world-wide problem of conventional weapons, which drain our resources and fuel the fires of local conflict.\n52.\tIn all these efforts the United States will be guided by certain fundamental principles.\n53.\tWe have no desire for domination. We will oppose \u2014 as we have consistently opposed throughout this century \u2014 any nation that chooses this path. We have not been asked to participate in a condominium; we would reject such an appeal if it were made.\n54.\tWe will never abandon our allies or our friends. The strengthening of our traditional ties is the essential foundation for the development of new relationships with old adversaries.\n55.\tWe will work for peace through the United Nations as well as through bilateral relationships.\n56.\tWe recognize our special obligation, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to assist in the search for just solutions in those parts of the world now torn by strife, such as the Middle East. While we cannot substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved, we are prepared to use our influence to generate a spirit of accommodation and to urge the parties towards practical progress.\n57.\tBut progress on the traditional agenda is not enough. The more we succeed in solving political problems, the more other and perhaps deeper challenges emerge. As the world grows more stable we must confront the question of the ends of detente. As the threat of war recedes, the problem of the quality of life takes on more urgent significance.\n58.\tWe are, in fact, members of a community drawn by modern science, technology and new forms of communication into a proximity for which we are still politically unprepared. Technology daily outstrips the ability of our institutions to cope with its fruits. Our political imagination must catch up with our scientific vision. This is at the same time the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity of this Organization.\n59.\tThe pollution of the skies, the seas and the land is a global problem.\n60.\tThe increased consumption of cereals has reduced world food reserves to dangerously low levels.\n61.\tThe demand for energy is outrunning supply, and the need for technological innovation is urgent.\n62.\tThe growth of the world's economy is inhibited by restrictive trading blocs and an insufficiently flexible international monetary system.\n63.\tThe exploitation of the resources of the ocean beds, which is essential for the needs of burgeoning populations, requires global co-operation lest it degenerate into global contention.\n64.\tChallenges of this magnitude cannot be solved by a world fragmented into self-contained nation States or rigid blocs.\n65.\tI do not intend, today, to cover the whole agenda of international co-operation. Rather, I shall speak briefly of some illustrative areas for common action. I pledge the readiness of the United States to solve these problems co-operatively and to submit proposals Jmed at their resolution.\n66.\tFirst, a world community requires the curbing of conflicts. The United Nations, in its 28-year history, has not always been idle in this sphere. In Indonesia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, the Congo, and Cyprus, it has shown its ability for effective fact-finding, mediation and peace-keeping missions. This central aspect of the United Nations work must be strengthened. On a small planet, so bound together by technology and so interdependent economically, we can no longer afford the constant eruption of conflict and the danger of its spread.\n67.\tYet, in recent years, we have found ourselves locked in fruitless debates about the inauguration of peace-keeping operations and over the degree of control the Security Council would exercise over peace-keeping machinery \u2014 an impasse which has ensured that permanent peace-keeping machinery would not come into being. Each peace-keeping unit we have formed has been an improvisation growing out of argument and controversy.\n68.\tWe should delay no longer. The time has come to agree on peace-keeping guidelines so that this Organization can act swiftly, confidently and effectively in future crises. To break the deadlock, the United States is prepared to consider how the Security Council can play a more central role in the conduct of peace-keeping operations. If- all countries concerned approach this problem with a desire to achieve a co-operative solution, the United Nations can achieve a major step forward during this session.\n69.\tSecondly, a world community must have the widest possible membership. The exclusion of any qualified State denies representation not only to Governments, but to peoples. Membership in this body should be a step towards reconciliation, not a source of conflict. The time has come for North and South Korea to be offered their rightful place here without prejudice to a future evolution towards unification. In this spirit also, we support the permanent membership of Japan in the Security Council.\n70.\tThirdly, a world community must assure that all its people are fed. The growing threat to the world's food supply deserves the urgent attention of this Assembly. Since 1969, global consumption of cereals has risen more rapidly than production; stocks are at the lowest levels in years. We now face the prospect that, even with bumper crops, the world may not rebuild its seriously depleted reserves in this decade.\n71.\tNo one country can cope with this problem. The United States therefore proposes that a world food conference should be organized under United Nations auspices in 1974 to discuss ways to maintain adequate food supplies and to harness the efforts of all nations to meet the hunger and malnutrition resulting from natural disasters and that nations in a position to do so offer technical assistance in the conservation of food. The United States is ready to join with others in providing such assistance.\n72.\tFourthly, a world community cannot remain divided between the permanently rich and the permanently poor. Let us therefore resolve that this Assembly, this year, initiate a search, drawing on the world's best minds, for new and imaginative solutions to the problems of development. Our search must be candid and realistic, but it must also be free of peremptory demands, antagonistic propositions, ideological confrontation, or propagandistic rhetoric, or we will surely fail.\n73.\tThe United States is prepared to join this new search, providing freely of the experience gained over two decades. We have learned not to exaggerate our capacity to transform nations, but we have also learned much about what progress is possible. We will participate without pre-conditions, with a conciliatory attitude and a co-operative commitment. We ask only that others adopt the same approach.\n74.\tIn this spirit, the United States is willing to examine seriously the proposal by the distinguished President of Mexico for a charter of the economic rights and duties of States.\\\" Such a document will make a significant and historic contribution if it reflects the true aspirations of all nations; it will accomplish nothing if it is turned into an indictment of one group of countries by another. To command general support, and to be implemented, the proposed rights and duties must be defined equitably and take into account the concerns of industrialized as well as of developing countries. The United States stands ready to define its responsibilities in a humane and co-operative spirit.\n75.\tFifthly, a world community must harness science and technology for the benefit of all. We must begin to match our remarkable technological skills with our equally remarkable technological needs. We must find the means for the co-operative and judicious development of energy resources. We must responsibly confront the problems of population growth, which are fast pushing humanity towards the limits of what our earth can sustain. We must embark on a new scientific revolution to increase agricultural productivity in all lands. No field of human endeavour is so dependent upon an open world for its advancement, no field is so in need of international co-operation to cope with its potential dangers.\n76.\tAre we prepared to accept the imperatives of a global society and infuse our labours with new vision? Or shall we content ourselves with a temporary pause in the turmoil that has racked our century? Shall we proceed with one-sided demands and sterile confrontation? Or shall we proceed in a spirit of compromise produced by a sense of common destiny? We are convinced that we must move from hesitant co-operation born of necessity to genuine collective effort based on common purpose.\n77.\tIt is a choice no country can make alone. We can repeat old slogans or strive for new hope. We can fill the record of our proceedings with acrimony, or we can dedicate ourselves to dealing with man's deepest needs. The ideal of a world community may be decried as unrealistic, but great constructions have always been ideals before they can become realities. Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to this noblest of all possible goals and achieve at last what has so long eluded us: true understanding and tolerance among mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff56.\t This year the General Assembly once again looks to Latin America to provide a distinguished figure to preside over its proceedings. The honour, Sir, has fallen to you, and to your country. May I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your assumption of this high and responsible office, and also to express my confidence that our deliberations will be guided into constructive and productive channels with your experienced hand at the helm?\n57.\tThe membership of the United Nations at this moment stands at 135. This is a large membership when compared with the 51 States which signed the Charter as founder Members In 1945, of which my country was one. One of the objectives then, and in the intervening years, was to strive for universality in the Organization so that \\\"We, the peoples,\\\" of the Organization could justifiably speak as \\\"We, the peoples\\\" of the world. That desirable objective has been brought a step nearer realization by the admission during the current Assembly session of three new Members \u2014 the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the German Democratic Republic \u2014 representing between them a considerable population and a diversity of cultural, social, historical and political backgrounds and philosophies.\n58.\tThe admission of the two Germanys is the fruit of a policy of detente actively pursued in Europe, and is a striking example of the fact that accommodation can be reached between parties with widely differing political persuasions and conflicting interests, provided that the will is there and the effort is conscientiously and patiently made. It is a lesson from which we can all profit for the lessening of hostility is conducive to the buttressing of peace, which is the raison d'etre of this Organization.\n59.\tThe spirit of detente abroad was one of the main themes of the statements made in the general debate at last year's session of the General Assembly. The passage of time enables us to consider its consequences in better perspective and to take stock. Those countries which have adopted the course of detente appear to be consolidating their contacts and relationships to their mutual benefit and, in many ways, to the benefit of others. At the same time, some other Governments with seemingly irreconcilable differences have begun to follow their lead and to open up a cautious dialogue with one another. This attitude is highly commendable and ought to be endorsed and conscientiously emulated by all of us, for the single, overriding imperative of international relations is international peace. This is a fact which should be borne in mind, particularly by smaller countries, for they, too, have a duty to work towards a relaxation of tension after the example set by the major Powers. It would be a tragedy if the world should move out from under the shadow of major-Power confrontation only to be faced with the threat of increasing conflicts of smaller scale. Such a tragedy must be averted by responsible leadership in this Organization, as well as by the individual efforts of each one of us.\n60.\tIn its external relations, South Africa, for its part, remains willing to pursue all avenues of contact and communication, with the object of relaxing tensions and creating conditions favourable for the solution of problems of concern to us. Where our efforts in this direction have been reciprocated the results have been encouraging. South Africa remains ready to enter into discussions with any country, on the African continent or elsewhere, which shares our approach, an approach rooted firmly in the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes. South Africa harbours no aggressive intentions against any country; hence our willingness to conclude non-aggression pacts with other States in Africa. Accusations that we have committed acts of aggression are totally unfounded. We are irrevocably opposed to the use of force and violence in international relations.\n61.\tIt is deplorable that force and violence in the form of indiscriminate attacks against innocent, uninvolved and unsuspecting individuals and groups should have become a characteristic of our times. Terrorism takes many forms, but a common component is the utter disregard by the perpetrators for established authority and their determination to subvert, and if possible destroy, constitutionally established law and order, both national and international. It is doubtful that the international law of sovereign States can survive in a meaningful way if the international community should fail to discharge its responsibilities to curb this evil. It is a source of concern to my Government that so little progress has been made on this urgent world problem in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, which held its first session in July and August this year. My Government considers that the Assembly should urgently commence drafting a general convention on terrorism. We cannot afford to evade or to confuse the issue while terrorism is rampant.\n62.\tIf we, the international community, resolve that we shall settle our political differences without having recourse to force, if we renounce irresponsible methods of terror and violence, and if we continue to make progress in disarming a world bristling with lethal weapons, we can direct our energies and our resources to the solution of the world's other pressing problems, which are many. A number of these are problems of a non-political nature, and confront mankind as a whole. I suggest that the most basic problem of all, and one which encompasses a host of supplementary problems, is how in the future we shall balance the world's rapidly increasing population against our planet's dwindling resources, taking into account the rising economic and social expectations of the very same people whose numbers are increasing at a phenomenal and unprecedented rate. We have, for example, already been given a disturbing reminder this year of the difficulties of providing everywhere the most elementary of man's needs: food. The spectre of famine was raised by the devastating drought in West Africa, end drought conditions, floods and other natural disasters elsewhere. Let me at once express South Africa's sympathy to those who have suffered as a result. These disasters and the consequential threat of famine should not be seen as isolated occurrences. They are a foretaste and a warning of the problems that will have to be dealt with in the future.\n63.\tAnother serious problem with which mankind will have to deal is the potential energy crisis. It is necessary that there be the closest co-operation between the developed and the developing nations in the consideration of this matter, for, after making due allowance for the need to protect the quality of our environment, energy is the key to the material improvement of man's estate. We are faced with the possible gross depletion of the total known reserves of all sources of energy if energy is in future consumed at the rate forecast today. It is, therefore, essential for all of us that the different energy-producing resources of the earth be rationally exploited in the interest of mankind as a whole.\n64.\tNuclear energy undoubtedly occupies a key position in supplying mankind's energy needs of the future. Nuclear power reactors which will supply only about 51,000 megawatts of electricity in 1976, are expected to contribute as much as 564,000 megawatts in 1985 and then to double their supply in the space of the next five years. In terms of total world requirements of electricity, nuclear energy is expected to supply 23 per cent by the year 2000 as compared with half of 1 per cent in 1970.\n65.\tSouth Africa is one of the world's major producers of uranium. We possess large exploitable deposits of low- grade uranium and we provide a stable supply of a portion of the world's uranium on a competitive basis. At the present moment we are engaged in assessing our capability of supplying this nuclear fuel in an enriched form since enriched uranium is the fuel for most nuclear powered reactors.\n66.\tHaving said this, let me add that South Africa's atomic energy programme is devoted to peaceful purposes exclusively. It has always been our policy, and it remains our policy, to sell uranium only on condition that the uranium be made subject to International Atomic Energy Agency or equivalent safeguards to ensure that it is not diverted to military purposes. In the same spirit, the uranium enrichment project to which I have just referred will also be applied for peaceful purposes only. To that end, the South African Government proposes to negotiate, at the appropriate time, an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency for the application of safeguards to the enriched uranium produced by the project, so as to ensure that the product is used solely for peaceful purposes.\n67.\tWe believe that this development will not only herald a new era of industrial and economic growth in South Africa but will also enable us to make a contribution to the efforts of the international community to solve the potential world energy problem.\n68.\tMay I at this point digress to refer in a few words to the unfortunate events at Carletonville of which mention has been made in the course of the general debate. The tragic loss of life is deeply regretted. Sympathy with the next of kin was expressed by my Prime Minister and others immediately after the incident. A memorandum compiled by my Mission, in the course of reproduction as an official document,  will place the matter in perspective. Meanwhile I would simply ask that judgement on the incident not be formed purely on the basis of emotion. What transpired at Carletonville will be determined by the judicial inquiry which has been instituted.\n69.\tTurning now to the question of South West Africa, may I say at the outset that my Government has noted with regret the repeated calls of the Security Council to terminate the contacts between South Africa and the Secretary- General. Those contacts represent a voluntary attempt to use the facilities of the United Nations for the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the problem. That is one of the primary purposes of this Organization. Yet the call is now apparently to bypass and to set aside the machinery which the United Nations offers for the peaceful settlement of problems. This must inevitably serve as an encouragement to those who advocate confrontation, force and violence as a means to an end in South West Africa. And that course is being advocated despite the fact that in the 14 months between March 1972 and April 1973 during which contacts were made, more real progress was achieved in the search for a solution to the problem in the United Nations context than in all the preceding years.\n70.\tFor the first time in the history of the Territory, directly as a result of the contacts, representatives of black, white and other groups from throughout the territory have been brought together around the table under the chairmanship of a Prime Minister of South Africa for the purpose of discussing and trying to resolve issues with Territory- wide implications. We consider that this is a significant and important development for, as my Prime Minister has declared, it is the inhabitants of South West Africa themselves who must decide their own future and not South Africa or the United Nations.\n71.\tWe for our part do not consider that we have the right to impose a settlement on the Territory and we do not believe that the United Nations has the right or indeed wishes to impose a settlement on its inhabitants. We shall respect their wishes.\n72.\tWe have indicated that any exercise to ascertain the wishes of the population will not be compromised by any existing political and administrative arrangements. And we have stated, with regard to the question whether individual population groups may suddenly become independent as separate entities, that we do not envisage such an eventuality. We expressed the latter position in dealing with a point raised by the Secretary-General whether the possibility could arise, in the light of South African legislation, that one or other of the population groups might acquire separate independence before the South West African people as a whole had exercised their right to self-determination.\n73.\tWe believe that all this, taken together with the other points set out in the South African statements reproduced in the Secretary-General's reports, constitutes progress in the real sense of the word. South Africa, for its part, is ready to engage in further contacts, for we believe that we ourselves as well as the United Nations should persevere in searching for a solution.\n74.\tWe realize that there are those who believe that progress has been too slow. On the other hand, they too should realize that this is a most complicated and intractable problem and that it cannot therefore be solved overnight. This is fully recognized by the Secretary-General, who stated in his report of 30 April of this year that:\n\\\"Should the Security Council decide to continue these efforts\\\", \u2014 that is, the contacts \u2014 \\\"it should bear in mind my earlier statement to the effect that time and protracted discussion will be required if any progress is to be achieved.\\\" \n75.\tSouth Africa's presence in the Territory is accounted for by the undertaking we have given to ensure that its inhabitants are able and ready to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. We have no designs whatsoever with respect to any part of South West Africa's territory. In the meanwhile, we believe we have a duty to continue to assist in the development of South West Africa in all spheres: economic, social and political. We derive no financial or economic advantage whatsoever from our presence in the Territory. Every cent which accrues from taxation levied on income derived within the Territory, including profits on foreign investments and operations in the Territory, is reinvested in South West Africa for the benefit of all its inhabitants. In addition, South African taxpayers contribute to the Territory's advancement on current account alone \u2014 that is, excluding payments to finance capital projects \u2014 funds which in the last few years have varied between $60 million and $80 million per annum. It will be appreciated that our resources are not unlimited. Moreover, we have responsibilities also to our own peoples in South Africa, where there is an increasing need for funds for development purposes. Nevertheless, we make this Contribution to South West Africa in the genuine belief that it is our duty to do so.\n76.\tOne cannot of course forecast the outcome of the Security Council's consideration of the Secretary-General's latest report. We recognize that the gap separating us, although narrower than it has ever been as a result of our contacts with the Secretary-General, still exists. But we would hope that the Council and this Organization as a whole will be guided by the imperative need for peaceful evolution by consent of those directly concerned, namely, the inhabitants of South West Africa, both black and white. We believe it is crucial that all the segments of the population of South West Africa should be enabled to get together to sort out their problems and to resolve them to their own satisfaction, in a manner consistent with the peaceful objectives of the Charter\n77.\tAs I have indicated, a start has already been made in this direction. We have also been encouraged in this regard, by a series of discussions which have recently taken place and which are continuing between representatives of the white group in South West Africa and representatives of such groups as the Hereros, the Namas and the Damaras as well as of the organization known as the Voice of the People. The latter representatives are among those who are known to be opposed to the South African Government. Nevertheless, they have all in the course of these discussions expressed themselves as favouring dialogue in South West Africa and as being opposed to violence as a means to an end. As an example of these discussions, I may mention that Mr. Clemens Kapuuo of the Hereros and Mr. D. F. Mudge, a member of the Executive Council for South West Africa, met in Windhoek on 24 September. In a joint statement issued shortly thereafter, they declared that they were both in favour of contact and dialogue as a method of solving the problems of South West Africa and that they rejected violence. In the course of their discussions, according to the statement, they exchanged views on matters relating to South West Africa in general. It was clear, the statement added, that both of them wished to promote the interests of their respective peoples and of the peoples of South West Africa as a whole. Further meetings of this nature are envisaged.\n78.\tThese meetings of individuals of differing views and attitudes are an indication of the desire of the inhabitants of the Territory to involve themselves jointly and directly in the future evolution of South West Africa, and we hope that they will receive encouragement to seek progress in this way. We for our part will afford them every encouragement.\n79.\tIn this world of continual change, we recognize and accept the need for change also in areas of our own responsibility. Our policies are anything but rigid or static. My Prime Minister has stated in Parliament that the South African Government is a Government of change, and that it will continue to bring about change in a systematic and orderly way as warranted by changing circumstances and changing requirements. But we believe in change by evolution, not by violence. This is why we attach special importance to the consultations which are continually in progress between the Government and the leaders of the black and other peoples in South Africa.\n80.\tWe have stated on many occasions that our policies provide-for the different black nations in South Africa to achieve self-government in the geographic areas of their jurisdiction and to advance to complete sovereignty and independence in the sense in which this concept is generally understood. In other words, each of them would qualify for membership in this Organization. They are aware that they can negotiate their independence, in the full sense of the word, with the South African Government at any moment of their choice, as the South African Prime Minister has repeatedly stated.\n81.\tEight black nations, totalling more than 14 million people, have already achieved self-government in varying degrees. Six of them have their own Parliament, their own Cabinet and Prime Minister, the latter answerable to their Parliament. The two other black nations, including the 4 million Zulus, have Legislative Assemblies, with executive power vested in an Executive Council. During the course of the last two years, five elections have been successfully held to elect members of these Parliaments. A sixth election is still to be held.\n82.\tArising from this political progress, the South African Government and the Prime Ministers and other leaders of all the various nations are continually in dialogue with each other. Frequent contacts take place at all levels from the Prime Minister downwards and in the private as well as the public sector. In fact, my Prime Minister has, during the seven years of his premiership, held more official discussions with the leaders of these nations than have all his predecessors together. Many of these leaders, moreover, travel abroad and state their positions publicly. Their opinions on matters of detail falling within the over-all objectives of South African policy do not always coincide with the opinions of the South African Government \u2014 but it is their prerogative and duty to put the position of their peoples as they see it. The South African Government regards these contacts and discussions as essential for the promotion of peaceful evolution.\n83.\tOne of our concerns, in this evolutionary process, is the question of human dignity. The South African Government is fully conscious of the importance of recognition and acceptance of the human dignity of the individual, and my Prime Minister has publicly stressed the central position it must take in future political developments in South Africa. Earlier this year in Parliament he said he was at all times prepared to do away with unnecessary measures if these measures stood in the way of healthy relations in South Africa.\n84.\tThere is nothing which exercises the minds of South Africans more than the solution of our own special political problems. It is after all our future we are building and it is our security that is at stake.\n85.\tWe ask the international community to respect our desire to resolve our problems without interference. Let me repeat, however, that we are at all times ready to enter into discussions concerning our internal policies with anyone who is genuinely interested therein. But in the final analysis, it is we ourselves who must solve our problems and solve them we must and shall, whatever the sacrifice, if we are to continue to live in peace and prosperity in South Africa.\n86.\tThis brings me to the end of my prepared statement. Before resuming my seat, may I refer briefly to the efforts made to prevent me from addressing the Assembly. I do not intend to deal with the accusations levelled against my Government in the course of these efforts, for they are irrelevant to the issues before the Assembly. I must, however, totally reject them.\n87.\tWe have witnessed here an attempt to violate the principle of freedom of speech and expression in this august Assembly. It was an attempt to deprive the representative of a Member State of his inherent right to participate in the proceedings of the General Assembly and to state the case of his country. If it had succeeded it would have put the clock back 2,000 years. For it was the Romans who introduced the concept audi alteram partem: listen to the other party, a principle which has survived for over 20 centuries and is still observed and cherished in all civilized societies. The actions of some representatives were unworthy of the dignity and the status of this Assembly.\n88.\tMoreover, far from humiliating me and my country, they have succeeded only in furnishing proof of the length to which they will go to undermine a principle which forms one of the main corner-stones of the United Nations and without which it cannot survive.\n89.\tFinally, in view of what has happened here I must place on record my strongest possible objection to the unprecedented, illegal and unconstitutional action by the General Assembly concerning South Africa's credentials. My Government views it in the most serious light indeed."

        "file_text": "\ufeff90.\t Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you my warm congratulations on the trust bestowed upon you by the General Assembly through your election as President of the twenty-eighth session.\n91.\tI should also like to join my colleagues who paid a tribute to your predecessor, who, by his impartiality in exercising his responsibilities and his tactfulness in steering the discussions, has added further respect and dignity .to this noble post. Wishing you, Sir, the best of success in the execution of your high mission, I should also like to welcome the new States which were admitted as Members of our world Organization at this session. I hope that their presence with us will have a positive influence on the strengthening of international peace and co-operation.\n92.\tThis is our twenty-eighth annual session, and it once again confronts us with an increasing number of international issues and problems, for which we hope the Organization will find practical and positive solutions that befit the Organization's role and the sublime values embodied in its Charter. Despite the fact that my country is a relatively new Member which has only lately begun participating in the work of the United Nations, its deep faith in the Organization's principles and Charter has been from the very beginning identical with its faith in a future dominated by a spirit of peace and in an international community whose relationships are governed by justice and mutual understanding. We still have in mind the glorious image of the international Organization which was set up after the bitter years of destruction, murder and horror which cast their dark shadows over the world during the Second World War, in the hope that it might put an end to wars and grant mankind its right to dignity and freedom and relieve it from oppression, aggression and exploitation.\n93.\tMore than a quarter of a century has now elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations. During this time we have discussed many issues and adopted many resolutions and this hall has heard hundreds of speakers. Words like \\\"peace\\\", \\\"justice\\\", \\\"international security\\\", \\\"peoples' right to self-determination\\\" have resounded in each resolution. Nevertheless, we still ask ourselves whether we have accomplished within the framework of this Organization and in the light of its Charter a part of the role for which the Organization was established. Has peace been established? And have all signs of war which should have been eliminated when our predecessors signed the United Nations Charter actually vanished?\n94.\tWe are not here to spread pessimism; but war, aggression and exploitation in all forms are still allowed to devastate the lives of human communities in Asia and Africa and to cast their ugly shadows on the whole world. Should we continue, none the less, repeating the words \\\"peace\\\", \\\"justice\\\" and \\\"peoples' right to self-determination\\\" without allowing the international community to enjoy these privileges in reality when we would destroy the world's dearest hope and allow this Organization to dwindle into impotence and bankruptcy?\n95.\tWe notice with great relief the end of war in Southeast Asia, as it is high time for that region to enjoy real peace. We welcome the detente which has reflected its effects on the situation in Europe and Asia, resulting in positive progress in economic relations and in conferences held for disarmament and European security. Yet there is one region in the world which still maintains a state of permanent tensions; there is one issue which has been allowed to remain on the agenda of this Assembly since 1948 and one specific subject which is continuously debated in the Security Council without being allowed to benefit from the relaxation of international tension or the prevalent optimistic spirit.\n\n96.\tThe situation in the Middle East has been and still is a chronic problem for the United Nations. It has become an impediment on the road to peace, despite the recommendations issued by this Assembly and the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. I need not reiterate here those recommendations and decisions, but I am sure that most of them include clear condemnations of Israel. It is a strange irony that Israel should be the object of the greatest number of convictions issued by this Organization, which created Israel, because it still maintains its occupation of the territories of three Arab States, denies a whole nation the right of self-determination and, moreover, strives to disperse it and to liquidate its national entity and human structure.\n97.\tA Member State, whose representative sits with us in this hall, constantly declares that it will annex by force the territories of three other Member States; that it will defy the decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly prohibiting it from changing the characteristics of Jerusalem and thereby violate the sanctity of the Holy Places and challenge the feelings of both Moslems and Christians all over the world. Israel has announced its refusal to receive a three-member Committee of the United Nations delegated by the Council to investigate Israel's violations of human rights in the occupied territories.  It has shamelessly admitted that it committed attacks on civil airliners and that it would continue such attacks in the future. To sum up, Israel declares that it will challenge any such decision adopted by this Organization which does not bless its aggressive expansionist policies.\n98.\tThe State of Qatar voted for General Assembly resolution 3034 (XXVII), asserting its faith that terrorism and aggression still threaten the security and stability of nations. If the constant aggression of Israel against three Arab Member States and its liquidation of the Palestinian people is not to be branded as terrorism, then what is terrorism?\n99.\tIsrael, like other imperialist and racist States in Africa, endeavours to mislead the world concerning its policy based on terrorism and belligerency by trying to depict movements for national liberation as if they were an exercise in terrorism while in fact certain means of struggle carried out by the above-mentioned movements are merely aimed at directing world attention to the justice of their causes. In contrast, a State Member of this Organization which undertakes to explode some civil aircraft in the air and hijack others, to assassinate individuals and communities and to uproot millions of people from their fatherland or subject them to the most vicious forms of repression inside their occupied and usurped homeland, a State whose whole conduct is dominated by terrorism and a fierce demeanour, is actually the party which deserves denunciation, conviction and punishment.\n100.\tMy Government, while submitting these facts to the Assembly, declares that the time has come for this Organization to take positive and effective measures that would secure the cessation of acts of aggression committed by Israel against States Members of this Organization and effect its withdrawal from Arab lands that it has occupied by force, guarantee the Palestinian people's right to self- determination and put an end to the Judaization of Jerusalem and the defacing of its historical landmarks and aggression on the properties and freedom of citizens in the occupied territories.\n101.\tWhile we duly esteem the great role played by Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Middle East, in his attempts to work out a peaceful solution to the problem, we deplore Israel's obstruction of his mission and its non-co-operative attitude towards him. Meanwhile, we appreciate the good offices of the Secretary-General during his last tour of the region, which Israel attempted to render void of any practical sense, thus challenging Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n102.\tIn this connexion I should like to express, on behalf of my country, our great thanks and gratitude to President Mobutu of the Republic of Zaire for his deep and wise understanding and support of the vital Arab cause, especially of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arabs, hoping and wishing for more Arab-African solidarity in the crucial issues that concern the African and the Arab worlds.\n103.\tThe small, non-aligned States are the real beneficiaries of peace. Hence, on the basis of this realistic evaluation my Government supports the non-aligned countries and upholds the resolutions adopted at the recent auspicious Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, and at previous conferences.\n104.\tMy Government also maintains a similar attitude towards OAU and welcomes its decisions. Africa still suffers from the exploitation, aggression and attrition exercised by Portuguese colonialism in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. Millions of Africans still moan under the yoke of imperialist rule imposed by colonialists in Rhodesia and South Africa.\n105.\tThe non-aligned countries members of OAU are States that work for peace. Would the world Organization, then, turn a cold shoulder to their legitimate aspirations and positive yearning for peace, justice and freedom?\n106.\tMy Government feels that the policy of nuclear armaments and. their proliferation still poses a direct threat to humanity and, consequently, we deem it extremely necessary that a conference for nuclear disarmament should be accorded serious attention and care so that it may finally become possible to arrive at the stage of substantive negotiations on universal disarmament. Hence, my Government highly commends the General Assembly's wise resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)\\ As a State directly concerned with this resolution, we hope that it will be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity.\n107.\tOur appreciation of the important role of the United Nations in fields of development makes us feel that the world community has to exert utmost efforts to create stronger and more meaningful ties between developing and developed countries and to establish close and equitable co-operation between them. Commendable as they are, the efforts exerted by the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are still below the level requisite for bridging the gap between the developing and the developed nations. This gap will further widen and endanger world peace unless the United Nations seeks fresh horizons and takes larger steps in urging developed nations to redouble their assistance to developing countries with a view to enabling them to surmount backwardness and to bring about a balance between the prices of raw materials and industrial products.\n108. Finally, the State of Qatar hopes that this session will be more successful in realizing the aspirations of the peoples of the world for peace, freedom and justice, and in ensuring a prompter implementation of United Nations resolutions and enforcement of the principles of its Charter."

        "file_text": "\ufeff194.\tMr. President, your opening remarks [2117th meeting] were worthy of the civilization you represent. The ethical and legal principles on which that civilization is based are today's most needed commodity. It was refreshing to hear you present your views in the light of those principles. It was about time we all did. Those principles are flouted by many every so often \u2014 in the name of national interest sometimes, in the name of self-defence at other times, and many other times out of wooden logic. All have paid you compliments. I sincerely join them.\n195.\tOurs is one of those periods in history which you have so aptly depicted as \\\"stormy periods when [man] can find no haven in which to pitch his tent\\\" [2117th meeting, para. 93]. The problems holding man by the scruff of the neck, enumerated by speakers before me, give authenticity to this view and corroborate the vision you put to us. I crave your indulgence and that of my colleagues to sound as grave as I do. I have my reasons.\n196.\tRecently I accompanied my President on a tour of some western and northern African countries. We have not been to all the drought-stricken areas; we have been to some and as near as a person could be to the others. The experience was unwholesome. Never before have I felt the need for international co-operation. The misery of famine and disease one could visualize from world press reports and photographs. What struck more was the scanty relief given by the world. Valiant Nigeria, among many other African countries, offered all it could in the way of airport space and labour; but the use the world community made of the facilities at its disposal was depressing. I saw a solitary cargo aircraft waiting to be used, while hundreds of people in Africa were turned into fainting forms.\n197.\tWhat I heard from Africans nearer the misery and suffering was to do with the present. The tales were distressing; they left me with a dismal feeling. In this age that prides itself on its technological achievements, that part of the world is in for an even worse predicament. It is not the short-term problem of relieving the stricken but the urgent need for long-term ecological strategies that seemed to disturb the peoples of the region. How to reduce and eventually eliminate future droughts?\n198.\tIt is not only the periphery of West African Sahara; it is also the area lying between Senegal in the west and Ethiopia and Somalia in the east, some 4,000 miles. The Sahara, after all, is a creation of uncontrolled natural forces; left unchecked, it may extend farther south. Superior intellects have warned us before, but we did not heed their words. C. P. Snow was one of them. Long ago he put the poverty problem in plain everyday words:\n\\\"We know it is happening. We see people starving before they die. We know they are going to die. We know so much and do so little. We draw what in England we call curtains, and we try to make an enclave of our own.\\\"\n199.\tProfessor Prosierman will not go the same way of the late Sir Charles Snow \u2014 I hope. He reckons that over the coming 12 months between 10 and 30 million additional deaths in Africa and Asia might occur because of starvation and because of disease rendered fatal by malnutrition. He goes further and marks the egotism of the countries which can do something to avert the oncoming disaster and says:\n\\\"America's garbage over the next year will contain a large enough amount of thrown-away food to prevent a significant proportion of the famine deaths that will otherwise occur in Asia and Africa.\\\"\n200.\tThe situation is one of tragic pauperdom on one side and insolent surfeit on the other. The poor nations in question are 2 billion people who lose 25 per cent of their children before their fifth day; 800 million of them live on the equivalent of 35 cents a day.\n201.\tThe problem is no longer one of inequities and inequalities. It is becoming a threat to the very fabric of human society. Edgar Faure, in his brilliant introduction to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization report on education \u2014 the first international survey of the geography of ignorance \u2014 has put it sc ably:\n\\\"The great changes of our time are imperilling the unity and the future of the species, and man's own identity as well. What is to be feared is not only the painful prospect of grievous inequalities, privations and suffering, but also that we may be heading for a veritable dichotomy within the human race, which risks being split into superior and inferior groups, into masters and slaves, supermen and submen. Among the risks resulting from this situation would be not only those of conflict and other disasters (for present-day means of mass destruction might well fall into the hands of destitute and rebellious groups) but the fundamental risk of dehumanisation. affecting privileged and oppressed alike. For the harm done to man's nature would harm all men.\\\" \n202.\tThere is need for a mental revolution, a revolution that defies the origins of contemporary social and political thought. The poor of the world, some 800 million of them, cannot be wildly interested in peace in the world, which preoccupies the big Powers. They own nothing to lose; they arc unaware of this preoccupation of some of us here. Detente, dialogue and accommodation are but vacuous utterances. The poor nations are not cynical, but how can a skeleton of a man have the wits to be bothered about anything but a bowl of rice and a calabash of water. On the contrary, even an empty stomach can be a menace without knowing, a factor of instability at home and abroad. Indeed, it was as early as 1912 when Woodrow Wilson said \u2014 and right here in New York \u2014 that no one can worship God or love his neighbour on an empty stomach.\n203.\tOne cannot escape the feeling that a considerable part of the food crisis is largely artificial. It is ironic indeed that extensive means for production of food are at our call while people die of hunger and fall victims to prolonged droughts. We in the developing world have generous potentialities that could lend a hand to the combat of hunger beyond the limits of the boundaries of under-development. This potential has not yet been exploited, save certain partial efforts. The example of my own country is striking in this respect. The arable land in the Sudan is estimated at about 50 million hectares, but only 6 million hectares have been developed. Some would perhaps wish us to accept penury and pestilence, in the best Malthusian tradition, as a destiny that must visit the human race.\n204.\tIt is in this sense that we note with interest the call for a world food conference in 1974. This call tallies well with the resolve of the developing countries, as expounded in the decisions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973 to convene a world meeting on food and trade.\n205.\tThe proletarian nations of the world, exhausted by monstrously frequent internal upheavals, can well join the President of this Assembly in saying:\n\\\"With few exceptions, the industrialized countries amassed their wealth as true colonial or neo-colonial\nPowers. In one way or another, they rely upon exploiting the natural resources of the less developed countries \u2014  whether or not they were politically independent \u2014 since they provided cheap raw materials in return for costly manufactured goods.\\\" [2117th meeting, para. 84.]\nThat is a truism, and one hopes that none of us will be driven to bickering and recrimination.\n206.\tBut let us not forget that in our world progress and the well-being of man are not segregated variables; they are an integral part of world peace and international tranquillity. That is not only an incontrovertible proposition; it is a peremptory truth. History points to that with an infinity of examples. So we need peace to develop, to make progress and possibly to surpass ourselves. In our clamour for peace and liberty we are neither trouble-makers nor \\\"noisy riders of great causes\\\", as some would like to think. We are plain and simple fighters for the reconquest of our independence and the affirmation of our dignity, and this we do at a very heavy cost in life and property. Nobody knows that better than people who are conversant with Africa's past and present.\n207.\tIt is in that spirit that I now turn to some events in Africa and the Middle East in this year that marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n208.\tThe happenings in the Middle East cannot help anybody who is pondering over a formula for restoring peace and stability. I shall deal briefly with three developments that have started to vitiate the air, and even more so since the Security Council's special meetings in June 1973.\n209.\tFirst, I would mention the irresponsible talk about occupying the oilfields in the area. It may be loose talk, but it is widespread. We have recently been hearing and reading about an Israeli professor who declared that his country might occupy Kuwait, there being no force capable of standing up to Israeli power. Senator Fulbright must have sensed the folly prevailing when he indicated that it was not unlikely that the United States might go out to control the oilfields through Israel, a militantly potent surrogate. What gives credibility to that sort of plan is Israel's view of itself, brazenly put to American television audiences by Mr. Teddy Kollek in 1967: \\\"You are supporting Israel\\\" \u2014 he said \u2014 \\\"only because it is in your self-interest to do so and not because you are doing us any favour\\\". One trusts that these voices of insanity will be silenced in time, good time. Let loose, they are not unlikely to get their way. If they do. that \\\"will make Viet-Nam look like a picnic\\\", to use the words of Elmer Bennet.\n210.\tSecond, in spite of all pleas to Israel not to change the face of the land and implement the policy of \\\"creating facts\\\", Israel is planning a $375 million scheme to develop the West Bank \u2014 \\\"develop\\\" being a euphemism for \\\"annex\\\". The Israel Land Authority says it will acquire land on the West Bank and in Gaza for new Jewish settlements. It is worth noting that since 1967 some 4,000 Israelis have been settled in territories occupied then. The present plan is to bring in a further 10.000 Jews by the end of the four-year scheme. The idea is prompted by the race for power inside Israel, and not because of any tender-heartedness about the Jews living outside Israel.\n211.\tWith that in his mind and in his heart, Mr. Ariel Eliav commented at the last meeting of the Israeli Labour Party:\n\\\"... this programme is brought before us with the lashing of the whip of time and the scourge of haste and panic. There are many in this land whose souls weep in silence because of this document. I will be the voice of the ideological Jewry of silence and never, at any price or in any form, will I ever vote for the document.\\\"\nSuch emotions did not appeal to the Prime Minister and the most eligible contenders to the throne, and Eliav had to be chided and pilloried for entertaining such sentiments.\n\\\"I have lived through 50 years of political activities\\\" \u2014  the Prime Minister said to him \u2014 \\\"and never before have we had a comrade who set himself up as a Messiah.\\\"\nThe Israel Land Authority, she went on to say, \\\"will acquire land by every effective means\\\". Benjamin Disraeli must have been the mentor. \\\"Damn your principles. Follow your Party\\\", he once said.\n212.\tIn 10 years there will be a different Jerusalem. The sane Israelis can take it or leave it, and the world will have to lump it, along with statements like that made on 3 October, and right here from this rostrum, that Israel's policy \\\"is not unilateral annexation\\\" [2139th meeting, para. 79]. Sanity must live in the shadows, unheard and unseen.\n213.\tThird, there is a current rush of propaganda against \\\"the gnomes of Araby\\\", as a senior senator in Washington referred to oil-rich emirs. King Faisal is quoted and misquoted almost daily. The publicist twists both his words and his intentions. I personally detect a deliberate campaign to belittle the importance of the writing on the wall, as well as the man's diplomatic pragmatism and his capacity to influence events. Attributing to him obliquely ideas never put forward by him, some publicists are working hard to create hostility between him and the people of the United States. How far can mischief go? Some want to assume that \\\"the \\\"gnomes of Araby\\\" are an unthinking bunch of tribes, given to histrionics \u2014 an image that might lull the untutored into false comfort but would not change the facts which will ultimately determine the settlement.\n214.\tBut what are the facts? David Hurst, whose knowledge of the Middle East cannot be improved upon, put them in a simple way:\n\\\"... as a result of the energy crisis, never have America's vital interests in the Arab world seemed so precariously , exposed by its commitment to Israel as they do today \u2014  never has 'bastion Israel' seemed quite the glaring fallacy it is.\\\"\n215.\tThese are no dead facts or unfounded views. They need the urgent attention of this Organization. The machinery existing at the moment has not been able to check the wiles of Israel. That is a fact. To wait until it is improved is no intelligent counsel either. Let us admit it. There are Powers that could do more than they say they can. They must move. The United States of America and Europe have the means. If they are intimidated by the hell Israel can raise in face of any State that goes counter to its wishes, as witness the case of Austria, then we have nothing to say to them except \\\"What of the peace on earth that you say you serve?\\\" They would do well to remember the African voices raised yesterday and today by two of our dynamic leaders, prompted by nothing but a sense of justice. I should like us to contrast them with the hollow rhetoric indulged in the other day by Mr. Eban, who did not budge an inch from the position taken after the June 1967 hostilities. I refer to the recurrent theme of \\\"negotiation between the parties\\\". The United States and Western Europe have the means to advice Israel to come out of the quagmire it has drawn itself more and into which it is about to pull the whole world. There is no point in wailing about being alone and outvoted. Israel must produce something other than rhetoric, or must be made to do so. It is no use quoting Al Akhbar and Al Gumhuriya often out of context, deluding itself and tormenting the world.\n216.\tThe African scene is another case of peace thrown to the winds, and barbarity rampant. Three aspects of the tragedy presently played on the scene there need to be brought to the fore: first, the commendable role of the Church in unravelling the brutalities of Portuguese armies in Mozambique; second, the inhuman manner in which hundreds of men and women are languishing in the detainee camps: and third, the indifference of world conscience to the tragic drama played out there by South Africa, Portugal, and Rhodesia.\n217.\tIt is our duty as the voice of the world here to recognize. in some formal manner, the part now being played by many priests, bishops and cardinals of the Catholic Church in Portuguese Territories. Some young men and women not only are bringing the details of massacres to world public opinion, but are also risking their lives: indeed, some of them are in gaol. We shall be failing these brave souls if we do not take up their case seriously, see to it that those in gaol are released, and that those who had to leave their flock go back. I am certain there are ways of achieving this. It is the will that is needed.\n218.\tThe Church has definitely set itself on a new course. Let us contemplate the words of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Umtali, Ms. Donald Lamont, looking into the origins of racism. It is, he says:\n\\\"... a pernicious heresy, deep-seated in theological origins and disastrous in the conclusions it could lead to. If the Christian Church were to seem by its silence to give ' its consent to a system of government inspired by racial prejudice, any discrimination against men, or harassment of them on account of their colour, condition of their life, or religion, it would be contrary to the mind of Christ.\\\"\nNoble words in the true tradition of the sacred books, but never before brought to light as forcefully as this.\n219.\tEqually forceful in encouraging to men and women in the bush lighting for their freedom is Cardinal Bernard Albrink. He is no less a man than the Archbjshop of Utrecht and, at the same time, the international president of the Pax Christi movement, a man to reckon with. In a letter to Bishop Ferrcira de Silva he calls upon him \\\"to take all necessary measures and probably make a public protest. ...\nWc have a duty to show every African citizen that he can count on our solidarity in securing his right to self- determination\\\". At long last the All-Africa Conference of Churches is not alone. Surely these men are rejuvenating the Church, injecting into it a spirit that centuries ago impelled a few similar souls to petition the Pope to intervene with secular authorities for the purpose of prohibiting slavery. According to press reports, Father Martin Hernandez and Father Alfonso Valverdi have been in gaol since early 1972.\n220.\tThere must be others because several missions have been closed for fear of missionaries informing the world. And inform it of what? I can tell you. Vania's story is too well known now to recount. Zostin's story is too gruesome not to mention. Portuguese soldiers asked Zostin whether she knew the sex of the child inside her. They opened her stomach with knives, violently extracting her entrails, showing her the foetus which throbbed convulsively. They told her that she then knew and were chucking like maniacs. What little Serina, a 13-year-old girl, told reporters about the massacre of her family is as horrifying. Vania, Zostin, and Serina should find their way to sainthood. The hundreds of churchmen we honour, but must not content ourselves with honouring them.\n221.\tTo begin this process, the Sudan joins with those who call for an investigation of the atrocities in Wiriyamu, Mucumbora and other areas. The investigation conducted by Portuguese authorities cannot be convincing. Evidence is in the shaky words of Prime Minister Caetano. Here they are: \\\"The competent authorities will seek those responsible, in order that justice may be done\\\". The result of what he called \\\"rigorous enquiry\\\" is, in his own words, \\\"a total absence of the alleged facts in the places alleged by the accusers\\\".\n222.\tThe second question is that of the fate of the hundreds of detainees in South Africa and Rhodesia. The world knows about Father Sithole and Joshua Nkomo in Rhodesia, Nelson Mandela and Alexander Neville in South Africa, luminaries who have been silenced behind bars for a decade or so. We do not know about the others. We call upon this world community and other international institutions to take up seriously the matter of those men and women whose sole guilt is standing up for their inalienable right to independence and freedom to determine their future. It is also setting a pattern for life under the racist Governments of that region until the day of deliverance comes. The obtaining pattern is desperate and therefore unaware of decisions it takes. Mr. Smith has recently gone so far as to ban churchmen from preaching in their own Church. No one will be surprised if, under strain because of his many political and economic defeats, he locks them up. Some action is needed. In what form? Let us think together. After all, this year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.\n223.\tThirdly, recent developments go to show the near- maniacal eagerness of the white settler regimes to use armed suppression against the African population in order to entrench their rule and prevent the African from participating in government. The murder of Amilcar Cabral, the massacre of 400 defenceless civilians at Wiriyamu, the massacre of African mine workers in Carletonville, illustrate the length to which those minority regimes will go. Yet, despite brutality, African resistance in southern Africa not only has remained undaunted but has risen to unexpected heights. The recent labour strikes in South Africa have gone to prove how prophetic Nelson Mandela was when he said at his Rivonia trial:\n\\\"Government violence can do only one thing and that is to breed counter-violence. We have warned repeatedly that if there is no dawning of sanity on the part of the Government the dispute between the Government and my people will finish up by being settled in violence and by force.\\\"\n224.\tIt is against this background of terror that Africa has repeatedly pointed to the gathering storm south of the Zambezi, a storm that threatens to engulf the whole of Africa and the world beyond.\n225.\tBut South Africa, Rhodesia, and Portugal are not the ones to read the writing on the wall. Large portions of Mozambique and Angola are already in the hands of freedom fighters. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has plunged into the fray with indomitable gusto, after the miserable failure of elections in Ovamboland and the arrest of five of its leaders as the culprits who prevented a turn-out to the election booths. Mr. Smith is sending his bombers, jet fighters and helicopters to subjugate the Tete Province in Mozambique because, according to him and his followers, \\\"the Portuguese have lost the stomach to hunt out FRELIMO guerrillas\\\", as reported by newsmen who managed to get into the area. This is a logic for which we have only infinite scorn. The thickest writing on the wall is the triumph of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde in announcing the independence of Guinea-Bissau only days ago. That lesson will also be lost on the racists in South Africa, Rhodesia and Portugal. It will not be lost to the Africans. After all, one cardinal point announced by independent Guinea-Bissau is that it will help to liberate other Portuguese Territories.\n226.\tWe of the OAU shall, of course, soon take steps to help Guinea-Bissau to stand on its feet by making available to it whatever resources every single member of us can afford \u2014 and that apart from what the rest of the world can do at this stage.\n227.\tIt is useful to note that we have voted into our community some 130 million people in this particular year when we are seriously grappling with the improvement of the United Nations. To the representatives of those peoples, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I bring the congratulations of my country and its people. Our work in this Organization is incomplete without their industry and inventiveness. They will bring in a breath of fresh air, I hope. Some of those who have been at it for a long time have taken positions in the light of their own national interests, I am afraid. The steely muscles of the Organization need oiling. Some of us preach a \\\"don't-rock-the-boat\\\" philosophy: a conservative view that hopes to keep the status quo. Some preach the dismantling of the whole edifice as un- suited to our current needs and the construction of another that would be in tune with the times \u2014 a radical view that fails to take stock of the realities of international life. The dialogue started by the Secretary-General's notes and your own remarks, Sir, should end up in a serious endeavour to look into the matter and present recommendations to our next session.\n228.\tThose remarks and particularly your views of the General Assembly, so perceptively outlined, Mr. President, cannot be served by Olympian aloofness. These are not times for any one of us in a position of authority to shy away from creative leadership. To halt the tendency \\\"to underrate the powers of the General Assembly\\\" you need daring souls on your side. Many of us demonstrated this morning that we are ready to do so.\n229.\tWe appeal to you, Mr. President, not to be hemmed in by the stern rules and practices that have reduced the highest office of the General Assembly, our collective voice, into an honorific position. Worse still \u2014 they have even led us into the contented acquiescence in and acceptance of the presence in our midst of such political obscenities as the spokesmen of apartheid.\nc\n230.\tThe social and economic establishment of the United Nations cannot be left unchanged either. The United Nations can pride itself on many of its economic assistance programmes where differences among States have been effectively conciliated in the pursuit of common goals. Such programmes can materialize in limitless benefits if the necessary requirements for successful performance are made available.\n231.\tApart from the primordial requirement of resources there is a need to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the United Nations economic programmes. The implementation of those programmes demands a degree of emotional commitment beyond what is normally acceptable. And for such a change to be effective, all partners in the process of multilateral co-operation \u2014 and more particularly the recipients \u2014 should take part in the rationalization of procedures and modes of operation. What is needed in the prevailing conditions of international co-operation for development is a forward-looking perspective to development assistance and a dedicated spirit of performance at all levels. Nothing less will meet the pressing needs of the developing countries.\n232.\tThe Assembly had a taste of this from President' Mobutu of Zaire [2140th meeting]. His was a message of Africa pure and simple, freed from the trimmings of diplomatic niceties, and armed with the philosophy of his ancient land. His concept of aid is our concept \u2014 and not on the abstract level either. His country's experience of Chinese co-operation happens to be my country's experience too. It is the possible ideal of aid. I could go on and tell an identical story. The President's words were clear enough, yet one would like the \\\"better-equipped\\\" countries, as he prefers to call the richer members of the international community, to draw the moral. In my humble thinking, he was calling upon this Organization and upon the rich of the world to reconsider ways of co-operation witt us, in the light of the Chinese experience our two countries have, and to improve on it. Why not?\n233.\tIt is in that light that we say there is a need to review the Charter, to infuse the rules of procedure with a breath of life, to modify antiquated modes of operation, and to rejuvenate the administration with a timely blood transfusion. The Charter of the United Nations is not Holy Writ, however revered. It is a document reflecting the consensus of nations at a certain juncture of history. It will have to change with the changing times. The Organization is not an oracle. It is a political institution. And political institutions that tend to perpetuate themselves become reactionary. What use is a reactionary United Nations?\n234.\tThe resolutions of the non-aligned summit Conference at Algiers on the reorganization of the United Nations [see A/9330 and Corr.I] should not be passed over in silence, even by those who have a vested interest in the status quo. The change is necessary if the United Nations is to beat all efficient, efficacious, and truly representative of the infinite diversity of the world's culture and beliefs.\n235.\tIn order to achieve that change, we do not intend to fly in the face of prevailing facts. That does not do the job of strengthening this world forum. To be their prisoner, if they prove to stand in the way of new ideas, does not do the job either. There will have to be a golden mean between realism and idealism. To discard one or the other is to invite paralysis. It is not beyond our intelligence to be pragmatic idealists.\n236.\tAfrica is keen and willing to put its genius at the service of a machinery of reform. That is the meaning of the presence of four of our leaders here, one of them the current President of the OAU, General Gowon, who devoted a substantial part of his address [2141st meeting] to this question. It is not that they need the Organization more than any other continent in the world; it is that they realize only too well that Africa is the hope of peace and equitable distribution of the resources of the world. Africa is young and has not yet accumulated the cynicism that comes with old age and flabby wrinkles. Africa sees less of the seamy side of man and can speak up as the leaders you have heard this morning and yesterday did."

        "file_text": "\ufeff197.\tMr. President, the delegation of Guatemala considers that the General Assembly was well advised to appoint you, since this appointment also represents twofold recognition of your standing as a jurist and of the personal qualifications that you have brought to the service of the United Nations, helping to maintain trust and to increase faith in the unchangeable principles and vital objectives of the world Organization. Our admiration and respect bespeak your success and guarantee you the whole-hearted co-operation of the delegations present here.\n198.\tI wish to thank you also for the special tribute that you paid to the memory of the late Guatemalan internationalist, Emilio Arenales Catalan, who preceded you in your high office.\n199.\tI should like also to mention the ties and similar deep historic roots that link Ecuador and Guatemala. And I might refer to the fact that the greatest Latin American writer of fables, Rafael Garcia Goyena, as a child, left his native city of Quito and while in my own country he contributed to the emerging national awareness and served the cause of the political emancipation of Central America through the press that he edited and that supported independence.\n200.\tI must express the concern of my delegation at the exacerbation of the conflict in the Middle East.\n201.\tThis regular session of the General Assembly began with the promising prospect that the relaxation of great political differences and ideological controversies all over the world would make the road to the maintenance of international peace and security easier to traverse.\n202.\tSuch prospects have been seriously upset by the conflict in the Middle East. Since the United Nations was born out of the need of humanity for peace and for guarantees of the security of peoples, safeguarding mankind from the untold sufferings of war as our basic and primary objective, this conflict once again puts the United Nations on its mettle. It is a challenge to the political will of Member States to achieve a solution to the conflict and to follow up that solution in order to ensure peace throughout the region. We trust that the United Nations will live up to that mission.\n203.\tIt would be almost redundant for me to reiterate the adherence of Guatemala to the United Nations or even to try to list the fruitful achievements of the Organization. We should be better advised to consider the balance-sheet and then answer criticisms that have been made \u2014 some of them well-founded \u2014 which are the result of impatience and eagerness of many to revitalize the United Nations at a time when its purposes and directives have matured sufficiently to require greater achievements.\n204.\tWe are gratified that the application of the principle of universality is gaining ground and our international Organization is expanding and becoming stronger. We are happy to welcome cordially the representatives of the beautiful archipelago of the Bahamas and the admission of the two German States, whose renewed contact promises convergence in this climate of political detente, a convergence that Einstein entrusted to time, space and distance; this does not satisfy fully those of us who wish for a world that is united, yet this convergence will help us towards coexistence and human understanding. There are some very promising indications contained in the statements made by a number of Powers in this forum, confirming the fact that the United Nations inspires trust and leads to agreements. Thus, for example, the Soviet Union has revived, in concrete terms, a proposal, which the representative of the United Kingdom recalled here, on the reduction of military budgets in order that the resources thus saved might be diverted to international co-operation and to meeting the priority needs of the developing countries [A/9191].\n205.\tThe Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Willy Brandt, agreed in condemning violence in any form and, furthermore, he denounced that defeatism which is confined to a bitter criticism of \\\"an almost jubilant pessimism\\\" in the face of the present complex problems, when people are dying of hunger as earlier they died in war [2128th meeting]. Therefore, as we seek peace we must revitalize the instruments of international cooperation and improve the living conditions of many peoples whose backwardness or poverty are the ingredients of domestic upheaval and threats to international security.\n206.\tSurely this new atmosphere will be encouraged and promoted by the United Nations. It may be created by a convergence of fear and the memory of untold sufferings, but it is a climate which might be conducive to a disarmament movement or a change in individual and collective conduct that will turn sterile struggles into useful compromises, and to a search for peace and security through mutual understanding and co-operation.\n207.\tMy country does not need to reaffirm its traditional belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, which already in 1825 was the principle underlying the instructions that our delegates, Molina and Larrazabal, carried with them to the First Inter-American Conference in Panama, and that contribution to the rule of international law leads us today to advocate disarmament, and to condemn unreservedly the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests that might shatter the radiation balance and be a grave danger to mankind. We are proud, in the Western Hemisphere, that the Treaty of Tlatelolco was created and signed by us.\n208.\tIn Guatemala our concern for development has been directed towards an over-all plan with a deep humanist underlying condition that calls for better standards of health, training and cultural activity so that, at least the greater number of our inhabitants, if not all, shall participate actively in the social and economic welfare and thus meet the imperative that \\\"peace is the fruit of justice\\\". This is a guiding principle that has a deeply rooted tradition in the Guatemalans because in the Popol Vuh, the most important of pre-Columbian books, it was stated as follows: \\\"Let all rise. Let all be called. Let there be no group, no two groups, among us that is left behind the others.\\\"\n209.\tThe search for basic social justice as a means of promoting peace, security and the welfare of the nation is a matter for all of us, and our President, General Carlos Arana Osorio, has made appeals that go beyond party interests and elite groups, that we should all work together devotedly, sharing the sowing and the harvest and the enjoyment of the benefits, under the egalitarian inspiration of the Sacred Book of the Maya-Quiches in Guatemala:\n\\\"All the tribes climbed the mountain together to see the sun rise. They took with them their idols and their animals, their wives and their children, their chiefs and their servants; and the sun rose. And the tribes were not counted, nor the idols, nor the animals, nor the strong, nor the weak. The sun shone brightly on all.\\\"\n210.\tWe have stressed the great responsibility for a national effort to achieve over-all development, but we do not in any way underestimate bilateral, regional and international co-operation freely agreed upon; at the same time, however, we must obey the integrationist mission of the Central American isthmus, which is geographically, historically, ecologically and culturally intended to combine natural and human resources to meet the requirements of a single, common destiny, as provided in the restructuring of the common market and in other aspects of the regional plan, aimed at benefiting the peoples of the region. A number of organs are working along those lines and important programmes are under way. If there were difficulties in the Mercomun \u2014  the common market \u2014 if a dispute has endangered the plan, the situation has now improved and the prospects for the coming year are eminently promising.\n211.\tWe know that the United Nations will through its specialized agencies give the necessary support, on conditions appropriate to our circumstances, within the framework of our own institutions.\n212.\tWith regard to the efforts being made by the Central American Governments to speed up the economic development, we believe it is indispensable for all developing nations to define the economic rights and duties of States in a charter in keeping with present ideas, but flexible enough to be adapted to future situations. The prompt adoption of such a charter by the international community would set the stage for an era of constructive calm.\n213.\tDespite the fact that in 1970 the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, many policy measures included in the Strategy have not been implemented. Furthermore, the world economy has suffered a series of grave upheavals, with particularly unfavourable repercussions on the developing countries. That situation surely calls for political will on the part of the developed countries to implement new forms of international co-operation that will cover global interests and treat common problems, without distinction, in the light of interdependence.\n214.\tThe United Nations and its specialized agencies, without doubt, in specific fields falling within their competence, have done praiseworthy work on the development of the less advanced nations, and yet bureaucratic and administrative problems hinder implementation of the United Nations Development Programme in some regions. In this connexion, it is suggested that international co-operation should make better use of available resources, since the balance-sheet of the first two years of the Second Development Decade shows that many problems persist. Some have become aggravated to the point where they even show signs of retrogression.\n215.\tTrade negotiations started in Tokyo within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also call for preferential treatment to be given to the developing nations. If this goal is lost sight of, and if multilateral negotiations are to be made subject to the interests of the economic Powers, or if they are limited merely to solving their own problems, then irrecoverable ground will be lost in international relations.\n216.\tDevelopment is also linked closely to the problem of population. At round tables and seminars, in studies and speeches at national and regional levels, a preventive policy regarding the balance between population and natural resources is discussed and examined. We must recall the warnings of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations but must not go back to the simplistic Malthusian theory regarding world supply of food-stuffs. We must rather take into account the complexity of the socio-economic concept in which man is at present developing, since his destiny depends primarily on the family milieu. It is in order to ensure that every man has better and more resources, and can thus more effectively contribute to the collective welfare, that the United Nations has stressed the importance of population problems and has created a specific department to gather and disseminate information and, we might also say, keep its finger on the pulse of each country regarding reactions to the problem.\n217.\tIn my own country the demographic problem is not the determining factor governing under-development, nor is it of an alarming nature. Far from it; however, the authorities and society have both taken it into account and thus encouraged study of the problem and discussion of programmes for family planning. We can bring some of our experiences and experiments to the World Population Conference planned by the United Nations for 1974.\n218.\tIn a different context, we admit that the United Nations has been more than ready to assist areas affected by natural disasters. Thus, my delegation would be ready to advocate and sponsor the creation of a standing United Nations body, ready to give assistance and help to countries suffering natural catastrophes or calamities, which almost constantly beset one region or another of the world and which call for timely and ample assistance.\n219.\tDuring 1974 the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is to be held. At that time, difficult problems will be raised, such as the different delimitations of the sea, especially as regards the utilization of natural resources as yet unassessed but whose importance is already known and planned on as vital sources and reserves for the economies of our peoples.\n220.\tSome formula will have to be found that will guarantee the rational exploitation of the sea-bed without disregarding the preferential rights of the coastal States, linking the interests of more than 130 nations whose situations are very different. It will be a challenge to the negotiating capacity of diplomacy, it is true, but scientific precision and technical advice, as well as the new concepts of international law, must prevail. Thus it might be helpful if prior and wide dissemination were made by the United Nations of any information and data that will allow those problems to be placed within the framework of the coastal rights of peoples and nations and in the emerging interests of future generations.\n221.\tFinally, this year the United Nations will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with world-wide repercussions. In this matter the Government of Guatemala, whose Constitution includes each and every one of the human rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration, apart from having presided over the formation and development of our own Republic and being soundly rooted in the people, has adopted measures to ensure the widest publicity in which schools at all levels and many cultural institutions will enthusiastically participate.\n222.\tThis General Assembly has before it the problem of devising the programme for the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. Guatemala agrees openly with the objectives of that Decade and we are ready to support the elimination of any form of discrimination by following a crusade to defend the right which goes hand in hand with the very right to life, and that is life with dignity.\n223.\tWe believe that this readiness, which is unanimous in the Assembly, is the best framework in which to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, and our hopes are that the awareness of those rights and respect for their tenets will not only be set forth in a declaration but will be part of the mentality of future generations and be brought out in their conduct and in their acts."

        "file_text": "\ufeff102.\tMr. President, I wish to begin by expressing the gratification of the Government of the State of Bahrain at your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are looking forward with hope to a successful session under your wise leadership. I should also like to pay a tribute to our former President, Mr. Trepczynski, for the manner in which he directed the work of the previous session. Also, I should like to welcome the presence at this session of the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and the presence of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as full-fledged Members of this Organization.\n103.\tThe present session of the General Assembly has witnessed major developments in the relations between the big Powers. This has been the culmination of a series of events which took place during the last two years and which heralds a new era of relaxation in international tension and co-operation among the big Powers.\n104.\tThe restitution of the lawful rights of China in the United Nations [resolution 2758 (XXVI)/ has-been one of the encouraging factors in the new international climate. Meanwhile, there are many serious pending problems which urgently need action. We should not neglect these questions simply because they are not of immediate interest to the big Powers. In the view of my country, colonialism, apartheid and poverty have a large impact on the future of international relations and will adversely influence the international climate unless we grapple with these persistent problems and find a speedy solution for them which is not based on expediency but which will be in conformity with the dictates of right and justice.\n105.\tI shall start with the Middle East question which contains elements of all the evils I have just alluded to, namely, colonialism, racism and poverty.\t\n106.\tIt is not my intention to review the Middle East question with which Members are all familiar. The question is now so well known that the peace-loving peoples all over the world take every opportunity to express their support for the Palestinian people and their just cause and insist on the withdrawal of Israel from the territories it occupied in 1967.\n107.\tIn the beginning of this month, more than 70 nations and Heads of State met in Algeria for the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, representing more than half of the population of the world, and adopted a momentous resolution regarding this question. This resolution, which contains practical measures for settling this question, should serve as an incentive to our Organization for taking appropriate action to uphold the rule of law and restore to the victims of Israeli aggression their lawful rights. I shall quote the main provisions of this resolution, which now forms part of the Political Declaration of the Conference:\n\\\"In the Middle East, the situation continues to give rise to deep concern. Israel's obstinate persistence in its policy, of aggression, expansion and annexation, as well as its policy of oppression directed against the inhabitants of the territories occupied by force, is a challenge to the international community, the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a threat to international peace and security.\n\\\"Drawing renewed attention to the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force, the Conference calls for immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied territories, and pledges itself to assist Egypt, Syria and Jordan in liberating their occupied territories by every means.\n4\n\\\"In this connexion, the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people is a basic prerequisite for the establishment of an equitable and lasting peace in the\narea. The struggle of the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland is an integral part of the struggle of all people against colonialism and racial discrimination and for self-determination. Member countries of the Conference call upon all States, and in particular the United States of America, to abstain from providing Israel with arms, or any political, economic or financial support which may enable it to continue its aggressive and expansionist policy.\n\n\\\"The Conference gives its firm support to and expresses its solidarity with the Palestinian people in their sore trial and the heavy sacrifices it is making to recover its national dignity and entity.\\\"\n108.\tAs long as the aggressive Zionist State is dispossessing the Palestinian people of their homeland and rights, and is illegally occupying territories of three Arab countries, the world will not witness peace, as this troubled situation could explode at any moment, exposing our civilization to the danger of devastation. Bahrain would like to see the United Nations playing its proper and effective role in world affairs and see the countries which hold in their hands the key to the solution of this dangerous situation take an active part in doing so rather than stand aloof as mere observers.\n109.\tThis year, the United Nations will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Bahrain is looking forward to participating ii this celebration. Bahrain attaches great importance to safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all peoples. It is significant to note in this respect that the new Constitution of Bahrain, which was approved by the Constituent Assembly, upholds the rights of the citizens of Bahrain in civil, political and social affairs. The Constitution of Bahrain is a solid foundation for a democratic life supported by both the people and the Government of Bahrain. One of the aims of the Constitution is to maintain the dignity and worth of the people of Bahrain and lead them to an honourable and fruitful life.\n110.\tThis year a major step towards world peace has been achieved by the signature of the cease-fire agreements in Viet-Nam. Nations all over the world have shown their relief at the cease-fire in that part of the world. Nevertheless, the situation in Indo-China is still precarious and may threaten the stability of political and economic life in that area. Accordingly, we hope that all parties involved will work towards the ending of hostilities and armed confrontation.\n111.\tIt is true that it is not in the interest of nations that the arms race should continue at a time when millions of people are living in misery and poverty. Statistics indicate that some $200,000 million a year are spent on military activities, while only half this amount-is spent on economic and social development. The world has not yet forgotten the destruction inflicted on human civilization by the last two world wars. So long as the arms race is not curbed, the threat of another world war will remain with us. The United Nations, through the goodwill and determination of its Members, can call a halt to the arms race and the production and stockpiling of destructive weapons. It is high time that the United Nations should play a more effective role in achieving general and complete disarmament and that Member States should meet their moral obligations towards the nations of the world, which are longing for peace and security.\n112.\tThe Indian Ocean is a vital area for the many nations who want it to be a zone of peace. The United Nations has declared that the Indian Ocean is a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and should not be used as an arena for military activities which endanger the political and economic stability of the littoral and hinterland States. Bahrain, which declared its approval of this principle, appeals to all other nations to do the same and to refrain from jeopardizing the peace and stability of this area. Also, we believe that the Gulf area should also remain free from big-Power rivalries and foreign intervention.\n113.\tAnother aspect of global unrest is the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. The United Nations has in the past spared no effort to combat these policies and practices through the resolutions that were adopted year after year. Nevertheless, these efforts have been in vain, mainly because those who carry out such practices persist in their wrong-doing and turn a deaf ear to all voices that condemn them. Moreover, these racist regimes are able to adhere to their vicious policies because of the moral and material support they receive from some other industrially advanced countries. The latter claim to be among those who laid the foundation of human rights, while at the same time they support racist regimes which suppress the indigenous populations and deny them their fundamental freedoms and inalienable human rights.\n114.\tColonialism and apartheid are crimes against humanity and can no longer be condoned. The international community must compel colonial and racist regimes to give up these odious practices.\n115.\tThe liberation movements in Africa are legitimate causes that must be supported and encouraged. Every nation on this earth has the right to self-determination, which, if denied, can be achieved through armed struggle. Bahrain confirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands.\n116.\tIn 1970, the United Nations initiated the Second United Nations Development Decade with a view to achieving the target of raising the national income of developing countries by 6 per cent. In order to achieve this objective there must be international co-operation, and in this respect the developed countries can help a great deal. Nobody can deny that the developing countries are primarily responsible for their own development. However, this should not prevent the developed countries from helping to improve the standard of living in the developing countries. The offer of technical assistance and the provision of financial aid can diminish the wide gap between the poor and the rich countries.\n117.\tThe increasing problems of the environment are placing a new challenge before those who are endeavouring\nto find solutions to combat them. No State whatsoever is immune from the problems of pollution of the environment. The United Nations has initiated an environmental programme and has set up a secretariat entrusted with the duty of following up the programme. It is hoped that all nations will co-operate amongst themselves and with the various international organizations in the struggle to combat the problems of pollution.\n118.\tNow that we are meeting in this grand Assembly to discuss the matters included in our agenda, which may exceed 100 items in number, we should look back on the work of our Organization to see whether it has achieved its aims and purposes, particularly the maintenance of international peace and security.\n119.\tThe United Nations has been exceptionally ineffective in maintaining international peace and security. To take one significant example, our Organization succeeded in repelling the aggression committed by Israel during the Suez war in 1956, while it has so far been unable to compel Israel to renounce the fruits of its aggression in 1967.\n120.\tIt is our fervent hope that the lessons of the past will be heeded and that the General Assembly will take effective measures to maintain and promote the aims and purposes of the United Nations. Meanwhile, I would take this opportunity to reiterate my country's firm support of the principles and ideals of the Charter and to proclaim its co-operation with the Secretary-General, who needs our help and whole-hearted assistance in the noble cause he is working for."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt should not be surprising that, for a citizen of the third world like me, it is difficult to speak once again before this Assembly-difficult because I cannot forgo accomplishing my duty to express here the point of view of my Government on the important problems which preoccupy us collectively.\n2.\tI cannot be pleased at having to denounce here once again, in the same circumstances, exactly the same evils-in spite of the rather fragile hopes that have appeared in the South-East Asian region. Members must understand that I am concerned over all the factors that have been created and maintained to aggravate and perpetuate underdevelopment in the third world.\n3.\tI rise up against retrograde selfishness on the part of all those who-while our common destiny depends upon universal solidarity-are still hesitating about co-operating frankly in keeping the weakest and the most destitute among us from achieving social well-being. I rise up against the constant threat of weapons of destruction which is weighing upon mankind. Lastly and especially I rise up against the abject conditions of colonialism, apartheid and occupation which still hold Africa in bondage, in spite of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contrary to the spirit of our Charter.\n4.\tI am therefore obliged to re-examine with members the same problems that have been debated at such length- problems of economic and social development, problems of international co-operation, problems of universal peace and, of course, problems of the sacred right of all peoples on earth, and in particular the Africans, to decide upon their own future.\n5. All those preoccupations would, of course, have made me pessimistic if we had not had a man of the dimension of Mr. Benites to preside over our Assembly. An erudite jurist, a politician well informed about, and fully acquainted with, this house and all the problems that we shall have to debate here, he is certainly the President that we were awaiting in order to find together the solutions that our apprehensions call for. On his election, which was so brilliant because it was well deserved and justified, I offer him the heartfelt congratulations of my delegation.\n6.\tWith Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, who is always between two aeroplane flights in his aim of getting first-hand knowledge of the various problems with which our Organization is confronted, Mr. Benites forms a team of distinguished men whose competence and dedication to the service of the world make it possible for us not to have doubts about the United Nations and to look forward to the future. My delegation assures the President, and all his colleagues in the General Committee and in the Secretariat, of our gratitude.\n7.\tThe same feelings guide my memories of the President and the General Committee of the twenty-seventh session.\n8.\tIn rushing to the United Nations as soon as they had acceded to political independence, we, the small countries, thought first and foremost that we would be part of a great human collectivity within which mutual understanding could engender greater justice. In our view, that justice necessarily had to begin with a better considered distribution of riches and consumer goods and all the other means which make it possible to struggle effectively against ignorance, disease and poverty.\n9.\tOur attachment to that ideal was all the deeper as we had total confidence in the industrialized countries, which, following one of the greatest conflagrations they had inflicted upon the world, had succeeded in placing before our eyes the new charter of a better future based upon a thousand altruistic obligations.\n10.\tBut, after 28 years and in spite of a better-organized and more profitable exploitation of our riches, our purchasing power is decreasing, whereas the industrialized nations are selling their products at higher and higher prices; so we grow poorer for the benefit of those very nations which are becoming richer and richer.\n11.\tSo, I repeat, after 28 years three quarters of mankind suffers from famine while a minority has surplus in its agriculture, and enormous sums continue to be sacrificed to sterile purposes while millions of children grow up illiterate because it is not possible for us to give them teachers, \n\nclassrooms, books-in a word, all that is necessary for them to become citizens worthy of our society.\n12.\tAs it now stands, the economic and social situation of the world must preoccupy the United Nations and lead its specialized agencies to restructure themselves in order better to help our States tackle the various aspects of the problems of underdevelopment that weigh upon us. It is an absurdity to try to deal with world peace before attempting to eliminate from the world the fundamental causes of social inequality which lead men to destroy each other through violence.\n13.\tOnly when those causes have been eliminated will our faith in international co-operation as an indispensable means in the service of development be justified. There is no doubt at all that the Central African Customs and Economic Union, the European Common Market, the Group of 77 and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, to which Gabon is making its modest contribution, are not in our view exclusive clubs for this co-operation.\n14.\tMy country is prepared to co-operate with the whole world and, repeating the statement of His Excellency Mr. Albert Bernard Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic, I would say that our only policy is to continue to give our peoples the means of emerging from underdevelopment.\n15.\tWe agree that other efforts should be joined to ours, provided that those who want to help us in this noble task by offering their co-operation to us respect our sovereignty. And it is not through any accident that our President, Albert Bernard Bongo, upon his accession to power, signed an \\\"investment code\\\" for all those who sincerely wish to help us; that code recognizes that businessmen who come to our country have a right to make a fair profit.\n16.\tIn regard to our sovereignty, I wish to go beyond the strict framework of the political situation exclusively and to speak of the full enjoyment of the riches which a generous and bountiful nature has placed upon our soil and buried within our subsoil and under our waters. Such a sovereignty can suffer no restriction. We intend to remain, in spite of our limited means and possibilities, the only masters of our soil, of which our territorial sea to a limit of 100 miles is an integral part.\n17.\tThis affirmation is in no way inconsistent With our universalist orientation. It is simply an explanation of the reality that we Gabonese, while prepared to co-operate for our economic development, do not intend to have any of our national wealth exploited to the detriment of our people. And if naturally we are in favour of the exploitation of the sea-bed for peaceful purposes, we reject its spoliation.\n18.\tBut how can we prepare and develop this cooperation, how can we improve the, standard of living of our peoples in a world which is uncertain of its own future, a world replete with weapons of destruction, a world in which those who have more than others are spending more for war than for the general well-being?\n\n19.\tOf course, the Powers responsible for our collective peace have been able to avoid the worst by opening treaties for our signature; of course, an important document has been drafted and signed prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\\\" All these measures, including the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, are so much evidence of a genuine desire to achieve peace.\n20.\tBut the Government of Gabon is still asking itself, What is the purpose of the bombs that were already stored before the publication and entry into force of the text to which I have referred?\n21.\tTo set our fears to rest for all time and to provide a satisfactory reply to all the small countries which are only dreaming of peace, there is a solution: formally to prohibit the manufacture of new nuclear weapons and immediately to establish international commissions for the systematic destruction of existing stockpiles. Not to accept that would mean purely and simply, as far as we are concerned, to shirk the sincere search for peace.\n22.\tThe Powers concerned which adopted our point of view would emerge ennobled by their decision. As for our world, enjoying the resources thus liberated and delivered from its anguish, it would at last know true happiness.\n23.\tIt is because of our faith in the principles of our Organization that I come to set forth here the thinking of my Government.\n24.\tHowever, for every African, for every citizen of the third world, as well as for all peoples imbued with lofty moral values, there is very little hope of achieving this world that we all desire as long as colonialism and apartheid are still the rule in Africa and one of the greatest peoples of our continent is still under military occupation.\n25.\tAnd yet, following the signature of the Charter at San Francisco, the African peoples, which had seen scores of thousands of their people die in order to help others reconquer their freedom, had seriously hoped that, because of the new international code, the day had at last come when they could enjoy independence.\n26.\tIndeed their hope was well founded; the freedom of peoples being inalienable, the France of Charles de Gaulle and the British Crown had decided in favour of honour, greatness and the future by substituting for the basically fragile ties of domination the almost indestructible relations of friendship, confidence and co-operation. The evidence is there that people who can have the most confidence in their common destiny are those who have forgotten their relations of the past in order to build a future through mutual consent.\n27.\tIt is unthinkable to observe that in Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verde Islands, Angola, Mozambique, Cabinda and the Sao Tome and Principe islands genocide still goes on, punctuated by unjustified massacres of the aged, of pregnant women and of children, who are daily burned with napalm. An entire village of 200 inhabitants has just\n\nbeen stricken from the map of Mozambique. And, as if it were living in a dream world, Portugal continues to believe that its country is part of Central Africa.\n28.\tTo complete this anachronistic picture, racism of the most humiliating and repugnant kind is still prevalent in South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia. The African populations, on the soil of their ancestors, live in conditions so well known that it appears superfluous to us to refer to them here once again.\n29.\tIndeed, the allied regimes of Portugal and South Africa, having remained deaf to the voice of reason, the African peoples concerned have risen up in the armed struggle which has been imposed upon them by the colonial systems. Blood is flowing and the United Nations is neutralized through the intrigues of the settlers.\n30.\tBut everyone knows \\\"hat this situation could not last were the Portuguese Government alone and if the white minorities of Southern Africa did not have outside support, making it possible for them to defy world public opinion with impunity.\n31.\tAs for the Middle East problem, it is the responsibility of the great Powers to restore the Jarring mission in order to find agreement within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), The recent refusal of Egypt and Israel to have this resolution amended makes it possible to think that each of the parties finds it acceptable.\n32.\tWhile we are pleased to see among us the qualified representatives of the German people, we should not lose sight of the other divided States-the two Viet-Nams and the two Koreas. It is high time for all inhabitants of the world to be represented in this Assembly.\n33.\tIn the case of Korea in particular, the non-aligned countries have advocated at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers, what might be considered as a basis for the settlement of the problem [see A/9330 and Corr.], p. 49]; but the fear of permanent insecurity which is making the southern part of the country hesitate to the point where it is attempting to modify this solution is such that we must seriously consider the statement made on 23 June by the South Korean President, a statement which we think lays down the essential bases for finding a just solution to the problem.\n34.\tThe two parties have arrived at a point where hope is possible. They should not fall back on misunderstandings, hesitations and errors, which have until now complicated the solution of their problem.\n35.\tdelegation has no magic formula for a perfect settlement of all the problems on the agenda of the present session. But it has the firm desire to make its modest contribution to the collective effort to find, with all men of goodwill, the majority of those data which might simplify examination of what unfortunately divides us, and thus attain the unity of thought which is our only salvation.\n36.\tMay I therefore be permitted to make a solemn appeal to all those who are particularly responsible for the weal and woe of the international community to give our world, at last, more justice, more progress and more peace."

We know what a responsibility it is to preside over this General Assembly. We feel sure that the vast experience of Mr. Leopoldo Benites, his talents placed at the service of his country and of the peoples of the world, and his recognized international erudition and sagacity will make it easy for him to discharge the task so honourably given to him. Paraguay, in congratulating him and wishing him every success in the task assigned to him by the world, promises him full co-operation.\n156.\tThe United Nations was built on the ashes of a world in material and moral ruin 28 years ago. Not in vain have waters run under the bridges of life! in that period of history. The evolution of things has meant a logical and substantial change in the characteristics of the world, as compared with 28 years ago. Prosperity has reached some-relatively few \u2014 countries while the just aspirations of the majority to achieve development rise day after day like an uncontainable tide. The then warring nations, destroyed by war, have today recovered their economic splendour, their industrial potential and their possibilities for permanent expansion, and they forget the priority needs of giving integral assistance in creating a better and more humane world so that economic and financial relations with the developing countries may be organized through a just system of equity which will make possible the progress of all countries.\n157.\tAll peoples and nations anxiously seek international peace and harmony. All men and women dream of a calm and fruitful world, where man will sing hymns in praise of labour, creative labour, with no asphyxiating clouds on the horizon. With the advance of technology in those 28 years the world has become small and relations between men and peoples have become so close that a conflict in one part of the world is a burning-point which touches one and all equally and undermines the desire for peace at its roots.\n158.\tThe United Nations has become ecumenical and in the course of time many nations which have at last attained a free and sovereign life have joined it. This universality of the Organization's membership requires work which in the field of peace and its strengthening has not been completed. The man of our world knows that, despite all the labour of the United Nations in so many areas of concern linked to man and his habitat, peace is in daily and horrifying danger. And there is the daily sadness of the universal citizen at the inextinguishable hotbeds of violence and aggression which, while they may appear to cool down at times, require only two or three accidents for a return to the initial explosive stage.\n159.\tThis world, so deeply concerned by the possession of nuclear weapons and devices, has not lost its faith in the Organization but looks upon it with critical eyes, permanently awaiting from it and from nations, especially the super-Powers, the definite resolution, through United Nations bodies, of all conflicts which may endanger peace.\n160.\tWe do not believe that life and the world have left the Organization behind. We believe it still has a far-reaching role to play in creating peace and for the development of peoples; and in the ensuring of collective peace, which is the supreme desire of mankind, it has total responsibility. But this cannot be achieved successfully unless all nations beginning with the great world Powers, come to the halls of the Assembly in a suitable frame of mind.\n161.\tMultilateral diplomacy must be used, with bilateral diplomacy placing its sometimes spectacular achievements at the service of such diplomacy. All countries, starting with the super-Powers, must be definitely prepared to submit to the rules of international coexistence as required within the Organization. If is not fair or advisable to praise peace universally by every means of social communication when interests other than those which are strictly basic for just and lasting international harmony prevail, regardless of what pretexts are adduced. United Nations meetings must be attended without prejudices or mental reservations, without ill-will or objectives determined in advance which admit of no reconsideration. Without a genuine dialogue of communication and good will there will be no peace-or if there is peace it will be only a weak flame which the first gust of wind will extinguish, so that night will again envelop the earth. There will be no lasting light without the final elimination of hatred between men, races and nations.\n162.\tThe multilateral action of the United Nations will never be a barrier to bilateral diplomacy. On the contrary, it is its indispensable complement. Any successful action by the Organization not only solves an international problem but gives greater prestige to the entity established so that man will have more faith in a world of peace, justice and liberty.\n163.\tTo arouse happy hopes among men in this century which is so heavily laden with disillusion and disenchantment is in itself a start towards building a better future for our anxiety-ridden mankind.\n164.\tThe world of today, rightly concerned by many collective problems, such as those of the environment, natural resources, improper distribution of wealth, both nationally and internationally, the conquest of outer space and the utilization of the resources of the sea, must still bear the asphyxiating fear of war or of an explosive lack of harmony between peoples and nations, when everything tells us that the integration of national economies and the obvious interdependence of countries are the basic resources to be used for a good future.\n165.\tWe must mention some notable achievements with legitimate satisfaction. Positive contacts between the great Powers have brought about a page of relief demonstrating at the same time that the quest for new means for the good of mankind is never-ending, that there are steps which have always to be taken if we have a sincere desire to shorten distances without thinking of prejudices, seeking solely understanding between peoples and countries which appear at first sight to be spiritually far apart.\n166.\tFreezing the long and sad war of Indo-China has been another valid step on the rough road to peace.\n167.\tWe hope that the countries involved in this problem will find a final solution based on respect for the substantive values of mankind, without which even life is not worth living.\n168.\tWe must not seek a solution for its sake alone, sacrificing the moral values which perish in the attainment of an easy success. Peace needs form, solid and definitive foundations, for today, for tomorrow, for ourselves and for the children of our children.\n169.\tLet us hope that the solution of international conflicts will always be based on respect for the free and sovereign existence of nations, the self-determination of peoples, the impossibility of waging war for military, economic or ideological conquest and on the elementary principle of coexistence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\n170.\tThe unflagging work of the Organization in the quest for peace is praiseworthy. In all explosive places-Cyprus, the Middle East or southern Africa-its presence is an effective action which the world itself undertakes to find a solution to the problems which overwhelm it. As I said, this is a ray of hope on the difficult but irreplaceable road to peace.\n171.\tMy country, Paraguay, wishes to make public a positive affirmation of its faith in peace and in the work of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. My country appreciates at its full value that daily, silent, sometimes thankless task, which has no substitute, in the common good of nations.\n172.\tThe opening meetings of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which were held in Helsinki are another milestone which is worthy of mention. A united Europe, above all one clearly aware of its vast international responsibilities, both political and economic, is of concrete assistance towards a just and lasting peace.\n173.\tWe anxiously hope to see better horizons in the conflict, by now almost classical, of the Middle East. It is a thorny and closed dilemma which places on trial not only the United Nations actions but its very existence, because the layman in every region judges the reality of the United Nations by the positive achievements in situations of conflict which are daily in the news.\n174.\tParaguay believes that, subject to two governing principles \u2014 express recognition of the full and sovereign existence of the State of Israel and the right of the Palestinian people to their own country-the application of resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council of the United Nations has to be the way to a happy solution which all men of goodwill hope for.\n175.\tThere can be different formulas to win peace. All of course require a spirit of dialogue, that is to say, a simple willingness to be receptive to reason, even though it comes from the other side, so as to be able to understand the objective realities which constitute every human conflict, and even more obviously the cooling of passions which reveal shady corners of opprobrium and lack of dignity in the very place where only good judgement should prevail.\n176.\tAmong our hopes, we have already pointed out the achievements of the great Powers and the relaxation of tensions among them. We hope that this will be final, so that they will co-operate among themselves in the solution of problems and in positive international action.\n177.\t\tWill these achievements eradicate the obscure and terrible problem of the accumulation of arms? Will mankind continue to invest thousands of millions of dollars in weapons of every kind? Will common sense and a lasting sense of responsibility finally prevail so that the multimillion figures will be reversed and used to improve the standards of living of the developing peoples?\n178.\tIt is up to the great and powerful nations to set an example, so that the freezing of conflicts and relaxation of tensions will bring forth fruit in a real limitation in the manufacture and sale of arms.\n179.\tIt is impossible to understand the arms race of some developing countries whose people so urgently ask for the satisfaction of their priority and elementary needs. Such attitudes defy the hunger and poverty of millions of human beings. There are developing countries which ask of the world more credits to give impetus to their progress. In the meantime, paradoxically, they invest millions of hard currency in the acquisition of ultra-sophisticated or obsolete weapons.\n180.\tThe roses of peace and international understanding cannot bloom along the route of an arms race. Any excessive growth in the might of military installations arouses suspicions, fears and rivalries among nations. The mere accumulation of weapons and the rivalry among States for their possession are already a beginning of war, which can lead us to painful experiences. It is best not to play with the elements of death, hatred, pain and destruction.\n181.\tParaguay has for many years struggled arduously while lacking greater financial assistance and, above all, more flexible and generous assistance, in an ardent quest for better days. The philosophy of labour and production prevails. The infrastructure moves forward at a rapid rate in every area. Education, housing, health, production, export promotion, energy-these are vital concerns of a Government which seeks only peace and thereby the progress of our nation. Its people, which in its history was viscerally torn apart several times by war and internal anarchy, embarks on these undertakings with faith and firmness. Its armed forces, which are subject to the Constitution, to order and to the law, have been placed at the service of communities and at the service of creating a better world for all without any kind of discrimination. The army, the navy and the air force are inspired by this desire for peace and development and work side by side with the people in works of national interest. Schools and public buildings, roads, new means of communication, telecommunications, the merchant marine, local and international air services, health centres and agrarian reform testify to the concern of the glorious armed forces of Paraguay, which are the legitimate pride of its people.\n182.\tMy country and its armed forces invest in these patriotic and progressive tasks monies which could have been invested in the purchase of arms.\n183.\tBased on these convictions, my country will continue to advocate in this great forum the need to contain the arms race and to support a policy of an honest and honourable disarmament which would be the result of a fruitful dialogue between all countries, starting with the super-Powers.\n184.\tIf there is one scourge which is characteristic of our times, it is the rise of terrorism. The hijacking of aircraft, the taking of innocent hostages, indiscriminate violence, horrible murders, the mutilation or killing of people without any valid motive constitute cankers which are a denial of civilization.\n185.\tThis is the most cruel and heartless of crimes.\n186.\tIn cold blood, in a calculated way, deliberately, in silence and in secret, terrorists prepare their destructive and nefarious activity which sometimes reaches, kills or destroys people who are tragically powerless before such refined evil.\n17\n187.\tWhat have these innocent human beings to do with the causes which are cited as the reasons for such spurious criminal action?\n188.\tWhere will our civilization go, and where will our ethical values go, if this dark and clumsy course continues?\n189.\tIs there really honesty when in every national and external forum we speak of peace, of tolerance, of justice, of collective well-being and yet do not put an end to or punish this heartless type of activity which is repudiated by all men throughout the world, regardless of their colour, language or religion?\n190.\tParaguay wishes to affirm that this chapter of our memory must be added to the list of the major collective frustrations. The committee of our Organization which is studying terrorism  arrived at no concrete results in weeks of study and debate.\n191.\tThe evil is everywhere. The illness stalks every day the entire geography of our planet. It is not from a definite country. At the current rate, terrorism has become international and its consequences explode in any place, at any hour, at any time, without respect for the life of anyone. There is not even any definite place for the activity, itself: today it is the point-blank assassination of a man in his home, tomorrow the painfully amputated hands of a modest employee of the post office.\n192.\tThe basic solution is to be found in the eradication of the generating causes. Let us study the problem and find a prompt and final remedy. Here I have in mind: the oppression of peoples who seek their autonomy, their own independence and national identity; the pessimism of many men and women who see in the work of the United Nations no solution to the chronic problems which afflict their countries; the obsolete colonial status of communities which are ethnically different from the metropolis or their oppressors, which are not able to express themselves freely in order to state their sovereign will; the unjust and immoral exploitation by oligarchic groups of majorities maintained in racial or economic discrimination, or both at the same time, maintaining people in an inhuman status and persecution for ethnic, social, religious or political reasons.\n193.\tWithout questioning the right of these peoples or communities to seek their own way towards liberation or autonomy, we should make practical efforts to put a halt to the present wave of terrorism which is making our own world impossible to live in.\n194.\tMankind, in its perennial quest for greater well being, is setting its sights on and devoting its most advanced technology to the rational use of the resources of the sea.\n195.\tFood, energy and processing industries hope to find within the sea almost magic sources, the yield of which is as yet unknown but may reach unexpected figures and derivations.\n196.\tWithout going into detail as to the value of the sea as a provider of resources and minerals, we must also mention its vast usefulness in the field of transportation and communications between peoples and men.\n197.\tParaguay, because of an unfortunate historical determinism, not only has been deprived of a coast but is within the heart of South America bereft of the benefits which a sea coast would have given it.\n198.\tThis fact explains, to quote my predecessor, Mr. Miguel Solano Lopez,\n\\\". . . our firm determination and our constant fight in all forums and in all organs to obtain endorsement of the principles of an increasingly enlightened international law which, through international justice, compensates for the obvious disadvantages deriving from a land-locked position.\nAt the meeting held on 17 April 1971 in San Jose, Costa Rica, during the first regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States [OAS], the illustrious Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country, Professor Raul Sapena Pastor, referred to the question of the breadth of the territorial sea in order to express the point of view of Paraguay. This is what he said:\n\\\"The Republic of Paraguay is \\\"an inland land-locked country, and geographical and historical circumstances have deprived it of the extraordinary benefit of having a coastline. None the less, Paraguay has the right to enjoy freedom of the high seas and unlimited navigation and to have access to fisheries, the underlying resources and the airspace over the sea. To the extent that the States with coastlines arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by widening their territorial sea, they are also arbitrarily limiting the rights of the Republic of Paraguay and of all inland or land-locked countries.\n\\\"The breadth of the territorial sea can be fixed not by national precepts, whether they are derived from law or the Constitution; but through the consent of all States, ' including those that are land-locked and those that have coastlines, a consent expressed in the form of international agreements\\\".\n199.\tMr. Jorge Espil, who is a member of the Inter-American Council of Jurists, affirms:\n\\\"Within the American continent we must bear very much in mind the situation of the land-locked countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay, which have expressed their disagreement with the extension of the territorial sea to 200 miles, because this implies a limitation of their rights over the high seas. Without these two countries one cannot speak of a uniform regional agreement\\\".\n200.\tIn taking up the common elements in principles and rules on the question, the Inter-American Juridical Committee, on 9 February of this year, stated that:\n\\\"The coastal States shall authorize the land-locked countries which are part of the region to exploit the living\n8 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-seventh Session, Plenary Meetings, 2062nd meeting, para. 11.\nresources within the zone from 12 to 200 nautical miles and grant them preferential rights in comparison with third States and in accordance with criteria which will be stated in multilateral, regional or bilateral conventions\\\".\n201.\tThese common elements are the ones which the Committee recommends to the American States so that they can be taken into account and submitted to regional or world-wide conferences on a new regime for the seas.\n202.\tElementary international justice requires that the land-locked or the shelf-locked countries have a right to exploit the living resources in the zone, whatever the name given to it, on a footing of complete equality with the nationals of the coastal States; and not only the living resources but also the mineral resources must be reserved for the exploitation of States in their respective regions, without taking into account their geographical location.\n203.\tIn regard to frustrations, one chapter deserves special treatment, and developing countries continue to hope that the declarations and recommendations made at international gatherings and conferences will become a reality. Their economies continue to suffer from the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade in their trade with the highly industrialized countries, to the direct detriment of the future of their peoples.\n204.\tThe countries supplying raw materials and exporting primary goods continue to suffer the unfavourable impact of the unstabilized prices of their export goods and the revaluation of certain currencies, which is a punishment impossible to foresee and one that has a harmful effect on the return of credits and international loans, with an increase in the prices of goods which our countries must of necessity import to satisfy their consumers and their plans for expansion and industrial development. The rich become richer and the poor become poorer.\n205.\tIt is not possible that only a few countries should participate in reforms of the monetary system when the consequences have a repercussion on all nations and a special impact on the economies of the developing countries.\n206.\tDevelopment is not an exclusive commitment of each nation; it is a responsibility for all nations and requires co-operation within the measure of the possibilities of each, with complete respect for the principle of non-intervention. Logically, the powerful and prosperous countries are obliged to co-operate more, quantitatively and qualitatively, in this ecumenical crusade. Technology, which is the key to expansion, can no longer be a closed club, the price of admission being the price of gold. Technology, trade problems, investments, financing and the opening of new markets constitute instruments which are essential for countries to progress.\n207.\tPeace is not only an absence of armed conflict; it is also an attitude of understanding on the part of the highly industrialized countries and just co-operation for the development and well-being of our peoples. Justice, in economic relations, monetary decisions, the policy of general preferences, the granting of credits and financial assistance, the use of technology and investment policy is the only possible vehicle by means of which to arrive at a world which will be more humane, fair and just.\n208.\tDisillusionment, discontent, extreme poverty, the rise in privileges, the unjust and unequal distribution of international labour and the scarcity of financial assistance for development will never be a help towards peace, stability or international understanding. If we wish for neither war nor conflict, let us see that the great countries, in the first place, put their shoulders to the wheel so as to change economic relations with a view to giving just treatment and genuine assistance to the developing countries. Their progress ultimately will be a triumph for our world and our institutions, a factor of good economics and harmonious and fruitful trade relations. The well-being and prosperity of all countries will ensure the well-being and prosperity of each.\n209.\tParaguay, which is a founding Member of the United Nations, has long since emerged from a long process of political anarchy and lives under the guidance of a genuine patriot, General Alfredo Stroessner, and we live a life in which republican institutions are paramount. We have left behind us the cruel confrontations between brothers so as to devote our days completely to the tasks of fruitful labour. We have swept away hatred so as to march ever forward towards the goals of collective well-being and national development. We have superseded the provisional institutions and we work under the rule of peace and progress, with the powers of the State and public opinion functioning fully. Today, we are concerned with peace, egalitarian public education, health, housing, the opening up of new markets for exports, a policy to create employment and an efficient development of the resources of the country. That is to say, we are concerned with that which interests man and the development of peoples.\n210.\tWithin that spirit Paraguay would reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim, that we wish to have a United Nations which is \\\"more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies\\\" [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 8].\n211.\tParaguay wishes this to be a dynamic Organization above the emptiness of verbalism, something far more than a simple forum: an entity of solidarity, a solidarity where the great and the powerful will genuinely assist in advancing the world and its peoples. Paraguay wishes the light to shine at every dawn for every man in every region, -with no privileged States and no countries cast into oblivion, with no foreign intervention, exploitation, economic dependence or ideological domination."

        "file_text": "\ufeff79.\tMr. President, first of all, I should like on behalf of the delegation of Thailand, to offer you my sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of this Assembly. My delegation fully endorses the expressions of confidence, respect and admiration which have been conveyed to you by previous distinguished speakers. The keen knowledge of, and deep experience in, United Nations affairs which you have acquired during the years as the representative of your country, Ecuador, are the essential attributes of a successful President of the General Assembly. Your wisdom and compassion are the human qualities which add further to the high esteem that the peoples of Latin America, as well as other parts of the world, have for you as a person. My delegation pledges its whole-hearted support and co-operation in the tasks that lie ahead of all of us.\n80.\tOn this occasion my delegation would also like to pay a tribute and to express its deep appreciation to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland for the efficient and able manner in which he conducted the proceedings of last year's General Assembly as its President.\n81.\tThe delegation of Thailand wishes to convey to the Swedish delegation, Government and people its heartfelt condolences on the demise of His Late Majesty King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden. My delegation is also saddened by the death of Mr. Salvador Allende, former President of Chile, who only last year addressed this Assembly on many important international issues [2096th meeting/. It was also with the deepest regret that my delegation noted the loss of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta Angel of Colombia, the President of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations, whose contribution to the founding of our world Organization will always be appreciated by the \\\"peoples of the United Nations\\\".\n82.\tThe Thai delegation wishes to express its grateful appreciation to our Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/ and its thought- provoking introduction [A/9001/Add.l], which should commend itself to the careful attention of all Member States. Last year the Thai Government and people were pleased and privileged to welcome the Secretary-General on his first official visit to Thailand and to the headquarters of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in Bangkok. It is therefore a genuine pleasure and an honour for me once again to meet you, Mr. Secretary-General, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.\n83.\tThe past year has witnessed, except in one instance, a continuing improvement in the relations among the major Powers. Despite evident difficulties generated by fears and suspicions in certain areas, the great Powers appear to be trying in earnest to promote mutual restraint in their conduct towards each other and the outside world. In so doing, they are entering a new era of peaceful accommodation and detente. Although it may take a while longer before these promising trends become an established fact of international life, they are welcomed by all peace-loving peoples of the world.\n84.\tIn this respect, Europe has made impressive gains. The successful conclusion in Helsinki of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the agreements on and between the two German States, together with a series of treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and its neighbours to the East, seem to justify a mood of optimism in East-West relations, and enhance the prospect of a European settlement.\n85.\tSince both the First and Second World Wars began in Europe, the outcome of the on-going negotiations is awaited with interest by people throughout the world. The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations in furtherance of the concept of universality in the world Organization provides ample proof of the pragmatic wisdom of the States involved, perhaps setting a trend for an evolving accommodation of similar difficulties in other parts of the world.\n86.\tMy delegation, therefore, was privileged to be a sponsor of the resolution that admitted the two German States to the world Organization and wishes to extend, once again, its whole-hearted welcome to them, as well as to the other new Member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n87.\tBig Power moderation nay also have a salutary effect on the Middle East, where the cease-fire has continued in its fourth year, although with worrying interruptions and little lessening of tensions. However, the Security Council has found itself powerless to enforce compliance with its resolutions. The continuing occupation of the territories occupied as a result of the 1967 conflict and the subsequent measures taken by Israel to consolidate its control run counter to the spirit and letter of existing United Nations resolutions. Security Council condemnation of the lawless violence perpetrated on government orders, as well as its repeated warnings, have also not been heeded. This is a deplorable state of affairs, and one fraught with grave risks.\n88.\tThe efforts of Ambassador Jarring have come to a standstill, with no beginning of a settlement in sight. Indeed, the only glimmer on the darkened horizon has been the first official visit of the Secretary-General himself to the countries in the area; for his presence in the area has emphasized the increasing concern felt by United Nations Members and may have served to underscore the urgent need to prevent further deterioration of the situation, as well as to renew our hope of finding a just and lasting settlement in conformity with the United Nations Charter and on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and other United Nations resolutions.\n89.\tRegarding Asia, one of the significant events of the past year has been the establishment of regular diplomatic contact between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. It is, however, still too early to ascertain whether that historic step will pave the way towards a possible settlement of the outstanding problems in Asia. Nevertheless, there have been some subsequent positive developments.\n90.\tIn South Asia, the emergence of the Agreement between India and Pakistan is a welcome development of great humanitarian significance which augurs well for the solution of the other problems pending among the nations on that subcontinent. It is hoped that, with the improved climate of understanding, the People's Republic of Bangladesh will be able in the near future to take its rightful place in the United Nations.\n91.\tIn East Asia, where United Nations attention this year will be focused on the Korean question, recent developments on the Korean peninsula have made it possible for the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea to recommend its own dissolution. It therefore remains for the world Organization to determine, in the appropriate organs, what new steps or further adjustments concerning the United Nations role can be undertaken to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities in Korea. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that United Nations Members, particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, will be able to reach an accommodation on the remaining issues which will be to the best interest of the Korean people itself.\n92.\tIn South-East Asia, where the legitimate aspirations of people to live their own lives have long been hampered, the situation remains a cause of deep concern and a grave threat to world peace. Subsequent violations of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam have made it increasingly difficult to implement the already complex arrangement, and have further prolonged the bloodshed. However, the long-awaited Protocol to the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos  has finally emerged. Thailand welcomes this important development which has brightened the prospects for peace and national reconciliation in the neighbouring Kingdom of Laos. It is, however, necessary that all the provisions of the Agreements be implemented in good faith by all parties concerned, and that the Geneva Agreements of 1962 and article 20 of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in the presence of the Secretary- General of the United Nations in January of this year, be fully and strictly adhered to by all the signatories.\n93.\tWith the new accords on Laos and the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam, the absence of a similar consensus on the Khmer Republic represents a noticeable failure of international diplomacy and a remaining challenge to us all. While the Government side is prepared to negotiate, the other side, with active and substantial support from outside, is still intent on imposing a military solution to the conflict. Although it is generally accepted that the Khmer people itself should be allowed to solve its own problems free from foreign interference, it should be apparent to all that a just and lasting solution must be firmly predicated on the preservation of Khmer independence, neutrality and territorial integrity.\n94.\tAfter the din of battle has ceased it is imperative that the vital security interests of all the neighbouring States should be assured and that they should have adequate protection to safeguard their independence as well as regional peace and stability. A basis for such a step has already been created-when the five members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] signed the Kuala Lumpur Declaration 27 November of 1971 stating their common aim that South-East Asia should become a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free fr6m any form or manner of external interference. Moreover, the proposal before the United Nations to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace also has an important bearing on the security of littoral and hinterland States, some of which are situated in South-East Asia. A great deal of satisfaction and inspiration can be derived from the growing acceptance of similar endeavours by major Powers in other areas, such as the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear\nWeapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which has already received the formal endorsement of four of the five nuclear Powers. The latter should be persuaded also to recognize that only a new structure based on the willing and mutual co-operation of the Asian States themselves and other interested parties can promote genuine peace in that important part of the world.\n95.\tThailand firmly believes that all countries in the region of South-East Asia must jointly assume primary responsibilities in establishing conditions for political stability, economic progress and social justice and genuine peace in the region. We of the region must be left free to work out our own destiny. It is essential that all countries in the region participate actively in the creation of a new order and contribute directly towards peace, freedom, stability and progress. Together they could make the South-East Asian region free from all forms of interference from outside and ensure freedom with peace, independence and territorial integrity for all States of the area regardless of differences in political systems.\n96.\tIn the area of disarmament, improved East-West relations in Europe have made possible the encouraging progress of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). With SALT-II now in the negotiating phase, the anxious world has been promised a slowing down of only one aspect of the arms race. Progress in the field of general disarmament is disappointing, and national defence budgets do not reflect the atmosphere of detente. The proposed World Disarmament Conference has not benefited from early organizational difficulties, which can be resolved only through mutual goodwill and not by political pressure or manoeuvre. Since participation in the Conference by all the nuclear Powers and other militarily important States is indispensable to its success, we should explore every possibility of achieving a compromise and refrain from acting in undue haste.\n97.\tThe tenth anniversary of the signing of the partial test-ban treaty12 passed by without any further movement towards the final goal of a comprehensive test-ban agreement. It may be said that a nuclear-test race is going on at fever pitch, with the more advanced nuclear Powers resorting to underground nuclear testing to maintain their superiority and the newcomers to the nuclear club rushing to develop an independent capability for avowedly defensive purposes. As this situation is a serious danger to mankind, my delegation would urge immediate cessation of all testing as a first essential step in the direction of the elimination of all nuclear weapons.\n98.\tWe in Thailand firmly believe that all peoples are entitled to their inalienable rights of self-determination, independence and sovereignty, free from outside interference. We have therefore consistently supported the efforts of the world Organization in the area of decolonization which have resulted in the birth of many new nations and the increase in the membership of the United Nations. However, many problems are still unsolved, especially with regard to Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Cape Verde. Various resolutions of both the General Assembly\n\nand the Security Council have been adopted, but certain Powers still place their economic, political and militaristic interests above their national conscience and human values and thus have neither strictly observed nor implemented those resolutions. Again this year, the time has now come for all of us to appeal to those countries to soften their known positions and to adopt a new policy which will help correct the long-standing injustice done to the peoples in colonial Territories and to hasten the process of self- determination and independence for the people of those Territories.\n99.\tThailand also supports the legitimate struggle of millions of indigenous Africans against apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa. Despite the fact that this year marks the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those peoples are still denied their fundamental freedoms and basic human rights. Thailand will therefore continue to work closely with other Member countries of the United Nations to bring about the speedy elimination and total eradication of racism and the shameful practice and policy of apartheid.\n100.\tEleven years ago the General Assembly proclaimed the first United Nations Development Decade [resolution 1710 (XVI)] with the expressed aim of reducing the gap between the rich and the poor nations. It is now three years since the Second United Nations Development Decade began; but the gap between the rich and the poor has widened even further. A major task lies ahead for all of us therefore in that the first biennial review and appraisal of the objectives and policies of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] are scheduled to take place during this session. The developing countries have a great stake in the outcome of the review, and my delegation stands ready to give its whole-hearted support to the Group of 77 in the task of breathing new life into the global development effort, the aim of which is to raise significantly the standard of living of the developing countries. This worthy goal must be vigorously pursued in the present decade, if there is to be any hope of lessening human misery and the despair affecting the majority of mankind, thus fulfilling the lofty aims of the Strategy.\n101.\tSeveral events of major importance are taking place which could be of tremendous benefit to the developing countries. First, the multilateral trade negotiations dealing with world-wide trading arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] have begun in Tokyo. The Thai Government has shared the view that increased and expanded access of exports from developing countries to the large industrial market is one of the essential keys to the accelerated growth of developing countries. Furthermore, developed countries should lower, and eventually eliminate, trade barriers and other practices which have long curtailed the export trade of the developing countries. Such benefits can be attained only through concerted efforts by the developing countries during what will be long and arduous negotiations.\n102.\tWhether the multilateral trade negotiations will have a chance of success, however, is intrinsically linked to the monetary negotiations which have just ended in Nairobi.\nStatements coming from the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues of the International Monetary Fund indicate that a significant step forward has been made, to a point where the over-all shape of the reforms is perceptible enough to allow for greater concentration on the key issues. It is welcomed that the Committee has affirmed the desirability of effecting an equitable transfer of resources from developed to developing countries as a means of promoting the latter's economic' development. Here again it is essential that the developing countries should do all in their power to increase their individual and collective bargaining power and so improve their chances of obtaining beneficial results. In this connexion the members of ASEAN have had useful consultations concerning both the GATT negotiations and the Nairobi talks.\n103.\tOf equal significance to developing countries is the United Nations World Population Conference to be held in August 1974 in Bucharest at the invitation of the Government of Romania. The problem of population is of fundamental importance to the future of humanity, and a coherent approach to this highly complex issue is needed to make the best use of our available knowledge and resources. The United Nations has already made impressive progress in this field through the United Nations Fund and Population Activities and it is hoped that the conference will further help us to see this problem in all its dimensions.\n104.\tMy delegation holds that economic relations among States should be governed by agreed principles and that a charter of economic rights and duties of States will be of benefit to all countries. One of these rights is the right of States to permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources.\n105.\tWe fully support the concerted efforts being made to expand the capability of developing countries to apply science and technology to development, and we consider that the serious maldistribution of the world's scientific and technological resources is a major obstacle to development.\n106.\tAbove all, we believe in, and will continue vigorously to pursue the idea of, economic self-reliance with the co-operation of neighbouring countries and within geographical subregions.\n107.\tAll of the foregoing come under the purview of the Economic and Social Council, whose task and responsibilities for the co-ordination of all United Nations activities in the economic and social fields have grown both in complexity and scope over the past 25 years. The imminent ratification of the amendment to Article 61 of the Charter should further enhance the Council's leadership role and ensure a broader basis for its activities. It is necessary therefore that this enlargement, coming at a time when the Council has shown a spirit of revitalization, should be used to provide opportunities for member nations that have expressed their willingness to serve but have never had an opportunity in the past to participate in its important work.\n108.\tOne of the most challenging questions facing the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is the progressive development of the international law of the sea.\nDuring the year's session, the Thai delegation was privileged to play a role in achieving the widest possible consensus on various procedural steps that would lead to the substantive phase of the conference on the law of the sea 1974. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, of which Thailand is a member, has met twice this year and has accomplished a certain amount of preparatory work. Further efforts should, however, be made to consider the legitimate and limited interests of others, particularly those arising from geographical factors, be they concerned with land-locked or shelf-locked countries, or semi-enclosed seas, in order to find compromise solutions before the conference takes place. My delegation looks forward to the organizational meeting towards the end of this year and also to the conference itself in the early part of next year as originally agreed.\n109.\tWith regard to the exploration and exploitation of resources in the sea-bed area, progressive development in the direction where the legitimate interests of coastal States, countries with special geographical problems and maritime Powers can be harmonized, is not only feasible but beneficial to all. Perhaps it is even conceivable that with the enormous wealth lying untapped beneath the deep ocean it should be possible to share the benefits on an equitable basis without falling short of the aspirations of any State or group of States. However, there can be no derogation from the fundamental principle that every nation, whether small or large, rich or poor, has sovereignty over its own natural resources. The question is, therefore, one of delimiting areas under national and international jurisdiction. My delegation recalls the difficulty encountered in 1958 and 1960 on the limit of the territorial sea, but is confident that this problem can soon be resolved. Thus, it also hopes that the questions concerning the sea-bed outside national jurisdiction and related issues, which have important economic ramifications, can eventually be settled for the benefit of mankind.\n110.\tThe rule of law must reign in all fields of human endeavour. The only alternative is anarchy. Nations should, therefore, accept the necessary adjustments to make the international community more responsive to basic human needs as well as more responsible to its final constituent, namely, man himself. The international community should endeavour to avoid catastrophic mistakes of the past and to ensure that man's noble instinct and ideals will not only endure but will ultimately triumph over his foibles and follies. States, therefore, have an obligation not to impede progress in this respect, but must act in concert to further it. In so doing, they have the United Nations to assist them. The Organization's inherent shortcomings are already well- known, and its many accomplishments and useful rule are widely appreciated, especially in the light of the Secretary- General's eloquent introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l]. But whatever the shortfalls are, the world Organization, now composed of 135 Member States, embodies the international community and represents its weaknesses and virtues. Moreover, the United Nations system constitutes the only, albeit imperfect, universal instrument of peaceful change in existence today. It is, therefore, imperative' that the international community should try to improve the Organization's efficiency and effectiveness partly by positive actions of its component States. It was in this spirit that the Thai delegation last year joined with others in sponsoring the draft resolution on the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.  In the present atmosphere of detente, no opportunity should be lost, and we should explore fresh avenues that will satisfy the demands of change and the requirements of contemporary international life. The amendment to Article 61 of the Charter is a welcome demonstration of realism on the part of all concerned. The world has grown, not only in terms of population, but also in political maturity. Although it is a slow and continuing process, the time has come for us to encourage it by every possible means. Indeed, the world Organization, together with the international community which it represents, should be made truly responsive to basic human needs and more responsible to mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeff152.\t The overwhelming majority of speakers at this session of the General Assembly has noted with a feeling of definite relief and optimism the positive changes taking place in the world.\n153.\tWe are in fact witnessing a fundamental change in the entire post-war history of the world \u2014 a shift from the lengthy period of tension and \\\"cold war\\\" towards detente and confirmation of peaceful coexistence as an immutable principle in relations between States.\n154.\tIn analysing the course of events, it is impossible not to conclude that the trend towards detente did not come about of its own accord but that it has broken through and is gaining momentum as part of the arduous struggle of progressive contemporary forces against the forces of reaction and the advocates of the policy of negotiating from a position of strength. As we all know, the world system of socialism came into being after the Second World War and consolidated itself into a powerful stronghold in the struggle for peace and international security. The anti-imperialist, anti-militarist front of the peoples of the world has gained immeasurably in extent and strength with the emergence, as a result of the collapse of the colonial system, of new independent States which need peaceful conditions for their political and economic transformation and development. Thus, a huge number of countries and peoples has become involved in the building of peace. The effect of all this was to doom to failure the policy of negotiating from a position of strength and at last bring about changes in the direction of realism even in the foreign policies of a number of capitalist Powers.\n155.\tThe consistent and constructive peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community, supported by many other peace-loving States, and the bold and persistent implementation of the programme of peace proclaimed by the Soviet Union, slightly more than two years ago at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party have been of decisive\nsignificance in accelerating this crucial change in international life.\n156.\tThe political talks which Comrade Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, had recently with the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States of America and France, the conclusion of treaties and agreements with these and other Western countries, the development of co-operation and friendship with India, Egypt, Iraq and many other independent States of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the constructive proposals submitted in conjunction with the Socialist countries concerning the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \u2014 all these developments are graphic evidence of the efforts of the Soviet Union to carry out the Programme of Peace and to give new impetus to a further easing of tension on earth.\n157.\tThe war in Viet-Nam has now ended, and a whole system of treaties and agreements has been concluded in Europe thus easing the way for the strengthening of security and the development of co-operation. Although in the remote past the history of Europe was measured in periods of lengthy military conflict \u2014 the Seven Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, the Hundred Years' War, and so on \u2014 and although twice in the lifetime of one generation Europe has been the source of devastating world conflagrations costing tens of millions of human lives, today we have for the first time the possibility of measuring European history in decades of peace. To strengthen peace and genuine co-operation in Europe and to transform those ideas into a permanent factor in international life \u2014 that is the noble task of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the work of which, we hope, will reach a successful conclusion this year. The talks on the limitation of arms and armed forces in Central Europe are also of great significance.\n158.\tIn speaking of achieving detente, due credit should also be paid to the United Nations, which has done much to help establish an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence and co-operation among peoples and States. We note with satisfaction that in the new conditions of friendlier international climate the Security Council and the General Assembly have been able to decide the question of the admission to the United Nations of the two German States \u2014 the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Our delegation has already had an opportunity to congratulate the representatives of those countries as also the delegation of a young independent State \u2014 the Commonwealth of the Bahamas \u2014 on the occasion of their admission to the United Nations. In welcoming with a special feeling of friendship and solidarity the admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic, the Ukrainian people wish the fraternal people of the German socialist State further great successes in the struggle for the triumph of socialism and of peace and security.\n159.\tAt the same time, however, we cannot ignore the fact that, against the background of the tangible successes achieved by peace-loving forces, peoples and States in the easing of tension, important contemporary\nproblems remain unsolved: the dangerous arms race continues, hotbeds of armed conflict persist, and millions of people suffer in the chains of colonial slavery. Certain forces are still active which view with disfavour positive changes in international relations and the movement of peoples towards peace, independence and progress.\n160.\tDetente and the strengthening of peaceful coexistence are being opposed by the imperialist circles, the elements of the extreme right, the military-industrial complexes which are profiting from the arms race, the counter-revolutionary leaders of the emigre group which have been expelled from their own countries, the Zionist extremists and, in short, by all those who have prospered from lies and the propaganda of hatred and enmity among peoples. Those who seek to turn backward the wheel of history to undermine the foundations of the detente which has been achieved and to denigrate socialist reality can be aptly described by the Ukrainian proverb which says that those who lurk in the dark shy away from the light.\n161.\tThe peoples of the world are aware of the need for ceaseless efforts in the struggle to strengthen peace, as can be. seen from the wide support given by the popular masses and public organizations to the World Congress of Peace Forces, which is to take place shortly in Moscow. That is why, as V. V. Shcherbitsky, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, rightly pointed out in a recent speech made by him at Kiev:\n\\\"In the present international situation, when a constructive basis has been established and a considerable investment made for the further improvement of the political climate, the advocates of the 'cold war' find it increasingly difficult to breathe.\\\"\n162.\tAll peace-loving forces must, however, maintain a high level of vigilance. The facts show that, wherever they have the chance, the enemies of progress use their vast propaganda machine to try to mislead people, kindle acute conflicts and foster conspiracies; in so doing, they have no compunction in resorting to armed force. That is what happened in Chile, where Fascist thugs overthrew the lawful Government, assassinated the President elected by the people and unleashed acts of terrorism against the people, brutally suppressing their desire for freedom, independence and a better life.\n163.\tOur people angrily protest against the arbitrary action and atrocities of the military-Fascist junta and express their fraternal solidarity with the people of Chile; they are confident that the just cause of the Chilean people, for which the unforgettable patriot Salvador Allende and thousands of other Chilean patriots gave their lives, will triumph and that the butchers will receive the punishment they deserve and be damned by the people and by history.\n\n164.\tNor can we overlook the fact that the reactionaries, in their efforts to justify a policy of brinkmanship\nand the maintenance of a state of tension which is so dangerous for the cause of peace, assert that although the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community affirm in their foreign policy the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States, yet they remain true to the ideas of communism and are determined to vindicate their ideology.\n165.\tBut surely even the troubadours of the \\\"cold war\\\" must be aware that the value of peaceful coexistence lies in the very fact that it enables States with opposing social systems and opposing ideologies to live in peace. In conditions of peaceful coexistence the opposition between two systems and the related conflict of ideas must not develop into interference in internal affairs or, a fortiori, into military confrontation, but must entail the peaceful settlement of disputes and mutually advantageous co-operation.\n166.\tGiven this understanding of peaceful coexistence, a solution can be found to many contemporary problems of vital importance for the further consolidation of peace and international security.\n167.\tOne of the vitally urgent problems which must be solved without delay is the situation in the Middle East. Here, as we all know, Israel, for more than six years, has been occupying Arab territories several times greater in area than the territory of Israel itself. During this time the Arab States, seeking to ensure a political settlement of the conflict on a just basis, have shown great restraint. However, the Israeli usurpers are flagrantly undermining the cause of peace and international security and defying Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and other decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Relying on the support of international zionism and the most reactionary imperialist circles, they are pursuing an adventurist policy of annexation and expansion.\n168.\tA few days ago guns began to fire again in the Middle East, and now military action is spreading havoc over an ever widening area. The peoples of the world are again faced with a dangerous turn of events. Now even those who earlier had some doubts have come to see clearly that the continued presence of the hotbed of Israeli aggression in the Middle East is the cause of the renewal of military operations.\n169.\tThe frequent discussion of the Middle East crisis in the Security Council has shown that only Israel and its protectors are opposed to a peaceful political settlement in that area. Israel persists in a policy of annexation, terrorism and oppression of the Arab peoples, seeking with the support of its imperialist protectors to undermine the progressive regimes in Arab countries and to maintain and strengthen at any price the positions of international monopolies, and the oil monopolies in particular.\n170.\tBut surely even rabid aggressors have realized that they cannot pursue with impunity a policy of usurpation and annexation, for such a policy generates irresistible opposition in the peoples concerned and rouses them to\nfight for their liberation against the aggressors. This is true of any region on our planet, and it is true of the Middle East as well. That is why the smouldering hotbed of Israeli aggression has again kindled the flame of armed conflict in the Middle East and why the responsibility rests with the Israeli forces of occupation.\n171.\tA just and lasting peace can be re-established in the Middle East only through the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which constitutes a realistic basis for a peaceful settlement in that explosive area. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied territories and respect for the legitimate rights of the States and peoples of the area, including the Arab people of Palestine, are indispensable conditions for such a settlement.\n172.\tWe share the opinion of those delegations which have stressed that the termination of the lengthy and bloody war in Viet-Nam is of the greatest significance for peace and security in Asia. We are confident that the talented and industrious Viet-Namese people, with the brotherly assistance and support of the countries of the socialist community, will succeed very quickly in healing the deep wounds of the war and rebuilding their destroyed towns and villages.\n173.\tWe must not, however, forget that the peace in South-East Asia is still very precarious: the Saigon regime continues flagrantly to violate the Paris agreement, military operations are still being carried out in Cambodia, and the peaceful situation in Laos has not yet been properly consolidated. In addition, great efforts still need to be made to ensure genuine peace and security on the Indian subcontinent.\n174.\tComplete normalization of the situation in Southeast Asia, and indeed on the continent of Asia as a whole, would give new impetus to the efforts to establish peaceful co-operation among all Asian States on a basis of equality with no exceptions whatsoever \u2014 a development which would serve to strengthen international security.\n175.\tThe idea of strengthening collective security in Asia was greeted with interest in that vast area. The United Nations, too, could encourage a dialogue on this subject among the countries of the area, an action which would, incidentally, be in conformity with the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].\n176.\tWe expect that even at this session the General Assembly will take decisions which will help to improve the situation in that important part of our planet. We refer primarily to the termination of the United Nations Commission for Korea, the disbanding of the so-called United Nations Command, which is a cover for foreign interference in Korean affairs, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea. Such action will remove one more obstacle from the road to a peaceful political settlement of the Korean question without any outside interference.\n177.\tA vital factor in the strengthening of international security \u2014 and one which is embodied in the United Nations Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security \u2014 is the strict observance by all States of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations. On the initiative of the Soviet Union, the General Assembly adopted at its twenty-seventh session resolution 2936 (XXVII) concerning the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, having rightly noted that in the present situation a ban on nuclear weapons can be achieved only if, at one and the same time, States renounce the use of force in international relations.\n178.\tIndeed, the most noteworthy stages of progress in the improvement of the international situation in recent years have been linked with an unequivocal affirmation of the obligations of States to refrain in their relations from the use or the threat of force. It is sufficient to refer in this connexion to the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany or to the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, concluded between the USSR and the United States for an unlimited period on 22 June 1973.\n179.\tThe USSR and the United States undertook to take the necessary action to remove the danger of nuclear war and not to permit its emergence or the use of nuclear weapons by specifically agreeing that both sides will refrain from using force or the threat of force either against each other or against other countries. The salutary effect of this agreement on the international situation is obvious. And if other States, especially the nuclear States, were to adhere to the principle of renouncing the use of force and adopting decisive measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war \u2014 a principle jointly established by the Soviet Union and the United States \u2014 they would provide an even firmer guarantee of the strengthening of universal and lasting peace.\nx 180. If someone \\\"frightens the weak-willed\\\", as they say, with the non-existent threat of collusion between the \\\"two super-Powers\\\" but at the same time refuses to take part in the joint action to strengthen international peace, he thereby reveals his own demagogic and negative approach to practical international action to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.\n181.\tWe consider that all the conditions exist for the Security Council and all its permanent members to adopt specific practical measures concerning the non-use of force and, at the same time, the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2936 (XXVII).\n182.\tNo one who soberly assesses international events can fail to see that never before in the whole post-war period has the general climate changed so rapidly. An energetic search is under way to find solutions to the most important and the most weighty problems facing the world.\n183.\tAmong those problems is, of course, the problem of disarmament, which affects the interests of all States\nwithout exception. It has many aspects, both general and particular. The practical experience gained over many years shows that it is useful to approach them in different ways: either on a bilateral basis or with the participation, for example, of a specially delegated group of States meeting in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, as is the case at Geneva, or in a forum in which all States can take part \u2014 the World Disarmament Conference. The need for such a variety of approaches to the solution of this complicated problem is dictated by life itself.\n184.\tConsequently, some well-known treaties and agreements have been concluded in recent years which have played and continue to play an important part in the search for a consistent, concrete and effective solution of the problem of disarmament.\n185.\tBecause of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water,2 which has already been signed by more than 100 States, the atmosphere has become significantly freer of the products of nuclear fission, and a start has been made in preventing irreversible changes in the human environment. This year is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], which has been an important milestone along the road to removing the threat of nuclear war. In our view, it is fully appropriate for new efforts to be made to increase the number of States which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to ensure its ratification by all the countries which have signed it.\n186.\tThe Ukrainian SSR advocates greater progress in the activities of the Geneva Committee on Disarmament. The talks taking place under the auspices of the United Nations at Geneva deal with the broad spectrum of disarmament problems. We all know that the general efforts made both within the framework of the United Nations and elsewhere led to the preparation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex]. The agenda of the Geneva Committee now includes the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. The socialist\n, countries, including the Ukrainian SSR, submitted a draft convention on the prohibition of such weapons3 for consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. In our view, the situation is now favourable for the immediate adoption of this important convention.\n187.\tThe General Assembly has every reason to express its satisfaction with the position taken by the two strongest military Powers \u2014 the United States of America and the Soviet Union  \u2014  on the limitation of strategic defensive and offensive weapons.\n\n188.\tHowever, no matter how gratifying the conclusion of the existing agreements may be, it does not of itself remove the burden of the arms race from the peoples of the world. Thus, as A. A. Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, pointed out in his well reasoned statement: \\\"... only in recent years has it become possible to take the first... steps towards limiting the arms race\\\" [2126th meeting, para. 115]. But military expenditures continue to grow on a world scale at an increasing rate that is approximately twice as high as the rate of growth of world industrial production. This has a negative effect on the level of capital investment for non-military purposes and on the amount of funds made available for improving the living conditions of mankind.\n189.\tAccordingly, the Soviet proposal concerning the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries is of enormous importance for the cause of disarmament, for reducing the burden of military expenditure being borne by the workers, and for the provision of substantial additional assistance to developing countries [A/L.701].\n190.\tIt would, of course, be desirable that not only all the permanent members of the Security Council but also other States which have large economic potential and considerable military expenditures should join in the implementation of this proposal.\n191.\tOur delegation fully supports and welcomes this timely and important proposal and hopes that this latest noble initiative of the Soviet Union will be supported by the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations and by all progressive forces and peoples.\n192.\tMany of the heads of delegations who have spoken from this rostrum, and above all the heads of delegations of developing countries, have already reacted favourably to the Soviet proposal. True, there were also delegations which did not find the proposal to their liking. Fortunately, they have thus far been few in number \u2014  only two or three.\n193.\tAmong the few sceptics and opponents of disarmament, as you have heard, was the delegation of a country which is a permanent member of the Security Council, that is, a country entrusted with special responsibility under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of peace and international security and for disarmament. That, however, did not prevent the representative of that country, with his characteristic penchant for demagogy and anti-sovietism, from opposing the Soviet proposal, which is aimed at solving the most important international problem of our times, namely, disarmament, and is dictated by a sincere desire to help satisfy the needs and requirements of developing countries.\n194.\tSo it has come about that a State which puts itself forward as a defender of small and medium-sized countries is in fact again taking up a position, as it has done at previous sessions of the General Assembly, which is opposed to the interests of those countries and is\nopposing detente, the strengthening of international security, and disarmament. It has again been demonstrated that the representatives of this Power, in their judgements and actions, close ranks with the reactionaries and the opponents of detente; they make no constructive contribution to the United Nations and maliciously reject everything that is conducive to the safeguarding of peace and security of peoples and to disarmament. They try to cover up their bankrupt position with rabid anti-sovietism. Truly, as the popular saying has it, their bones are filled with spite.\n195.\tAt the last two sessions of the General Assembly, as we know, approval was expressed for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference to examine the problem of disarmament in all its aspects with the participation of all States and with due regard to the positions of all parties concerned. Unfortunately, the stand taken by two of the permanent members of the Security Council is actually bringing to nought the work of the Special Committee established by the General Assembly to make the preparations for the World Disarmament Conference.\n196.\tIn the opinion of the Government of the Ukrainian SSR, the sooner that this World Conference takes place, the sooner will further talks on disarmament, including those held under the auspices of the United Nations, be given a powerful boost and the sooner will speedy and concrete results be achieved in the matter of halting the arms race.\n197.\tOur delegation therefore believes that the Committee established to convene the Conference4 could begin the preparatory work without delay. If any country, nuclear or non-nuclear, is not ready to take part in the work of the preparatory committee at this time, it can join it at a later stage.\n198.\tThe struggle for disarmament has now entered a very specific phase; the time has come for action. To assume the obligations of preventing nuclear war, renouncing the use of force and nuclear weapons, and reducing military budgets, to take an active part in the preparation and conduct of the World Disarmament Conference and to work for the early prohibition of chemical weapons and the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe \u2014 these are specific steps in the implementation of which all States, large, medium-sized and small, undoubtedly have an interest. Along this road are to be found limitless opportunities for peaceful initiatives by all Governments.\n199.\tDisarmament is capable of consolidating and strengthening the process of mankind's turning away from the \\\"cold war\\\" period to an era of peaceful cooperation. Political, economic and other measures, supplemented by an easing of military tension, will undoubtedly bring stability and permanence to the processes of detente and improvement of the international climate.\n4 Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference.\n200.\tOur delegation considers that speedier progress towards the complete elimination of colonialism would be a very important contribution to the further relaxation of international tension and to the consolidation of the peace and security of all peoples. The existing colonial enclaves are permanent hotbeds of tension in international relations not only in Africa, but also in Oceania and Latin America \u2014 in all parts of the world where the desire exists to maintain the conditions of the last century and breathe new life into colonial regimes.\n201.\tProfound indignation was aroused throughout the world by the bloody massacres carried out by Portuguese punitive squads against Africans in Mozambique and other territories. The fact that Portugal receives armaments from its NATO allies and enjoys their protection and support is not the least of the reasons for these colonialist outrages.\n202.\tPeoples are aroused to just indignation by the inhuman apartheid regime in South Africa. The racist regime in Pretoria not only deprives the African population of South Africa of its elementary human rights but also constitutes, in fact, the foundation, of the tripartite alliance of the colonialist racist regimes of Portugal, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia or, as it is justly termed in Africa, the \\\"unholy alliance\\\" in southern Africa. Repression continues in Southern Rhodesia as well. Our delegation believes that there is and can be no justification for the sale of arms to racist regimes. The embargo on the supply of arms to South Africa and Southern Rhodesia must be strictly observed by all States. Diplomatic, economic and military relations with the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury must be broken off by all States which have not yet done so. Every day that the colonial and racist regimes continue to exist through the aid and support of Western monopolistic and military circles is an insult to the honour and dignity of Africans, an insult to the dignity of all honourable people and a threat to peace and international security.\n- 203. In this connexion we again draw the attention of the General Assembly to the need for persistent efforts to achieve the earliest possible implementation of a programme of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514(XV)]. In accordance with the traditional policy of the socialist countries, our nation will continue to render every kind of support and assistance to oppressed peoples in their legitimate struggle for the elimination of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR warmly welcomes the proclamation of the independence of Guinea-Bissau by the people of that country, welcomes the participation of representatives of the national liberation movements in the work of United Nations organs, and expresses its firm conviction that the day is not far off when new independent States created by the liberated peoples of the remaining colonial territories will be numbered among the Members of the United Nations.\n204. The nature of the auspicious changes taking place in today's world confirms yet again the vision of the founder of the Soviet State, V. I. Lenin. As early as 1920\nhe stressed that the policy of socialism created \\\"completely different international relations which enable all oppressed nationalities to rid themselves of the imperialist yoke\\\".5 The present restructuring of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence enables States which recently attained independence to fight more effectively against exploitation by monopolist capital.\n205.\tWe are aware that the peoples of the developing countries are facing great difficulties. We know that international monopolies, because of their greedy nature, will not voluntarily renounce the pursuit of profits, the merciless capitalist exploitation of economically weak countries. We consider that, with the help of the United Nations, it is both possible and essential to establish a political and an international legal framework to regulate the activities of monopolies and make possible the introduction of profound social and economic transformations, thereby helping to protect the interests of the developing countries and countering the attempts of the monopolies to impede the social and economic progress of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n206.\tIn this regard, particular importance attaches to: a further strengthening of the principles of the sovereign equality of States; non-interference in internal affairs; respect for the basic political, economic and cultural character of all States; equality of rights; and the right of peoples to control their own destinies and their own natural resources. These, indeed, are the principles which form the basis for the ever stronger relations between the socialist States and the developing countries.\n207.\tSuccess in the development of international economic co-operation can in turn do much to strengthen the auspicious progress now being made in the political relations among States and can also make those relations long-lasting and irreversible and can confirm the triumph of stable and universal peace on our planet.\n208.\tIn the case of our country, which has suffered the horrors of devastating wars throughout its history, the direct interrelationship between the strengthening of peace and economic development is not just a theoretical issue. We built power stations and planted trees, we transformed the appearance of our towns and villages, and then, with heartfelt pain, we saw the fruits of peaceful labour perish in the flames of a war unleashed by fascism. The \\\"cold war\\\" and its legacy, the arms race, have diverted considerable energy and resources from peaceful development. But it is our wish that the installations built by the hands of our people should stand for centuries, that our orchards and fields should yield generous harvests and that future generations should continue our work on a peaceful earth.\n209.\tThat is why we support the joint efforts of all States in the establishment of the kind of international relations which will ensure that the \\\"cold war\\\" \u2014 together with its dangerous atmosphere of suspicion, the arms race and the clatter of lethal weapons \u2014 will recede into the irrevocable past and will yield, for all time, to lasting\npeace and mutually advantageous international cooperation.\n210.\tThe peoples of the world judge the political maturity of the United Nations as it approaches its thirtieth anniversary, not by its age, but by its actions, by its contribution to the strengthening of international security and the development of international cooperation on a basis of equality. May the bold and positive action of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on the important problems which reality itself has caused to be placed on the agenda demonstrate the readiness of the United Nations to justify the great hopes placed in it by people of goodwill throughout the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeff166.\tMr. President, our Prime Minister, His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, is retained in Vientiane by his many obligations and has done me the honour of asking me to be the leader of the delegation of Laos to this twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Thus it is my pleasant duty to express to you, on behalf of my country, Laos, our feelings of great esteem and confidence as well as our warmest congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the Assembly.\n167.\tI could not at this time fail to pay a just tribute to your predecessor, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, who last year guided the twenty-seventh session with equal diligence and talent.\n168.\tI should also like to refer with admiration to the dedication and unflagging activities of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We hail with respect his praiseworthy initiatives and his frequent pilgrimages in the quest for peace to serve the principles of the United Nations Charter so as to adapt them to the new realities.\n169.\tBecause we ourselves have suffered from the Indochina tragedy, we can fully appreciate the initiatives for peace and goodwill which are presented to circumscribe an incipient conflict and to restore order and calm wherever they are threatened.\n\n170.\tIt is a fact that mankind does not know and has practically never known universal peace. But our common duty is patiently to seek it by uniting all our efforts so as to banish war and to promote the coming into being of a rational order. What might appear to be Utopian today may become a reality tomorrow. Perhaps we shall thus be able to limit conflicts and end terrorism, which all too freely springs up in many different places in a way which ensures impunity for itself while making innocent victims run grave risks. We understand the deep reasons for certain struggles and we respect the ideals and the aspirations which prompt them. But it is difficult for us as Buddhists to recognize that a systematic recourse to force is the right way to promote an ideal or a just cause. Furthermore, if the means used are cruel and repugnant, they may do a disservice to the cause which they are supposed to defend. In this sense and contrary to the well-known adage, \\\"the end does not justify the means\\\", it should be possible to settle the most legitimate claims by peaceful means through national and international legal institutions.\n171.\tThis concept of non-violence obviously leads us to regret the bloody events which have overcome our neighbour the Khmer Republic, a country friendly to us. It came into the conflagration late and it deserves to have the hostilities on its soil come to an end soon and to have a peaceful life more in accord with its Buddhist traditions.\n172.\tFurther removed from us, three new States have been admitted to the Organization: the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We congratulate them and welcome them.\n173.\tUntil they become reunited, the simultaneous admission of the two German States is a source of satisfaction to the international community at the level of political realities. This new event is the result of a long evolution and we see in it also a healthy result of detente. These are two States having different systems of government which recent events have brought much closer together and which are now on a footing of equality within the same Assembly. Because of this doctrine, other divided States may expect sooner or later to be admitted in similar manner to the United Nations. However, one must be forewarned against an improper application of that concept. It is not conceivable, on the pretext of universality, to take into consideration a mere dissident movement in rebellion against the central power of a State. To do so would create a dangerous precedent and introduce in international relations a centrifugal and pernicious force which would encourage new divisions or the erosion of sovereign States. We have recently observed the de jure recognition by certain States of political parties or movements which are far from having the attributes of a sovereign and organized State. An extensive interpretation of the legitimacy or representative character of these movements would lead us \u2014 and this would be mistaken \u2014 to multiply admissions to the United Nations at the whim of revolutions and alliances.\n174.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, recently held in Algiers, rightly pointed out, among other considerations, this delicate problem of legitimacy among the non-aligned. It further drew attention to the polarization on a world scale of wealth and poverty. It is to be hoped that the views expressed and the settlements proposed on that occasion will prompt the rich countries to think these things over and lead them to consider or reconsider the problems of underdevelopment with more sympathy and understanding.\n175.\tAllow me now to speak on the problem of Laos in the light of the most recent events.\n176.\tEmerging weakened after a lengthy struggle, my country is now reborn to hope, to a dawn of a new era of peace and national harmony. Whereas internationally there is detente and co-operation, internally we must liquidate the consequences of war and organize peace. Our efforts in this direction have not been in vain. To our great relief, the useless fratricidal struggles have stopped and there is on both sides, in a spirit of agreement and mutual understanding, a firm will to promote a mutually satisfactory negotiated settlement of the problem of Laos. A reassuring event has already taken place, which deserves our attention. On 21 February 1973, to the general satisfaction of all, the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos was signed in Vientiane in order to seal the reconciliation of all the people of Laos and decree the immediate cessation of fighting.\n177.\tAfter lengthy and laborious negotiations on the thorny problems which remained in abeyance, this agreement was defined and completed by the Protocols of 14 September last. These new arrangements set forth in detail the conditions for the implementation of a vast programme of reconciliation of the people of Laos without foreign interference.\n178.\tOn the basis of the agreements concluded and under the decisive impetus of His Highness Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, who achieved this, a new Government of national union will shortly be formed.\n179.\tThe problems we had to face throughout the negotiations were many and arduous. The patient and determined quest for peace made possible the most difficult compromises and made the most delicate points easier to handle. It was not a question of sterile quarrels, of rhetorical jousts, of vain propaganda. It was rather a matter for the two opposing parties to undertake constructive talks and to clear the way for a broad consensus on the points which could bring us together and unite us. These sustained efforts have borne fruit. Moderation, common sense and, above all, the spirit of conciliation have prevailed. It is the victory of reason over division and misunderstanding. Whatever the results of the fights, the country does not wish to recognize either victors or vanquished. Everyone is an equal citizen, with the same rights and duties, and all are equally determined to work for the common good. A chapter of sorrow in our history has been closed.\n180.\tPerhaps the situation has never been more favourable, nor the opportunities greater for our country to become again an oasis of peace.\n181.\tIf it so happens \u2014 and this is always regrettable \u2014 that some promises are not kept, or there are violations of the cease-fire, these may be isolated events caused by irresponsible agents, or ephemeral and localized acts of minor importance that cannot be allowed to jeopardize the policy of reconciliation which was won in noble battle.\n182.\tWe also know that the atmosphere of detente has had a decisive and beneficial influence on our own political situation and has greatly eased the problem of Laps.\n183.\tIt would bean illusion, nevertheless, and indeed even dangerous in some respects, to seek peace at any price. Need I remind you that Laos is a small country which has paid a heavy toll for the war imposed on it from abroad, a war which is not ours. My country must no longer, directly or indirectly, pay the price for detente. That is why we are striving to find a political balance in the best way possible which, while respecting treaties, will effectively guarantee our independence and neutrality. We no longer wish to be a battlefield for any nation, whether it is a matter of an ideological war or of territorial conquest. We reject any domination and oppose all the most insidious forms of a certain \\\"mini-imperialism\\\" which, under fallacious pretexts, would seek to expropriate a part of our national territory, carrying out what you yourself, Mr. President, have described as \\\"partition by despotism\\\".\n184.\tWe also wish the international community to be witnesses, to recall solemnly to those who will bear the responsibility for it, that there is an imperative need for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops, in particular those which two decades ago brought war to our country. Under the terms of the Paris agreements and of the Vientiane Agreement, this withdrawal must be complete 60 days after the formation of a Government of national unity.\n185.\tI shall spare you further details. We are at present embarked on our path of national reconciliation and peace, while aware that this will be long, difficult and full of pitfalls, because it is no easy matter to eliminate the seeds of distrust and suspicion which a quarter of a century of foreign interference and subversion have inevitably accumulated.\n186.\tAs such, the Laos Agreements nevertheless constitute an interesting experiment and a valuable contribution to world peace. It is indeed in Laos that progress towards a political settlement and the restoration of peace in Indochina have been most marked. In comparison with our neighbours, the Laos solution is unique, because there never has been and there never will be in the new situation, either in law nor in fact, any division of the country. Under the aegis of our august sovereign, a single Government will be formed which will exercise its prerogatives over the entire Kingdom and will follow one policy only.\n187.\tWhat can that policy be if not one of strict neutrality towards all States without exception, a policy which my Government has voluntarily taken up since 1962, at the time of the signature of the Geneva agreement?  Laos, because of its size, can be a threat to no one and cannot be considered as such. Its people have no hostile intentions towards any country. It has never interfered in, nor will it ever interfere in, the internal affairs of another State. Its congenital pacifism predisposes it to the maintenance of a peaceful system in its own country and to the continuance of good relations with all its neighbours. Naturally it is entitled to expect that other States will show equally strict respect for its sovereignty and frontiers. Neutrality has become our creed and the aim and basis of all our foreign policy.\n188.\tYet it remains a fact that the Laos solution is only one step towards genuine peace. Without a global settlement, covering all of Indo-China, the peace will be precarious and my country may indeed fall back into the chaos of war. But the first corner-stone has been laid. We wish to strengthen it and place other corner-stones elsewhere among our neighbours.\n189.\tFriendly nations who are interested in world peace and in maintaining a neutral Laos, have not spared their encouragement and support. We note with reassurance that the process of rapprochement and reconciliation has been followed with a great deal of sympathy by the concert of nations, as well as by the great Powers, which are more specially concerned with safeguarding and consolidating peace.\n190.\tIt is a good augury that those same Powers, in a spirit of generosity and of international solidarity, which is to their credit, are prepared to grant the countries of Indochina the aid they need for reconstruction within a multilateral and bilateral framework and according to modalities that are to be determined. At present, a large-scale programme is being prepared among the donor countries.\n191.\tEndless conflict has in the past accustomed us, in spite of ourselves, to launch recriminations and hurl invectives  \u2014  to condemn, and to deplore from this lofty rostrum the ill deeds of an implacable battle.\n192.\tThe favourable turn of events makes me confident however and enables me to end my statement on a more optimistic note.\n193.\t1973 is a propitious and reassuring year. For my country it is the year of concord and the year in which peace has been restored. By giving us peace, this year has also given us faith in the future and new reasons for hope."

        "file_text": "\ufeff178.\tFirst of all, I should like to convey the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva, for the success of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n179.\tI should like to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. We have great admiration for your qualities. I am confident that those qualities, together with your wide experience, will serve you in good stead in your high office. My delegation wishes you all success and offers its whole-hearted co-operation in your important task.\n180.\tI also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the distinguished services of the outgoing President of the Assembly, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, who discharged his functions as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly in an exemplary manner.\n181.\tMost of the speakers who have so far participated in the general debate this year have drawn the attention of the audience towards the growing detente among the major Powers of the world today. The spirit of co-operation and understanding that have prevailed between the two superpowers has been generally welcomed. The Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States has been lauded. The dialogues between China and the United States on the one hand and between China and Japan on the other have been rightly appreciated. The improved political climate of Europe has been noted with satisfaction.\n182.\tMy delegation also views these recent developments in international relations as positive steps towards the goal of international peace and security. No more does the fear of a nuclear holocaust haunt us every now and then. The cold war, it seems, has come to an end. But may I remind the distinguished audience that neither detente nor peace is in itself an end. We need detente for the sake of peace and peace for the sake of progress and development and for the happiness and prosperity of mankind.\n183.\tIt has, therefore, become incumbent on all of us, especially the small and developing countries, not to be swayed by the feeling of euphoria concerning the present state of world affairs into being complacent about the urgent problems that face most of mankind today. My delegation does not intend to create any misgivings in any quarter, nor does it doubt the sincerity of the big Powers which have worked towards bringing about an atmosphere of increased detente. What my delegation wishes to stress is the need to seize this present opportunity, which is characterized by a mood of co-operation and understanding, to work towards solution of the problems that exist in the world today. The momentum of detente should be allowed to gather greater strength and deeper meaning. The mood of detente should be harnessed to bear fruitful results to mankind everywhere.\n184.\tWhat I have said just now will be all too clear and vivid when we look at the problems that still beset us in our world today. First, the continuing economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries is a very alarming feature of the present-day world. In spite of the declarations at the first and the second Development Decades by the United Nations, the gap between the developed and the developing nations is ever widening. The rich countries are getting richer and the poor countries poorer every year. The target of 1 per cent of gross national product as aid to the poorer countries remains a distant goal. Unless massive doses of technology and capital are injected into the developing countries, the economic disparity will continue to grow and the world will soon find itself polarized between the rich northern countries and the poor southern countries. My delegation, therefore, makes a strong plea to the industrialized nations to try earnestly to achieve the target of 1 per cent of gross national product in aid.\n185.\tAt the same time, the industrialized nations should provide favourable trade terms to the developing countries. The spirit of detente should prevail in the field of trade and commerce as well, in order for it to have any significant meaning to the developing countries. My delegation hopes that the present negotiations being held by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Tokyo will be able to come forward with some bold and substantive proposals towards granting more favourable trade terms to the developing countries.\n186.\tThe painful history of the colonization and economic exploitation of the developing countries has been a major cause of conflicts and war. So long as these conditions remain unchanged we cannot safely look forward to an era of peace. So long as three-fourths of mankind cannot achieve a minimum standard of decent living, peace and security remain threatened.\n187. Bearing these things in mind, I believe, the framers of the Charter of the United Nations adopted the goal of economic prosperity as one of the purposes of the United Nations.\n188.\tNepal has been waging a battle against the latent forces of insecurity. My Sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra, has recently said:\n\\\".. . the battle lies well within our territory- it is a battle against backwardness and destitution, to fight which I have exhorted the need for development... a crusade against poverty, however time-consuming and arduous it be, is a need and a moral responsibility we cannot shrug off our shoulders\\\".\n189.\tWhile the urge to develop, the effort to develop and the problems facing the effort are very similar among the developing countries, the magnitude of these problems is much graver in the case of the developing land-locked countries. The land-locked countries, having been denied by geography the cheapest means of transport, sea transport, have to incur additional costs for transport in international trade. This increases their cost of production and makes their products non-competitive in the international market. This problem, having been recognized by the international community, has found expression in regional economic organizations, in the General Assembly, and particularly in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. All these international organizations have adopted various recommendations and appeals, and unless some effective way is found to subsidize the additional cost of transportation the efforts of the developing land-locked countries will be retarded.\n190.\tOur interest in the United Nations Committee on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been motivated by the desire to count the hidden wealth of the sea-bed and ocean floor among the arsenals of our war against poverty and under-development. For us particularly, we of a country which is full of young mountains but lacking in sufficient mineral resources necessary for industrial development, and with a limit posed by topography on the extension of more arable land to grow food for the growing population, the promise of mineral wealth and fisheries is of great importance. It is only natural that we should show our eagerness to guard our rights derived from the declaration of the common heritage of mankind. This causes us to defend the area beyond the national jurisdiction from being converted into an area which becomes economically meaningless or unfeasible.\n191.\tWhile we are ready to accommodate the interest of the coastal countries, we expect the same reciprocity from them. We believe that the bigger the area belonging to all mankind, the bigger will be the benefit derived by mankind.\n192.\tThe United Nations resolution /3029 (XXVII)] has clearly laid stress on taking into consideration the interests of the developing countries. Nepal, as a developing country, is ready to contribute to the attainment of the purpose of the resolution for the benefit, of all the developing nations.\n193. However, the sharing of benefit and the utilization of the exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor and the\nenjoyment of the right of fisheries, and so forth, shall remain mere ideals for land-locked countries if they are not backed by specific provisions guaranteeing them free and unrestricted access to and from the sea. There should further be a specific provision for port and other essential facilities in order to make the land-locked countries able to enjoy these benefits with all the rest of the world. In order to narrow the gap of development, these essential features have to be accommodated in the convention on the law of the sea.\n194.\tOn the question of equitable sharing, while giving consideration to the needs of developing countries, further consideration should be given to the rights and interests of the land-locked countries which are least developed among the developing. What we urge is not to adopt any new norm that has not already been in practice among the international community. We only want the same norm to be applied judiciously.\n195.\tMy delegation is indeed very happy to welcome the Bahamas in our midst as an independent and sovereign country. The emergence of the Bahamas is yet another example of the decline of colonialism all over the world. But this evil has remained unmitigated in some parts of the world. In the southern part of Africa, the chronic problems of colonialism and racialism have persisted stubbornly as before. The people of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea- Bissau are still suffering from the worst type of colonialism practised by Portugal. My delegation strongly condemns the recent massacre of the defenceless and unarmed people of Mozambique committed by Portuguese colonialists. In utter disregard of world opinion and the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the colonial rulers of Portugal are stubbornly perpetuating their old policy. The repressive and retrogressive policies of the colonial Powers are incompatible with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Moreover, the Portuguese colonialists are exploiting the resources of those Territories while ruthlessly suppressing the independence movement waged by the freedom-loving people of the Territories.\n196.\tThe racist policy of apartheid followed by South Africa is a constant challenge to the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This policy is not only the cause ,of humiliation for the majority of the people of South Africa but also an affront to humanity and civilized behaviour. The South African regime is now trying to fortify itself further through its unholy alliance with Lisbon and Salisbury. Both South Africa and Portugal have been receiving assistance from their major trading partners, which, in turn, make huge profits at the cost of the indigenous population. The major trading partners of South Africa should stop their investment in that country so long as it does not give up the inhuman apartheid policy. My delegation has always supported the idea that the freedom fighters and refugees from the southern part of Africa should be given assistance to combat racism.\n197. The South African regime has continued its illegal occupation of Namibia even after the termination of its\nmandate by the United Nations. This is a further affront to the United Nations. Furthermore, South Africa has extended its inhuman policy of apartheid to Namibia. The freedom fighters of Namibia are being subjected to great pain and torture in the prisons of South Africa. My delegation strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia to discharge its function in accordance with the resolution adopted by the United Nations.\n198.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the racist minority regime has continued the policy of discrimination and repression against the majority of the people. World opinion is overwhelmingly in support of the right of self-determination of the people of Zimbabwe. The mandatory sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the illegal regime remain ineffective.\n199.\tThis situation in the southern part of Africa constitutes a grave threat to peace. There must be a limit to the suffering and humiliation of a great number of people at the hands of a minority regime based on ruthless exploitation. It is incumbent on all States Members of the United Nations, including the major trading partners of these racist and colonialist regimes, to work sincerely for the implementation of the various resolutions on the subject adopted by the United Nations. We must all act in unison and sincerity before the situation becomes explosive, resulting in a violent bloodbath.\n200.\tIn spite of some encouraging developments in the field of disarmament, the arms build-up seems to be growing in alarming proportions among many nations. Even small and medium-sized countries are spending fortunes in trying to arm themselves. The big Powers, while trying to curb the armaments race among themselves, seem to have been seriously engaged in outdoing each other in supplying military hardware to various countries. The test-ban Treaty  remains ignored and neglected by some of the nuclear Powers. Nuclear tests have continued with total disregard for world opinion. There has been no progress towards the ban on chemical weapons. Huge amounts are being spent on the production and development of sophisticated weapons of destruction. Such activities, while creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity, drain away vast sums of money which could have been utilized to alleviate the sufferings of the poor and needy people all over the world.\n201.\tLasting peace is not possible without achieving complete and universal disarmament. With that in mind, my delegation has been supporting the idea of a world disarmament conference, after adequate preparatory work, in which all nations of the world, including the divided ones, should be allowed to participate.\n202.\tThe Middle East problem remains unresolved in spite of the best efforts of the United Nations, in spite of the growing detente between the major Powers. That only goes to prove further that any lasting and durable solution to the problem can be worked out only by the parties themselves concerned. My delegation appreciates the initiative taken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in going to the Middle East to assess the situation and consult with the leaders of Egypt, Israel and Jordan about solving the problem. My delegation would like to reiterate our belief that Security Council resolution 242(1967) of 22 November 1967 provides a reasonable basis for a just and peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis. There is ample scope for a just solution of the problem within the framework provided by that resolution. What is needed is the political will to implement it and to adhere to the formula which has already been provided. We have in the past pleaded for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories. We are constrained, however, to find that Israel has not shown any willingness to do so; on the contrary, it is trying to bring about demographic changes in the occupied territories. We strongly appeal to Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that the tense atmosphere can be relaxed, which will be conducive to further negotiations.\n203.\tThere has been an alarming increase in the frequency of acts of terrorism, hijacking and other actions of reprisals and counter-reprisals. The wave of wanton killing, hijacking and kidnapping has become a matter of grave concern for us all. My delegation strongly condemns all such actions and urges that the main issue of terrorism should not be side-tracked and buried under verbose speeches.\n204.\t1 have made a brief reference to the problems that face us in the world today. I might have sounded somewhat sceptical in my assessment of the world situation. Far from being so, I have only been suggesting that the present is an opportune moment to go to the depth of the real problems facing most of mankind today.\n205.\tMy delegation takes note with satisfaction of the encouraging developments which have appeared on the contemporary international horizon. The most significant among them is the end of the fighting in Viet-Nam. The Paris peace agreements on a Viet-Namese cease-fire were designed to end the untold misery and destruction suffered by the people of Viet-Nam for a long time. We hope that the terms of the Paris peace agreements will be scrupulously observed by all parties of the conflict so that lasting peace can be maintained in Viet-Nam. The withdrawal of American troops from South Viet-Nam is a welcome step. We reiterate our stand that the peoples of Indo-China should be left free and unhindered to decide their own future without any outside interference.\n206.\tAnother notable development is the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations this year. As a result of patient and skilful negotiations, the two countries have been able to sign a treaty on the basis of their relations towards the end of last year in Berlin. For us at the United Nations the admission of these two countries brings the Organization closer to universality. My delegation is happy to welcome the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, both of which, with an aggregate population of 73 million, a surging economy and a highly-developed technology, will no doubt be a source of great strength and energy to the United Nations. Viewed from Europe, the admission of the German Democratic\nRepublic and the Federal Republic of Germany marks the fulfilment of untiring efforts to bring about a spirit of co-operation and peaceful coexistence, which have been evading that continent for such a long time.\n207.\tNearer my country, India and Pakistan have been able to enter into an agreement regarding the repatriation of the prisoners of war and the exchange of civilians. My delegation heartily welcomes this step, which will go-a long way towards alleviating the humanitarian problem that had cropped up as a result of the 1971 conflict. My delegation hopes that the spirit of understanding and friendship will prevail in implementing the terms of the agreement. This agreement should further pave the way for the normalization of relations between India and Pakistan. This improved situation in the subcontinent should help Bangladesh to obtain its rightful entry to the United Nations.\n208.\tMy delegation would like to reiterate its support for General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) regarding the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Our support for this Declaration is motivated simply by a desire for peace in this sensitive area. My delegation hopes that concrete measures will be taken to implement the Declaration as soon as possible.\n209.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June 1972, was able to focus the attention of Governments and the public to the need for concerted action to preserve and enhance the human environment. The growing realization that protection of the environment is a problem being faced by both developed and developing countries, though in varying degree and nature, is a welcome fact. While for developed countries the problem of the human environment is a direct consequence of pollution and industrialization, for developing countries it has in its roots the unscrupulous use of natural resources and the inability to control the process of deterioration caused by nature. To give just one example, soil erosion has been posing a serious problem in my country. Vast tracts of fertile land are being annually washed away by rivers. We have not even been able to assess the damage caused annually as a result of the problem of soil erosion, much less to do something towards the solution of this problem. These and other such problems of the human environment should draw the immediate attention of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme.\n210.\tIn conclusion, I should like to stress that we have come to the United Nations to pledge our support and rededicate ourselves to the attainment of the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We strongly feel that it is the only Organization which can bring peace and harmony in our world, which is divided between developed and developing nations and big and small nations. The States Members of the United Nations should work sincerely to make this Organization more effective to ensure lasting peace, to develop friendly relations among nations and to achieve international co-operation in solving various international problems."

        "file_text": "\ufeff85.\t Having already had the privilege of expressing to you, Sir, the profound congratulations of the Government of Liberia on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and our very best wishes and assurances of our co-operation as you assume your grave responsibilities in the interest of securing world peace, you will permit me now to extend our sincere appreciation to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, for the able and astute manner in which he conducted the affairs of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n86.\tMy Government also wishes to convey to the Secretary-General its deepest appreciation for the dedicated and wise manner in which he is discharging his arduous and highly important task on behalf of justice, peace and security for all peoples throughout the world.\n87.\tLiberia reasserts its firm belief in the principle of universality, because it is only by the harmonization of action by the peace-loving peoples of the world that mankind can achieve that security and lasting peace to which this Organization is dedicated. I therefore again express, on behalf of my Government, a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic on their admission to this Organization.\n88.\tThat the era of cold war and confrontation among the major Powers is being replaced by a new era of negotiation and detente is a heartening development, which my Government unreservedly welcomes and will actively support. We do not, however, believe that the achievement of this long-awaited detente in itself guarantees the establishment of a just and lasting peace. Such a peace can best be assured if all the nations strive to promote an atmosphere of trust and tolerance in international affairs and assiduously grapple with the perennial economic, social and political problems with which we are all still confronted. The seeds of peace and concord have been sown, but they cannot be nurtured into a satisfying harvest so long as situations which constitute threats to international peace and security are not promptly and fairly dealt with.\n\n89.\tThe Government of South Africa, supported by a minority racist clique from within and by its powerful trading partners from without, carries on with impunity what this Organization has rightly called \\\"crimes against humanity\\\". Apartheid, the worst form of racism in existence today, continues to plague the African peoples of South Africa. The United Nations has condemned this outrageous policy, which denies to the African majority their fundamental freedoms and constitutes a threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. Our brothers in South Africa have demonstrated extraordinary patience and endurance, but their patience is not unlimited. Unless this Organization can find means effectively and speedily to implement its resolutions on South Africa, I foresee a deterioration of the existing situation and a consequent failure of all efforts aimed at a peaceful solution.\n90.\tRegrettably, the South African police, in a repetition of the Sharpeville tragedy, recently murdered several black workers whose only crime was their boldness in pointing out the inequities of existing employment practices and economic benefits. But were those murderers punished? No-they were rewarded with words of congratulation.\n91.\tThese practices, clear manifestations of a bold and unrepentant racism, and the system of government which fosters them, are so deeply wrong, so offensive to morality, so unbearable, so unjust, so clearly at variance with the noble sentiments contained in the Charter of this Organization that it is still astounding and a source of despair that men can support and uphold such practices and such a system, seemingly blind to the terrifying evil and inhumanity of it all.\n92.\tWe express the hope that the principal trading partners of South Africa will weigh their desire for profits and immediate financial returns against their responsibility to assist, on moral grounds and in keeping with their obligations as Members of the United Nations, the oppressed peoples of South Africa to obtain their most basic, fundamental and God-given rights as human beings.\n93.\tWilly Brandt, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, in his profound statement delivered before this Assembly on 26 September, said unreservedly for his country that \\\". . . we condemn racism as inhuman and as the cause of the most terrible crimes\\\" and reaffirmed its support for \\\"the principle of the universality of human rights.\\\" [2128th meeting, paras. 59 and 60.]\n94.\tThe Secretary of State of the United States, Henry Kissinger, in his brilliant address before this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on 24 September, said, among other things:\n\\\"We shall honour our pledge to promote self- determination, economic development and human dignity across the continent of Africa.\\\" [2124th meeting, para. 51. J\n95.\tMy Government finds those commitments most encouraging and expresses the hope that all nations will desist from those activities which perpetuate injustice and inhumanity in southern Africa and, rather, render substantial moral and material assistance to the peoples of South Africa and southern Africa as they seek to acquire their fundamental freedoms.\n96.\tIn all forums of this Organization, Liberia and other nations have appealed for justice, self-determination and freedom for all the peoples of Zimbabwe; yet the illegal regime of Ian Smith continues its oppressive domination of the majority African population while denying to them the basic rights of political representation and equal economic and social opportunities. Most African political leaders in Zimbabwe are either in prison or have severe restrictions placed on their movements. This increasingly intolerable situation cannot and will not last. A small group of men, solely for racial reasons and because they possess the power to do so, continue to deprive the African majority in Africa of all their political rights, as well as of their equitable share of the wealth of their own land. Such practices must shock the conscience of the world-and if the people and leaders who perpetuate and benefit from them cannot be convinced by measures now being employed, then it is. the responsibility of the entire international community to undertake whatever new measures are required to eliminate those injustices.\n97.\tWe reaffirm our commitment to and total solidarity with our oppressed brothers in Mozambique, and Angola. Portugal should now know that there is no price which the people of Africa will not pay to end oppression and colonial domination.\n98.\tThe Assembly is aware of the recent reports of massacres in Mozambique. Portugal, in its brutal attempts to intimidate the courageous people of Mozambique, has resorted to mass indiscriminate slaughter of innocent men, women and children.\n99.\tThis is not the first time that Portuguese atrocities have attracted world-wide attention. The representative of Liberia on 20 February 1961 sounded an early warning in a letter to the President of the Security Council in which he asked that immediate action be taken by the Council to prevent further deterioration and abuse of human rights in Angola. He then gave the following reasons why it was necessary for the Council to meet:\n\\\"This is necessary because men are dying in Angola, because men are being cast into prison without trial, because men are living under conditions which are an affront to human dignity and a defiance of human rights. .. . Must the machinery of the United Nations wait until the dead are counted not by the scores, but by the thousands before action is taken? \\\" \n100.\tToday, in Mozambique as well as in Angola, Portugal continues its ever more repressive and desperate activities, the last faint flickers of a dying and vicious colonialism. The dead are now indeed counted by thousands, but the will of the people to freedom cannot be denied. How long will we tolerate this?\n101.\tI must make special mention of the gallant people of Guinea-Bissau who, having liberated three fourths of their country, happily proclaimed their independence on 24 September. My Government on 26 September joyously accorded recognition to this new sister State. Moreover, as a mark of its profound solidarity with the new Government and people of Guinea-Bissau and as an expression of its deepest satisfaction and joy at their declaration of independence, my Government will, as soon as a constitution of the new Republic is announced and the new Government is organized, proclaim a national holiday in commemoration of their attainment of independence. We cherish the hope that Guinea-Bissau will soon assume its rightful place among the ranks of nations in our world Organization which are contributing to international peace, security and co-operation.\n102.\tThe Government of Liberia continues to view the question of Namibia as a serious special case for the United Nations. The General Assembly, through resolutions 2145 (XXI) and 2248 (S-V), by which it terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and provided for the establishment of a Council to administer the affairs of Namibia, and the Security Council, by agreeing in resolution 301 (1971) with the opinion of the International Court of Justice that South Africa's presence in Namibia is illegal, have together established a firm base upon which the United Nations would be enabled to use the best channels available to it to bring about a peaceful transfer of power from South Africa to the people of Namibia.\n103.\tHowever, the United Nations Council for Namibia remains totally ineffective because South Africa neither recognizes it nor permits it to exercise its lawful role in ensuring the independence of Namibia. Instead, the Government of South Africa seeks to entrench in Namibia its grim policies of apartheid and exploitation.\n104.\tAs the mission of the Secretary-General to Namibia may not continue after this year, the question that confronts us now is, What next? If a tragic and violent confrontation is to be avoided and the rights of the people of Namibia ensured, then the United Nations, and in particular the five permanent members of the Security Council, must urgently undertake new initiatives designed to bring about the speedy implementation of the decisions both of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.\n105.\tThe Liberian Government remains convinced that the highly explosive situation existing in the Middle East constitutes a grave threat to world peace. We believe that the territorial integrity and the right to national existence of all the States in that region must be ensured. Therefore we emphatically oppose all forms of aggression and the acquisition of territory by force of arms. For this reason, the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) appeals to us as the most practical measure for ensuring a just and lasting solution to an admittedly difficult situation. The Secretary-General should be complimented for his untiring efforts in seeking ways to bring a speedy and lasting solution to the problems of this troubled region of the world. We note with appreciation his recent visit to the Middle East and look forward to further positive action to this end.\n106.\tTen years after the whole world sighed with relief when the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963  was signed, promising a lessening of the threat of nuclear war and raising hopes that the danger of radioactive contamination had ended, it is regrettable that some countries continue to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Such actions threaten the hopes of mankind not only for a safe and clean environment but also for world peace.\n107.\tAt this, the focal point of the conscience of mankind, we appeal to all Governments concerned to heed the anguished pleas of a concerned people and to desist from all further nuclear tests in the interest of humanity.\n108.\tWe note with deep appreciation the action taken by the General Assembly to ban the use of bacteriological weapons [resolution 2826 (XXVI)] and we express the hope that measures will soon be undertaken by the Assembly to prohibit the employment of chemical weapons as well.\n109.\tWith the convening of the proposed Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, an opportunity will be presented to all of us to assist in furthering the realization of universal peace by justly contributing to the economic development of all nations. Thirteen years have passed since the Second Conference took place in Geneva. In that brief span of years, the increase of world population, the birth of new nations and revolutionary advances in science and technology have combined to make , the question of the uses of ocean space a foremost question of our day.\n110.\tIf, in our one world, inequalities still abound and the gulf between rich and poor nations continues to widen, the causes lie in the way in which the wealth generated from the quarter of the earth's surface comprising land space has been unevenly distributed. The forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea affords us an historic opportunity to advance the cause of peace and prosperity for all nations by the legal order we shall frame to govern the three-quarters of our earth comprising ocean space. For this reason, my Government has attached the greatest importance to the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, of which we have been a member since its beginning in 1967.\n111.\tThe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations refers to our determination both \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" and \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". In accomplishing these ends, we are pledged, among other things, to employ international machinery for the economic and social advancement of all peoples. Moreover, Chapter IX of the Charter specifically deals with economic and social co-operation for the purpose of ensuring \\\"the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations ...\\\".\n112.\tAlthough United Nations efforts in pursuance of these goals have fallen short of the purposes and principles of the Charter, the assistance rendered by the specialized agencies of the United Nations has been helpful in meeting both chronic and emergency needs around the world, thereby fostering the kind of co-operation among the peoples of our one world which exemplifies the highest ideals of this Organization put to practical effect.\n113.\tRecently, the United Nations commendably assisted the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region in dealing with the human problems resulting from the severe droughts which have affected that region and drastically reduced the availability of both crops and livestock. The United Nations also rendered prompt and valuable assistance to the peoples of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh during the recent natural disasters affecting those countries.\n114.\tHowever, effective as those measures have been, much more must be done.\n115.\tThe framers of the Charter wisely understood that the problem of preserving international peace and stability was not solely a matter of providing means for ensuring the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and the prevention of aggression around the globe. The emphasis placed on the social and economic advancement of the world's peoples reflects the belief that all the peoples of the world should share in the bounties of this earth and that freedom from hunger and want, from poverty, ignorance and disease is an essential prerequisite to the enjoyment of all fundamental rights. We affirm these beliefs primarily because it is right and just to do so. But more than that, we do so in the sure knowledge that world peace and security cannot be long ensured if the gap between the \\\"have\\\" and the \\\"have-not\\\" nations remains so vast and apparently unbridgeable. That this gap continues to widen is unacceptable and extremely dangerous to the achievement of international stability and harmony.\n116.\tThe First United Nations Development Decade has been a painful disappointment. We look now to achievement of the goals set forth for the Second. But what becomes increasingly apparent is that a firm commitment from the developed countries has not existed in the past. Without that commitment, these efforts cannot yield success. Moreover, the vicissitudes of the international economy, and the world monetary system, factors over which developing countries exercise no control, often adversely affect our economies.\n117.\tWhat is at stake is to ensure that the prerequisites of development, including capital inputs and technological assistance, are available to all nations on a sufficiently large scale, with reasonable and unburdensome terms. It is only by those means that the chronic problems of underdevelopment and the resulting instances of human misery, the inability of all men fully to have the opportunity of realizing their individual capacities, may be effectively tackled.\n118.\tThe President of Liberia has called upon all Liberians to become totally involved in building a better Liberia, in working for the development of the country to the benefit of all. He has therefore emphasized that the primary effort of ensuring development must be ours. \\\"Self-reliance for self-sufficiency\\\"-this phrase sums up his challenge to the people of Liberia. But these policies are not limited to measures taken within the boundaries of Liberia, for we believe strongly in economic co-operation among all nations for the benefit of all the peoples of the world.\n119.\tAt a time in history when the genius of mankind has provided the means for vastly increasing agricultural production on less acreage, for producing heavy machinery and consumer goods on a massive scale, for arresting many of the conditions which breed disease and ill health, the challenge which faces us collectively is to use this capability for improving the condition of humanity. Let us refrain from large and wasteful expenditure of scarce resources on implements designed for the destruction of human life. Let us create in our one world that degree of mutual trust, tolerance and goodwill which will ensure that all men, regardless of race, creed, religion or ideological persuasion, shall live together in peace and prosperity.\n120.\tI applaud, therefore, the recent proposal put forward by Mr. Andrei Gromyko, Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union [2126th meeting], that the military budgets of States permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and other States with major military and economic potential be reduced by 10 per cent, and that part of those savings be directed towards providing assistance for developing countries. This is a notable and commendable positive step, and my delegation calls upon the General Assembly to consider this proposal seriously.\n121.\tIt is true that a nearly identical proposal was put forward by the Soviet Union in 1958*4 and 1959,  but as an essential twin goal of the proposal is to effectuate some progress in the area of disarmament, those years of cold war may not have allowed for its serious consideration. However, in the spirit of major-Power detente which now prevails, ushering in a spirit of increased trust, tolerance, understanding and co-operation, we sincerely believe that this proposal will receive the consideration it deserves.\n122.\tIt is perhaps fitting at this time to remind ourselves that a new order of change has come into being in international relations, and to ponder over the fate of this Organization and refuse to permit sterility of imagination to cause us to remain unresponsive to problems that have been defined by new realities.\n123.\tIn this regard, we call upon all Member States, big and small, to give serious consideration to measures which will make this Organization more effective in today's world by enhancing its democratic character and adding to the impact of its decisions. The interest of a nation in peace, justice and economic progress does not increase or decrease in degree with the size of its population or the military power contained in its arsenals. These are issues which are vital to all nations and on which all nations should speak with equally authoritative voices.\n124.\tMy President recently said:\n\\\"At its birth, the United Nations placed great emphasis upon the limitless possibilities of the human mind \u2014 and personality. It affirmed the equal creation of all human beings, and expressed the hope that the developing nations of the world would enjoy the right to share equitably in the wealth of the world. Unfortunately, after 27 years of its existence, man's hopes for a world order of peace, equality and justice have remained disappointingly unfulfilled.\\\"\n125.\tLet us therefore focus on this task and rise to this grave challenge and, in so doing, fulfil the sacred purpose of this great repository of man's hopes: to attain peace in our time and for all time, and to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples in freedom and justice."

        "file_text": "\ufeff65. Mr. President, my feelings, as from this high rostrum I address you, our Secretary-General and the representatives gathered in this august Assembly, are no more than the serene concern of the neophyte who can contribute nothing other than his faith and readiness loyally to serve the common good of mankind. However magnanimous such feelings may appear to be, I cannot refrain from rendering reality's due. And the reality is that we are here in a forum with more than a quarter of a century of experience and existence, a forum which has forged for itself practices, a style and methods of action. It therefore goes without saying that a certain amount of caution when taking positions, certain urgings to realism and moderation in the face of problems calling for vigorous and immediate solutions and a certain degree of compromise which one is called upon to accept, failing firm and unanimous decisions in the face of international situations extremely serious to peace, might well exasperate beyond endurance the indulgence and patience of those who are not accustomed to move in diplomatic circles.\n66.\tIndeed, the echoes which flow from here to the world of the laymen leave too much room for frustration and despair.\n67.\tBut we are here because we sincerely believe that the large majority of nations of the world have decided to live together in peace and to translate into concrete measures the will of peoples to base their relations on the principles of equality and justice. Starting from this premise, one may well think that our shortcomings and failures in the face of certain international situations are due less to the lack of collective will of States to settle the problems before us than to a certain amount of national selfishness and certain prejudices of which we have not yet succeeded in ridding our minds. One may therefore well believe that this Organization can be made to serve its real purpose, namely, to safeguard and preserve peace in the world provided its Members make greater efforts to observe the provisions of the Charter.\n68.\tThus we believe that this Organization can still pursue its task of promoting greater justice for all. To this end, men of goodwill must place all the resources of intelligence, science and wisdom at the service of the solidarity and co-operation we seek to accomplish here. In this connexion we are happy to see that the universal purpose of our Organization is becoming stronger, and it is with true satisfaction that we welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to whose delegations we extend our sincere congratulations.\n69.\tMr. President, it will therefore not be only because it is customary or in order to discharge a duty, however pleasant, that I shall speak here of your election to the presidency of this twenty-eighth session. This event has for us a deep meaning at a time when the world has its eyes turned so often towards the American subcontinent. The important changes that have been progressively but surely taking place, since the beginning of the decade, are encouraging for the future and the development of the third world, while at the same time they are disturbing the erstwhile untroubled interests of the large monopolies of the wealthy world. From the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], prepared at Lima and held in Santiago, Chile, in April and May last year, to the meetings of the Security Council held in Panama City from 15 to 21 March and the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries in Georgetown in August 1972, the Americas will have been the centre of attraction and the high point of the solidarity of the nations of the world which struggle to reconquer their dignity and their right freely to dispose of their economic heritage.\n70.\tToday it is you, Sir, a worthy Latin American, imbued with the purest patriotic traditions of Bolivar, who are called upon to conduct the business of this Assembly to the service of which you have already devoted more than 20 years of your diplomatic career. Your unremitting efforts and your profound devotion to the service of peace and international security do both you and your country great credit. You will understand our pleasure in working side by side with you with the\nsame ideals and hopes for the successful discharge of the enormous task ahead of us.\n71.\tBefore going any further, Mr. President, allow me also to pay a tribute to the glorious memory of that other son of Latin America, President Salvador Allende, that great patriot, that convinced democrat, who was so tragically assassinated when he was engaged in a decisive battle for the economic liberation of his country.\n72.\tOur Secretary-General also deserves our praise for the perseverance and patience with which he discharges the many and delicate tasks which we entrust to him. His relentless ardour and his vigorous interventions more than measure up to the seriousness and paramount importance which he attaches to the role of this Organization for the establishment of an order of peace and confidence in multinational relations. It is a thankless task and a heavy responsibility to have to unravel the contradictions and complexities of the different systems under which our States develop. He has accepted the risk and for that we are deeply grateful.\n73.\tSince 26 October 1972 the State of Dahomey has been governed by a team of young men opposed to all internal dissensions such as those that jeopardized the development of my country since its accession to international sovereignty. Dahomey is a small country but a country that started along the path of independence with the best possible chances for its harmonious evolution in the concert of free nations. In fact, we are generally known as a well-spring of human resources with cadres whose value is appreciated even beyond our national frontiers. With the dynamism and the inventive spirit of these cadres, we are well equipped to lead our country out of the dependence the purely nominal liquidation of which could not truly liberate us. Regrettably, what Dahomey has known over these last 12 years is a situation of indifference and avoidance of responsibilities. The politicians who held the reins in my country during that period spent the better part of that time in creating and maintaining among the masses of our population violent feelings of regionalism. During that time neo-colonialism and international imperialism had found in our country a fertile soil for the development of their manoeuvres of exploitation and enslavement. Disorder was rampant while the peoples continued to wallow in the most poignant poverty and misery. Our show-piece foreign policy had no other backing than its incoherence and enslavement to foreign anti-national interests. Our African personality had disappeared and left the field open to borrowed cultures and reactions which largely favoured the pernicious doings of our thinking masters and our exploiters. Dahomey was the sick man of Africa and the reactionary press of our foreign mandarins did not fail to so proclaim.\n74.\tBut no people can stand living forever in the fetters of shame and exploitation. On 26 October 1972 the people of Dahomey, helped by the patriotic elements of our national army, put an end to these internecine wars and resolutely undertook to free itself from foreign domination. Our political charter, elaborated for the first time in our history by all the living forces of the nation, without exception, acting in unity, was solemnly\nproclaimed and adopted on 30 November 1972. The first few lines of that document give a clear idea of the new course on which we have embarked:\n\\\"The fundamental characteristic and the primary source of the backwardness of our country is foreign domination. The history of that domination is the history of political oppression, of economic exploitation and cultural alienation, of interregional and intertribal contradictions. But it is also the history of the lengthy struggle of the militant people of our country who, on 26 October 1972, marked a radical break with the past and started a new policy of national independence the basis and purpose of which are its interests and its personality.\\\"\n75.\tI felt that it was necessary to give this information on the new Dahomey that I represent at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly because the generally accepted logic demands that we put our own house in order first before we judge the neatness of the home of others. The principles that guide our foreign policy are very simple, but they are also characteristic of the important changes that have taken place in our national life. We are striving to develop our foreign relations with all countries in the world without discrimination, on the basis of respect for national sovereignty, equality and mutual advantage. It is thus that since the accession to power of the revolutionary military Government we have decided in all sovereignty and in full awareness of what we are doing to normalize our relations with the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the German Democratic Republic. In so doing we have sought to prove that Dahomey will be neither the bailiwick nor the private preserve, as it were, of any Power seeking hegemony.\n76.\tIn Africa itself we have tightened our bonds of fraternal solidarity with all the countries that practise a true policy of African dignity. But we wish to state once again that the revolution that has begun in Dahomey is not directed against any State and that it excludes from the outset any discrimination in our relations with the outside world.\n77.\tThis appears to us to be very much in keeping with the development of international relations inasmuch as at the present time the developed countries themselves have just put an-end to their cold war policy and proclaimed peaceful coexistence as a means of attenuating the consequences of oppositions and contradictions between their socio-political regimes. In fact, for the first time in the history of Europe, the plenipotentiaries of developed countries have met around the same table to consider ways and means likely to favour the development of relations between their respective countries in conditions of peaceful co-operation. We cannot but rejoice, and rightly so, at this historic initiative the results of which will not fail, I hope, to have generally beneficial effects on world detente and co-operation.\n78.\tWe wish that, at the same time, the conference on general and complete disarmament would make such progress as to enable it to serve as a support for the new system of international relations that the European States are seeking to establish. It is already comforting to note that the new agreements recently concluded between the United States of America and the Soviet Union bring a fresh contribution to the cause of international peace and security. We rejoice, and again express our hope, that soon the day will come when the enormous resources at present earmarked for armaments will be devoted to economic development for the well-being of all peoples..\n79.\tThus we believe that it might not be inapposite at this juncture to devote as much attention as necessary to the proposal of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union aimed at a reduction of military budgets for purposes of assistance to development [2176th meeting].\n80.\tHowever, in this second half of the twentieth century, the problem of international peace and security can no longer be solved within a regional or even a continental framework. The extraordinary development of the means of communication, the equally rapid growth in awareness of the peoples of the whole world, render the question of peace and security among nations one and indivisible. There will be peace and security for all peoples on earth, or there will be peace and security for none. Of this there can be no doubt.\n81.\tSimilarly, we note with concern that, while the great Powers speak of peace and appear to do everything to achieve it in Europe, there are some among them that, discarding all international morality and prompted by selfish national interests, continue to put arms in the hands of Stateless criminals, mercenaries and adventurers of all types.\n82.\tYes, despite the many wise resolutions of this august Assembly, despite the general disapproval of the international community, certain Powers continue to pursue their old policy of the cannon and the big stick, pursuing as their only objective the unbridled search for huge profits through the most abject and shameless exploitation of the third-world countries.\n83.\tThus Africa, my own continent, remains a theatre of imperialist wars for which Portugal, South Africa, Rhodesia and their allies are responsible.\n84.\tThe Middle East remains a theatre for a war of aggression and acts of violence for which the State of Israel and its allies are responsible.\n85.\tThe peninsula of Indo-China remains a theatre for wars of domination waged by local puppets and their allies.\n86.\tYes, despite general condemnation by the international community, Portugal, that insignificant and wretched country, continues to pursue in Africa its anachronistic policy of exploitation and domination. In resolution 1514 (XV), the General Assembly of the United Nations clearly defined the course that should be followed by the Government of Portugal in order to lead its former colonies to independence. But the only reply to this wise and relevant resolution that the Fascist State of Portugal has ever given was to intensify its policy of\noppression and terror against the innocent and unarmed peoples of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. Buttressed by the complicity of some of the great Powers, Portugal believes it can remain indefinitely in those countries against the will of enormous native populations \u2014 a grave mistake which, unfortunately, also represents a grave threat to peace.\n87.\tToday, in the area of the Sahara under Spanish domination, we find great tension engendered by the delaying tactics of the Madrid Government, which seeks to evade its obligations under the terms of the relevant decisions of international bodies. In order to prolong a situation the maintenance of which entails serious threats to peace in Africa, and disregarding General Assembly resolution 2983 (XXVII), the Spanish Government is endeavouring to oppose the nationalists in the Sahara with an assemblage of puppet elements who have sold out to colonialism \u2014 a serious error resulting from political short-sightedness.\n88.\tRecent developments in the situation in Zimbabwe as a result of the adoption by the rebel racist regime of Ian Smith of measures of coercion and economic strangulation of our brothers, the people of Zambia, have indeed moved international public opinion and have stigmatised once again the Fascist type of policy being practised in that British colony. We shall never cease to repeat that the responsibility for that situation falls squarely on the shoulders of the British Government, which refuses \u2014 for reasons involving its own interests \u2014 to take strong measures against the minority regime in Salisbury. The equivocal position of London with regard to the Rhodesian rebellion acts as encouragement to those other States that violate with impunity the Security Council resolutions on economic sanctions and that provide massive military and financial assistance to the racist regime of Ian Smith. This situation is one of extraordinary gravity and as such constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\n^ 89. With regard to Namibia, that Territory which South Africa continues to occupy illegally in defiance of the relevant decisions of our Organization, the situation evolves day by day towards a clearer affirmation of the rights of the Namibian people to throw off the racist yoke of the Bantustans. Despite the repressive measures and arbitrary arrests carried out by Vorster's henchmen, the Bantustan policy is daily checkmated by the dynamic action of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].\n90.\tThe boycott by the Namibian people of the illegal elections recently organized by Pretoria clearly demonstrates that that people is mature enough to take its destiny freely and fully into its own hands. We are not unaware of the efforts made by our Secretary-General to arrive at a peaceful settlement of this problem, for which we sincerely thank him. But what can we expect in the face of the obstinacy of the authorities of South Africa in pursuing their policy of repression and torture?\n91.\tFurther, racial discrimination established as a political philosophy under the name \\\"apartheid' continues to be the daily lot of the black peoples of South\nAfrica. The international community has condemned this shameful policy in a multitude of resolutions. The authorities in Pretoria have nevertheless remained deaf to this general condemnation. And why? Because they too can rely on the hypocritical manoeuvres of certain Members \u2014 and not the smallest Members \u2014 of our Organization who condemn apartheid here while at the same time increasing their economic, financial and military assistance to South Africa. This ambivalent and criminal attitude, which unfortunately is one of the contradictions and disgraces of this noble Assembly, is, in our view, a political mistake on the part of the great Powers and constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.\n92.\tIt is true that nothing can indefinitely contain the aspirations of peoples seeking to achieve their freedom. All those peoples that are oppressed today because they are calling for greater dignity and justice; all those men, women and children who are helplessly massacred today so that the resources of their countries and the fruits of their toil may be the more easily plundered \u2014 all those peoples, I say, may perhaps not be victorious today nor even tomorrow, but they will certainly win some day. Of this there can be no doubt, and we loudly proclaim to all those who assist the minority regimes that for them the final choice will lie inevitably between recognition of the rights of the majority, and complete annihilation.\n93.\tThe resounding victory of the heroic people of VietNam, after 25 years of epic struggle against foreign domination, against the most aggressive and stubborn imperialists, against the most inhuman and devastating military Powers that mankind has ever seen, and the equally resounding victory of the people of Guinea-Bissau over Portuguese imperialism, prove, if that is necessary, that there is no point in trying to dominate a people by force.\n94.\tAllow me here, since I have an opportunity to do so, to applaud solemnly the independence of Guinea-Bissau, which the Government of my country has been happy to recognize as a sovereign State.\n95.\tIt is, therefore, through negotiation on an equal footing and not starting from positions of strength that we must seek a settlement of conflicts which threaten world peace. It is a solution of wisdom that we have\n, always recommended and that we recommend again. From this high rostrum and in the name of all mankind, let all Members of this august Assembly unite their forces and place them at the service of just causes so as to shorten the sufferings of our peoples and avoid the despair that could plunge us into the infernal cycle of blind and deadly hatred. We are firmly convinced, in fact, that without the massive assistance and the complaisance of some of the great Powers all these illegal regimes would have already sought and found the road to peace and understanding with those populations that they are massacring uselessly today.\n96.\tAfter so many years of war and suffering the peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula smile with a hope mixed with concern as they glimpse an uncertain peace before them. The hope of my country is that this peace,\nwon at such high cost by the martyred people of VietNam, will prevail and repel the forces of evil. We also wish sincerely that the Government of the United States will at long last disengage itself from this part of the world and let the people of Cambodia and Laos settle their own problems without foreign interfere.\n97.\tWe also wish that the important lesson drawn from the Viet-Nam war may guide our international action for the settlement of the conflict between Israel and its neighbours in the Middle East. Escalating arms and repression are no solution to this painful problem. Since 1948 the dispersed Palestinian people have lived in moral and material misery, as everyone here is aware. What success can we expect from a dialogue with people who have been deprived of all their possessions and reduced to indigence? What can we expect of people who daily live under the contempt and taunts that is the lot of the weak? What can we expect other than acts of despair? The problem of the Palestinian people whose lands were plundered is of great concern to my country. In 1948 this Assembly recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist, but at the same time it recommended that Israel should sign a just and equitable settlement to the Palestinian problem. Israel accepted the first recommendation concerning its existence but refused to respect the second, thus creating a crisis that ever since, and today more than ever, has constituted a threat to peace and security in that area.\n98.\tButtressed by the unconditional support of some of the great Powers, the State of Israel openly flouts the international community and wages a policy of terror and arrogance in the Middle East.\n99.\tIt is high time that Israel becomes convinced that solution to the problem is to be found in the strict and immediate implementation of all United Nations resolutions on the Middle East. We venture to hope that the great Powers will help, so that peace may return to that region and, at long last, the Palestinian people and the Arab States may recover their legitimate and inalienable rights.\n100.\tWhat has been happening in the Middle East since 6 October 1973 confirms our opinion. If the Israeli authorities have always sought to delay the solution of the problem, no effort of our Organization will prevent an armed confrontation, because no nation worthy of the name would accept a situation where a part of its territory would be permanently occupied as the result of aggression.\n101.\tWe shall have occasion, in the course of the current session, to tackle the problem of the reunification and rehabilitation of Korea. Last year we noted with pleasure the laudable efforts of the two Governments of the North and South to pass from the stage of confrontation to that of negotiation. In order to avoid foreign interference likely to compromise the important achievements of that rapprochement, we have decided to encourage the two Governments to continue their discussions outside the framework of this Organization where one of the parties was not authorized to state its point of view. Today we are happy to note that as a result of international detente\nthe two Governments are represented in New York by observer offices. This dual presence, however, should neither perpetuate the division of the country nor constitute a prelude to the admission of two Koreas to the United Nations. In our view, any other solution could only compromise the independent and peaceful reunification aspired to by the two parties concerned. Thus, it will be understood that the presence of foreign troops in the southern part of the country cannot have our approval. It is for this reason that my country formally demands that United Nations troops stationed in South Korea be withdrawn and that the so-called Armistice Commission be dissolved.\n102.\tOne of the fundamental objectives of the policy of the Military Revolutionary Government of Dahomey is the realization of a society where all will live happily because they will have the minimum necessary for a decent life.\n103.\tThis aim, which Dahomey shares with many other developing countries, coincides with the purposes pursued by the United Nations. The Charter of our Organization, in fact, in Article 55 of Chapter IX lays down that \\\"the United Nations shall promote... higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development.\\\"\n104.\tBy adopting the international strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the United Nations community once again undertook to create conditions of stability and well-being and to ensure a minimum standard of living consistent with human dignity through economic and social progress and development.\n105.\tTo attain the realization of this fundamental condition which is essential to peace and stability throughout the world, two categories of complementary instruments are envisaged in general. First of all there are national measures for mobilizing human and material resources that are controlled by each of the developing countries in their respective territory. The Head of State of Dahomey stated in this connexion that \\\"first we must rely on our own forces, on our own resources, on the creative initiative of the masses in our struggle to shake off the yoke of foreign domination, to develop our economy and to give our people the dignity and personality of a free people\\\". But these national measures must be accompanied by measures of international co-operation which, on the whole, tend to improve the quality of human resources in the developing countries by facilitating the training of men and the acquisition of techniques that will make it possible to increase the productivity of those countries.\n106.\tProduction is, however, not an end in itself. Its primary purpose is to nourish men and to make it possible to accumulate, through international trade, capital goods designed to sustain, consolidate and diversify the development process.\n107.\tThe tasks that are required to achieve development are quite clear, the methods to accomplish them well known, and yet millions of human beings throughout the\nthird world continue to live an anachronistic life of poverty, when they do not simply die of hunger.\n108.\tIt is by living such dramas as those that have befallen the Sahelian countries that one realizes that with the present means available, national development measures are subject to the vagaries of fate beyond the control of the developing countries. As for international co-operation, everything goes on as if the wealthy countries cannot be moved except in the face of dramas that border on the catastrophic. Lucidity, intelligence and genius seem to be bowed in indifference and hardly troubled by the daily spectacle of hunger, misery and poverty. The generous impetus that in the recent past allowed reconstruction and development in entire continents ravaged by war is stifled in this instance by quibbling and casuistry.\n109.\tThere would be reason to despair of human solidarity, were it not that authoritative voices in the United Nations often come to shake the international community out of its torpor. We think, for instance, of the proposal made a few months ago by the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] concerning international action With a view to ensuring a minimum level of world food security. It deserves careful study in the hope that soon it will be applied in practice. We refuse to accept:\n\\\"... that in these, the years of the 1970s, our world, with all its scientific capacity and the slow appearance of a spirit of communal action, may allow the persistence of a situation in which human beings depend on rain and good weather for their food.\\\"\n\n110.\tIn this connexion, my delegation also welcomes the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Henry Kissinger, to convene in 1974 a world food conference [2124th meeting]. However, we believe that the international community must not await natural catastrophes to help peoples that are affected, but rather should arm them so as to prevent those effects, for if it is\n- good to give fish to someone who is hungry, it is better to teach him to fish.\n111.\tBy helping the developing countries to fight the spectre of hunger within the framework of concerted international action, the world community will also liberate human resources which will be able to make a valuable contribution to development. The acceleration of this process in the trade field calls for the stabilization of the price of products from those countries as well as an increase in their export earnings without forgetting, however, the need to eliminate obstacles of every kind that stand in the way of primary products in the developed countries.\n112.\tThe present monetary situation hardly enables the developing countries to obtain sure earnings from their exports on the international market. Thus, in the course of the negotiations to be opened shortly to review and appraise international economic relations, special attention must be given to measures designed to confer true advantages on the trade of the developing countries by ensuring in particular an increase in hard currency, the\ndiversification of their economies and the acceleration of their trade.\n113.\tWe are profoundly attached to international peace and security. Our efforts aiming at the promotion of the well-being of peoples stems from our conviction that the shortest road to the establishment of durable peace is not war but the economic and social development of the underprivileged.\n114.\tThe time has come to end this statement. I should like to end on a note of hope, the hope that is aroused in all hearts by the noble purposes of the Charter governing our Organization.\n115.\tWe see in the happy initiatives of peace and cooperation between the great Powers in general and the European countries in particular, a concrete realization of the objectives set by the nations that met in San Francisco at the end of the Second World War. The progress achieved lately along the path of general and complete disarmament leads us to believe that we were not dreaming when we advocated that one day mankind could live without confrontation born of conflicts of interest and influence and could pass on to an era of general solidarity where peoples would be happy and free and respect each other and each other's rights. In any event, for the great nations that dream is becoming a reality because the progress of science and technology makes it possible to envisage the process that will enable us to improve the quality of life. We want to see in these important changes that characterize our international relations today the proof that international peace and security are ideals, the realization of which can be achieved by nations and men.\n116.\tOver 130 sovereign countries are represented in this forum where for close on a 100 days their plenipotentiaries will review all the burning problems threatening universal peace. I nave touched upon some of those problems, the majority of which have already been the object of numerous discussions and recommendations in this same Assembly. Be they the continuous assaults of the imperialism of the wealthy and colonialist Powers in Africa or elsewhere, of racial discrimination established as a system of government, of the occupation by force of the territory of other States, of peoples divided following foreign interference or economic domination\nI of one part of the world by another, the third world today stands outside the peace initiatives that the developed world multiplies in favour of international detente. The most pessimistic perhaps are not wrong in detecting in those initiatives a general conspiracy of the \\\"haves\\\" against the \\\"have nots\\\". Because it is to be feared in fact that the settlement of differences between the developed countries may be achieved to the detriment of others. Universal peace is indivisible and there can be no true international detente if imperialism, colonialism, racism and economic exploitation of the weaker by the more powerful are still at the root of relations among peoples. There could be no international peace and security without the total elimination of those scourges from the life of mankind. This is a truth that it is our duty to keep well in mind throughout our work in order that the\nUnited Nations may be the true place of understanding and universal solidarity."

        "file_text": "\ufeff19.\t Mr. President, the high responsibility which has been entrusted to you as President of this Assembly, in acknowledgment of your own merits which fully qualify you for this position, as well as the homage paid to your country, gives us the opportunity to congratulate you as an outstanding representative of Ecuador, a country with which Romania maintains cordial relations of friendship and co-operation. That was vividly brought to the fore on the occasion of the recent presence in Ecuador of the President of the Council of State, Mr. Nicolae Ceausescu, during his visit to several Latin American countries.\n20.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, who directed with competence and distinction the proceedings of the last session of the General Assembly.\n21.\tI take this opportunity to express again to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our sincere appreciation for his devotion to the cause of the United Nations, for his activity in the service of the Organization, for his endeavours to strengthen the role of the United Nations in international life. His visit to Romania \u2014 an event to which the Romanian Government attached great importance \u2014 enabled us to know better and to appreciate highly his preoccupations and efforts.\n22.\tThe present session of the General Assembly meets against the background of a process of detente, cooperation and rapprochement among peoples. That process is the result of the combined effect of a number of factors such as the social revolution which brought about profound changes in society, the technical and scientific revolution, as well as the desire and the determination of all peoples to live in peace, understanding and cooperation.\n23.\tIn the complex world of today, the will of peoples to be masters of their fate and to act as independent nations receives an ever stronger impetus.\n24.\tVitally interested in the expansion of international co-operation, the small and medium-sized countries, irrespective of their social and political systems, are carrying on a consistent activity and are determined to make their contribution to directing international life on the road of progress, co-operation and understanding.\n25.\tA telling example in this respect was the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held recently at Algiers. At this Conference the top representatives of a large number of States playing an important part in international life were assembled. The Conference reviewed the essential issues of man's endeavours for co-operation and peace, and for the establishment in relations between States of the principle of equal rights and mutual respect, national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and the right of peoples to decide their own economic and social development for themselves. Present-day developments in Latin America, Europe and other continents speak for themselves.\n26.\tThe rise and progress of the forces that stand for detente, co-operation and peace demand the development of inter-State relations in keeping with the realities\nand requirements of the day, and the assertion of a new, democratic spirit in international life.\n27.\tAll this requires that the settlement of the great issues facing mankind should be the outcome of the active, direct contribution of all States, irrespective of their size, potential, level of development or social and economic system. The progress achieved in the way of detente in Europe and other areas of the world proves the significance of the role that all States should play nowadays, the necessity that they be able to voice their will and that the legitimate interests of all peoples be taken into account in the settlement of the vital issues of the contemporary world. In this lies the actual guarantee of the adoption of those solutions which would respond in the highest degree to the will and aspirations of all nations, to the cause of co-operation and peace. It is only thus that such solutions may prove their worth and durability.\n28.\tAs Mr. Nicolae Ceaucescu, the President of the Council of State of the Socialist Republic of Romania, has stated:\n\\\"Drawing the right conclusions from the .changes that have taken place and from the new balance of forces throughout the world, it is necessary to secure the participation of all States in the settlement of the important international problems. Life has demonstrated that nowadays no problem can be solved without the participation of all interested nations. Hence the need for the countries that have set out on the road of independent development, the small and medium- sized countries, to act in ever greater unity in order to play an increased role in international life.\\\"\n29.\tA strong influence on international life is exerted for the growth of the political consciousness of peoples and their responsibility for safeguarding peace. The broad masses of the people are nowadays more active than ever. Human solidarity, complex in form and broad and profound in significance, now prevails over force.\n. Public opinion has become a factor that everybody should take into account.\n30.\tA great contribution to those processes has been made by the socialist countries, the working class and the progressive, democratic, anti-imperialist forces all over the world.\n31.\tAs is proved by the latest developments, and particularly by the resumption of military hostilities in\\\" the Middle East, the new trend in international life, which responds to the aspirations of all peoples, does not assert itself spontaneously.\n32.\tAt the same time, one must not ignore the fact that in the world today there are still reactionary forces hostile to co-operation and detente and to the establishment of new principles in the relations between States \u2014 forces that conduct a policy of domination of some States by others. The existence of such forces requires continuous vigilance, intensification of the struggle of the broad masses of people everywhere and of all anti-imperialist forces, so that the new reality may grow into a lasting reality in our world.\n33.\tThe United Nations has an important role to play in furthering all progressive trends, in asserting the new course in relations among States and in introducing new principles into international life.\n34.\tIt is in the context of these important shifts and of the changes taking place in the international political arena, and in the light of the role our Organization should play, that I should like to deal with some of the problems of concern to the Romanian people and its Government.\n35.\t1'he period that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been characterized by a multiplication of contacts, exchanges of views and negotiations between various large, medium-sized and small States, by a normalization of relations among a great number of States and by the conclusion of important agreements on co-operation in various fields. It is the desire of Romania that these agreements may bring about concrete results in promoting peace, security, cooperation and friendship among all peoples. For its part, Romania, too. has embarked on such activity.\n36.\tAs a socialist country, Romania has expanded and deepened the relations of friendship and multilateral cooperation in the political, economic, technical, scientific and cultural fields with all socialist countries and is acting to strengthen and further promote new kinds of relations among them.\n37.\tWe attach particular importance to the broadening and strengthening of our relations with the countries that have embarked upon the path of independent development, on the basis of the common struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. Romania maintains good relations with those States and will also expand them in the future, doing its best to forge links of co-operation that rest upon mutual advantage, and to ensure the general progress of each country and the increased well-being of each people.\n38.\tContinuing the contacts made in the past few years with a number of States in Africa and Asia, the recent visit of the President of the Council of State, Mr. Nicolae Ceausescu, to six Latin American countries is a telling proof of our State policy of developing and strengthening multilateral co-operation with all these States, and gives a new impetus to the expanding course of bilateral relations. -Following the visit to the Latin American countries, the foundation for lasting co-operation has been laid, and we have come to the conclusion that we should add the new relationships to the age-old traditional relationships that bind our peoples of Latin origin. We realize also the necessity of strengthening our solidarity in the common struggle for economic and social development, in support of independence and sovereignty, for a better and more righteous world, and for friendship and peace among all the peoples of the earth.\n39.\tTangible progress has been made also in Romania's relations with the Western European Countries, the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia, which were conducted in the spirit of active peaceful coexistence in the mutual interest of our peoples.\n40.\tA concrete token of my country's preoccupation with contributing to the process of detente, to the promotion of the new course in international relations and to the establishment of inter-State relations on a new basis is the wide- ranging international activity pursued by the President of the Council of State, Mr. Nicolae Ceaucescu, and the solemn joint documents signed by him on the occasion of the exchange of visits with the highest representatives of over 20 countries in all continents. In those documents the respective parties expressed their common will to base their bilateral relations, and their relations with other countries, on the democratic principles of international law and justice required by the present and future realities of international life, as well as to affirm their commitment to develop and deepen the co-operation between themselves, and with other States, in the interest of peace, understanding, detente, co-operation and friendship among all peoples.\n41.\tRomania highly appreciates the development of bilateral co-operation, between all States. The wider and closer that co-operation becomes, the more lasting will be the peace and the more difficult its violation. Such cooperation also causes reason to prevail in international relations.\n42.\tBut, as we have already stated, issues of general interest cannot, in our opinion, be solved bilaterally, within a narrow framework, but only by the participation of all States and the taking into account of their individual viewpoints. Any obstacle preventing States from exercising their right of contributing, on an equal footing and in keeping with their own interests, to the settlement of these issues should be eliminated.\n43 The United Nations is the universal forum that, under present circumstances, can offer the most suitable framework for the fulfilment of these requirements. In Romania's view, universality does not mean only that the Organization should include all States as its Members, a goal which has been almost achieved; it also implies the submission of international issues to the Organization, their examination and the search for their solutions with the participation of all the countries concerned, as well as the observance of the same rules and principles with respect to all members of the international community, at all times and everywhere. Such universality is a prerequisite for real co-operation, as required by the purposes of the Charter.\n44. The firm establishment of relations among all States of the world on a new basis \u2014 that is, on full equality of rights \u2014 requires the strengthening of international rules of law, the key-stone of which is respect for national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual advantage, renunciation of the use or threat of force and the right of each people to decide its own fate by itself. Nowadays, those principles acquire ever greater strength and ever wider recognition in the international arena. That is precisely why firm steps should be taken for their implementation so that they may become constant guidelines for the conduct of all States in their mutual relations. Any violation of those principles, any interference in the domestic affairs of another State, should be considered an act against peace and humanity and an assault on the cause of international co-operation.\n45.\tThe United Nations, which has made a noteworthy contribution to the progressive development and codification of international law, could, as a natural development, promote the implementation of the declarations, resolutions and other documents adopted in this field by giving them compulsory force.\n46.\tThe elimination of the use or the threat of force from relations among States necessarily implies the duty of States to settle their differences by peaceful means only.\n47.\tAdherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter in the implementation by the Organization of its main task \u2014 that is, the prevention of conflicts \u2014 involves full use by States of United Nations machinery and of the peaceful means provided by the Charter for the settlement of international disputes.\n48.\tThe new trend in international life makes it imperative that all vestiges of the system of relations founded on political and economic subjection and discrimination should be wholly and urgently extirpated.\n49.\tThe United Nations, which has made an important contribution to the process of decolonization, must act more vigorously and firmly for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the programme of action adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2621 (XXV)] as well as the other resolutions concerning the liquidation of colonialism and the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid. It should take effective measures for multilateral and direct assistance to the national liberation movements of colonial peoples.\n50.\tIn full accordance with the sense of history and the general goals of the United Nations, the Romanian Government upholds the necessity of international recognition of the national liberation movements in colonies \u2014 including bilateral acts of States \u2014 as the only legitimate and authentic representatives of the peoples concerned. They should be granted a status enabling them to be directly represented in the United Nations, the specialized agencies and other international forums in order to defend and promote the rights of their peoples.\n51.\tRomania extends material, political and diplomatic assistance to the liberation movements in African countries and considers that the conditions exist for the liberation struggle in those countries to be successful in the years immediately ahead. Significant for Romania's stand is the signing on 27 June 1972 of the joint communiqu\u00e9 on the occasion of the visit to our country of the delegation of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] \u2014  the first international document signed by that party. Amilcar Cabral emphasized its historic importance as an act of recognition of his party in the international arena.\n52.\tThat is why we experience a feeling of sincere satisfaction at the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. Romania has recognized that State, and we take this opportunity to reaffirm our determination to expand and deepen the relations of solidarity and friendship with PAIGC, to lay the foundations of wide co-opeation between the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and to continue to support on a multilateral basis the righteous struggle for the liberation of the Republic's whole territory, for the independent economic and social development of that country, for the quick elimination of the consequences of colonial domination.\n53.\tIn the year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we cannot but reaffirm our profound adherence to one of the Organization's aims \u2014 that of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights. The significance and the topicality of protection for human rights is emphasized by the fact of their wide-scale violation. We strongly condemn the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination pursued by the racist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.\n54.\tThe campaign of repression and persecution of the progressive and democratic forces, the violation of constitutional rights and freedoms and fundamental human rights in Chile give rise to deep concern. We express from this rostrum our solidarity with the progressive forces and the Chilean people, and we are confident that it will succeed in re-establishing the constitutional and democratic order and in imposing its will.\n55.\tThe President of the Council of State of Romania sent messages to you, Mr. President, to the Secretary- General of the United Nations and to the heads of State of many countries of the world calling for their intervention as quickly as possible with the authorities in Chile so that the lives of Luis Corvalan and the other Chilean fighters for progress and democracy may be saved. We are grateful for the widely expressed manifestation of human solidarity aroused by President Ceausescu's message and believe that the General Assembly could adopt a resolution calling upon States, taking account of their obligations under the Charter and in the spirit of humanity and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and in keeping with the progress of history, not to resort to repression against persons struggling for progress and democracy, for peace and co-operation among peoples.\n56.\tIt is the Romanian Government's view that the continuation of situations and sources of conflict and tension, of opposing military blocs, of huge arsenals of weapons, is incompatible with the requirements of the democratization of international life, of the elimination of war from relations between States, of securing peace and security in the world.\n57.\tWe are deeply concerned about the outbreak of military hostilities in the Middle East, which inflicts great loss of human lives and material damage, aggravates the tense situation in that area and gives rise to further dangers to general peace and security. The present developments prove that continuation of the occupation by Israel of the Arab territories seized by force Is a source of permanent tension, posing an endless clanger of the resumption of military hostilities.\n58.\tThe seriousness of the situation prevailing at present requires the cessation of the military hostilities forthwith and the restoration of peace in the area. Romania consistently stands for the settlement of the conflict in the Middle East by political means, on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), so as to bring about the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a fair and just peace which would secure the recognition of the right to sovereign and independent existence of all States in the area; the problem of the Palestinian population should be settled in accordance with its own national interests and aspirations.\n59.\tIt is the Romanian Government's view that all nations throughout the world have the duty and high responsibility to act firmly in suppressing the hotbed of tension in the Middle East and for a quick settlement of the conflict there, in conformity with the supreme interests of the peoples, the principles of international law and the interests of international peace and detente.\n60.\tWorld public opinion has welcomed with unanimous satisfaction the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam and the conclusion of the Paris peace agreements, as well as the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos. The Romanian Government is of the opinion that everything should be done to put an end to foreign intervention in Viet-Nam and all over Indo-China, so that the Viet-Namese, Laotian and Cambodian peoples, which experienced great hardships because of the war, may devote all their power to reconstruction and to their independent economic and social development.\n61.\tThe political initiative taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made possible the conclusion of agreements that pave the way for the normalization of relations between the North and the South of Korea. The Romanian Government has warmly welcomed the new proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which provide measures designed to contribute to rapprochement between the North and the South, to prevent the division of Korea, and to ensure the fulfilment of the lawful aspirations of the Korean people to live in a single State set up through the efforts of the whole nation, by peaceful and independent means, with no outside interference. We believe it is the duty of our Organization to take into account such positive developments and to give them its full support. The United Nations should uphold the idea of Korea's national unity, since that unity is a factor of economic, social and political progress, of peace and understanding among peoples. This requires, first of all, the renunciation of institutions which, under the aegis of the United Nations, make possible the continuation of a situation at variance with the interests of the Korean people and prevent that people from deciding upon its own fate in accordance with its own will.\n62.\tWe therefore support the principled stand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the creation of favourable conditions for the acceleration of the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea, which is an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly [item 41 (b)].\n63.\tAs the representative of a European country, I cannot but take the present opportunity to express the Romanian Government's satisfaction at the positive trends now prevailing on our continent, reflected also in the admission to the United Nations of the two German States, an event which we welcomed a short time ago.\n64.\tThe idea of convening a general Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \u2014 which was launched seven years ago, in the Bucharest Declaration by the socialist countries of Europe, including Romania \u2014 gradually gained the adherence and approval of the States and Governments, of public opinion and of the peoples of the continent; following intense \\\"and successful preparation this Conference has become a concrete reality of historic importance for the political life of Europe. A remarkable victory of the European peoples and, indeed, of the peoples all over the world. The general European Conference \u2014 whose first stage, at the Foreign Minister level, was completed successfully \u2014 provides an appropriate political framework for an approach by the representatives of all participating States, on the basis of the full equality of rights and the sovereignty of all nations, to problems of major importance for the consolidation of detente, understanding and co-operation among the peoples of the continent, in order that lasting security may be guaranteed.\n65.\tThe Romanian delegation to the Conference has been instructed to act consistently for a greater contribution by Romania to the success of the proceedings of the Conference, to obtaining good results in the settlement of the vital problems of the continent, to promoting the trend towards detente, co-operation and peace in Europe and throughout the world.\n66.\tEuropean security is not an end in itself: it is part and parcel of the general effort of setting up world security, an aim which will also be attained as a necessity; that is why it is not directed against anybody.\n67.\tWe express from this rostrum, too, our satisfaction at the good relations Romania has with all the Balkan countries, and we reiterate Romania's desire to ensure the turning of the Balkans into a zone of good- neighbourliness, co-operation and peace, free of nuclear weapons; of particular importance for the attainment of that end would be the holding of a meeting of the representatives of the Balkan States, in which other interested countries may also take part.\n68.\tA matter of the greatest importance for the future of human civilization is that of freeing mankind from the burden of armaments and the nightmare of a nuclear war.\n69.\tThe two reports prepared in the last few years by the United Nations, namely Economic and social consequences of the arms race and of military expenditures  and Disarmament and Development,  emphasize the enormous waste of human values and material assets, which amounted in 1971 to $216,000 million, and also the serious danger represented by the arms race for the peace and security of all peoples. At the same time, the talks on disarmament have not achieved results commensurate with the urgency of that question, nor have they met the expectations and hopes of the peoples.\n70.\tThe United Nations, the most representative international forum, has, along with the heads of all States and all political leaders, a great responsibility to the peoples for halting the arms race. The United Nations, in the spirit of its own resolutions, including the one proclaiming the decade 1970-1980 as a Disarmament Decade, should play an effective part in the negotiations on the halting of the arms race and of military expenditure, in the working out of a concrete programme for the reduction of those budgets, starting with the heavily armed countries, and of effective measures for disarmament and, above all, for nuclear disarmament.\n71.\tIt is from this angle that we approach the recent proposal of the Soviet Union [A/9191] as well as other similar proposals on the reduction of military budgets; they confirm the need to consider and take concrete actions towards that end which could be a start to measures for the reduction of military budgets.\n72.\tIt is imperative that a firm beginning should be made in the banning of nuclear arms and all other weapons of mass destruction, in the cessation of their production, the reduction of the existing stockpiles and the elimination of the whole arsenal of nuclear, chemical, bacteriological and other weapons, towards the attainment of the final goal \u2014 general disarmament.\n73.\tIn order to continue the intensive negotiations within the United Nations, the Romanian Government supports the idea that the United Nations Disarmament Commission should be reactivated.\n74.\tThe waste of huge human and material resources for military purposes appears even more irrational when related to the economic and social situation of the world, dominated as it is by the dramatic widening of gaps, by the persistence of under-development in wide areas of the earth, which in itself also affects international security. The economic and social purposes of all nations is indivisible and constitutes an acute requirement for the stimulation of the trend towards detente, rapprochement and understanding among States.\n75.\tRomania itself follows the process of developing and modernizing its national economy The Romanian people make consistent efforts for the building up of a multilaterally developed society through the more effective use of the country's human and material potential for the acceleration of the development and modernization of the productive forces, the improvement of the management and organization of the society, the deepening of democracy and the laying of new premises for raising the standards of life and civilization of the whole people.\n76.\tRomania, a socialist developing country, stands for the intensification, widening and diversification of international economic, industrial, technical and scientific co-operation, through the system of the United Nations as well, with the aim of accelerating the economic and social progress of all countries and, first of all, of the developing countries.\n77.\tThe Romanian Government conceives of cooperation as an essential means for strengthening international security and securing the economic and social progress of all peoples.\n78.\tIncreased attention will have to be paid to the expansion of co-operation in particularly important fields, such as energy resources, raw materials, environment, outer space, the sea-bed, information systems and electronic computers, so that all nations may be able to benefit from the epoch-making achievements of modern science and technology. It is necessary that the United Nations should undertake concrete measures in favour of developing countries in the fields of transfer of technology, know-how and patents, the training of specialists and the creation of the structures needed for the development, assimilation and application of science and technology at the national level.\n79.\tThe United Nations has a vital role to play in harmonizing assistance activities in support of the efforts of all developing countries to accelerate their economic and social progress, strengthen their economic independence and bridge the gaps existing in the world. That is why the Organization should activate the whole machinery at its service for the total implementation of the projects and measures in the field of development, among which an important place is held by the programmes of technical co-operation of this Organization. It is also absolutely imperative that the resources at the disposal of those programmes, which nowadays represent only an eight hundredth part of the expenditure for military purposes should be substantially increased, particularly by the most developed countries. Those resources should be directed to the implementation of complex projects bound to promote directly the economic growth and social progress of the developing countries.\n80.\tIt is also necessary that international co-operation for social development be expanded. The Organization should permanently focus its attention on the complex problems of the younger generation, and the necessary framework should be created for young people to make an effective contribution to the people's progress towards peace, understanding and well-being, under conditions of greater freedom.\n81.\tThe United Nations is nowadays faced with a great number of complex and complicated problems to which it is called upon to offer solutions.\n82.\tThe strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security, the development of cooperation among all nations and the promotion of the rules of international law in relations between States, is a primary preoccupation of the whole international community. The examination of that problem at the last session on the initiative of Romania and the adoption by consensus of General Assembly resolution 2925 (XXVII) show the urgency and importance of this problem, which should become a constant concern of the Organization. In the view of the Romanian Government, it is an objective necessity that all States act to implement the provisions of that resolution and contribute to the identification of the ways and means likely to permit a strengthening of the role of the United Nations. Of particular importance for the discussion of that item on the agenda [item 25\\ are the final document of the Algiers Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries [A/9330 and Corr.l] and the ideas contained in the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. /].\n83.\tThe strength of the United Nations and its potential for action undoubtedly reside in its capacity to adjust to the realities of the contemporary world. That is why we share the view expressed by the Secretary-General that:\n\\\"If the United Nations is to become the organization which the Governments and peoples of the world require and which their problems demand, we have to make a continuous effort to assess the challenge of the radical changes in the world, to make the necessary adjustments and, where needed, to develop new machinery and methods.\\\" [Ibid. p.2.]\n84.\tIt is inconceivable that the United Nations should not keep peace with the progress of mankind and should not reflect and support the positive processes in international life.\n85.\tIt is in this spirit that we support the need to secure an increased participation of the small and medium-sized States in all the activities of the United Nations. That means, for instance, giving the plenary body of the Organization, the General Assembly, a role corresponding to its representative character, making a reality of its competence under the Charter to examine and settle the major issues of international life in the interest of all peoples. The United Nations is by no means the only possibility in the struggle for peace, co-operation, progress and understanding among peoples. But we have to acknowledge that it is only in this forum that the great fundamental issues of the world, of international relations, facing all the peoples of the five continents, can be discussed and settled, with the participation of all Member States and of all interested parties.\n'86. Experience shows that attempts are sometimes made to avoid the United Nations or that decisions taken here are not implemented. The time has come for us to examine in a responsible manner the activities of this Organization, to strengthen its role in international life, to make the provisions of the Charter a reality. The time has come for all the major problems of today's world to be debated here by all the Member States, and the solutions adopted should represent everybody's contribution and express the will and the interests of all Members of the United Nations.\n87. The efforts we are making are aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations, reinforcing the purposes and principles of the Charter, making fuller use of its resources in order to adapt the Organization to the requirements of the day, bringing it into the process of detente, co-operation and democratization of international life as a fundamental instrument at the disposal of the forces of peace and progress able to repel any manoeuvres of the reactionary and imperialist forces \u2014 in brief, to enable the United Nations to fulfil in the world today the mission entrusted to it by the peoples.\n88.\tVoicing the will and aspirations of the Romanian people, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania will make an active contribution, in the future as in the past, to strengthening the capacity of the Organization to fulfil the purposes of the Charter. It is our profound conviction that, by acting in this manner, we shall contribute to the strengthening of peace all over the world and to international security."

        "file_text": "\ufeff164.\tThe election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly of Mr. Benites, the representative of Ecuador, is not only the culmination of his long and distinguished service to the United Nations, but a telling reflection of the esteem in which his country and he are held within the community of nations. It is also a symbolic acknowledgement of the growing voice of Latin America in world affairs. It is most gratifying for me to greet him on behalf of Iran on this auspicious occasion, all the more so as our two countries have just recently agreed to exchange Ambassadors.\n165.\tI deem it my pleasant duty to pay a warm tribute to his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski, who guided the work of the General Assembly last year with courage and distinction.\n166.\tWe reiterate our admiration and support for Secretary-General Waldheim and wish him to know how deeply we appreciate all that he does to advance the purposes of the Charter and thus the interests of peace.\n167.\tA few days ago, the General Assembly made history by admitting the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the membership in the Organization. The significance of this step goes beyond its material value in decisively advancing the goal of universality. This decision has high symbolic value in that it marked the end of an era. The pattern now set may well be followed by countries in a similar position in other regions of the world.\n168.\tI wish also to welcome to our midst the new State of the Bahamas and express our best wishes for the prosperity and well-being of its people.\n169.\tMuch good work was done last year to reinforce the fabric of peace. I am thinking primarily of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam. I am also thinking of the New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973 between Pakistan and India; of the conclusion of the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic;  of the fruitful summit talks held last June between President Nixon and Mr. Brezhnev; of further signs of flexibility in the respective positions of North and South Korea; of the long awaited Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and of many other events that have added substance to the process of detente.\n170.\tOne can take comfort in the thought that conciliation is now a habit-forming process in our international life. To be sure, there still remains much that mars this process. Peace is not yet in sight in the Middle East, and remains a fragile condition in South-East Asia, in spite of efforts to buttress it. The international community is also plagued by the recurrence of acts of international terrorism by individuals, groups and States alike.\n171.\tIt is against the background of this dichotomy that I wish to turn briefly to some of the issues affecting our \ncommon interests. A while ago I referred to the Agreement of 27 January ending the war in Viet-Nam. The shaky ground on which this Agreement is being preserved is no reflection on its significance as a basis for viable peace in South-East Asia and on the extraordinary amount of good will and negotiating skill that have gone into its making. The magnitude of this achievement should indeed be measured against the background of 28 years of incessant hostilities and the depth of alienation they had caused.\n172.\tMy Government sincerely hopes that those who joined at Paris to end the war in Viet-Nam will continue to co-operate with one another to make the agreement a viable instrument of peace and a vehicle to achieve a peaceful unification of Viet-Nam. The viability of the Agreement, however, can only be preserved through scrupulous adherence , by all sides, to all its provisions.\n173.\tMy Government, having recently established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and being equally friendly with the Republic of South Viet-Nam, will spare no opportunity to contribute to the restoration of peace in Viet-Nam, and in this spirit has agreed to assume responsibility as a member of the International Commission of Control and Supervision.\n174.\tIn a wider context, the end of the war in Viet-Nam has eased the process of detente and its soothing effects have been felt in the improved relations among major Powers. One of the happy products of this process, this year, was the United States-Soviet Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, signed on the occasion of Mr. Brezhnev's visit to the United States.14 Though essentially a joint policy guideline, the agreement can lead to more comprehensive and binding commitments on nuclear weapons and to a more unequivocal denunciation of the use of force in international relations.\n175.\tWith regard to the question of disarmament, in our view a disarmament programme should be worked out maintaining a constant link between the partial measures and the final goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n176.\tIn the absence of such a programme and until the goal of general and complete disarmament is achieved, countries cannot fail to look after their defence requirements. But efforts aimed at the realization of the goal of general and complete disarmament must be pursued, and I can say, as far as Iran is concerned, that we have not failed to do our part in a constructive spirit.\n177.\tIn this connexion, there seems to be no reason which could justify a lukewarm attitude towards effective disarmament measures, especially on the questions of cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests and the prohibition of chemical weapons, areas which are designated by the General Assembly as \\\"first\\\" or \\\"high\\\" priority.\n178.\tLast year marked another failure in attempts to break the deadlock in the Middle East, but the abortive debate at the Security Council reflected a world-wide disenchantment over the retention of Arab lands. We heard the embittered world opinion, voiced by representatives of so many nations, including my own, clearly rejecting the retention of occupied Arab territories by Israel.\n179.\tNegotiations among the parties can only be undertaken if there is a reasonable guarantee for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and for the realization of all other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), including a just solution for the problem of Palestinian-Arab refugees.\n180.\tIran continues to maintain that that resolution provides the most practicable and viable framework for peace. We sincerely hope that renewed efforts by the Secretary-General will help to form the climate of peace. His recent bid to help break the deadlock in' the Middle East conflict, which took him to the countries directly involved, was as courageous as it was timely. Against the background of six years of frustrated peace-making efforts, no opportunity, no matter how dim its prospects, should be missed without having been fully explored.\n181.\tTerrorism continues to be a source of concern for the international community. Last year I had the opportunity to express from this rostrum1 s our sense of dismay and abhorrence of acts of violence involving threats to or loss of lives of innocent people. On several occasions since, we have elaborated our position, never failing to call for strong, international action. In doing so, we have, of course, been keenly conscious of the complexities involved in this issue and the fact that radical treatment will have to deal necessarily with the source and not merely the manifestation of the evil. But neither this conviction nor the controversy surrounding this issue has lessened our proclivity for action against terrorism parallel with the study of its underlying causes.\n182.\tThis conviction is reinforced by the thought that not all terrorist outrages are rooted in injustice, and where such casual relationship exists, not ail its. victims can be implicated in the cause of the grievance. If we make Jaws to regulate the behaviour of States in armed conflicts in order to protect civilians and those unconnected with the war, we cannot concede a free hand to individuals and groups, or for that matter to States, to jeopardize the lives of innocents.\n183.\tIn this connexion, a cruel example is aircraft hijacking and other acts of violence directed against civil aviation. Commission of these acts for political purposes has become increasingly counter-productive. We, like many others, cannot refrain from expressing our dismay over the half-hearted reactions to this international plague. If our efforts are to be effective, there should be conceited action by all States, on a world basis, for the prevention as well as the suppression of aircraft hijacking and related offences. In this connexion regional and bilateral arrangements are also of paramount importance; and here I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that on 7 August this year, a bilateral agreement on co-operation for the prevention of hijacking aircraft was signed between Iran and the Soviet Union in Moscow. \n\n184.\tIran warmly welcomes the breakthrough achieved on 28 August in negotiations between India and Pakistan which provides for a settlement of a range of issues resulting from the 1971 armed conflict. A victory of reason, the agreement bears a distinct mark of statesmanship displayed by the leaders of all parties directly involved. In voicing our support for this outstanding diplomatic achievement, I wish to express our fervent hope for a quick settlement of the remaining details that will be taken up in the ensuing tripartite talks among Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.\n185.\tA few days ago, in this hall, we listened to the inspiring address of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan [2122nd meeting]. We know that the environment of peace now prevailing in the subcontinent is to no little extent a product of his courage and resourcefulness. We wish him well in his pursuit of peace and in overcoming a multitude of other problems.\n186.\tPeace in the subcontinent is an essential ingredient of security in our region, and to preserve it we shall continue to seek the friendship and co-operation of all concerned. It is a source of satisfaction for my delegation to note that this spirit is now fully reflected in our relations with India and is reinforced by strong economic and cultural ties.\n187.\tThe principles Iran upholds internationally have enabled us to expand our bonds of friendship and co-operation with countries of diverse social and economic structures and political orientation. With one notable exception, our relations with all our neighbours are close, friendly and productive. Our ties with our great northern neighbour, the Soviet Union, represent a full spectrum of fruitful collaboration. This was further expanded last year through the conclusion of a 15-year economic and technical co-operation treaty, which was signed on the occasion of a State visit to the Soviet. Union by my august Sovereign in October 1972. A visit to Iran last March by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mr. Kosygin and a return visit by our Prime Minister to the Soviet Union are symbolic of a new vision and hope in the relations of the two countries.\n188.\tOur relations with Afghanistan are nurtured by deep-rooted ties, a common cultural heritage, good-neighbourly relations and mutual respect and co-operation.\n189.\tWith Turkey and Pakistan we continue to maintain exemplary relations of fraternity.\n190.\tIt is only in respect of our western neighbour, Iraq, that our efforts to normalize relations have not yet succeeded. I do not wish to reopen here old grievances. Iran has repeatedly offered to resolve its problems with Iraq in accordance with the accepted norms of international law and practice of States and with due regard to the principles of equity and mutual rights and tire interests of both parties.\n191.\tIn the Persian Gulf, from which some 5 million barrels of our oil are shipped daily to the world markets, our policy has been one of vigilance and co-operation. We have insisted that the area should remain free from big-Power rivalries and that the preservation of the security of the waterway should be the duty of the littoral States through co-operation among them all. To ensure the free outflow of oil from the Persian Gulf and the stability of its maritime routes, we seek the co-operation of all the littoral States, all of which have much at stake in this enterprise.\n192.\tTo the great continent of Africa we once again pledge our solidarity. We have supported the African cause against colonialism and racism with sustained alacrity at the United Nations and elsewhere. This support will remain a dynamic feature of our policy as we expand our bilateral ties with a growing number of African States. Since early last year Iran has established diplomatic relations with Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Zaire and Zambia. It is our hope and our expectation that our relations with all the countries of the third world will continue to multiply and bear fruit in the corning years.\n193.\tThe third world is still gripped by the basic problems that have defined its trade relationship with the industrialized nations. Enough has been said of the hazards of a continuation of the present trends in international trade to obviate further exhortations. Here we no longer deal with sacrifices to be expected from one particular group of States to accommodate the needs and the development requirements of another. One of the striking realities of our time is the transformation of our world into an interdependent entity from which there can be no disengagement. This interdependence is particularly discernible on the economic plane. The developed economies, expanded beyond national frontiers, are dependent not only upon shrinking markets abroad but more - and this increasingly so - on the profits accrued from their external investments. The industrialized countries, while having to cope with the problems arising from monetary instability and the trade relationship among themselves, have to meet a growing and better-articulated demand from (he third world for fair play in international trade.\n194.\tFacts surrounding this issue are complex and carry a built-in warning to all those who care to note it While the world consumption of raw material increases in astronomical proportions, mainly as a result of demand by the industrialized nations, the cash value of these resources, mainly in the hands of less developed nations, cannot and should not remain the same. Moreover, the purchasing power of the exporters of these commodities that is to say, the less developed nations-should not be subjected to fluctuations resulting either from monetary instability or unchecked, inflation in the industrialized world.\n195.\tMy own country's development efforts am provide a good example. Our current development programme would require us to spend in the next five years tens of billions of dollars on imports, against a Fixed foreign exchange income derived mainly from oil and other raw materials. Obviously, we cannot allow our purchasing power to diminish as a result of events in the shaping of which we have no voice or responsibility.\n196.\tThe pursuit of our national goals readied a new climax this year in an agreement, concluded at Teheran on 31 July 1973 with the operating international oil com-"

I should like to commend the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience and outstanding reputation. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, for the manner in which he presided over the past session of the General Assembly.\n212.\tKuwait welcomes the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. This constitutes a major step towards achieving universality which will enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and security. I should like also to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Guinea-Bissau on the proclamation of its independence, which constitutes a victory for the principles in which we believe.\n213.\tIn view of the grave events of recent days I shall confine my remarks to the situation in the Middle East. Clearly, those events are the inevitable result of the developments of the past six years.\n214.\tIsrael's occupation of territories of three Arab States through a war of aggression violated not only the natural right of those States to territorial integrity but also the principles of the United Nations Charter. And the continued occupation of those territories is tantamount to a continuation of the original aggression through which that occupation was accomplished.\n215.\tThe Arab States whose territories fell under Israeli military occupation in 1967 have patiently spent six long years waiting for the international Organization to adopt effective measures for putting into effect the principles of the Charter, the rules of the law of nations, and the provisions of successive international decisions. In the meantime, they have responded positively to every international attempt to ensure Israel's withdrawal within the framework of a peaceful and just settlement of the whole problem.\n216.\tBut those international attempts have been aborted, one by one, by Israel \u2014 which has shown nothing but disdain for international principles and the will of the international community. Israel has, in fact, formally proclaimed that its permanent retention of some of the occupied Arab territories is a natural right which it will under no circumstances give up, and that its withdrawal from the remaining Arab territories is subject \u2014 in its scope, circumstances and timing \u2014 to its own assessment of its-national interest.\n217.\tMoreover, Israel has proceeded relentlessly from proclamation to action. Inspired by its expansionist policies, Israel's practices in the occupied territories have sought to transform them demographically, economically, and politically into Israeli territories.\n218.\tThe international community, which has reviewed Israel's practices year after year, has condemned them and declared them null and void. I shall not burden this Assembly with a citation of the dozens of resolutions expressing this solemn international verdict. I shall merely refer to the most significant of recent decisions.\n219.\tOn 8 December 1972, this Assembly, by a vote of 86 in favour and 7 against [2105th meeting], declared once more that the acquisition of territories thus occupied must be restored; invited Israel to declare publicly its adherence to the principle of non-annexation of territories through the use of force; declared that changes carried out by Israel in the occupied Arab territories in contravention of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were null and void; called upon Israel to rescind forthwith all such measures and to desist from all policies and practices affecting the physical character or demographic composition of the occupied Arab territories; called upon all States not to recognize any such changes and measures; and invited them to avoid actions \u2014 including actions in the field of aid \u2014 that could constitute recognition of that occupation [resolution 2949 (XXVII)].\n220.\tOn 26 July 1973,13 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the eight-Power draft resolution which, inter alia, strongly deplored Israel's continuing occupation of the Arab territories and declared that no changes that might adversely affect the political and other fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the occupied territories should be introduced or recognized.7 The fact that one permanent member of the Security Council chose to cast the lone vote against that draft resolution has served not to diminish the moral force of that expression of the Council's will, but to emphasize the extent of Israel's isolation in the international community.\n221.\tSimilarly, outside the framework of the United Nations, the international community has given unambiguous expression to its verdict.\n222.\tThus, the Assembly of Heads of State and Governments of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], at its tenth ordinary session held in May 1973, strongly\ncondemned the negative attitude of Israel, and its obstruction of all efforts aimed at a just and equitable solution; called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied African and Arab territories; declared that all changes effected by Israel in the occupied territories were null and void; and pledged not to recognize any changes leading to a fait accompli or likely to jeopardize the territorial integrity of the countries concerned.\n223.\tSimilar pronouncements were made, a month ago today, by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.\n224.\tIsrael's intransigence in clinging to the occupied Arab territories and refusing to withdraw has been inspired or fostered by three factors: first, by a greed for territorial expansion, which is an inherent and inseparable part of the objectives of zionism and which is accompanied by an arrogant belief in Israel's superiority in ail fields, including the military field, and by the further belief that such superiority absolves Israel from any obligation to submit to the supremacy of the law or to respect the rights of other peoples and States; second, by the continuous and virtually limitless aid which Israel has been receiving, and which it believes it will continue under all circumstances to receive, from the United States, in economic, military, political and other fields; and third, by the failure of the United Nations to take any effective action towards the application of its principles or the implementation of its resolutions.\n225.\tThe right of a State to self-defence is absolute and sacred. The Charter of the United Nations has recognized it as a natural and inalienable right of every State. It is incontestable that the right to liberate its national territory from military occupation is a facet of the exercise by a State of its right to self-defence.\n226.\tOnly last month, the Fourth Conference of Non-Aligned Countries solemnly declared its support for the legitimate struggle, by various means, of the Arab States concerned for regaining their occupied territories in their entirety.\n227.\tThe Arab States that are now fighting to liberate their usurped lands are engaged in exercising, on the battlefield, their absolute right to self-defence. They do so after having endured occupation patiently for six long years \u2014 during which they have seen Israel refuse to' acknowledge its duty to withdraw but endeavour instead to transform military occupation into permanent annexation, and they have seen the United Nations nevertheless refrain from taking any action aimed at restoring their rights without bloodshed.\n228.\tKuwait supports without reservation the right of Egypt and Syria to liberate their occupied lands.\n229.\tAnd \u2014 prompted by its faith in the principles of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force as well as by the bonds of brotherhood and common destiny which bind it to other Arab countries \u2014 Kuwait now renews its declaration that it places its capabilities and resources at the service of international rights and Arab brotherhood."

I am confident that, with his vast experience and tact, he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly with success.\n2.\tIn view of the latest Israeli military aggression on both Egypt and Syria, and the ensuing political and military developments in the Middle East, I shall refrain from reading my original statement, which I request be distributed as an official document of the General Assembly. However, I shall now take the opportunity to address myself to the arena of war in the Middle East.\n3.\tSince 1948 Israel has adamantly denied the Palestinian people their legitimate rights to return to their homeland. After the war of June 1967 it has been arrogantly following a policy of aggrandizement and outright territorial annexation of Arab lands. Counting on the myth of military superiority, Israel has undertaken a policy of continued military provocation and State terrorism. In the last six years, Israel has bombarded civilian populations in Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon; it has downed a civilian aircraft and hijacked another one. All this has been done on the pretext of the requirements of Israeli security.\n4.\tIn response to further Israeli provocations and aggression, Egypt and Syria, after having exhausted all means of regaining their lost territory through the Security Council and by other peaceful means, have resorted to liberation of their lands by force \u2014 the only language which the Zionists understand. A war of liberation of Arab lands is now under way. The General Assembly whose many resolutions have been flouted by Israel, is in duty bound to support this war of liberation until all Arab lands are liberated and until the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored.\n5. Egypt and Syria are fighting on their own territories against occupation; and the Palestinian resistance movement is struggling to regain the rights of the Palestinian people in their homeland. What people and what State would tolerate alien occupation and outright colonialism? What is the United Nations Charter about if it does not safeguard the rights of peoples to liberation and the rights of States to independence?\nIn the Security Council the representative of the United States of America asked Egypt and Syria to withdraw from their own territories in order to allow Israel to perpetuate its occupation. When his request was rebuffed by the majority of the members of the Security Council, his Government moved its Sixth Fleet nearer to the arena of conflict, and there are reports that United States military planes and equipment are being hurriedly transported to Israel. This act of United States involvement is directed against all the Arab peoples and is certainly one last piece of proof that the occupation of Arab lands and the usurpation of the national rights of the Palestinian people by Israel are not only condoned by the United States, but are also sustained and encouraged by it. The Arab peoples will prove that, regardless of the time, they can repel the dual American- Israeli aggression.\n7.\tThe latest bombardment- of civilian targets by the Israeli air force in Syria are not only to be condemned, but are also against the principles of international law in armed conflict. The United States which is supplying Israel with long-range bombers, cannot escape condemnation, and the Israeli murderers will certainly pay for the atrocities they are inflicting on civilian populations and targets.\n8.\tThe Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen fully supports the struggle of Egypt and Syria to liberate their occupied territories, as well as the struggle co restore the full rights of the Palestinian people."

I assure you, Mr. President, that my delegation will spare no effort to co-operate with you during the term of your presidency.\n102.\tIt is also with pleasure and satisfaction that I welcome, on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic, the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, as well as the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, to membership in the United Nations. The admission of the two German States signifies the ending of the painful sufferings to which mankind as a whole, as well as the German people themselves, were subjected when nazism appeared in the arena of world history.\n103.\tWe are convinced that the contribution of these two States to our Organization will be effective and open up new perspectives for international co-operation in building a better future for mankind, characterized by peace and progress. On this occasion I am happy to convey to the General Assembly that my Government has recognized the Government of Guinea-Bissau, which we hope will soon take its place in our Organization.\n104.\tThe explosive situation in the Middle East has imposed upon me the necessity of shortening my statement now before you, which I request be reflected in the General Assembly records. It is my conviction that our responsibilities in preserving international peace require the concentration of our attention on the developments in the Middle East, where a dangerous situation, with all its repercussions on international relations, has been created.\n105.\tThe Israeli persistence in disregard for international will to establish peace and justice in the Middle East, and the Israeli refusal to respect and to abide by General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, is to be blamed for the eruption of hostilities in the Middle East. Israel, by virtue of its technical superiority, and of the material and moral support extended to it by a super-Power represented in the flow of arms and money, is to be held responsible for the premeditated and continued aggression on Arab lands.\n106.\tOur role should not be confined merely to delivering speeches and statements or adopting resolutions full of compassion for humanity, peace and justice. If we really want to acquire for ourselves the quality of a civilized international community and make sure that we have abandoned the law of the jungle and are willing to live as human beings in this universe, then we are bound to give this\nOrganization an effective role in stopping aggression and putting an end to injustices inflicted on small nations by\ninternational pirates, by virtue of their might and technological superiority.\n107.\tOur responsibilities call for a scrupulous implementation of the United Nations resolutions. In this connexion, I refer to those resolutions which condemn the acquisition of territories by force.\n108.\tIf we do not abide by the international norms which we have accepted as embodied in the Charter, if we do not respect the decisions we have adopted, if we resort, as some do, to the murder of international will by a single vote, then we will, certainly, find ourselves in the future confronted with a devastating situation, not only in the Middle East alone but in other parts of the world.\n109.\tJustice is indivisible, legitimacy is indivisible, and if aggression is given the chance to reap its fruits and achieve victory while we watch as spectators and are satisfied with condemnation, without putting an end to it, then we are allowing the epidemic to spread indefinitely. In order to maintain a genuine and lasting peace in the area, and before trying to suppress the smoke, we should honestly seek to extinguish the source of the fire.\n110.\tSince its inception the conflict in the Middle East has revolved around one issue: that is, the legitimate right of the people of Palestine to live as a nation in their homeland and not as refugees victims of the aggression by a Member State of the United Nations.\n111.\tThe tragedy of the people of Palestine is the main source of tension and hostility in the Middle East. The\nUnited Nations, which played the role of the midwife in the creation of Israel, is called upon today, more than at any time before, to impose on Israel compliance with United Nations resolutions regarding the right of the Palestinians to self-determination.\n112.\tThe United Nations is in duty bound to see to it that Israel fully respects the territorial integrity of the Arab States and abandons its illegal claims of sovereignty acquired by the force of arms.\n113.\tThe great sacrifices endured by the peoples of Egypt and Syria, who had been denied justice and were forced into this battle to regain their territories, awaken every human conscience which believes in the right of every human being to live in a free and independent society. My delegation takes this opportunity to salute the heroic sacrifices and the determination of the people of Egypt and Syria. It is my duty to declare from this rostrum, on behalf of Yemen, our total support for and solidarity with the people of Egypt and Syria, who are now engaged in a legitimate struggle to liberate their territories occupied by force for so long by Israel. It is my conviction that the freedom-loving and peace-loving nations Will lend their support to the legitimate rights of both Egypt and Syria, in the pursuit of peace based on justice which would put an end to Israeli aggression."

        "file_text": "\ufeff354.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic, it is my privilege to join with my fellow representatives in congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. We are confident that your wisdom and guidance will greatly contribute to the success of the session, and my delegation pledges to you, Sir, its full co-operation.\n355.\tMy delegation also wishes to express to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, its appreciation of his efficient and skilful handling of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n356.\tI wish also to welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. The accession of these three States to our\nOrganization is a clear indication that the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations are both acquiring an ever greater recognition.\n357.\tFollowing the renewed acts of aggression launched by Israel last Saturday against Egypt and Syria, the situation in the Middle East has drastically deteriorated and fully justifies international concern, for such a situation could have tragic consequences for world peace and security, The Somali Democratic Republic unreservedly condemns Israel for its repeated aggression against the Arab States and for breaking once again the already fragile peace in the Middle East. The General Assembly must strongly condemn Israel for this latest provocative act of aggression; otherwise it would be failing in its primary duty. Furthermore, the Assembly must immediately take the initiative of asking Israel to withdraw its forces from all the occupied Arab territories which it seized in 1967 so that an end to the violence of war now in progress could be promptly brought about.\n358.\tMy Government shares the disappointment of the majority of Member States that progress towards a clarification of the issues, and therefore towards a solution of the Middle East problem on the basis of accepted principles of international law, was impeded last July. I refer to the United States veto in the Security Council of a draft resolution that had gained solid support from an overwhelming majority of the Council's membership. In this connexion, my delegation fully endorses the resolution by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of [OAU] at its tenth ordinary session and presented to the United Nations General Assembly by the current Chairman of that organization, General Yakubu Gowon, the President of Nigeria, a few days ago [2141st meeting]. We also applaud the forthright decision of the Republic of Zaire to break off diplomatic relations with Israel, as announced to the world by President Mobutu Sese Seko during his address to the General Assembly on 4 October 1973 [2140th meeting]. It is our strong hope that all those who have a sincere concern for the cause of peace and justice in the Middle East will follow suit.\n359.\tThe task before the United Nations with regard to the Middle East is not the devising of so-called balanced resolutions as though the problem was one of literary composition rather than of political realities. United Nations action must reflect the facts of the situation, which are that Egypt and Jordan have co-operated with United Nations peace initiatives and Israel has adamantly refused to do so.\n360.\tThe consensus of the United Nations membership is that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is a just and practicable basis for peace. But Israel has refused to accept its main responsibilities under that resolution by stating that it will never withdraw to the pre-June 1967 de facto boundaries and by ignoring the question of the Palestine refugees. On the other hand, Egypt and Jordan have acceded to every requirement of resolution 242 (1967) that concerns them, in response to the United Nations peace initiative undertaken by Ambassador Jarring. They have stated clearly and unequivocally their willingness to terminate all states of belligerency and to acknowledge the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force.\n361.\tIsrael calls for negotiations without conditions, but its exceptions to this position are so notable as to make it inoperable. There is the exception of Arab Jerusalem, whose return has been declared non-negotiable and where a I frantic rush is being made to change the Arab composition and character of the Old City; where, too, the sacred trust of the spiritual and aesthetic integrity of three great religions is being betrayed by political expediency and crass materialism. There are the exceptions of Sharm el Sheikh and the paramilitary settlements in the Sinai desert. There are the exceptions on the west bank of the Jordan where more paramilitary settlements and a linking highway are being established as part of a plan for a \\\"security belt\\\" within occupied Arab territory. There is also the significant movement of the Arab population in Gaza and the assertion that the Golan Heights will not be returned to Syria.\n362.\tIf there were any doubts about the true nature of Israel's annexationist and expansionist policies, they should be dispelled by the fact that the dominant Labour Party has put forward as a major platform in its elections campaign the establishment of new Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and a plan for the public and private purchase of Arab land. All these positions and activities contravene the United Nations Charter, numerous United Nations resolutions, and the provisions of relevant international conventions.\n363.\tIn the light of these facts, it is difficult to see how any State can support Israel's position and claim with credibility to support resolution 242 (1967) as well. The efforts of all who seek peace with justice in the Middle East must be directed towards ending Israel's illegal occupation of Arab territory and towards restoring the inalienable rights of the Palestinian refugees. The plight of the Palestinians still remains at the heart of the Middle East problem.\n364.\tNo settlement would be complete or lasting unless this long-standing injustice is ended and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians are satisfied. This fact is universally acknowledged in principle and almost universally ignored in practice.\n365.\tOn 24 September last, a new independent State was proclaimed by the Popular National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau. On behalf of the people and Government of my country, I wish to salute from this rostrum the birth of a new sister State in Guinea-Bissau to which my Government has already extended diplomatic recognition.\n366.\tThis jubilant event illustrates in a dramatic way the validity and the effectiveness of the African liberation movements. The success of the long and arduous struggle led by PAIGC provides a symbol of hope for those other peoples still under colonial domination. It is a warning to the colonialist and racist oppressors that they are not invincible and that the spirit of freedom can and will prevail.\n367.\tThe primary task of the new State of Guinea-Bissau is to complete the expulsion of Portuguese forces from the rest of its territory and from Cape Verde. In this task it will need as much diplomatic and material support so that the consolidation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity can be firmly established. All those States which give such support will show their concern for human rights and human dignity, and for the achievement of an important goal of the United Nations \u2014 that of self-determination and independence for all peoples. This goal is closely linked to the principle of universality in the United Nations, for only when all subjugated peoples are free to take their places in the family of nations, will true universality have been accomplished. We, therefore, look forward to an early admission of the new State of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations.\n368.\tIn this connexion, I should like to pay tribute to the memory of all those Guinean patriots who have paid the price of this victory with their own lives and we pay special homage to the memory of the late leader of PAIGC, Amilcar Cabral, who died at the hands of the forces of oppression.\n369.\tThe recent tragic events in Chile, where the legitimate Government of the late President Salvador Allende was overthrown by the most reactionary elements within the armed forces, provide a vivid example of the menace to the developing world of the forces of imperialism represented by multinational corporations. All who believe in the. philosophy and goals of Salvador Allende will condemn the combination of foreign interests that effected his overthrow and will strongly condemn the brutal manner in which his work was interrupted.\n370.\tAt this point, I should like to pay homage to the memory of Salvador Allende Gossens, the late President of Chile, who paid with his life for his loyalty to his ideals and whose tragic and untimely death is a blow to the cause which he pursued with so much dedication, namely, the cause of social justice.\n371.\tThe tragedy in Chile, which fully justifies international concern, provides also another vivid example of how the combined forces of imperialism and reactionary foreign interests can replace those of peaceful revolution for social change.\n372.\tThis subject should be examined by the United Nations because it is becoming all too apparent that these elements can and do use the great political and economic influence they command to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\n373.\tThe United Nations must also be concerned about these events because the reactionary military junta is not only hounding down and executing supporters of the legitimate socialist Government of the late President, but are subjecting foreign nationals and property to their harshly repressive measures. A Member State, Cuba, has already lodged a complaint to the Security Council in this regard. It is to be hoped that the pressure of international opinion will serve to end, for citizens and-non-citizens alike, the reign of terror and the suppression of fundamental human rights in that unfortunate country.\n374.\tThe twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is taking place against a background of what is considered by many a detente in international relations. My Government cautiously welcomes the easing of tensions in some areas of the world. There is clear evidence that such areas have moved away from a cold-war atmosphere and that peaceful coexistence among the nations concerned is no longer an optimistic slogan. This development can be seen in the bilateral and multilateral agreements between European nations in the last three years and in the meetings which have resulted in the establishment of peaceful and better relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the United States Government and the People's Republic of China. There is further evidence of this spirit of detente in the Helsinki Conference, which initiated a period of East-West co-operation in economic, industrial, cultural, scientific and environmental affairs and which set in motion concrete efforts to reduce military tensions.\n375.\tIt is the conviction of my Government that the achievement of the easing of tensions in the parts of the world I have already referred to owes much to the fact that for nearly three decades now the statesmen of the world and representatives of Member States have been acquiring the habit of international co-operation at the United Nations and its agencies.\n376.\tEverything that happens in world politics is reflected at the United Nations. However, the Organization is not merely a mirror of the world situation \u2014 it is a training ground for the acquisition of the habit of international cooperation in political as in other fields.\n377.\tThe achievement of the Organization in instilling the habit of international co-operation is indeed unspectacular but steady and it is of significant importance, for the habit must be learnt if the structure of peace is to be built.\n378.\tThe more obvious successes of the Organization in the economic, social, scientific and humanitarian fields underline the necessity of the existence of an established machinery for global action. Each year sees the expansion of United Nations activity into new and exciting areas of human experience and endeavour such as the protection of the environment and the use of the sea-bed, oceans and space.\n379.\tIt is in this context that my Government would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and to the various agencies of the United Nations for their efforts in organizing, over the past year, relief assistance to many countries which were hit by natural disasters.\n380.\tFollowing the tragic results of the earthquake in Nicaragua, were the equally tragic famine conditions in parts of India, major floods in Pakistan and the overwhelming tragedy of the drought that has wreaked havoc on the people and economies of several countries in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of west and central Africa.\n381.\tThe Somali Democratic Republic has suffered from occasional droughts and so we can appreciate fully the way such disasters retard national development and shatter\nins which have been formulated on the basis of limited resources. In such circumstances, the developing countries\nsometimes require international assistance so that normal conditions can be restored.\n382.\tMy Government was glad to witness the excellent organization that has been established by the Secretary-General to deal with crisis situations in a co-ordinated manner. We will certainly give favourable consideration to the Secretary-General's plan, endorsed by the Economic and Social Council, to devise an over-all international strategy to provide the required co-ordination for medium-and long-term assistance to countries affected by large-scale natural disasters.\n383.\tIt is another positive contribution to the cause of peace that regional co-operation has become as much a part of the world scene as international co-operation. OAU, which celebrated its tenth anniversary this year, is in a very real sense a positive outgrowth of the United Nations, and its existence and effective functioning for the past decade have made it as significant to African peace and progress as the United Nations is to world peace and progress.\n384.\tLike the United Nations, the OAU is more often criticized for its failures than praised for the steady progress it is making in every area of regional co-operation. My Government believes that the record of the OAU is an impressive one and that it will continue to improve as the benefits of regional co-operation become increasingly apparent.\n385.\tAnother aspect of the agreement of general policy reached by the African Heads of State and Government last May, and one which my Government considers of particular importance, is the unanimous support of African States for the principle of non-alignment. We regard this as a positive force and one that has contributed to the advent of the era of international detente.\n386.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, of 76 non-aligned States demonstrated the fact that the principle of non-alignment has now attracted a clear majority of the Member States of the United Nations, and that the third world is a highly significant factor in international affairs.\n387.\tMy Government supports the consensus of the Conference that it is time for the United Nations to recognize that the third world should be given a greater voice, and that such a change could best be made by abolishing or limiting the veto system of the major Powers.\n388.\tWe also support the insistence of the non-aligned States that principles of international law should be upheld, particularly in the context of the Middle East where Israel refuses to accept the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. We of course identify ourselves strongly with the concern of the non-aligned States for human rights shown in their decision to give active support to the African liberation movements. We share, too, the aspirations of other peace-loving States in the call for disarmament in general, and nuclear disarmament in particular. One of the results of the non-aligned Conference we consider of immediate practical value is the agreement on presenting a solid third world front in negotiations for establishing\n33\nequitable arrangements and conditions for trade with the developed countries, and agreement on the principle that developing countries have the right fully to control their natural resources.\n389.\tThe de-escalation of the American military involvement in South-East Asia is, we hope, another step towards world peace. The end of the war in Viet-Nam can be described as the removal of a cancer from the international body politic. Small nations can now hope that ' a heightened sense of international morality will in future protect them against being used as pawns in the game of international power politics. My Government trusts that not only the people of Viet-Nam but also those of Laos and Cambodia, who have suffered illegal, wanton and highly destructive bombing attacks, will now be permanently free from the terrors of a particularly inhuman aggression.\n390.\tThe people of South-East Asia must, like any other people, be left alone to determine for themselves their political future, free from outside pressures and interferences. Their wish for, and indeed their right to, political self-determination must be scrupulously respected.\n391.\tIt is evident that the Cambodian people look to the return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk for the restoration of unity and stability to their country. My Government recognizes the Royal Government of National Union headed by Prince Sihanouk, whom we regard as the legitimate Cambodian Chief of State and who has the support of the majority of the people. We hope that it will soon be possible for him to be in a position to lead his country once again to unity, peace and progress.\n392.\tA most welcome development is the creation of a coalition Government in Laos. For 20 years the internal divisions of that country were sharpened and unnecessarily prolonged by foreign interference and by the pressure of external events. The present coalition agreement is evidence of the ability and willingness of the Laotian people to work for national reconciliation. My Government hopes that foreign disengagement from Laos will be genuine and complete so that a lasting peace can be achieved in that country.\n393.\tIn the context of the welcome dissipation of cold war tensions, the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic hopes that Member States will agree, at this session of the General Assembly, to end another unfortunate legacy of the past \u2014 namely, the continued presence in Korea of what is known as the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] and of American armed forces under the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\".\n394.\tThe internal dialogue which is continuing between the Governments of the North and South has given the Korean question a new climate, a climate in which it is possible for the General Assembly to hold a full and objective debate on this issue. The welcome presence of representatives of the Government of North Korea, who for the first time are attending the General Assembly as observers, will give balance and validity to such a debate.\n395.\tThe task before the General Assembly is clear: ii is to correct the mistakes of the past. It was a mistake, initially, for the world Organization to have given up its role as mediator and to have taken sides in a cold war issue. That mistake is compounded by the continued presence in South Korea of foreign armed forces under the United Nations flag. Their presence is a symbol of threat and hostility, and is one of the main stumbling blocks to the reconciliation and reunification of the Korean people.\n396.\tAs far as UNCURK is concerned, it is obvious that the time is long overdue for the dissolution of a body which has itself declared that it serves no useful purpose, and whose one-sided approach ill befits a United Nations peacekeeping operation.\n397.\tThe realities of today must now be reflected in the establishment of normal conditions in Korea. The question of reunification and other internal questions can be decided only by the Korean people themselves. Now that they have formulated and accepted the principles on the basis of which they intend to proceed towards reunification, it is clear that UNCURK and the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\" represent unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of that country. Their presence can only hamper the creation of conditions likely to bring about the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea. If they are allowed to remain, it will mean that the lessons of the tragic wars in South-East Asia have not been learned.\n398.\tProgress in building the structure of peace has undoubtedly been made in some areas, but the structure remains glaringly incomplete while over 31 million people in southern Africa are still victims of apartheid and of cruel and oppressive colonialism. It would be a great setback to the cause of international security if, in the atmosphere of satisfaction over the allaying of tensions in Europe and South-East Asia, the crimes of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa were to be overlooked or relegated to an unimportant position on the list of international priorities.\n399.\tWe do not look for new insights or for the making of new judgements about the southern African situation. The international community has long been aware that apartheid, with its elements of genocide, and representing as it does a national commitment to racism and all the injustices that spring from it, is one of the historic crimes against humanity. The international community has long accepted the fact that colonialism, by its very nature, is an exploitative system that easily lends itself to racism and to the withholding of the human rights of peoples under colonial domination.\n400.\tBut just as the character of apartheid and of colonialism remains unchanged so, unfortunately, do the attitudes of those States that are most' able to exercise leadership in the economic, political and social isolation of the minority regimes of southern Africa. They remain as unmoved by recent examples of the brutality of the racist regimes as they have been by the gross injustices of the past decade in South Africa, Namibia, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and the Territories colonized by Portugal. They are apparently also able to rationalize their complacency and indifference with easy consciences.\n401.\tOne might ask why it is that American big business is prepared to demand the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel as a quid pro quo for trade agreements with the Soviet Union, but finds it impracticable to attempt to put economic pressure on the South African Government with regard to the elimination of apartheid But this is only one example of the indifference of the highly industrialized States of the Western alliance towards the plight of the majority of the people of South Africa. An example of the rationalization of this indifference is given by those who assert that contributing to the expansion of the South African economy will erode apartheid by a natural process. This unrealistic but convenient approach ignores the more fundamental political, social and coercive arrangements which dehumanize non-white South Africans and make them powerless to control their destinies.\n402.\tIt is also asserted that financial assistance and the supply of arms to Portugal are not given for the purpose of supporting its colonial war, although it is obvious that without such support the Portuguese effort to suppress the African struggle for freedom and self-determination could not continue.\n403.\tThe minority regimes have also been making new attempts to cover up and justify the evils of their racist societies. New constitutional arrangements in the African territories still under Portuguese domination or small economic concessions to black workers in South Africa are cited as evidence of the benevolence of these racist regimes. But cover-ups and rationalizations have been completely discredited by recent events. The revelation, on the basis of evidence from unimpeachable sources, that terrible atrocities have been committed against hundreds of innocent villages in Mozambique has received world-wide publicity. In their colonial war against Africans fighting legitimately against colonial domination, the Portuguese have already used napalm, defoliants and herbicides to terrorize the African populations. Now they have resorted to \\\"the systematic genocidal massacre of villages\\\" \u2014 to quote a report from Spanish missionaries.\n404.\tIn numerous resolutions, the United Nations has called on Portugal's NATO partners to stop the supply of armaments that enables Portugal to carry on this unjust and cruel war. Will there be as little response to the latest evidence of Portuguese brutality as there has been in the past to the use of internationally proscribed forms of warfare? It seems very likely. There have been protests from people all over the world against the barbarities of the Portuguese army, but the Governments whose generous support makes the Portuguese war of oppression possible, have maintained a deafening silence.\n405.\tThe other event which should shatter any complacency that has developed about the southern African scene is the recent killing of 11 mine workers in the Western deep mine in Carletonville, South Africa. The killing dramatizes a basic fact about South African society which may have been forgotten. As Chief Butelezi expressed it, \\\"a black life is regarded as very cheap in South Africa\\\". That comment is relevant to the shooting of workers protesting against patent economic injustice; it covers the whole enormous economic gap between black and white in South Africa and the system which keeps this\ngap a constant of South African society. It covers, most of all, the inhuman, slave-like conditions which are considered suitable for hundreds of thousands of African breadwinners who must live herded together like cattle in compounds and who are denied the rights of normal family life.\n406.\tIn spite of what is common knowledge of conditions in southern Africa, the minority regimes will no doubt continue to receive the arms they need for the suppression of the non-white peoples of southern Africa; the trade and investments they need to shore up their unjust systems; the moral support they need through social and diplomatic intercourse to prove to themselves and to the world that they are not complete outcasts and that their crimes are acceptable in the highest circles of the international community.\n407.\tThis session of the General Assembly will be presented with a draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid; and it is important that this convention be established as a norm of international law. But will the convention be observed and enforced by the allies of the minority regimes any more than the arms embargo against South Africa or the sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia, or any of the numerous resolutions which reflect the consensus of international opinion about the southern African situation? The outlook is not hopeful.\n408.\tOne may well ask whether it is an exercise in futility for the African Members of the United Nations, for their non-aligned and third world friends and for the many other supporters of the cause of African liberation to come here, year after year, and ask for co-operation, from the Western Powers and Japan, in the international campaign against apartheid and colonialism. The time has come for a more widespread realization of the fact, emphasized in the Mogadishu Declaration of 1971 by the Seventh Summit Conference of East and Central African States and sanctioned by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU in Rabat last year, that the road to freedom for African peoples living under apartheid and colonialism is through armed struggle waged by their own liberation movements and through the help that can be given to those movements by all who have an honest concern for human rights and human liberties. The victory of the heroic people of Guinea-Bissau is the most recent example of that fact.\n409.\tA most welcome example of practical action in assisting the liberation movements has been given recently by the Scandinavian countries, in particular Norway, whose Government is in favour of giving increased humanitarian and other forms of financial assistance to the peoples of dependent areas who are fighting for their national liberation. Putting the question in its proper perspective, the Norwegian Government has rightly emphasized that such aid is based on the United Nations Charter and on General Assembly and Security Council decisions, and that it must be seen as a normal, internationally accepted duty. That is how aid to the liberation movements has long been viewed by OAU. It is the approach to the southern African problem that has been endorsed by 76 nations of the non-aligned group. It deserves the widest support and emulation.\n410.\tMy Government continues to be concerned about the elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism not only in large areas of southern Africa but also in smaller colonial territories such as Spanish Sahara, the Comoro Islands, the Seychelles Islands and French Somaliland. The legitimate aspirations of the people of these territories continue to be kept in restraint by the ruling colonial Powers because of their own military, strategic and economic interests \u2014 a state of affairs which is contrary to the Charter and to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n411.\tMy Government has, of course, a very special interest in French Somaliland, a neighbouring territory. The question of French Somaliland has been before the decolonization Committee\\\" since 1965 and the status of the Territory remains clearly that of a colonial dependency. Decisions of the Territorial Assembly have to be communicated to the French High Commissioner before being published or implemented and can be annulled at will by the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories. In addition, important matters such as control of immigration, law and order, currency and foreign relations, come within the exclusive control of the French Government. Several referendums and elections have been held in French Somaliland within the past 15 years \u2014  supposedly to determine the wishes of the people about their status. But it is notorious that these procedures have not been conducted in a climate free from political and other intimidation. My Government strongly hopes that the question of French Somaliland will continue to be viewed with concern by the United Nations in order to secure for the people of that Territory the free exercise of their right to self-determination, free from the intimidations to which I have just referred.\n412.\tIt is within the context of the frustrations and sufferings of peoples such as the Palestinian refugees and the oppressed peoples of southern Africa that my Government views the question of international terrorism. We are not indifferent to the tragedies which occur when innocent people become the victims of terrorists who use violent methods to dramatize their cause. But our greatest concern must be for violence which unjustly excludes over a million Palestinians from their native land; the violence of racism which brutalizes millions in southern Africa; or the violence that subjects small States to large-scale military aggression by a bigger Power.\n413.\tObviously, there is a strong desire on the part of those countries most affected by international terrorism to put into immediate effect measures to combat the problem. But it would be an even greater contribution to the cause of peace and security if the same urgency, which some nations feel about protecting the rights of the few, could be directed towards the removal of the chronic violence which is the condition of life for millions in the Middle East and southern Africa.\n414. There is no lack of effective measures or just solutions to the underlying causes of international terrorism and to the underlying causes of those legitimate wars of\n\\\"Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\nliberation to which the minority regimes of southern Africa would attach the label of terrorism. And so it is pertinent to ask why powerful States which have dragged their feet for the past 26 years on the question of the plight of a million Palestinians and that of 31 million victims of apartheid and colonialism are today anxious to take action which might give an air of legality to the suppression of the cause of freedom in Africa and which would certainly demonstrate to the Palestinian people that there is no equality in the justice that is meted out in the name of the United Nations.\n415.\tWhat stand is the world community to take on terrorism when the Government of a Member State \u2014  Israel \u2014 itself indulges openly in terrorism, formerly the preserve of the hopeless and the desperate? What credible action can the United Nations take now, when Israel resorts to terrorist raids, brutal murders and the hijacking and shooting down of civilian aircraft \u2014 acts which have violated the sovereignty of a peaceful neighbour State, violated the rule of law in international civil aviation and violated the most elementary codes of human and civilized behaviour?\n416.\tIf Governments in the national sphere were to use the methods of those who are driven by whatever \\\"causes to desperate and criminal acts rather than duly prescribed legal processes, there would be national chaos. Similarly, there will be international chaos if Israel's actions are allowed to set a precedent and to go unreprimanded and unpunished.\n417.\tThere must be general recognition of the fact that violence and terrorism engendered by a deep-seated sense of injustice cannot be combated with more terrorism. They can be dealt with only by the restoration of justice and human rights to those who have been deprived of them.\n418.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express a sense of optimism about the future of international co-operation as it applies to political as well as to economic and social goals. Obviously, it would be unrealistic not to recognize the fact that many States, particularly some of the major Powers, do not yet accept all the implications of the Charter and are not yet prepared to put international peace and security above national self-interest. Still, I believe that the time must come when the international ideal will be fully accepted and when the machinery of peace will be fully used. However unsatisfactory the short-term results of our present efforts for peace may seem, in the long run they cannot fail to contribute effectively to the goals we all seek."

        "file_text": "\ufeff29.\tMr. President, let me begin by expressing on behalf of my delegation our great pleasure at the honour that you have done us and Latin America by accepting the appointment to the most responsible post of President of this Assembly. As a distinguished diplomat, your acceptance of this appointment brings us particular pleasure. We take additional pride in the fact that an eminent Latin American has been chosen for this honourable position.\n30.\tPermit me to express the gratitude of my delegation to the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland, for the able and efficient manner in which he guided the deliberations of that session.\n31.\tI should like to add the voice of Jamaica to those who have drawn attention to the cause of universality which has been significantly advanced by the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, to membership in the United Nations. Mr. President, you will understand the reasons why for me and for my delegation and for the Government and people of Jamaica the entry of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations is a matter of particular pride and pleasure. Our two countries are not only neighbours, but a developing relationship over the years has brought us into a very close association. The Bahamas with its hundreds of islands, its exquisitely beautiful seas and beaches and its wonderful people, almost immediately on the emergence of the present political leadership, has joined us as an independent nation. I know that the Bahamian people and their Prime Minister, Mr. Lynden Pindling, along with their delegation to this Assembly, bring to this great Organization their independence of spirit and their determination to contribute to the good of mankind. In this endeavour, they will once more, as they have in so many other ways, join forces with those independent English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, which against the background of a common history and parallel influences have established a tradition of co-operation in many fields, and an undying faith in parliamentary democracy and a particularly strong interest in furthering the cause of developing countries through the United Nations system.\n32.\tIt is because my country so strongly feels the importance of this occasion and because of our particular associations including, for me, strong personal ties with the Bahamas, I have been moved to reinforce the earlier statements of congratulations with farther expressions of pleasure.\n\u00bb\n33.\tFor my delegation, the degree of our pleasure is qualified to some extent on this occasion by the sad events which have overtaken two distinguished international figures who but a short time ago addressed the nations gathered here. We recall with pride and with sorrow Amilcar Cabral and Salvador Allende, two men who in their own very distinctive ways have sought to advance the interests of the people of their countries. It is not for us here to make judgement on the internal affairs of other countries. We accept the principle, in matters related to development and the fate of the third world, that \\\"any man's death diminishes me\\\", and so we feel that something has been lost in the death of those two men because they loved their people and their countries. We feel that in each case their death marks but a momentary pause in the irresistible movement of the forces for freedom in which they believed. The fight for freedom will continue as long as there continues to beat within the hearts of men the love of freedom and concern for their fellows.\n34.\tMuch criticism has been aimed at this Organization but not for lack of appreciation of what it has achieved for millions in the fields of education, health improvement and labour conditions. Such criticism as we repeatedly hear arises more from the patent necessity for change that is so obvious in an instrument created 28 years ago in very different circumstances from those of the world of today. The changes in political and international affairs as well as in the domestic affairs of most of the nations have at times been spectacular and even dramatic. New ideas, new demands, new pressures and new expressions of national sovereignty, independence and international relations have emerged.\n35.\tThe world is slowly developing a system of values based on the principles of the rights and duties of States. This new phenomenon has brought about the evolution of a complex of institutions and a system of consultations to meet the present realities. Some of this is not entirely new but over recent years we have seen a great deal of progress in those directions centred mainly around detente \u2014 detente which unfortunately takes place entirely outside of the ambit of the United Nations.\n36.\tThe very fact that in this Organization we have heard from this podium repeated plaudits on the achievement of detente which itself was contrived outside this Organization, leads us to ask ourselves two questions, Do those who sing those praises lack faith in this Organization as the proper instrument for achieving detente? Can anyone claim that in bypassing the Organization, lustre has been added to its cause, or is it that the benefits of detente are not expected to extend far beyond their immediate concern? I must confess that in a small country which looks upon this Organization as the greatest repository of hope for the peoples of the world, serious doubts exist as to the achievement of this detente, both its method and its effect. There is an African proverb very well known by my friends the people of the United Republic of Tanzania and others, which says that when two great elephants fight it is the grass that suffers. The present period of detente makes us add the second phrase: even when the great elephants make love it is also the grass that suffers.\n37.\tWe must acknowledge that this great Organization was conceived and created , in different times. As was pointed out by President Mobutu of Zaire in that address [2140th meeting] which spoke for all Africa and beyond, the same five permanent members of the Security Council exercise the same control today as they did at the time when they assumed their position as the reward for victory. Since then the Organization has been enriched by the valuable contribution of some of the best brains in regions outside of Europe, Asia and America. You yourself, Mr. President, and many others who have occupied that distinguished Chair derive from countries outside of the favoured five. In these modern days of science ,when all horizons are challenged, it would pay us well were we to examine some of the political systems, social characteristics and humanitarian developments that emanate outside of this small original group. It has been suggested that Japan be considered a candidate most fit for and worthy of joining the Big Five for a permanent seat on the Security Council. Without questioning for one moment either the suitability of Japan or the suggestion itself, let us look at this matter for a moment. The fact is that the continent of Africa, with its 360 million people and 41 independent sovereign States, and Latin America, with a population of over 250 million and 25 independent States, would seem to have a stronger case for consideration. Certainly we need to bring this element as well as other aspects of the Organization into line with present-day realities. Clearly, the establishment of rational criteria for change is superior to an ad hoc approach to the revision of the Charter.\n38.\tToday we see the quality of life on this planet in a fragile balance. We see the need, as recent events have shown, for international co-operation and collaboration in the fields of trade, monetary reform and population growth, in correcting environmental deterioration and in relation to the question of the earth's resources whether \\\"and-based or sea-based. In this new relationship which must be forged, the technologically advanced countries must be prepared to accept and abide by a new code of ethics and international morality \u2014 a new code which will ensure a greater share and a more equitable and rational distribution of the fruits of progress in the interests of the peoples of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n39.\tThe 1970s will be remembered as the decade in which the world came to recognize much more fully some of the realities of life as far as development is concerned.\n40.\tWe have watched with disappointment approaching dismay the ever-widening gap between the developed and developing countries; the gloomy outcome of the First United Nations Development Decade and the hopeless prospects of the Second; the eroding effect of the resurgent inflationary pressures and the uncertainties centring on the international monetary system; and the increasing burden of debt borne by developing countries.\n41.\tWe have seen the struggles of many developing countries in their attempts to wrestle with domestic, economic and social problems and needs and the forces within resisting change and the external forces adversely affecting them.\n42.\tWe have seen how easily countries striving to improve their condition can be thwarted by natural disaster \u2014 by drought, flood, earthquake or hurricane.\n43.\tWe have seen how the preoccupation of developed countries with their own problems diverts attention from the fate of the vast majority of the world's peoples.\n44.\tWe have observed the way in which the global food supply is quickly affected by internal social and political forces in a few large countries and by changes in bilateral relationships and trade between them.\n45.\tWe cannot avoid certain conclusions which emerge from all this: the heavy bias in favour of the better endowed, the wealthier, the more technologically advanced countries; the limited contribution of the conventional approaches to development in the making of any significant impact on the basic problems of poverty and towards the narrowing of the development gap; and the inevitable growth of economic power and influence as evidenced by the emergence and rise to virtually unchallengeable influence of the multinational corporations, representing, in institutional terms, a new political dimension in the economic affairs of the world and operating, so far, outside of the sphere of real control of Governments and international institutions.\n46.\tAll of that points to the need for real and fundamental change in international economic relations between developing and developed countries and for the establishment of a much greater range of economic interplay between developing countries.\n47.\tThe Secretary-General has proposed that at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly we examine seriously the relationship between the real issues facing the world and the institutional framework of the United Nations and the capability of that Organization to play a significant part in resolving those issues. As he stated in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, many of the present world-wide economic and social problems were scarcely foreseen at all when the United Nations system was created, and these, as he said, include the interrelated problems of development, trade, population, natural resources and environment. We agree with him that \\\"institutions created in 1945 often no longer correspond to current needs\\\" [A/9001/Add. 1, p. 3] and that the United Nations in respect of this and other issues \\\"will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support which are not backed by inner conviction, realism and whole-hearted participation\\\" [ibid.].\n48.\tIt is in that spirit and in the full realization that we continue to be in danger of falling far short of our real responsibilities that my delegation would like to address this session of the General Assembly.\n49.\tUnder the auspices of the First Development Decade, the developed countries undertook to contribute 1 per cent of their gross national product toward the resources of the developing countries. That undertaking has not been fulfilled, but we must acknowledge that some countries have lived up to their promises.\n50.\tBut we now know that even if the aid-target was fully achieved, and if the 6 per cent per annum growth rate of developing countries was accomplished, the development gap would continue to widen. The fact is that the per capita income of the developing countries of Africa and Asia is about $100 to $120. This is just about equal to the yearly increase in the per capita income of the developed countries.\n51.\tFrom that it can easily be seen that the masses of the third world cannot hope for even the beginning of the fulfilment of their aspirations in the Second United Nations Development Decade. It is thus clearly and mathematically illustrated that there is falsity behind the thinking that conventional aid can in any way bridge the problem of the dangerous imbalance between the poor nations and the rich.\n52.\tThe other approach to aid suggested by the Soviet Union is that 10 per cent of the cutback on armaments expenditure should be used to assist the developing countries [A/L. 701/Rev. /]. But while this matter is being debated and examined, perhaps we should look at other possible approaches. For example, we suggest that if even the interest on foreign debts of developing countries was wiped out by the creditor nations, it would greatly reduce the very heavy pressure of this indebtedness.\n53.\tLet us stop fooling ourselves and fooling each other that aid as we have known it can ever by itself solve this problem. The answer is clear: trade, not aid, must be the main approach to the achievement of an equitable international economic system. The developed nations must pay us more for our primary commodities and give us greater access to their markets for the manufactured goods we produce. The illustrious President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania has pointed to the fact that, whereas 8 or 10 bales of cotton could buy a tractor 20 years ago, today it would take some 25 bales of the same commodity to buy the engine of that tractor. This situation can also be illustrated in terms of sisal, bananas and so on. President Mobutu of Zaire has indicated that the price of rubber is less today than it was 20 years ago, and we are all aware of the increase in the price of tires over that period.\n54.\tIf we are seriously considering the problem of elevating the living standards of the poor of the world, if we are seriously contemplating the danger on the borders and in the shanty-towns of all our countries where the human time-bombs of poverty are ticking away in the settled hopeless expectation of a futureless existence, then we must sit down at this very Assembly and work out a system which will relate the price of bananas, cotton, rubber and so on to the price of machines and tractors and trucks and automobiles so as to link the two sets of commodities in such a way that they will move up together automatically as the prices move up in the industrial countries. What we need is a formula which will serve as the basis for this new relationship and the construction of appropriate indices to measure and guide movements of :he basic elements.\n55.\tIs such a task beyond the ingenuity of this international institution? It is in fact a vital and urgent one. But will you admit that it is at present outside the desire of this Organization and its Members? My country proposes that the United Nations should make a clear commitment at this session of the Assembly that the Economic and Social Council, in collaboration with UNCTAD, should apply its collective mind to this problem now. My delegation will submit a draft resolution ir. the appropriate Commitee proposing that a task force should accordingly be set up to work out such a system and to consider all the monetary and other implications attendant on it. It is- surely not beyond the ingenuity or the desire of this international Organization, founded on such high hopes, to relate the effort of the worker in the sugar-cane fields with that of the labourer in the factory of a more temperate climate. The fact is that there is now no meaningful or equitable relationship whatever between the artificial prices manipulated by the few and the misery of the millions who produce these commodities in both the developed and the developing countries.\n56.\tA few days ago Secretary of State Kissinger called on the Latin American Governments to join with the United States in a \\\"new dialogue\\\". My country welcomes this invitation. We applauded his remark that \\\"We do not believe that any institution or any treaty arrangement is beyond examination\\\". Let me apply this new and hopeful approach in international policy to the existing state of affairs, for it is one of the most significant expressions of United States international policy in this decade. Placed within the framework of my own country's traditional and hallowed respect for the sanctity of contracts, it gives, in our view, expression to the need for, and understanding of, the principle that in the matter of treaties and agreements, review is an inevitable and natural and just process of history. It takes into account the reality of present and changing patterns of international relationships and the growing respect for the sovereignty of all nations.\n57.\tThe application of this principle relates equally to the structure and form of the complex of international institutions that have been established over the last 28 years. As an example, the urgent need for the reform of the international monetary system is no longer in doubt. What is really in doubt is whether such reform, when it comes, will ever be really practical or effective. It is clear that here, as elsewhere, the developed countries have not been prepared to submit sufficiently to the jurisdiction of a fully elective international body. Let me hope that Mr. Kissinger's remarks when he proposed to us, his Latin American neighbours \\\"a friendship based on equality and a respect for mutual dignity\\\" will bear fruit. The Secretary of State was right when he said \\\"... such a relationship is needed for all of us, and I believe it is needed also for the rest of the world\\\". By the same token, reform in the case of the monetary system must include the achievement of more effective participation in decision-making by the developing countries, in particular, by ensuring the adequate representation of such countries in the appropriate bodies.\n58.\tReform must also mean the more effective introduction of the concept of development into the international monetary system. The urgent requirement of the immediate post-war period was the establishment of a system of controls and a code of behaviour in the monetary field. Today we need to move on to a realistic pursuit of development in the widest sense of that term. Reform must include the association of the reserve assets, the special drawing rights, with a system allowing a greater flow of resources between developed and developing countries. We ask that further thought be given to proposals advanced by us and others at the recent joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Nairobi to evolve a hew type of loan bearing a lower interest rate from that institution.\n59.\tReference has been made by several speakers to the recent meetings at Algiers of the non-aligned nations.31 was very proud of the contribution made by my own small country on that unique occasion. I was particularly pleased to see over 70 great nations, in many instances represented by their Heads of State, from Afghanistan to Zaire, concentrate so much energy and thought on economic and social matters. In these areas there seems to be no space for detente. This effect is not felt here, and it is precisely in these fields that the poor nations need most consideration and that the world needs a new understanding. The very reason that brought the non-aligned group into existence was that the world became aware of the total disaster that could overtake it unless sanity prevailed. It seems less ominous today than it was a decade or two ago, and a great deal of this is owing to the pioneers of the non-aligned movement; but the spread of terrorism, the grim hatreds behind the smiling and non-smiling faces in the ghettos of the world require a universal awareness of the need to fashion effective means of constructive action in the economic and social fields. Failure to do this will not merely mean for us a failure to grasp the opportunity of the moment, but will also cast all of us in the role of enjoying a frivolous flirtation with history.\n60.\tThe United Nations was conceived by idealists. We make no apology for following the road of idealism, but it is an idealism that is limited only by the will of each of us to carry out specific commitments within our powers \u2014 great or small.\n61.\tAs a small country, we make no apology for concentrating more on people than on property. We feel that nations, great or small, should pay no more importance to the balance of payments than they pay to the balance of human distress. Traditional mathematical representations such as gross national product are often meaningless in terms of either hunger or homelessness. We go further and say it is short-sighted to neglect social development, which is the essential purpose of economic development. This was made clear in a short passage of the Honourable Prime Minister of Jamaica's inaugural address to this Assembly a year ago:\n\\\"I am convinced that housing is going to have to become the great new area of world concern and effort. It seems to me that, in the absence of a home, much else that we seek to plan and to achieve is frustrated and overwhelmed by the sheer, brutal reality of shanty-town life. I believe that much of education is lost upon a child who returns from school to share one room with his brothers, sisters and parents. I believe that many of the hostilities and tensions which frustrate the economic process can be traced, a t least in part, to this problem. Therefore I wish to suggest that the international community should address its mind to the development of a world-wide plan for housing. I was pleased to see that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has taken note of this problem and called for support for the housing fund that was proposed at that Conference. I suggest that formulas be explored for ensuring that funds\n\nfor housing become a planned and standard addition wherever investment capital moves.\\\"\n62.\tHere at the United Nations and elsewhere, Jamaica has played a particularly active role in the field of the human environment, for we believe that through the environment programme there is a possibility of approaching more closely the heart of the matter of development. We have stressed the need to view the human being as central to the theme of the environment. We urge, therefore, that the ideas and priorities agreed upon at the first meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme in Geneva in June of this year should be pursued, particularly those concerning human settlement, health and habitation.\n63.\tMy country enters a plea for forgiveness in repeatedly returning to the idea that the central core of all our endeavour is the improvement in the quality of life of the individual human being. We have already seen how national statistics may have scant relevance to this central theme. We have also seen that in the determination of economic development it is no longer possible to neglect the social factor.\n64.\tFollowing Jamaica's initiative during the twenty- seventh session, the Assembly adopted resolutions dealing with the institutional and financial arrangements for housing and human settlements. We are aware of the considerations that have taken place on these resolutions of the Assembly. We note with regret, however, the illusion of action on these resolutions and will raise these issues in the appropriate forum.\n65.\tMy Government continues to note with regret the low priority that has been accorded to this sector by the United Nations system. We are heartened that the World Bank has committed itself to allocating substantial funds for the housing and human settlements sector of its activities. It is our hope that the question of establishing new and realistic criteria for determining the rates of interest and the eligibility for soft loans in this sector will be given the urgency of treatment and attention that it deserves. It is our further hope that a new sense of international morality and financial commitment by the developed countries will emerge, and that action based on this recognition by the World Bank of the intimate relationship between economic development and such social problems as urbanization, unemployment, poverty and the condition of human settlements will not be frustrated. Let us remember that the greater the task, the greater the need that the effort be rooted in the deepest human convictions. It is time for us to introduce a new game-plan to reflect the high priority that was accorded to this sector in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and that was again reinforced in the number 1 priority of the Governing Council for environmental programmes. The scale of activities so far undertaken is not at all commensurate with the magnitude of the problem. The Jamaican delegation will at the appropriate time work with like-minded delegations in an effort to accelerate and give further impetus to the activities in this sector, and to ensure full participation by the developing countries in any new mechanism that is being up within the United Nations system.\n66.\tIt is because my small country, Jamaica, has never faltered in its support for the United Nations as the greatest repository of hope for the peoples of the world that we cannot pass without noticing a very unfortunate phrase from a most distinguished source referring to \\\"the increasingly assuming characteristic of a bloc of its own \u2014 the alignment of the non-aligned\\\". If this is not a naive misunderstanding of the history and nature of that great and growing movement for the preservation of peace, it could only be a deliberate and calculated misrepresentation of the role of this great movement. We are not a bloc. By definition we are against blocs. We never have been a bloc and we persist in a solemn resistance to being lured into joining any bloc.\n67.\tAs a small and poor nation, our strength lies less in the threat to exercise power against others than in the capacity to remain objective and frank both to our friends and to any who choose to describe themselves otherwise. It is in this tradition of frankness that my delegation refers with deep sadness to the unfortunate turn of events in the Middle East. We have always hoped, and still do hope, that in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in its entirety lies the hope for a true and lasting peace in this area. As a consequence Jamaica calls for an immediate cease-fire and the commencement of negotiations in accordance with that resolution, which, we repeat, is the only hope for peace in the Middle East.\n68.\tWe believe equally that unless we follow more the dictates of our collective conscience and less the escalation of rhetoric and hypocrisy, many more conflicts will erupt and continue, at the cost of countless innocent dead. A few days ago we witnessed in this very room the disgraceful exhibition of that small band who purport to represent the people of South Africa, shamelessly supported by a very slim minority of this Organization in a legalistic argument\n^ as to their right to freedom of speech. The enunciation of that right sounds thin and hollow in the mouths of a racist regime whose best-known characteristic is their own denial of that right to the millions forming the majority in their own country. The shameless gang will continue this massive exhibition of hypocrisy as long as they obtain encouragement from the few remaining supporters in this Organization, who, by such support, cast grave doubts upon the moral posture of the Organization itself.\n69.\tIt is in this setting, and at a time when bombs are raining death and blood is flowing like a red sea of its own, that I give this solemn warning. War is caused by breaches of faith, by desertion of principle and abandonment of a moral code.\n70.\tHow can we absolve ourselves from blame \u2014 we who sit comfortably unconcerned while the brutal bandits of South Africa, who demand their freedom of speech here, refuse to reply to the demand of the International Court of Justice that they set Namibia free? It is this body which has by resolution after resolution, in accordance with the legal decision of that high Court, set up the instruments for the liberation and lawful government of the people of Namibia. Yet we lack the will to put them into effect. There are many areas of the world in dispute that come Before us In which there are, however weighted, two opinions to be decided. In the case of Namibia there is but a single clear, irrefutable example of injustice \u2014 that by South Africa. South Africa is illegally in charge of Namibia. There is no legal obstacle to United Nations action against it. It would have been indefensible if this were only a case of territorial aggression. It would be even more reprehensible if it were merely an extension of that wrong in that South Africa had annexed property and people in the manner of the classical colonialist. But it goes further: the conscience of the world is tortured by the dehumanizing practices that are forced upon the people of Namibia by this racist abomination which is supported here by those few friends who legalistically uphold the right to freedom of speech.\n71.\tThe conscience of the world cries out, in the name of those dying today on the battlefield of wrong, that this Assembly should call upon the Security Council to act now.\n72.\tOur hope for peace demands that we ask the Security Council: first, to demand that South Africa surrender the administration of Namibia, or that force be exercised against it to enforce its obedience to the law; and secondly, to protect the United Nations Council for Namibia that has been established to administer Namibia and restore to its people God's gift of freedom.\n73.\tIn the name of my small country, Jamaica, I ask you, each of you, Have you the will to demand this, that the United Nations summon up its collective will to take up its own Mandate?\n74.\tThe precious young lives being sacrificed even as we speak in comfort here cry out this warning, If you do not maintain the force of law, your sons and daughters will die under the law of force.\n75.\tThe painfulness of the truth is already evident in other parts of Africa. Jamaica and the rest of the free world salute the freedom fighters of South Africa, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. We welcome the brave liberators of Guinea-Bissau, our newest nation, which recalls the struggle for freedom in the United States of America, and elsewhere when men believe in \\\"liberty or death\\\". My country was the first in the new world to recognize Guinea-Bissau.\n76.\tMy delegation believes that the main purpose of the United Nations is to preserve peace, not to stop war. We believe that much has been done by this great international body for which the world must be grateful. But the preservation of peace demands that we be constantly alert to maintain our principles and enforce our resolutions. There are areas today in Latin America which are not yet in a state of war but which are far from enjoying the atmosphere of peace. I refer in particular to the tiny Territory of Belize. Belize has been promised independence by the United Kingdom. But fear of accepting that freedom, which its people deserve, arises from fear of invasion the moment independence is granted. Let me pray that we shall take strong and timely measures, clear for all to see, to prevent the use of force from spreading the seeds of war and oppression in that otherwise peaceful area.\n77.\tMy country, Jamaica, has never lost faith in the influence for good that exists here in the United Nations. The\nhopes of mankind rest in our hands. Can we summon up the will to do that for which future generations will be grateful? Each moment of indecision, hesitancy or disobedience to the dictates of our conscience, every sacrifice of principle on the altar of expediency, each wasteful death in the ghetto or on the battlefield of wrong cries out to us. We can no longer afford the luxury of delay."

        "file_text": "\ufeff51.\tI should like at the outset of this statement to join those who have preceded me in congratulating you from this rostrum on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to reaffirm our confidence in your ability to fulfil the duties of your high office by virtue of your long experience in the international arena and your distinguished qualities of astuteness and high competence. I should not fail to reiterate on this occasion our appreciation for, and satisfaction with, the important part taken by your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Trepczynski, in guiding the deliberations of the previous session.\n52.\tI should also like to express our welcome to the new Members who have joined the ranks of the Organization, thus bringing it closer to being a truly international Organization. The principle of the universality of this Organization is one that Iraq has constantly striven to achieve. It gives me pleasure to extend a special welcome to the German Democratic Republic, h which Iraq has the closest ties of friendship and co-operation. We are confident that the presence of that State within the United Nations will contribute in an effective manner to the strengthening of international security and international co-operation. We also are ready to establish the best relations in all fields with the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n53.\tIt also gives me pleasure to declare here Iraq's welcome for the independence of Guinea-Bissau. We fully support the Government of Guinea-Bissau and look forward to their representatives occupying their seats in this Organization as soon as possible.\n54.\tThe convening of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly provides the international community with an important opportunity to review the international developments that have taken place during the past year and the effects of those developments on the policies of the States Members of the Organization. Iraq, following closely and with interest the developments on the international scene, avails itself of this opportunity, which is characteristic of the United Nations, to present its views on the most important of them.\n55.\tThe past year was marked by two outstanding events which, in spite of the differences between them, together constitute two complementary steps towards the fulfilment of the desire of the peoples of the world to establish an international community where peace reigns and where the principles of justice and freedom are realized.\n56.\tThe first event was the increase in further steps towards closer ties and co-operation among the great Powers and the establishment of the foundation of new relationships that would decrease international tension and the dangers of a nuclear war. The people of Iraq, who share the expectations of the peoples of the third world in achieving a just peace, welcomes these developments and calls upon the international Organization to play its part and to participate fully in furthering and strengthening this vital development, making international participation a firm base for a new international order.\n57.\tThe second event was the convening of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Algiers, where for the first time in the history of the non-aligned movement the great majority of the States Members of the United Nations were represented. The non-aligned movement has played an important and effective role in lessening international tension, in advocating the policy of peaceful coexistence, and in reaffirming the right of peoples to participate in the establishment of an international order governed by the principles of justice, freedom and peace, as President Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr of Iraq has confirmed on numerous occasions. It is for that reason that the convening of the Algiers Conference at this particular juncture was of special significance for the assessment of the non-aligned movement and for outlining its direction within the new international developments. The Conference proved yet again the importance and effectiveness of the non-aligned movement and the part it will play within the United Nations and outside it in the maintenance of international security and in safeguarding the rights of the developing countries of the third world. Under the leadership of the Arab Baath Socialist Party, the policy of non-alignment constitutes a basic principle in the foreign policy of the Republic of Iraq. Having had the honour of participating in the Algiers Conference, Iraq would like to express its pleasure at the important results of the Conference and to confirm its determination to work diligently to implement the decisions taken in Algiers.\n58.\tIf the positive trends in international relations arouse feelings of optimism for the future, there are also negative developments and chronic problems that still threaten international security with great dangers. These problems call for firm and urgent measures to prevent a further deterioration of the situation. Perhaps the recent events that took place in Chile are the clearest demonstration of such a tragic deterioration. The words uttered last year before this Assembly [2096th meeting] by the constitutionally elected President of Chile, the late Mr. Salvador Allende, are still alive in our memories. Mr. Allende was describing the plight of many areas of the world when he warned of the dangers of the conspiracies hatched by the forces of colonialism and international monopolies against the freedom of peoples and their independence.\n59.\tIn Asia, in spite of the world's glad expectations aroused by the reaching of a peace agreement to end the singularly inhuman war waged by the United States of America against the struggling people of Viet-Nam, we find that the agreement, which was regarded as the beginning of the end of American military intervention in South-East Asia, did not in fact stop the bloodshed in that area, but rather became itself the target of continuous manoeuvres attempting to impose the Saigon regime on the people of South Viet-Nam.\n60.\tIn spite of the great victories achieved by the people of Cambodia under the leadership of the Government of National Union, the United States of America continues to prolong the war at the expense of the legitimate interests of the Cambodian people, thereby threatening international peace and security. On this occasion we would like to state our belief that it is the duty of the United Nations, in conformity with its Charter, to see that the true representatives of the Cambodian people are given the opportunity to occupy their seats in this Organization.\n61.\tAs for developments in Korea, Iraq has welcomed all the measures taken to enable the Korean people to achieve unity and to banish the American forces of occupation from its territory. Iraq also believes that the duty of the United Nations to put an end to mockery of having its flag hoisted over the barracks of the American forces of occupation, forces which have brought nothing but misery and suffering to whichever land they have trodden in Asia.\n62.\tIn the African continent, which has been subjected to the worst kinds of colonialism and exploitation, the Governments of the white minority regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to practise their abhorrent racist policies against the peoples of those lands, in defiance of the denunciation and revulsion of the whole world, as embodied in the resolutions of the United Nations. The Portuguese forces of occupation, whose detestable practices are daily being exposed, persist in defying the United Nations and denying the peoples their right to self- determination. Iraq expresses without reservation its full support for the struggle of the African peoples striving towards freedom and independence and the preservation of their natural wealth, and calls upon the international Organization to exert all its efforts to assist their just struggle.\n63.\tThe sufferings of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America recur most glaringly in the Arab region, an area beset by problems and dangers threatening at any moment an explosion that will confront the world with unimaginable consequences. The continuation of this abnormal state of affairs in the region faces the whole of the international community with a fateful trial, and arouses, doubt and scepticism about all the positive achievements in the field of international relations.\n64.\tTwenty-six years have elapsed since the Zionists launched their aggression against the people of Palestine; seven years have passed since the Zionists attacked three States Members of this international Organization and have continued to occupy parts of their territories. In spite of the fact that the United Nations was and still is a responsible party in the present crisis, it has not achieved any progress towards the elimination of aggression and the implementation of the principles of the Charter in the area. I regret to say that what has taken place is the exact opposite. The dispersion of the people of Palestine, the denial of their legitimate rights in their homeland, continues to be the policy declared and enforced by Israel; a policy that has taken all the dimensions of a campaign of genocide against the exiled people. The air-raids on the refugee camps, the massacre of children, women and the aged, the murder of the Palestinian leaders according to a programme of terrorism, and the continuation of systematic violence and ejection in the occupied territories, are the Zionist policies which violate all the fundamentals of justice and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n65.\tIn the occupied territories Israel persists in its programme of settler-colonialism by daily establishing new paramilitary settlements in Gaza, Sinai, the Golan Heights and on the occupied bank of the Jordan. The Judaization of Jerusalem, the defacement of that city's historical landmarks, which are part of the heritage of the whole of mankind, continue unabated and undeterred.\n66.\tIsrael is no longer abashed or concerned over the exposure of its plans and policies. This indifference is best shown in the election platform adopted by the ruling Israeli Labour Party concerning the colonization of the occupied territories, a policy which was described by a member of that Party as \\\"creeping annexation\\\". Furthermore, Israel's repeated aggressions against Syria and Lebanon have become almost daily occurrences, and the matter has gone even further than what has come to be expected of Israeli aggression and lawlessness. Israel has assumed for itself the role of an international policeman in the area, attacking the neighbouring States and abducting its people to try them before Israeli courts, for no crimes committed within Israel and in contravention of all the norms of international law. The Israeli Air Force has been entrusted with a new task, namely, the hijacking or shooting down of civilian airliners and killing their innocent passengers. These crimes, which are prohibited by all international codes, make us pause to inquire, how was it possible that such acts could be committed with such impunity?\n67.\tIt is absurd to say that the international community, with the great moral authority at its disposal and the adequate means of deterrence granted to it by the Charter, is yet incapable of putting an end to Israel's crimes. Nor can Israel's arrogance, aggression, its contempt for the United Nations, its resolutions and its Charter, be interpreted as the mere intransigence of a small State which behaves like an international outlaw.\n68.\tTo understand this behaviour we have to face an unpalatable fact of international life: Israel is not the only culprit, but a major Power is engaged in practising annexation by proxy. That Power is the United States of America. The arms with which Israel fights are the arms of the United States, the military expertise which Israel deploys in its aggressions is the expertise of the United States, and the funds with which new settlements are implanted on Arab lands are the funds of the United States. And, last but not least, the protective voice which paralyzes the Security Council so that it may not punish Israel, is the veto of the United States. No wonder that this kind of morality in foreign policy has insidiously crept into the very fabric of United States political life to the abhorrence and bewilderment of the people of the United States.\n69.\tOur Arab nation, and most people of the world, are now fully aware of the nature and the objectives of the aggression launched by the Zionists against the Arab people. Our ancient nation, inspired by its history, confident in the future of its struggle, will never submit to any aggressor or accept surrender.\n70.\tOur struggle will be long and arduous; but our cause is just and noble, and it rightly enjoys the support of the peoples of the world. The termination of the Zionist occupation of the Arab lands, and the restoration of the right of self-determination to the people of Palestine in its homeland, will soon become a living reality. The Arab nation, burdened with the struggle to attain a goal which is of the essence of the purposes of the Charter, realizes full well that the international community, too, has its own share of responsibility in that struggle, and awaits expectantly the moment when that community shall rise to the challenge of fulfilling its responsibilities in the matter.\n71.\tThere is another crisis whose developments and consequences are bound to affect the future of security in our area, and international security as well. I am referring here to the policy of Iran in the Arabian Gulf region. Recent statements emanating from the highest sources in Iran indicate their inclination to resort to the use of force and to interfere in the internal affairs of the States in the area, on the assumption that Iran will play the role of the great and \\\"protecting\\\" Power in the Arabian Gulf. The ominous implications of those statements are confirmed by Iran's embarkation upon huge armament programmes which cannot be justified on the grounds that they are needed for defensive purposes. Iraq's concern in regard to these developments is fully justified by the sad recent history of Iraqi-Iranian and Arab-Iranian relations. Late in 1971 Iran forcefully occupied three Arab islands and, prior to that, in contravention of the Charter, declared its unilateral abrogation of the Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Treaty, signed at Teheran on 4 July 1937.\n72.\tThe Foreign Minister of Iran mentioned in his statement before this Assembly on 25 September that Iran's efforts to normalize relations with Iraq had not succeeded. He also claimed that Iran had repeatedly offered to resolve its problems with Iraq in accordance with accepted norms of international law and practice of States, with due regard to the principles of equity and mutual rights and the interests of both parties.\n73.\tI regret to say that the basis of the problems between Iraq and Iran is Iran's violation of those very norms of international law in accordance with which the Foreign Minister of Iran claims that he wishes to solve these problems. The boundaries in Shatt-al-Arab are established on the basis of an existing treaty which should be the first instrument to be implemented in order to resolve any problems concerning those boundaries. Perhaps the Foreign Minister of Iran has forgotten that the foremost rule of international law and the one which is due the highest respect is the principle of the sanctity of treaties, pacta sunt servanda. Iran claims that it can abrogate the Boundary Treaty unilaterally; this claim reveals the extent of Iran's respect for the norms of international law. The very nature of boundary treaties, as confirmed in article 62, paragraph 2 (a) and in article 65 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,  refutes all the claims put forth by Iran to justify its abrogation of the said Treaty.\n74.\tIraq has repeatedly offered Iran recourse to the International Court of Justice to find out whether Iran had the right to terminate the boundary Treaty. This offer demonstrates our respect for the norms of international law. We expect a positive response from our neighbour Iran if it truly cares about international law and its principles, justice and mutual interests.\n75.\tThe considerations which command the special attention of the international community where safeguarding the principles of the Charter in the Middle East is concerned, should have yet another important consideration added to them, namely, the fact that the region contains the major deposits of energy resources in the world.\n76.\tThis important fact calls for an objective attitude on the part of all those who are interested in ascertaining that the energy resources shall continue to flow from the producing countries to the consumer States. For decades international monopolies have greedily bled the developing countries of their natural resources regardless of the legitimate interests of the producing countries. The growth of national awareness, however, and closer co-operation among the developing countries have impelled the majority of the countries producing energy resources \u2014 Iraq being foremost among them \u2014 to assert their sovereignty over their natural resources, the better to serve the objectives of their national development.\n77.\tThe increasing demand for energy throughout the world cannot be met by hysterical cries from imperialist sources aimed at imposing their will upon the oil-producing countries. Iraq, itself an oil-producing country, believes that the orderly flow of energy resources demands the establishment of objective relationships between the producing and the consumer State. These relationships must be based on the principles of equality, respect for national aspirations, sovereignty and the inherent right of nations to control their natural resources. We hope it is realized that threats of the use of force and publicized desert-war manoeuvres are the surest way of bringing about a disruption of the flow of oil.\n78.\tIn its twenty-eighth year the United Nations can claim many accomplishments that time does not permit me to recount. The peoples of the United Nations and the founding fathers of the Charter envisaged a role for the Organization in keeping peace and security which we have so far failed to attain. Iraq, however, is not despondent nor disdainful. Our faith in the spirit of man, his unrequited quest for justice, liberty and for a world in which, irrespective of colour, race or creed, humanity can join hands in marching towards a better future, is our ideal of the United Nations. That is why we are here."

        "file_text": "\ufeff149.\tThe delegation of Senegal associates itself fully with the friendly words uttered by the many heads of delegations who have preceded us at this rostrum, and, although it is not necessary to stress the matter, wishes to present in its turn its sincere congratulations to Mr. Benites on his unanimous election to the office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n150.\tWe wish to associate ourselves also with the tribute already paid to his eminent predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski.\n151.\tFinally, we express to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our profound gratitude for the activities he has carried out in so little time in the service of peace and justice throughout the world.\n152.\tI wish to take this memorable opportunity also to hail on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal the admission to membership in the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, an event which concretely expresses, over and above the reduction of tension throughout the world, the universalist mission conferred upon the Organization by the founders of the United Nations.\n153.\tIn the short period which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly positive signs heralding an atmosphere of detente, which is the first essential step towards universal peace, have shown themselves in international life. This trend finds its clearest expression in the priority given by the great Powers to rapprochement and harmonization of their relations, whether this involves the strengthening of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union or a mutual accommodation between China and the United States, which is a prelude to the normalization of their relations, or the installation of a climate of detente in Europe, which takes the form in particular of the basic agreement between the two Germanys and the opening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n154.\tAt first sight, all these events would tend to show, were this to be necessary, that in international life there seems to be taking form a trend towards new bilateral relations inspired by political realism, thus increasing the possibility for peaceful solutions to the controversial questions which have so far been postponed from year to year.\n155.\tBut since the reduction of tensions and coexistence are not always synonymous with international peace and security, the positive trend which has partially taken place in international relations cannot completely allay our misgivings at the rapid and complex evolution of our world, which frequently exceeds its own understanding, in the face of the fierce competition which is taking place there and of which the third world all too frequently is the theatre when it is not the stake.\n156.\tToo many countries are interested in the United Nations only in so far as this Organization can serve their interests and fulfil their aspirations, instead of seeing in the Organization an active, vital and universal mechanism, making it possible to build a more just, more democratic and more human world.\n157.\tAs it is, in the field of economic and trade relations the proletarian nations are unceremoniously relegated to the outer reaches of the world market and of the international division of labour. The situation for some of them is deteriorating from year to year as the result of various factors, among which the frequent occurrence of natural catastrophes of all types is one phenomenon.\n158.\tAs you are aware, our region has been the victim of one of those natural catastrophes. Indeed, the cycle of drought which has prevailed for seven years in the Sudano-Sahelian region became aggravated last year and has reached catastrophic proportions, affecting, directly or indirectly, more than 20 million human beings in Upper Volta, Mali, Mauritania. Niger, Chad and Senegal.\n159.\tAnd yet, as early as August of 1972, the Senegal Government had brought to the attention of friendly States and international organizations the food shortage which was going to result from the drought. On 9 October the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor, called the attention of the World Bank to the deterioration of climatic conditions in the Sahelian zone.\n160.\tI might also point out that the struggle against the spreading desert in our regions through the rational use of surface and ground water has for years been the principal preoccupation of the States bordering on the Senegal River-Mali, Mauritania and Senegal-which are today regrouped in the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River, known as the OMVS.\n161.\tFaced with the devastating consequences of this scourge, African solidarity and international assistance have not failed. To brother States, friendly countries, the United Nations and other international organizations I convey the sincere thanks and profound gratitude of the Government and people of Senegal. One can regret in passing that some, in helping us, have thought it fitting to address unjust reproaches to us, as ii this natural calamity could be ascribed to the negligence of the Governments of the six countries involved.\n162.\tIt remains for me to hope that the General Assembly will take into consideration item 101 of its agenda, entitled \\\"Consideration of the economic and social situation in the Sudano-Sahelian region stricken by drought and measures to be taken for the benefit of that region\\\", in particular, to seek ways to deal with a repetition of the dramatic consequences of such a catastrophe by providing-as it is invited to do by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1797 (LV)-for concrete measures equal to the scientific resources and technological capacity of industrial civilization.\n163.\tWithin this scheme of things, the Senegal delegation firmly supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to provide funds under the regular United Nations budget for emergency operations. It goes without saying that such an initiative would constitute an important contribution to the implementation of resolution 2717 (XXV), by which the General Assembly recommended the adoption of measures designed to strengthen the capacity of various United Nations organs to contribute assistance and secure a rapid mobilization and effective co-ordination of international aid.\n164.\tAt a time when man, by setting foot on the moon, has achieved one of mankind's long-cherished dreams, it seems to us that the great task confronting the international community now more than ever is the solution of the problems of economic, cultural, social and political development-in a word, the integral development of man.\n165.\tAnd yet, what do we observe today?\n166.\tThe Committee on Review and Appraisal, charged with assessing the progress accomplished in the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, reveals that the experience of the last two years is particularly discouraging.\n167.\tThe situation of developing countries, already precarious, has further deteriorated, of course, because numerous poor countries do not always do enough for the less-favoured classes, as will be seen from the reports of the World Bank, but especially because the rich countries do not implement the measures contemplated in the Strategy.\n168.\tSuch a situation, in the present state of affairs, can only widen the huge gap between the rich and the poor countries, and this may bring about a feeling of profound frustration, the consequences of which, it may be presaged, will be serious for international peace and security.\n169.\tIn order to ward off such a possibility, the United Nations will have to refrain from the magic of words and simple declarations of intent and resolutely bend its efforts towards more concrete co-operation and the search for just solutions to questions of natural resources, trade and development.\n170.\tIt is only very recently that the developing countries have begun to intervene directly in international discussions on the law of the sea, whose evolution had formerly been subject to the criteria of only the industrialized countries.\n171.\tNo precise international agreement having been concluded in order to fix the limits of national jurisdiction, to ensure the necessary protection of the resources of the sea and guarantee the preservation of fisheries, my Government, by a decree of 3 June 1971, has denounced the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone,  as well as the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the Sea. \n172.\tAt the same time, our country has opened a dialogue with other African States in order to co-ordinate the various interpretations with a view to presenting a common front at the different international conferences that are to take place soon and in which Senegal will participate, with the object of contributing positively to the new formulation of maritime law.\n173.\tThe major lines of the African position as reaffirmed at the Algiers Conference fits in perfectly with the claims of my country concerning specifically the exclusive economic zone and the sea-bed.\n174.\tIn the case of the exclusive economic zone, we claim an adjacent zone of essentially economic utility not stretching beyond 200 nautical miles. Within that zone the coastal State would exercise exclusive sovereignty over all the biological and mineral resources existing in the waters, the soil and the sub-soil, without prejudice to freedom of navigation, overflight, the laying of cables and pipelines, etc.\n175.\tOf course, land-locked and partially land-locked countries will be acknowledged to have rights concerning participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the zone on the basis of bilateral, regional or multilateral agreements.\n176.\tAs for the sea-bed and ocean floor, as well as the sub-soil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, that constitutes a zone proclaimed to be the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\" by the famous Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction.\n111. We consider that the exploration and exploitation of that zone should be entrusted to an international agency administered in common by all States, or else to a specialized agency such as the World Bank.\n178.\tIn this same context, the Senegal delegation approves, as of now, Economic and Social Council resolution 1762 (LIV) designed to create a revolving fund for research on the development of natural resources.\n179.\tIt is quite natural that I should now come to the fundamental claims of the third world relating to trade and development, to which neither UNCTAD no* the General Assembly have managed to find just and acceptable solutions.\n180.\tThese days, when a certain number of countries that have achieved industrial and technical over-development are seriously envisaging putting a brake on economic growth, four fifths of mankind continues to endure living conditions incompatible with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and with the present state of civilization and the norms of coexistence as established in recent years.\n181.\tI should therefore wish to recall that my country has for many years proclaimed the necessity of transforming the unfair economic structures of our day by a triple plan of action.\n182.\tFirst of all, there is the agonizing problem of commodities. As has already been stressed by President Leopold Sedar Senghor in his outstanding plea at the fifty-sixth session of the International Labour Organisation:\n\\\"Therefore, we believe that the most urgent question is to revise the relationships between us-between affluent countries and proletarian countries-by guaranteeing a fair remuneration for the products of the emerging countries through a more rational and, consequently, a more humane organisation of international trade . . .\\\".11\n183.\tIn this spirit the developing countries forcefully call for the regularization of production and the stabilization of prices at a remunerative level so as to increase export income considerably, taking into account the need to increase the financing of the development of countries and to offset the disastrous effects of the implacable continuous deterioration of terms of trade, euphemistically called \\\"the law of supply and demand\\\".\n184.\tIn this connexion I am very pleased with the decision of the. European Community's commission concerning future relations of the Community with the Associated African States and the developing countries of the Commonwealth, contained in its memorandum of 4 April 1973, to guarantee to each associated country, as part of the Eurafrican Yaounde Association, export incomes in order to take into account any possible climatic catastrophes and the deterioration in the terms of trade.\n185.\tHence, in the field of aid my Government continues to call upon the developed countries to attain the goal of 1 per cent of gross national product in the transfer of financial resources, of which 0.70 per cent would be from public resources for the benefit of developing countries. It goes without saying that within the framework of the over-all goal of 1 per cent of the gross national product, which unfortunately does not take into account reverse flows representing payment of interest and dividends, greater attention will have to be concentrated upon the priority goal of 0.70 per cent deriving essentially from public resources.\n186.\tLastly, in the case of debt, the developing countries call for an improvement in financial conditions and the alleviation of debt servicing.\n187.\tIn this respect it should be noted with satisfaction that there has been a decision by the UNCTAD Committee on Invisibles and Financing Related to Trade whereby a special group of governmental experts would be established\n\nto examine problems of the debt of developing countries, amounting to $75,000 million for a group of 80 countries, and any possible measures to be prescribed internationally.\n188.\tIn truth, these questions are so closely tied to the international monetary situation that if this serious problem is not resolved it will practically be illusory to attempt to accelerate exchanges and increase the net volume of aid provided to the communities that are not properly equipped in world competition.\n189.\tWith that in view, Senegal, for its part, will provide its unqualified support for any proposal or formula submitted with a view to establishing some machinery for collective economic security which might form an over-all framework for solidarity between rich and proletarian nations.\n190.\tHowever, these events depend first and foremost upon the progress that is achieved towards general and complete disarmament. As of now, I am happy to proclaim from this rostrum that my delegation firmly adheres to the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce by 10 per cent, the military budgets of permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191 J. It would, moreover, be desirable for that proposal to apply likewise to the other States possessing a large economic and military potential. The resources thus liberated would finance the fund for special aid to development, establishment of which has so urgently been called for by the non-aligned countries. For it is with considerable misgiving mixed with powerlessness that we note that military expenditures annually amount to $200,000 million-in other words, more than the cumulative revenues of Africa, southern Asia and the Far East.\n191.\tThe atomic Powers are indefinitely strengthening their military arsenals, whereas others are engaging in nuclear tests in the atmosphere and underground, threatening our world with the spectre of an atomic war capable of engulfing our fragile planet.\n192.\tDoes that mean that the Disarmament Decade might in turn prove to be only a snare because for 10 years now the United Nations has adopted only partial measures which are, as a matter of fact, limited to the field of \\\"non-armament\\\"? Well, no. Thus my delegation notes with satisfaction the recent agreement in Washington between the United States and the Soviet Union concerning the limitation of strategic arms. \n193.\tMoreover, my Government, which on numerous occasions has registered its disapproval of nuclear explosions, is particularly gratified at the adherence of the People's Republic of China to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) prohibiting nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as France's decision to adhere to it in the near future. In a sector as crucial as this for the future of the whole of mankind, that is assuredly a historic development which I am sure will gradually spread.\n194.\tIn that perspective, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which met in Helsinki, already constitutes an irreversible trend towards the transformation of the old continent into a zone of peace and thus towards the convening of a world disarmament conference, for which my Government yearns with all its heart.\n195.\tWill it, then, be possible to hope at last for an era of progress and peace in the world?\n196.\tFor the moment, we have welcomed with gratification the Paris agreements which put an end to the horrible war in Viet-Nam. Therefore, my Government, after a clear-headed and objective analysis of the situation, has drawn the necessary conclusions from these agreements by recognizing the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and, at the same time, placing both parties on a footing of equality so as to promote their progress towards unity.\n197.\tIn the case of Cambodia, where peace depends solely on the return to legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union, I remain convinced, in the light of the events that have taken place recently, that our Organization, in this respect basing itself upon the Algiers Conference, will at the present session raise the problem of the restoration to the regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of its legitimate rights.\n198.\tSimilarly, in Korea the United Nations should establish conditions favourable for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, supplementing, by a radical revision of the role of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and by a decision to withdraw all foreign forces, the present negotiations between the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul, with which Senegal maintains diplomatic relations.\n199.\tBut it is more by favouring establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East that the United Nations will recover the prestige that has been seriously undermined by the despair of some and the bellicose arrogance of others-not to mention, of course, the actions of certain great Powers which seem quite reconciled to the aggravation of tensions in that already tense area.\n200.\tThe more the Israeli Government accentuates its aggressiveness, as evidenced by the recent acts of reprisal and air piracy, the less its behaviour is likely to be understood by international public opinion.\n201.\tThe Israeli leaders would make a very important contribution to the coming of peace to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean if they really agreed strictly and fully to apply the relevant provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and if they were to proclaim publicly their policy of non-annexation of occupied Arab territory.\n202.\tSuch a conciliatory and unambiguous attitude would undoubtedly help the United Nations to give a new impetus to the efforts made with a view to the restoration of peace in that part of the world and would also contribute to the elimination of colonialism and apartheid in Africa.\n203.\tGreat is our bitterness and profound our disappointment at seeing the collective will of the United Nations to put an end to colonialism and racial discrimination come up in Africa against a solid wall of arrogance, defiance and contempt.\n204.\tPortugal, a European country which would seem, after all. to be in a good position to avoid the errors of colonial conquest, refuses to comply with the obligations of the Charter and continues with impunity to trample underfoot the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations.\n205.\tWhile millions of men have, over a period of 15 years, recovered their right to assume responsibility for their own destinies, Portugal continues to seek shelter-and how blindly-in the superstitions of the past and to follow a merciless policy of oppression of the populations of Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verde Islands, Angola and Mozambique. This inhuman Portuguese policy is expressed most tragically, as will be seen from the report of Father Adrian Hastings [see A/9023[Rev. 1, chap. IX, para. 28], in the odious massacre of more than 400 men, women and children, ignominiously perpetrated on 16 December 1972 in the village of Wiriyamu in Mozambique.\n206.\tAnd yet we have very much present in our minds the particularly reasonable proposals of Amilcar Cabral, former Secretary-General of PAIGC - assassinated in a dastardly manner on 20 January 1973 - proposals which the General Assembly was to endorse last year by recognizing the liberation movements of territories under Portuguese administration as the authentic representatives of the peoples of that Territory and inviting Portugal to enter into negotiations shortly with these movements.\n207.\tIn the face of the arrogance of the Portuguese Government vis-\u00e0-vis the injunctions of the international community, what is left for the United Nations if not to assume its responsibilities in order to have its decisions applied?\n208.\tFor its part, the people of Guinea-Bissau has taken the historic decision to take its destiny into its own hands by proclaiming a few days ago the independence of its Territory.\n209.\tI should like, on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal, to hail warmly the accession to international sovereignty of the republican and democratic State of Guinea-Bissau and to express our best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of its people. And I wish to take this memorable occasion solemnly to invite the Members of the United Nations to recognize the new State without delay, to admit it to our Organization as soon as an application is made, and to ensure to it as of now their co-operation as well as their active solidarity in its struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\n210.\tBut our Organization has another specific duty: that of aiding the populations in Southern Rhodesia and Namibia to achieve their independence on the basis of\n\nequality of rights for all. Unfortunately, in spite of the rather significant efforts made by the majority of the Members of the United Nations, the minority regimes in power in this tormented region continue to base their retrograde policies on racial segregation and discrimination.\n211.\tIn Southern Rhodesia eight years have elapsed since the rebellion-eight years of suffering and martyrdom for the Zimbabwe people-without any satisfactory results being recorded. On the contrary, the illegal and racist minority regime is growing stronger from year to year in spite of economic sanctions, or perhaps because of attempted negotiations conducted by the British Government.\n212.\tIn fact, the report of the Security Council's Committee on sanctions  informs us that Rhodesian trade increased in 1971, the mandatory economic sanctions having largely been ignored by Members of the Organization-and first among these, certain permanent members of the Security Council.\n213.\tAt the same time, tension is constantly growing in view of the acts of provocation of the Zimbabwe people by the Southern Rhodesian army. Thus, in January 1973 the Zambian Government was forced once again to come before the Security Council as a result of the unilateral decision of the illegal regime to close its common border with Zambia, thus imposing upon that country an economic blockade in retaliation for the support given by the Zambian authorities to the just cause of the Zimbabwe people.\n214.\tIt is obvious. We note there, on the part of the rebellious Government, as was pointed out last year appropriately by the representative of Somalia, \\\"the same disregard for the authority of the United Nations, the same withdrawal from responsibility on the part by those most able to take effective action, and the same drift towards support for the racist regimes. .. .\\\"\n215.\tConcerning South Africa, my Government rejects out of hand the thesis according to which normal economic relations, as well as financial and cultural relations, with that country might bring about changes in the policy of South Africa, or at least the humanization of the abominable regime of apartheid, which is both an ideology and an iniquitous system of Government based solely upon complete contempt for non-white races. More serious still, the South African Government calmly pursues the integration of Namibia into its own territory, denying the populations concerned the right to self-determination and imposing upon them the sordid policy of separate development of races.\n216.\tThat is why Senegal, in this respect complying with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity, considers that an end must be put to contacts between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the South African Government concerning Namibia, since these contacts are exploited by Pretoria in an effort to have the Organization endorse its retrograde policy of the dismemberment of Namibia.\n217.\tIt is felicitous, in the view of my Government, that the Ovambos, the largest ethnic group, have resolutely rejected the policy of dismemberment of the Territory by refusing to take part in the elections organized on 1 August 1973 by the South African authorities.\n218.\tIt may be possible for us, at a time when we are about to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to adopt effective and appropriate measures for the safeguarding of human dignity, and to bring our world into harmony with the necessities of the planetary age. From this point of view, the time has come to put a final end to the relegation of the United Nations to the diplomatic sidelines through a process of mutual accommodation and alleviation of tensions: on the contrary new vigour must be infused into the Organization and it must be enabled to take into its own hands the control of improvement in relations between States.\n219.\tThe time has come to entrust to the United Nations the full requisite responsibility and all the necessary authority to increase its normative capacity and to build the basis of an equitable mechanism of international co-operation, as part of the democratization of international relations.\n220.\tThis democratization postulates-and the non-aligned countries anticipated it in Georgetown  and have just proclaimed it in Algiers-that at the present stage no durable world-wide system can ignore the constructive and creative contribution of the small and medium-sized Powers to the solution of problems of world-wide interest.\n221.\tFinally, I wish to formulate the ardent hope that the present session will constitute a historic landmark on the difficult road towards strengthened tolerance between nations and the realization of the legitimate aspirations of peoples for freedom, economic justice and peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeff2.\t I am particularly delighted with the opportunity to address this Assembly. This is my first visit here in this capacity and already I feel that I am among friends. This is as it should be. For we are all united by our desire to translate into reality the philosophy behind the founding of this world body. It was the hope of the founding fathers that this Organization, representing peoples of different political, cultural, economic and social backgrounds, should be an effective instrument for harmonizing different views, reconciling competing interests and concerting such action as would give substance to mankind's aspirations for peace and plenty in justice and dignity. Ideals nobler than these for structuring a world order will definitely be difficult to find. To live up to such high expectations is the great challenge before all of us who are assembled here.\n3.\tPermit me, Mr. President, to convey to you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. It is a fitting tribute to your sterling qualities as a diplomat who has rendered distinguished services not only to your country, but also to the international community as a whole. Your election is also a well-deserved honour for your country,\nEcuador, with which my country enjoys warm relations, and which has shown consistent adherence to the principles and purposes of our Charter. I have no doubt that under your wise guidance this session of the General Assembly will achieve great success.\n4.\tMy congratulations also go to the members of your Bureau and to the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, since his assumption of office, has brought great dedication and sense of personal commitment to his heavy task. I wish him continued success and God's blessing. I wish also to place formally on record my appreciation of the excellent services rendered to this Organization and humanity by the past Secretaries-General, particularly the late Dag Hammarskjold and U Thant.\n5.\tThirteen years ago my country was admitted as the ninety-ninth Member of this Organization. On that occasion, the then Prime Minister of Nigeria, the late Sir Abu-bakar Tafawa Balewa, expressed the belief of Nigeria in the United Nations as the only effective machinery for bringing about world peace and the progress of mankind generally. Today, I wish to reaffirm my country's faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We in Nigeria believe that if all Members States adhere strictly to the provisions of our Charter, as an earnest of their dedication to the ideals of our Organization, then we may yet accomplish that unique and bright promise for all mankind which the United Nations represents.\n6.\tI am a strong believer in the United Nations. I therefore find it rather disturbing that the image which some people tend to have of the United Nations is a misleading one of lack of dramatic success in dealing immediately with some of the major problems of peace and security, of human rights, and the degrading poverty of a large majority of the world's population. Proceeding from such a viewpoint, the conclusion is often heard that this Organization is hardly any more relevant to our times. I do not share such pessimism, and I venture to suggest that most Africans would not accept such a doleful assessment of the United Nations. We are all well aware of its shortcomings and its failings. These are, in some measure, a reflection of the world which produced and now operates the Organization. It is necessary to seek to improve its effectiveness, but we in Africa hope that the States Members of the United Nations will embark on such a process in a manner that would not do damage to this Organization which is so vital to the vast underprivileged, as yet developing, population of the third world. \n\n7.\tFor millions of such peoples throughout the world, the United Nations provides an indispensable forum for bringing to world attention, some of the problems that plague the world, and for which, all too often, no other means of solution are apparent. The United Nations can and does bring to bear the moral weight of world opinion on many a controversial issue. That explains its great value to the smaller nations and to the dispossessed and downtrodden peoples of the world. For example, it is clear that without the moral pressure exerted on colonial Powers, principally by this Organization, the struggle for self-determination and independence would definitely have been more difficult for many of the nations that are today proud Members of the United Nations. Nor can we ignore the invaluable services rendered by the Organization and its specialized agencies in the vital areas of health, literacy campaigns, child welfare and the championship of progressive labour legislation on a world-wide basis.\n8.\tIt cannot be over-emphasized that the primary purpose of the United Nations is \\\"to save mankind from the scourge of war\\\". Unfortunately, we have not always attained this lofty objective. There have been breaches of peace, such as in Korea, and Viet-Nam, with consequences no less dismal and harrowing for those affected. However, since 1945, there has been no global war such as mankind experienced to its horror during the first half of this century. It is to the credit of this Organization that, even when conflicts do occur between nations in recent times, peaceful intervention by the United Nations has succeeded in arresting them. In other areas of the world, the United Nations continues to play a key and vital role in providing physical stability and preventing a deterioration of unhappy and unstable political and social conditions. It is, therefore, not unjustified that we should look back on the 28 years of the existence of this Organization with some degree of satisfaction. The little measure of stability and hope that the world and its many peoples have been given these past 28 years has been worthy of the long hours spent in this hall as well as in the chambers of the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations.\n9.\tOf course, to acknowledge these areas of achievement of the United Nations should by no means lull us into a sense of complacency. As in every human organization, there are areas of United Nations activities that cry out for urgent attention and improvement. Among these is the imperative need to correct the structural and institutional deficiencies that hamstring some of its operations. When the Charter was framed, five nations were entrusted with the responsibility of \\\"policing\\\" the whole world. In the prevailing circumstances of those days such an arrangement might have been justifiable and acceptable. It is no longer so today. An urgent review of the decision-making processes in the United Nations system, taking into full account existing political realities, is long overdue. I need hardly say that one area of immediate concern is the increasing use of the veto in the Security Council in support of causes which seem to be in conflict with the noble objectives of the Charter. In this connexion, it must be emphasized that African nations, and indeed most nations of the world, have been distressed at the constant use of the veto to block meaningful initiatives in matters relating to fundamental human rights, freedom and human dignity in many areas of the world and, in particular, in parts of Africa still under foreign or minority regimes. It is our hope, therefore, that the nations which at present enjoy the privileges of veto power should use it responsibly in furtherance of world peace and the progress of mankind.\n10.\tThe Secretary-General has, in the introduction to his latest report on the work of the Organization, invited us to participate in a \\\"constructive debate\\\" about the future of this Organization [A/9001/Add. 1, p.l]. It is my hope that in responding to this invitation all Member States would advance proposals that would ensure that the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations are implemented by all Member States.\n11.\tIt is a matter for great relief that in the world today preoccupation with outmoded rivalries and enmities on the one hand, and ideological distrusts and suspicions on the other is now being progressively replaced by the spirit of accommodation. The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic into the United Nations justifies the expectation that before long there will be genuine universality of representation in this Organization. I congratulate them, as well as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, on their admission.\n12.\tWhile commending the important steps towards ending the legacies of the Second World War in Europe, we must state that steps towards normalization of the situation in that continent should be matched by the continuing search for peace, understanding and co-operation throughout the world. The search for peace and security must be in a global context and must involve the active participation of all countries. We welcome agreements between the superpowers inasmuch as these agreements lessen the fear and threat of nuclear warfare. However, we are compelled to call on the super-Powers to resist the temptation of limiting their negotiating spirit only to such issues as are of narrow interest to them and their people. We must insist that their negotiations and agreements which affect the fate of others should take account of the views of those concerned. For every nation and every country, great or small, rich or poor, has a stake in peace and security. It is therefore essential that each should participate, on the basis of sovereign equality, in resolving issues of concern to the whole world.\n13.\tA few months ago the Organization of African Unity [OA U\\ celebrated its tenth anniversary. I had the great privilege of presiding over the ceremonies and the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU. I should like to express the deep appreciation of OAU and all the people of Africa to the United Nations for the co-operation, inspiration and assistance that have continued to characterize the relations between our regional organization and this world body. We highly appreciate the constant interest of the United Nations as an institution, and the unfailing concern of the Secretary-General and the various agencies in developments in Africa and the progress of OAU. All this is in keeping with the spirit of Article 52, which encourages regional organizations \\\"consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations\\\".\n14.\tThe Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contributed significantly to the basis and the charter of OAU. Permit me, therefore, to make some observations about how our regional organization has been addressing itself to the many problems confronting our continent.\n15.\tThe birth of OAU in 1963 was a great act of faith, and its response to the challenges of modern times has filled all Africans with joy and immense pride. After only 10 years we have overcome some of the earlier impediments and difficulties in our way. Independent countries from all parts of Africa, with a variety of historical, political, linguistic and social backgrounds, are now united in our organization, which has come to be recognized as the voice of our continent.\n16.\tOf course, when we reviewed the various activities of OAU at that meeting we acknowledged that we had not achieved all our objectives. Indeed, it would have been difficult to achieve every single one of our aims and objectives in a short decade, given the uncertainties and unforeseen contingencies of world events. However, we have succeeded in consolidating our national independence, and in settling among ourselves and without distracting attention from outside Africa, many such intra-African disputes that have arisen. We have launched many economic and social programmes for improving the quality of life of our peoples in a spirit of self-reliance.\n17.\tWe have brought the meaning of African unity and co-operation much nearer to each African's heart. We have continued to uphold, as central to the problems of our continent, the spirit of self-sacrifice, of compromise, and of reconciliation. We have pledged to redouble our efforts with a view to eradicating all forms of colonialism and racism from our continent, and thus assume control of our continent's destiny. Above all, OAU has symbolized the collective effort of the Governments of Africa and their peoples to uphold for ever the dignity and stature of the African in this world.\n18.\tThe problem posed by the continuation of colonialism, racism and apartheid is the most intractable problem that has confronted us on the continent. Not only do colonialism, racism and apartheid constitute an unbearable affront on human dignity in the areas where those evils exist; they represent a great threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent African States and to international peace and security. Thirteen years after the adoption of United Nations resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, more than 30 million Africans, spread over about one-sixth of our continent, continue to be denied their human rights, exploited and subjugated under minority, racist and colonial regimes. In defiance of world public opinion and in contemptuous disregard of the decisions of all international organizations of African unity, those regimes have fanatically frustrated and resisted all attempts at introducing constitutional changes designed to involve, in simple justice, the majority of the inhabitants of those lands in the processes that govern their destiny and their daily lives. Thus denied constantly of their basic and legitimate rights, and bereft of all hope of change by an impervious and inflexible ruling class, is it any wonder that the voice of despair is turning reasonable men who desire nothing but peace and progress to their frightful alternatives offered by constant frustration and loss of hope? Can we wonder then that the people are attracted, in such a situation, to the painful alternative of force and conflict? For our part in OAU we have no choice but to give whole-hearted support to the efforts of our unfortunate brothers to restore their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. In the words of the Solemn Declaration on General Policy adopted at our tenth anniversary session:\n\\\"... our support for the liberation struggle was adopted in response to the legitimate and profound aspirations of our peoples and should be viewed less as a circumstantial community of interests than as an awareness of the common destiny of all peoples of the African continent\\\".\n19.\tAt the same meeting, the African Heads of State and Government viewed with satisfaction the progress made in the decade since the establishment of OAU in the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, the Comoro Islands, the so-called French Somaliland, the so-called Spanish Sahara, the Seychelles Islands and the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. The struggle and the pressure will continue in Africa until the stain of this degradation of human dignity has been removed and until the African, everywhere on his continent, can raise his head proudly in independence and self-determination and thereby be able to contribute his quota to world progress.\n20.\tIn this regard, Mr. President, let me commend to you and to members of this honourable Assembly the bold and momentous step taken by the long-oppressed people of Guinea-Bissau and their political party in declaring their country independent. We in Africa believe that the struggle for final consolidation of the independence of this new nation will be much assisted by the practical support and co-operation which all men of goodwill and all who subscribe to the principles of the Charter of this Organization will extend, promptly and without hesitation, to the efforts of the rightful owners and peoples of Guinea-Bissau.\n21.\tThe declaration of independence by the people of Guinea-Bissau has received the overwhelming support of member States of OAU and of the friends of Africa. I should like, on behalf of Africa, to thank those friends for their prompt recognition accorded to that new State. It is our hope, therefore, that that new nation will shortly take its rightful position as a proud member of the international community.\n22.\tWhat of the special case of Namibia? The situation in Namibia continues to be a source of considerable embarrassment and concern to this Organization. I do not need to go over the various steps that have been taken by the United Nations and its competent organs to bring some rational solution to the situation created in Namibia by the intransigence of the racist regime of South Africa which still occupies that country illegally. The United Nations has endeavoured to carry out its fundamental responsibilities to the hapless people of Namibia by repeatedly providing opportunities for a progressive and peaceful transformation of the situation in the country. It was the hope of many people in different parts of the world that the South African Government would, in its own wider interests, take advantage of the opportunities offered by the United Nations to fulfil its woefully neglected obligations to the people of Namibia.\n23.\tBut what have we found? The South African Government is intent upon defying the opinions of the world. Even after the International Court of Justice has expressed opinions which clearly indicated that the South African Government had no further moral or legal right to dominate Namibia, the South African Government continues to subject the people of that country to its Fascist social and political system.\n24.\tOne is entitled to ask why it is that of all the Territories that were entrusted to the colonialist Powers under the Trusteeship System, only in Namibia, the Territory entrusted to South Africa, has this international trust been betrayed. All the Territories are today full Members of the United Nations or on their way to independence. We in Africa strongly believe that the United Nations and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council have a duty and responsibility to use all means at their disposal to compel South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and thereafter to assume control of the Territory and to administer it until it attains full independence.\n25.\tSide by side with the steady pressure and progress in the efforts of the liberation movements in various parts of Africa, we witness with dismay the support that continues to be rendered by some nations to two Member States of this Organization that have the dubious distinction in history of being the sole advocates of repression and colonialism and racism. Also, the illegal regime in Salisbury still continues because of the non-compliance by certain Member countries of this Organization with the unanimous decisions of the Organization and of mankind. Perhaps those who prefer to sell a few goods to such an illegal clique, or to buy such commodities as the racists of Salisbury wish to sell in order to maintain themselves in power, have made their own calculations and prefer their temporary material profit to their sense of honour and their position in history.\n26.\tWhile on this subject, perhaps I should emphasize again the sadness of Africa in the face of the stubborn and unreasonable intransigence of those white regimes that continue to constitute themselves as enemies of Africa and of the third world. Nobody in Africa wishes to adopt the path of armed struggle and conflict against those minority regimes for the love of it. Nobody has asked that people who normally live in Africa and wish to consider themselves as part of Africa should, by any manner or means, be made to feel unwelcome. Those who are born among us and live and join us both in spirit and co-operation are welcome to live in Africa. For they are Africans. It is for this reason that we made genuine efforts to assure the world of our desire for. racial harmony on conditions of mutual respect and fundamental human rights of all the inhabitants of the continent. Is that not a message of hope for the colonialist and racist regimes? The Lusaka Manifesto  which was presented to this Assembly three years ago by my dear friend and brother, President Ahmadou Ahidjo of the United Republic of Cameroon on behalf of Africa,  embodied Africa's effort to work out a peaceful solution to the colonial and racial problems of the continent \u2014 problems which are not of our own making. What was the response? The colonialist and racist regimes rejected out of hand our peace offer and rewarded us with intensification of repressive laws in the areas under their control, massacres of our people, inspired assassination of the authentic leaders of the African freedom movements, and attacks on independent African countries.\n27.\tViewed, therefore, against the background of our efforts to initiate peaceful solutions, and the response we got, we are bewildered that several countries which claim to be friends of Africa continue to give such material and moral support to the colonialist and racist regimes, and to strengthen them in their oppression of our peoples. Permit me to appeal again on behalf of Africa to those who give support to our oppressors. It is time for all of us Members of the United Nations to join hands in an effective and total isolation of the colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. It is time for us to tighten sanctions against the rebel clique in Salisbury. In addition, I appeal to the United Nations and the international community generally, to extend to the liberation movements and to the millions of Africans under severe oppression and exploitation, such material assistance as would ensure fulfilment to the African peoples of the promise held out by the Charter of the United Nations.\n28.\tTime is on the side of the African in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. Victory is sure to be ours in the war against oppression and deprivation of individual liberty. But the United Nations and its Member countries can render the process less painful and can help to make the road shorter by taking necessary steps before it is too late. By so doing, they would be contributing to the increase of peace and progress, in place of unhappiness and pain and suffering in the world.\n29.\tDuring our tenth anniversary session, the African Heads of State and Government adopted another document of considerable importance. I refer to the African Declaration on Co-operation, Development and Economic Independence. In the 10 years since OAU was founded, we have observed that the promise of substantial economic development, leading to the path of economic independence, as contained in the charter of OAU, has not been marked by encouraging progress. On the contrary, the pattern has been one of continuing deterioration in the economic and social conditions of African and developing countries generally. The gap between us and the developed countries continues to grow even wider. Measures adopted during the last decade, we found, have been frustrated by other developments in the world at large, over which we have little say and no control. The terms of trade have constantly gone against us. World monetary arrangements have been made without consultations with us and without adequate consideration of our interests.\n30.\tFaced with this situation and firmly convinced that our economic destiny must be taken firmly in our own hands if noticeable improvement is to be achieved, African States solemnly proclaimed their determination to achieve the economic independence and development of the continent through the effective mobilization of Africa's own human and material resources. To this end, we decided to accelerate the implementation of the Africanization policy in each of our countries and to ensure effective and equitable African representation in international organizations.\n31.\tBearing in mind the loss which Africa has suffered and continues to sustain through the foreign exploitation of its natural resources, we resolved to defend vigorously, continually and jointly, the sovereign rights of our countries to exercise full and effective control over our resources.\n32.\tWe believe that the time has come for the rich in this Organization to ponder seriously on the danger of being surrounded by so many poor. In their own self interest, if not for the sake of humanity in general, the rich nations should at least give us an even chance of pulling ourselves up. It is no longer our intention to go cap in hand to the door of the rich. What we want and demand is the opportunity for our own people to be afforded a chance of acquiring those skills and those elements of technology without which no decent and progressive economic system can be structured and maintained in the modern world. We have learned that we cannot expect help, at least not of the order that would make a significant contribution to our own needs of development. But the older, more experienced and more technologically advanced countries can still do much to redeem the pledge they made to humanity and to this Organization by not putting impediments in our way, by making less selfish and lopsided marketing arrangements for our own produce and by facilitating our determination to utilize such resources as we have in the interest of our own peoples. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will approve a constructive idea which emerged from the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, namely, that a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic matters should be held in 1975, when we shall be half way through the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n33.\tI shall conclude my address by referring to the urgent and serious problem of the Middle East, an area with which Africa enjoys strong and deep ties.\n34.\tAs if the situation whereby about 2 million hapless refugees have been dispossessed of their homelands and virtually condemned to live out their lives in tents was not bad enough, the conditions of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" compound the problem. Since June 1967 parts of the territories of States Members of our Organization have remained under foreign occupation by another State Member of the United Nations. When the Security Council adopted its famous resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, it was widely accepted that the provisions of that resolution formed a balanced framework for an equitable and honourable solution to the crisis. It was the greatest hope for peace based on justice in that region. Not only has peace proved elusive; we are all witnesses to the unspeakable series of aggressions, heartless and mindless brutalities, harassments and massacres, not to speak of air piracies and hijackings, which dominate the news from the area. Needless to say, such conditions are a constant threat to world peace and security.\n35.\tOAU has, in session after session, expressed great concern at the situation. We did even more. As will be recalled, in 1971 a mission of four African Heads of State paid a visit to Egypt and Israel. It was a great honour and privilege for me to have been a member of that mission. Our objective was to see how best OAU, since one of its member nations was involved in the Middle East conflict, could contribute, even if in small measure, to the efforts of the United Nations and others towards a just and peaceful solution or, at any rate, the reduction of the tension of the explosive situation.\n36.\tDuring its tenth session, held in Addis Ababa-last May, OAU once again reviewed the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East. It adopted a resolution and charged me, as its current Chairman, with the task of presenting its views to this Assembly.\n37.\tPermit me, therefore, to read out the resolution which was unanimously adopted by the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government:\n\\\"The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government, meeting in its Tenth Ordinary Session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 27 to 29 May 1973,\n\\\"Having heard the statement of His Excellency El Shafei, Vice-President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, on the situation in the Middle East in general, and in particular on that resulting from the continued occupation of part of the territory of Egypt since the Israeli aggression of 5 June 1967,\n\\\"Recalling all OAU resolutions adopted in this respect, and especially resolution AHG/Res.67 (IX) of the Rabat Summit Conference,\n\\\"Reaffirming resolution 2949 (XXVII) of the United Nations General Assembly, passed in December 1972,\n\\\"Aware of the danger emanating from the deterioration of the situation in the North-East of Africa as a result of the continued aggression perpetrated against the territory of Egypt and other Arab territories \u2014 a danger which threatens the security, territorial integrity and unity of our continent,\n\\\"Noting with deep concern that despite the numerous resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations calling upon it to withdraw from all occupied African and Arab territories, Israel not only persists in refusing to implement resolutions, but also continues to practise a policy with a view to creating in the said territories a state of fait accompli aimed at serving its expansionist designs,\n\\\"Deploring the systematic obstruction by Israel of all the efforts exerted to reach a peaceful solution to the problem at both the international and African levels,\n\\\"Recalling in this respect the negative attitude of Israel towards the mission of the ten African Heads of State mandated by the OAU to work for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which stipulated in particular withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied territories, in conformity with the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force,\n\\\"Noting with satisfaction that the Arab Republic of Egypt has spared no effort to reach a just and durable solution of the problem, and that these efforts have been\ncharacterized by the constructive co-operation of Egypt with international as well as African forums,\n\\\"Noting further that the intransigence of Israel and its systematic refusal to abide by the will of the international community constitutes a threat to the security of the continent,\n\\\"Fully aware that the massive military, economic and other aid as well as the political and moral support granted to Israel by certain Powers enable it to pursue its aggression and encourage it to commit acts of terrorism, especially the tragic act of shooting down the Libyan civilian aircraft, which resulted in the loss of innocent lives,\n\\\"1. Takes note of the statement of His Excellency H. El Shafei, Vice-President of the Arab Republic of Egypt;\n\\\"2. Strongly condemns the negative attitude of Israel, its acts of terrorism and its obstruction of all efforts aimed at a just and equitable solution of the problem in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) c* 22 November 1967;\n\\\"3. Calls once more for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied African and Arab territories;\n\\\"4. Declares that all changes effected by Israel in the occupied territories are null and void, and pledges not to recognize any changes leading to a fait accompli or likely to jeopardize the territorial integrity of the countries which are victims of the Israeli aggression;\n\\\"5. Recognizes that the respect of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an essential element in any just and equitable solution, besides being an indispensable factor for the establishment of permanent peace in the region;\n\\\"6. Reaffirms in the name of African solidarity and by virtue of article II, paragraph 1 (c) of the OAU Charter its active and total support for the Arab Republic of Egypt in its legitimate struggle to recover entirely and by all means its territorial integrity;\n\\\"7. Draws the attention of Israel to the danger threatening the security and unity of the African continent as a result of its continued aggression and refusal to evacuate the territories of the States victims of that aggression and declares that the attitude of Israel might lead OAU member States to take, at the African level, individually or collectively, political and economic measures against it, in conformity with the principles contained in the OAU and United Nations Charters;\n\\\"8. Earnestly calls upon the big Powers supplying Israel with arms and military equipment of all kinds and granting it moral and political support that enables it to strengthen its military potential to refrain from doing so;\n\\\"9. Strongly supports the Egyptian initiative requesting the United Nations Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East, and expresses the hope that the Security Council shall take every appropriate measure to implement immediately the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations, so that a just and durable peace may be established in the region;\n\\\"10. Designates the Foreign Ministers of Nigeria, Chad, Tanzania, Guinea, Algeria, Kenya and the Sudan to be the spokesmen of the OAU on this matter at the Security Council of the United Nations on 4 and 5 June\n1973;\n\\\"11. Entrusts the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government to present the views of the OAU on the matter at the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\\\"\nThere is the unanimous voice of Africa on this issue.\n38.\tSince then, the six Foreign Ministers designated by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government have participated in the Security Council meetings that were specifically convened at the instance of Egypt.  The debate that ensued, though extensive, produced no results that could bring peace nearer to that region. OAU cannot condone a situation whose final determination can be decided only by the force of arms. We regard it as an intolerable provocation that part of Egypt, a member State, should continue to remain under armed occupation in spite of the unanimous expressions of international opinion against the acquisition of territory by force of arms.\n39.\tMembers of OAU desire peace in the Middle East \u2014  peace based on equity; peace that does not insist on acquisition of other people's territory as a pre-condition; peace that acknowledges the right of all nations in the area to exist in security; peace that places a premium on respect for cultural diversity; peace that upholds the dignity of man and draws sustenance from the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations. For all the inhabitants of the area have every right to expect that they should no longer be distracted from the urgent tasks of economic reconstruction and social development. They have every right to live in peace and to continue to contribute, as they have done in the past and in history, to the mainstream of human civilization. That is the Middle East that the people of Africa envisage and fervently desire to see.\n40.\tThis is my message. This is the solemn assignment entrusted to me by OAU."
